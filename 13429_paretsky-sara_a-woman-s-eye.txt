introduction by sara paretsky my dear you are a young woman you are writing about a book that has been written by a man be sympathetic be tender flatter deceive use all the arts and wiles of our sex never let anybody guess that you have a mind of your own the angel in the house spoke these words to virginia woolf when woolf first tried to write for publication the angel was a phantasm but its speech crystallized all the voices woolf had heard from childhood on telling her that women should never have a mind or wish of their own woolf says she struggled with this angel for years trying to kill it so that she could find her own voice she died hard the artist reports her fictitious nature was of great assistance to her it is far harder to kill a phantom than a reality women have been wrestling with that angel for many centimes it is a difficult phantom to overpower because it speaks in so many voices and with so much authority behind it in some cases the authority is quite specific john winthrop the first governor of massachusetts bay wrote in that the poet anne hopkins has fallen into a sad infirmity the loss of her understanding and reason by occasion of giving herself wholly to reading and writing and had written many books he added that if she had attended her household affairs and such things as belong to women she had kept her wits this kind of authority this active pressure to keep women doing such things as belong to women made it difficult for women to join the ranks of storytellers of course we all look admiringly at the poet sapphoall except the athenian men who destroyed much of her work because she was praised more highly than their favorite pindar and we see the lady murasaki the eleventhcentury creator of the first novel whose fatherrecognizing her talentlamented she had not been born a boy she only had the minor hurdle of learning to write by secretly looking over her brothers shouldersher lamenting father had forbidden her direct education by we find more than one woman writer per century but to see a continuous chain of female storytellers we can look back only two hundred years during those two centuries women struggled hard for the right to be published and read in the nineteenth century they often wrote under mens names to gain an audienceacton currer and ellis bell for the bronte sisters george eliot for mary ann evans and george sand for lucie dupin dudevant george sand wrote most of her enormous oeuvre at night starting work at two or three in the morning after finishing with the management of her large household or her numerous lovers and it is only in this century that we find enough women writing that we no longer see ourselves as odd or worry like the seventeenthcentury poet anne finch that the masculine art of poetry is making us crabbed and unwomanly in some cases women struggling to express themselves faced a bombardment of wholesale angerfurious reviews social ostracism public excoriationso intense that they stopped writing kate chopin experienced this reaction after publishing the awakening in the anger against her was so intense that she wrote nothing else for publication she died five years later at the age of fiftythree broken by the forcible silencing of her voice edna pontellier the heroine of the awakening married with two children leaves her husband in order to paintand in so doing falls in love with a younger man she commits suicide in the end but this fate did not exonerate her or her creator either in or today over and over reviewers have castigated chopin for ednas selfishness in george spangler condemned chopin for ednas ruthless determination to go her own way that is disturbing even alienating contrast chopins fate and that of her heroine with goethe and faust at the end of a long life of debauchery faust ist gerichtet ist gerettethe is judged and saveda fate his creator who glorified his own numerous seductions in poems and journals no doubt expected for himself do any biographers of goethe take him to task for selfishness or find faust disturbing even alienating the strong expression of sexual desire is not just condoned in the male heroit makes him more heroic in a woman that desire is a sign at best of selfishness at worst of psychosis the character glenn close plays in fatal attraction alex forrest shows that we still find female sexualityoutside of marriage and specifically married maternityso shocking and debasing that the character must be deranged and as with chopins edna pontellier the only fitting end for alex forrest is death it is the struggle to find a voice to kill the angel to figure out what women really want what our stories really are that absorbs the energy of many women writers the voices that tell us we cant do it or we shouldnt do it continue to blare at us they may be loud and raucous like norman mailer addressing international pen a few years ago while head of pen usa and saying that it isnt possible for women to write as well as men its not hard to imagine what threat women present to mailers vision of his masculinity that drives him to insist that you have to have balls to write well it is hard to understand why an organization dedicated to freeing imprisoned writers should elect him president mailers statements are so extreme that many people laugh at him but hes far from alone in pushing down womens voices other people merely express themselves more softly women who write strong even angry stories are no longer told that they are unwomanly or selfish today as carolyn heilbrun points out we hear that we are shrill strident or worst of all feminists we also find most women excluded from the sacred mystical canon that allan bloom mortimer adler and others keep firing and a chicago area critic recently explained that feminists by definition cannot write great books in addition to needing considerable courage even to tell stories we women have also had to figure out what our stories are the image of ourselves as inconstant duplicitous stupid illogical using our bodies to seduce and subvert men is such an ancient ingrained part of our tradition reinforced in fairy tales epics history that to counteract these images by telling womens stories makes for very heavy work writers as different as george eliot and virginia woolf suffered from migraines brought on by the stress of this work and the selfdoubts that come from countering so widely accepted an authority it was virginia woolf who first clearly spelled out the central problem of the female artist the conflict between her interior vision and the expectation that she subordinate that vision to her perceived primary role as a selfsacrificing angel just being able to articulate this problem was an important step toward resolving it but many women artistsincluding the crime writercontinue to experience stress in taking their own visions seriously agatha christie who wrested total artistic control for production from her publishers in the twenties and whose residuals brought in over a million pounds a year at her death often told reporters that she regarded herself as a wife first a writer second one should take this statement seriously as a sign not of poormouthing but of internal conflict between her success and what she thought her womanly role should be in writing mysteries women for many years created primarily male heroes sayers with wimsey tey with grant marsh with alleyn when the detectives were women they were women who did not upset male stereotypes jane marpie is everybodys elderly spinster aunt essentially asexual while sharp and perceptive she uses her insights to shore up the patriarchal society in which she lives and operates on its fringes rather than as a professional crime investigator lady molly of scotland yard was a bit more daring but baroness orczy assures us repeatedly that lady molly never lost her feminine daintiness dorothy sayers created a complex character in harriet vane but could not allow heror the female dons of shrewsburyto solve their own problems they fester in an environment of fear and mutual suspicion for almost a year before peter wimsey arrives he is able to see through the situation at a glance and in a matter of days resolves the problem for them since sayers created harriet vane sixty years ago women have developed active careers in many spheres in the us supreme court barred women lawyers because of their natural timidity and delicacy now we have a woman justice when i started my first book twelve years ago chicago women were fighting for the right to be homicide detectives and patrol officers instead of matrons at the womens jails today ten percent of the force is female we dont think twice about seeing women on the beat in the courtroom the operating room or other exciting arenas its because we see women doing so much that the horizons of our fiction have expanded we can create heroines who act independently without guiltnot jane marples or even harriet vanesbut kate fansler sharon mccone or kinsey millhone who are all present in this anthology and our unmarried women can have affairs without needing to kill themselves afterward or turning out to be villains like brigid oshaughnessy or chandlers dolores gonzalez does that make this group of writers better than sayers by no means nor in terms of craft and talent does she have many equals today but what we do have is the freedom to present an independent woman hero without fear of excoriation kate chopin the brontes and other pioneers made it passible for us to believe in the female artist they turned publishing into a routine accessible acceptable businessthey obviated the need to publish under the cloak of an anonymous lady as austen had to or under a mans name as sand and eliot felt compelled to sayers woolf and others taking advantage of this ease of publication made us start thinking about what a genuine womans voice might be twentyfive years ago amanda cross delighted readers with kate fansler in in the final analysis kate professional witty feminine took over where dorothy sayers left harriet vane she could solve her own problems she could investigate and resolve a murder she could have a warm and wonderful lover but stand apart from him cross presented the hero wed been waiting for all our lives what began as a trickle of strong women a quarter of a century agowith christy oper working a new york transit authority beat followed by cordelia gray doing an unsuitable job for a womanhas grown into a great outpouring of womens stories marcia muller gave us sharon mccone in edwin of the iron shoes in five years later sue grafton and i flung kinsey millhone and v i warshawski on an unsuspecting world english pi anna lee joined us at the same time since then the number of interesting women heroes has grown past counting they range from the private eyes to julie hayes in dorothy salisbury daviss books whose efforts to find her own strength mirror the struggles many american women have gone through in the last twenty years this book gathers together a sample of what women have to say about women in the final decade of our century the collection begins with liza codys story lucky dip being homeless and on the street are issues that we all worry about cody goes beyond worry to show us through crystals eyes what that life is really like a street girl crystal is presented without gloss or sentimentality the horrors she witnesses and how she copes with them may chill you but will also give you food for serious thought the collection ends with another young girl in a different situation emma in dorothy b hughess that summer at quichiquois is trying to sort out the passions of the adults around her this haunting story shows us many different ways to view people passion and even forensic evidence between cody and hughes we see women struggling with a range of problems nancy pickard takes a new look at jealousy and possessiveness in the scar the new zealand setting is unusual and arresting but the feelings brought to life with delicate realism have been with us for thousands of years private eyes kinsey millhone sharon mccone kiernan oshaughnessy and lònia guiu solve cases that are far from conventional famous amateurs like jemima shore julie hayes and kate fansler are here along with these professional crime solvers are mothers grandmothers battered wives social workers and barbara wilsons startling story about one of the worlds most revered dead poets we have the debut of carolyn wheats new hero new york transit cop maureen gallagher whose struggles with sobriety and authority are as important as the torched subway bums she fights for mary wingss kill the man for me is guaranteed to provoke latenight discussions how far is it permissible to go in seeking justice or revenge and if her solution shocks you ask yourself if you were also offended by charles bronson in death wish the one thing these stories have in common is the message that there is no one way to view women nor is there one way women see themselves what we have all learned in the last three hundred and fifty years is that the reading and writing of books are such things as belong to women lucky dip by liza cody liza cody is the winner of a creasey award for her very popular anna lee series of mysteries and has also been nominated for the edgar her rich novels featuring private eye anna include under contract sad company dupe head case and stalker while rift is a stunning novel of suspense set in east africa she makes her home in england he was sitting against a bit of broken wall looking almost normal i could see him because of the full moon it was a lovely moon with wispy clouds like old ladys hair across its face i watched the man for a couple of minutes but he didnt move well he wouldnt would he i could see he didnt belonghe was far too well dressedand i wondered how he got there this is not a part of the city men dressed like him go he had not been dead long you could tell that at a glance because he still had his shoes on if you die here you wont keep your shoes for ten minutes you wont keep your wallet for ten seconds dead or alive with this in mind i had a quick look right and left for anyone lurking in the shadows if id seen anyone bigger than me id have stayed where i was moon shadows are blacker than hearses and i knew i wasnt the only one out that night but in the trenches only the big are bold and someone big would have been rummaging in the remains already so i hopped out from behind my pile of rubble and made a run for it i reached him in no time at all and grabbed his left lapel seven out of ten men are righthanded and the chances are seven to three anything valuable will be in a lefthand inside pocket i took a swift dip and came up with the winnings by now i could hear stirringsa snap of rotten wood a slide of brick dust i flicked his watch off his wrist and almost in the same motion made a dive into his jacket pocket then i got on my toes and legged it i legged it out of the trenches completely because although there are plenty of places to hide the people i wanted to hide from know them as well as i do the trenches are useful as long as its only the law you want to avoid robbing a corpse isnt nice and i didnt want to take all that trouble only to be robbed myself it was just a quick jog to the high street on the way i stopped under a street lamp to look at what i had in my hand the wallet was fat snakeskin the watch was heavy gold and the loose change was all pound coins and fiftypence pieces for once in my short life id struck oil all the same you dont break old habits for the sake of one lucky dip and when i saw all those plump taxpayers doing their late christmas shopping on the high street i stuck out my hand as usual got any spare change please i said as always for a cup of tea for a bed for the night for a hot meal and as always they coughed up like princes or told me to get myself a job it was nice that night i perform best when theres no pressure and by the time id worked my way down to the station id made a nice little pile but it doesnt do to loll around and count your takings in public so i jumped a tube to paddington my sister has this room in paddington she lives in camberwell with her boyfriend so this rooms just for business i dont trust my sisters boyfriend but i do trust my sister up to a point which was why i went to her business address you may meet all sorts of funny blokes there but you wont meet her boyfriend and that suits me it suits him too if you want to know the truth he doesnt like me any more than i like him when we first came down to the city dawn and me we relied on each other we didnt have anyone else to turn to but after she took up with him and he set her up in business she didnt need me like she used to and we drifted apart the trouble with dawn is she always needs a man she says she doesnt feel real without one feeling real is important to dawn so i suppose i shouldnt criticize but her men have been nothing but a disappointment you could say im lucky to have an older sister like dawn shes an example to me id rather die than turn out like her still she is my sister and weve been through a lot together especially in this last year when we came down to the city together and before that when our mum kicked us out or rather kicked dawn out because of the baby and after that when dawns boyfriend kicked dawn out because of the baby i have never been hungrier than i was last year trying to look after dawn she lost the baby in the end which was a bit of a relief to me i dont know how we would have managed if shed had it i dont think she would have coped very well either its much harder to get a man when youve got a little baby to look after anyway thats all in the past and now dawn has business premises in paddington i waited outside until i was sure she was alone and then i went up and knocked on the door crystal she said when she opened the door what you doing here you got to be more carefuli mightve had company well you havent i said and she let me in wrinkling her nose and pulling her kimono tight i dont like that kimonoits all hot and slippery since she got her hair streaked dawn has taken to wearing colors that would look all right on a tree in autumn but turn her hard and brassy gawd she said you dont half look clatty cant you get your hair cut that coat looks like its got rats living in it i took the coat off but she didnt like the one underneath either what a pong she said i had a wash last week i told her but i would like to use your bathroom i wanted somewhere private to look at what id got off the dead man you cant stop around here she said worried i got someone coming in half an hour she looked at her watch i sat in her bathroom and looked at the dead mans watch it had cartier written on the face and it really was proper gold quality i thought and felt a bit sad by rights a man with a watch like that shouldnt end up in the trenches without a stitch on because thats how hed be by now pale and naked in the moonlight nobody would recognize him without his coat and suit and shoes hed just look like anyone were into recycling in the trenches to cheer myself up i looked at his wallet and when i counted up i found i had pounds and pence and i couldnt use half of it imagine me trying to change a fiftypound note theres a chance in a million a cat with cream on his whiskers milked a cow but thats good odds compared to the chance id come by a fiftyquid note honestly i couldnt even pop the watch one look at a watch like that and any honest pawnbroker would turn me in a dishonest one would rip me off quick as a wink either way the watch was no good for me i borrowed my sisters toothbrush and had a fast swipe with her deodorant before i joined her again you never know when youre going to find clean water next so it pays to make use of what there is do me a favor crystal she said when she saw me bugger off before you frighten the horses brought you a christmas present i said and handed her the watch youre barmy crystal she stared at the watch like it was a spider in her bed whod you nick this off i never i told her i found it and it was true because the feller was dead it wasnt as if it was his property because there wasnt a him anymore for it to belong to when youre dead youre gone and thats final dead men dont own watches even with a christmas present dawn wouldnt let me stop for the night its a funny thing if i hadnt had pounds pence in my pocket i wouldnt have wanted to if it had just been the pence idve been quite happy sleeping out but having things is dangerous having things makes you a mark its like being pretty if you dont believe me look at dawn shes pretty and shes been a mark from the time she was eleven being pretty brought her nothing but trouble shes always had to have someone to protect her im glad im not pretty theres a hospital down the harrow road so i went there i couldnt decide what to do so i sat in casualty till they chucked me out its a pity there arent more places you can go and sit in at night to have a quiet think its hard to think on the hoof and if you are cold or hungry thinking is not on your mind at all it seemed to me after a while that the best place to go was where i slept last night some might say it was a daft idea to go back to a place that was rousted but i thought if the police had been there last night it would be deserted tonight twentyseven almatadema road is a condemned house they say its unsafe there are holes in the roof and holes in the floors but it is perfectly safe if you are sober tread carefully and dont light fires that was what went wrong last night we had a couple of winos in and one of them got cold just before daybreak when i got there i saw that they had nailed more boards across the front door and downstairs windows i could get in but it would take time there were still people up and about so to be on the safe side i would have to come back later if i wanted more than a few minutes kip i walked on past and went down to the embankment it is quite a long walk and by the time i got there i was hungry actually im hungry all the time dawn says she thinks i must have worms and i probably do but mostly i think its just my age someone like bloody mary does almost as much walking as i do but she doesnt seem to need half the fuel she stopped growing years ago there are a lot of women like bloody mary but i mention her because she was the one i picked up on the embankment that night huffing and puffing along with her basket on wheels oh me poor veins she said and we walked on together i slowed down a bit so she could keep up theres a stall open by the arches she said couldnt half murder a cuppa she used to sing in the streetswalk up and down oxford street bellowing paper moon with her hand held outbut after a bad dose of bronchitis last year her voice went at the arches i got us both a cup of tea and a sausage sandwich come into money crys johnny pavlova asked it is his stall and he has a right to ask because now and then when theres no one around to see he gives me a cup free as he always says hes not a charitable institution but catch him in the right mood and hell slip you one like the best of them all the same it reminded me to be careful christmas i said they were feeling generous down the high street down the high street he said you aint been on that demolition site have you i heard they found this stiff bollocknaked there this evening did they i said as if i couldnt care less i didnt hear nothing i was just working the high street i went over and sat with bloody mary under the arches johnny pavlova doesnt like us hanging too close round his stall he says we put the respectable people off their hot dogs will you look at that moon bloody mary said and she pulled her coats tight it was higher in the sky now and smaller but there was still a good light to see by where you kipping tonight crystal she asked i knew what she meant a moon like that is a freezing moon this time of year just then brainy brian came slithering in beside us so i didnt have to answer he was coughing his lungs out as usual and he didnt say anything for a while i think hes dying you cant cough like that and live long he used to go to college in edinburgh but then he started taking drugs and he failed all his exams he did all right down here in the city because to begin with he was very pretty but druggies dont keep their looks any longer than they keep their promises now hes got a face like a violin and ulcers all over his arms and legs when he recovered his breath he said share your tea crystal wed already finished ours so we didnt say anything for a while but brian was so sorrylooking in the end i went to get another two one for him and one for bloody mary while they were sucking it up i slipped away watch yourself crys johnny pavlova said as i went by he gave me a funny look the first thing you do when you break into a house is find another way out a good house has to have more than one way out because you dont want to go running like the clappers to get out the same door the law is coming in the house on almatadema road has a kitchen door through to the garden i loosened the boards on that before lying down to sleep i also made sure i had the snakeskin wallet safe i had made the right decision there was no one but me there a heap of damp ashes marked the spot where the winos had lit their fire and they blew in little eddies from the draught otherwise nothing stirred i went over the house collecting all the paper and rags i could find to build myself a nest then i curled up in it and shut my eyes nighttime is not the best time for me its when i cant keep busy and in control of my thoughts that bad memories and dreams burst out of my brain its hard to keep cheerful alone in the dark so i need to be very very tired before ill lie down and close my eyes sometimes i say things over and over in my head until i get to sleepthings like the words of a song or a poem i learned at schoolover and over so theres no spare room in my brain for the bad stuff that night i must have been very tired because i only got part of the way through whats love got to do with it when i dropped off dawn used to play that song all the time when we were still living at home she played it so often it used to drive me up the wall but it is songs like that songs i didnt even know id learned the words to that help me through the night nowadays the next thing i knew someone was coughing i opened my eyes but it was still dark and there was this cough cough cough coming my way brainy brian i thought and relaxed a bit its something you have to watch out forpeople coming up on you when youre alone in the dark its cold he said when he found me its hard hard cold out there he crawled into my nest i was quite warm and i didnt want to leave but i knew his coughing would keep me awake give us a cuddle crystal he said i got to get warm shove off i said his hands remind me of a fork some people do it to keep warm not me ive seen too much and i want to die innocent he started coughing again then he said you got any dosh crystal enough for a tea in the morning i said i really did not want to go it was one of my better nests and it didnt seem fair to give it up to brian theyre looking for you he said someone saw you in the trenches not me i said who saw me you know that little kid he said marvin i think hes called well they hurt him bad he said he saw you who wants to know i sat up lay down he said i got to get warm he grabbed me and pulled me down but he didnt start anything so i kept still after a while he said johnny pavlova says you got dosh they asked him too i waited till he finished coughing then i said whos asking the law not them he said he knew something i thought and then i thought he talked to johnny pavlova hes talked to marvin and marvin saw me in the trenches maybe brian talked to whoever is looking for me i said did they send you brian did they send you to find me he doubled over coughing later he said you dont understand crystal i got to get some money i lost my fixings and i havent scored for days so that was that i left him and went out the kitchen way brian was rightit was hard cold outside and i was right toohaving things makes you a mark i dumped the snakeskin wallet in the garden before i climbed over the fence and then i climbed right back and picked it up again dumping the wallet wouldnt stop anyone looking for me not having it would be no protection marvin didnt have it and he got hurt i wondered why they picked on marvin to clobber perhaps he got the dead mans shoes or his coat perhaps they saw a little kid in a big thick coat and they recognized the coat no one ever looked for me before there was no one interested i thought maybe i should run awaysomewhere up north or maybe to the west country but when i ran away the first time it was me and dawn together and it was difficult because we didnt know the city it took us ages to get sorted i thought about it walking down the road the moon had gone and the sky had that dirty look it gets just before day my nose was runny from the cold and i was hungry so i went to the kashmir takeaway the kashmir is a good one because it has a bin not twenty paces away what happens is that when the pubs close a lot of folks want an indian takeaway but because theyve been drinking they order too much and chuck whats left over in this bin ive had breakfast there many times the great thing about a kashmir breakfast is that although the food is cold by the time you get it the spices are still hot and it warms you up no end from this point of view indian food is the best in the city i felt much more cheerful after breakfast and i found a lighted shopwindow with a doorway to sit in it was there i had a proper look at the wallet before at dawns business premises i only counted the money and redistributed it in the pockets of my coats now i studied the credit cards library cards and business stuff these are not things i am normally interested in i cant use them but this time it seemed to me the only way out of trouble was to give them back the dead man in the trenches might be dead but he was still dangerous his name was philip walkerjones he belonged to a diners club a bridge club and a chess club he had two business cardsdata services ltd and safe systems plc he was managing director twice over which seemed quite clever because both companies had the same address in southwark road southwark road is not far from where i found him maybe he walked out of his office and died on the way to the station but that didnt explain what he was doing in the trenches nobody like him goes in the trenches i thought about philip walkerjones sitting in the moonlight against the broken brickwork he had looked as if hed just sat down for a bit of a breather but he wasnt resting he was dead there wasnt a mark on him that i could see it didnt look as if anyone had bumped himhe was just sitting there in all his finery quite dignified really little marvin would have been there watching like i was and probably a few others toowaiting to see if it was safe to take a dip we were wrong werent we i didnt want to go back too close to the trenches but if i was going to give the wallet back i had to it was too early yet for public transport so i started walking a good breakfast does wonders for the brain so while i was walking i went on thinking i didnt know anything about data and systems except that they sounded like something to do with computers but i do know that dining bridge and chess are all things you do sitting down philip walkerjones didnt have any cards saying he belonged to a squash club or a swimming club and if he spent all that time sitting down maybe he wasnt very fit if he wasnt very fit and he started to run suddenly he could have had a heart attack it was a satisfying bit of thinking that took me down to the river without really noticing crossing over it occurred to me that computers bridge and chess were things that really brainy people did and in my experience brainy people all wear glasses and dont run around much a really brainy man would not go running into the trenches after dark unless he was being chased a scared unfit man running in the trenches would have no bother getting a heart attack easy the wind off the river was sharp and cold but it wasnt the only thing making me shiver because if philip walkerjones had a reason to be scared to death so did i give the rotten wallet back i thought and do it double quick say heres your money now leave me be and then do a runner im good at that i stopped for a pint of milk to fuel up and i went through my pockets to find some of the fiftypound notes which i stuffed back in the wallet to make it look better i felt quite good i had made my plan and it was almost as if i didnt have the wallet anymore it was as good as gone and by the time i reached southwark road i wasnt bothering much about keeping out of sight it was daylight now and there were other people in the streets and cars on the roads and as usual no one seemed to notice me all the same i gave the trenches a miss i walked down southwark road bold as brass looking at numbers and signs and when i found one that read safe systems plc i walked right up to the door it was a new door in an old building and it was locked perhaps it was too early not having a watch myself i dont keep track of office hours i stood there wondering if i should hike on to the station where theres a clock and a cup of tea and just then the door opened from the inside it gave me such a fright i nearly legged it but the person opening the door was a young woman and usually women dont give me much trouble this one had red rims to her eyes and a really mournful expression on her face she also had a nasty bruise on her cheekbone that made me think of little marvin she said where do you think youre going she wasnt friendly but she looked as if she had other things on her mind safe systems plc i said what do you want she said the office is closed and havent you ever heard of a thing called soap and water ive got something for safe systems i said and held out the wallet jesus christ she said and burst into tears we stood there like thatme holding the wallet and her staring at it crying her eyes out at last she said i dont want it take it away and she tried to slam the door but i stuck my foot in there what do i do with it i said lose it she said and because i wouldnt let her close the door she went on look you silly little cow dont you come near me with that thing drop it in the riveryou can give it to steve for all i care im finished with all that she started banging the door on my foot so i hopped back the door crashed shut and she was gone i was so surprised i stood there gawping at the door and i didnt see the big feller coming up behind until he dropped a hand on my shoulder you the one they call crystal he said from a great height not me i said never heard of her i got the wallet back under my top coat without him noticing what you doing at that office then he said not letting go the lady sometimes gives me her spare change i said and watched his feet its no good watching their eyes if you want to know what a blokes going to do watch his feet the big mans feet were planted i did not like him knowing my name what is your name then he said i nearly said dawn but i bit it off just in time what he said doreen i said whos asking if he was steve i would give him the wallet and run detective sergeant michael sussex he said it was even worse than i thought now even the law knew my name it made me sweat in spite of the cold ive got a few questions for you he said and he tightened his hand on my shoulder i dont know anything i said what about about where you was last night he said and who you saw i never saw nothing i said really nervous course you didnt he said come on ill buy you breakfast and then we can talk and he smiled never never trust the law when it smiles none of this had ever happened to me before if you must know ive hardly ever talked to a policeman in my life im much too fast on my feet where do you live crystal he said starting to walk the names doreen i said and tried to get out from under the big hand where do you live doreen he said the thing you have to know about the law is that they ask questions and you answer them youve got to tell them something or they get really upset its the same with social workers if they want an answer give them an answer but keep the truth to yourself i told detective sergeant michael sussex the address of a hostel in walworth he was walking us in the direction of the trenches and i didnt want to go there so i said ive had my breakfast and i ought to go because ive got an appointment with my social worker it was a mistake because then he wanted to know who my social worker was and what time i had to be there lies breed its much better if you dont talk to the law because then you can keep to the truth after a while he said arent you a bit young to be living on your own doreen im eighteen i said i felt depressed i hadnt spoken one honest word to the man since he dropped his big hand on my shoulder well you cant can you i talked to a social worker once and she tried to put dawn and me in care never again they would have split us up and then dawn would never have found herself a man say what you like about dawns boyfriend but he did set her up in business and she does make good money she feels real no one can feel real in care we were right next to the trenches by now for a change it looked completely desertedno winos no bonfires none of us picking through the rubbish dumped there in the night its just a big demolition site really but since no one is in any hurry to build there its become home to all sorts of people detective sergeant michael sussex stopped he said we found a body in there last night i said nothing i couldnt see the bit of wall the dead man had been sitting by but i knew where it was yes he said as if he was thinking about something else stripped clean he was when it comes my turn id like to be somewhere no one can get their thieving hands on me i was still watching his feet and now even his boots looked as if they were thinking about something else so i took off i broke clear of his hand i dodged between two people passing by and hopped over the wire then i dropped down into the trenches it was the last place i wanted to be but it was the only place i could go i heard him come down behind me and as i ran through the rubble i could feel his feet thudding on the ground he was awfully fast for a big man stop he yelled and i kept running this way that way over the brickwork round the rubbish tips into cellars up steps and all the time i could hear his feet and his breath i couldnt get free of him i was getting tired when i saw the drain i put on one more sprint and dived head first into it it was the only thing i could think of to do it was the only place he couldnt come after me it was the only place i couldnt get out of i know about the drain ive been in there before to get out of the wind but it doesnt go anywhere there is a bend about ten yards from the opening and after that its very wet and all stopped up with earth anyway like it or not i dived straight in and crawled down there wasnt much room even for me i had to get all the way to the bend before i could turn round it was totally dark in the drain there should have been a circle of light at the opening but detective sergeant michael sussex had his head and shoulders wedged in it he said dont be a fool crystal come out of there his voice boomed look i only want a chat he said im not going to hurt you he wasnt going to hurt me as long as i stayed in the drain and he stayed out of it come and get me i said i would have felt quite cheerful if it hadnt been so dark and wet i dont know what you think youre up to crystal he said but youre in a lot of trouble i can help you i nearly laughed i dont know any crystals i said how can you help me youve got enemies he said the bloke who died had the same enemies you took something off him and now theyre looking for you theyre rough people crystal and you need my help i dont know any dead blokes i said i didnt take anything what am i supposed to have nicked youre wasting my time he said all right i said then ill go there wasnt anywhere to go but i didnt think hed know that wait he said dont go anywhere till youve heard what i have to say he fell silent it was what i always thought you tell them things theyd rather eat worms before they tell you something back after a bit he said you still there im still here i said but not for long im getting wet all right he said you wont understand this but ill tell you anyway the dead bloke was a systems analyst whats one of them i asked he was a computer expert detective sergeant michael sussex sighed i could hear it from my end of the drain sound travels in a drain he wrote programs for computers he debugged programs but most of all he wrote safe programs he sighed again this doesnt mean anything to you he said why dont you just come out of there like a good girl and give me the number what number i said he was right i didnt understand i was very confused i thought i was in trouble because id taken the wallet i tried to give it back but the woman wouldnt take it that was confusing whoever heard of anyone not taking money when it was offered it doesnt matter what number he said sounding angry this bloke this philip walkerjones he worked for some very funny types these types dont keep their dealings in books or ledgers anymore oh no they stick them on computer tape or discs where your average copper wont know how to find them its all bleeding high tech now he sounded very fed up and i couldnt tell if it was because i was in a drain out of reach or because he didnt understand high tech any more than i did just then i heard footsteps and someone said what you doing down there boss taking a bleeding mudbath detective sergeant michael sussex said what does it look like im doing did you lose her then the other voice said course not this is a new interview technique orders from on high do it in a bleeding landdrain he sounded so down i almost laughed are you still there he said no i said goodbye and i scrambled into the bend of the pipe and pulled my knees up to my chest so that i couldnt be seen shit detective sergeant michael sussex said youve scared her off you bleeding berk i could hear him heaving and cursing and then he said youd better give me a pull out of here hibbard there was some more heaving and cursing and then i heard his voice from further off saying where does this bleeding drain come out buggered if i know boss hibbard said could be the river for all i know well bleeding go and look detective sergeant michael sussex said and if you find her dont lose her or ill have you back in uniform quicker than you can say crystal balls you sure you had the right one hibbard said he sounded reluctant to go tramping around the trenches looking for the other end of a drain you saw the descriptionthere cant be two like her i didnt like the way he said that and i didnt like the way he made fun of my name i was freezing cold and soaked through but i wasnt going to come out for anyone with that sort of attitude so thats where we stayed him outside in the trenches and me scrunched up at the end of the drain waiting for him to give up and go away sometimes he shone a torch into keep himself busy i suppose but i stayed stonestill and never made a sound sometimes he paced up and down and muttered foul language to himself he reminded me of our mums boyfriend when he thought id pinched something off him we were all at it in those days hed pinch things out of our mums handbag and dawn and me pinched things off him we used to hide under the stairs dawn and me while he raged around swearing hed leather the lights out of us sometimes id hide from the truant officer too im used to hiding all it takes is a bit of patience and a good breakfast in your belly dont try it somewhere wet and cold thoughthat calls for real talent and i wouldnt recommend it to beginners at one stage hibbard came back he didnt sound half so cocky now shell be long gone he said i cant find where this thing comes out its got to come out somewhere detective sergeant michael sussex said use your radio get more bodies make a bleeding effort he stayed where he was and i stayed where i was another time hibbard said why dont we get in the borough engineers to dig this whole fucking site up and be done with it and another time detective sergeant michael sussex said comb the bleeding area she couldve dropped it or stashed it he was sounding cold and tired too all this for a bleeding number he said and if we dont get it our whole case goes down the bleeding bog why couldnt the silly sod pick somewhere else to pop his clogs hibbard said why are we so sure he had it on him and why are we so sure shes got it now we know he had it because he was bringing it to me detective sergeant michael sussex said and we know she got it because she swiped his wallet weve got everything else back except that and unless he had the number tattooed to his bleeding skull under his bleeding hair thats where it is couldnt he have just had it in his head hibbard said remembered it twentyfive bleeding digits do me a favor he said it was written down and he said i could have it you just want to go indoors for your dinner well no one gets any dinner till i get that kid so we all sat there without our dinners detective sergeant michael sussex made everyone go hungry for nothing because i didnt have any number twentyfive digits long but its no use worrying about what you dont have especially when what really worries you is what you might get i was worried i might get pneumonia if you get sick you cant feed yourself if you cant feed yourself you get weak and then either the officials grab you and put you in a hospital or you die ive seen it happen and ill tell you something elsea very funny thing happened when i got out of the drain well it wasnt a thing and it didnt really happen but i thought it did and it really frightened me i became an old woman it was when i looked round the bend and couldnt see the circle of light at the end of the drain i strained my ears and i couldnt hear anything moving out there and suddenly i thought id gone deaf and blind i tried to move but i was so stiff with cold it took me ages to inch my way along to the opening i didnt care if detective sergeant michael sussex caught me in fact i called out to him and my voice had gone all weak and husky i wanted him to be there if you can believe that i actually wanted him to help me see because i thought id gone blind and i was scared but he wasnt there and it was dark and teeming down with rain and i couldnt straighten up my back was bent my knees were bent there was no strength in my legs i couldnt have run if theyd set the dogs on me i was an old woman out there in the darklooking at the puddles in the mud shuffling along bent over and i thought about bloody mary and the way she is first thing of a morning there are some of them even older than she is who never have to bend over to look in dustbins because thats the shape they always are of course i come to my senses soon enough i got my circulation back and i rubbed the stiffness out of my legs and i knew it was truly dark i hadnt gone blind but i did not stop being scared even standing upright i felt helpless even with pounds pence on me the law was after me the bastards who beat up little marvin were after me and i had nowhere to go i was sick and old and i needed help what i needed i thought was a mark of my own once having thought that i became a little more cheerful not a lot mind because i hadnt had anything to eat since that curry before daybreak and being hungry brings on the blues like nothing else can but i pulled myself together and went looking for my mark i didnt know her name but i knew where to find her it was up the other end of the northern line i couldnt have walked it that night not for love nor money so i caught the tube to chalk farm and i hung around outside one of those bookshops i thought i had her once but she tightened her grip on her shopping and hurried away it was a mistake i put down to hunger usually i dont go wrong on middleaged women but i saw her at last she was wearing a fawncolored raincoat and a tartan scarf she had a green umbrella and she was struggling with her christmas shopping i said carry your bags for you missus she hesitated i knew her shes the one who has her handbag open before you even ask she doesnt give you any mouth about finding a job or spending money on drink she just looks sort of sorry and she watches you when you walk away she hesitated but then she gave me a bag to carry not the heaviest one either shes nice she wants to trust me at least she doesnt want to distrust me i knew her she was my mark she said thank you very much the car is just round the corner i followed her and stood in the rain while she fumbled with her umbrella and car keys i put her bag in the boot and helped her with the other one she looked at me and hesitated again not that shed dream of going off without giving me something this one just wants to find a polite way of doing it she said well thanks very much and she started to fumble in her handbag again i let her get her money out and then i said i dont want your money missus thanks all the same for the thought she said oh but you must let me give you something i just stood there shaking my head looking pitiful what is it she asked with that sorry expression on her face it was the crucial time i said ive got some money missus but i cant spend it and i held out one of the fiftypound notes she looked at the money and she looked at me i said i know what youre thinking thats why i cant spend it i want to get some decent clothes because i cant get a job looking like this but every time i try they look at me like i stole the money and they go to call the law no one trusts people like me she went on looking first at me and then at the money and said i dont mean to sound suspicious but where did you get a fiftypound note a nice lady give it to me i said she mustve thought it was a fiver she was a really nice lady because no ones ever given me a fiver before but when i went in to buy a cup of tea and some chips the man went to call the law and i saw she must have made a mistake i see she said you dont i said having this money is worse than not having anything i can see that she said how can i help i had her please missus i said please help me spend it all i wants a good coat and some shoes theres a charity shop just round the corner and i been hanging around for ages but i cant bring myself to go in on my own she was good as gold my lady mark she bought me a big wool coat for only a couple of quid and she talked to the women in the shop while i looked for jeans and jerseys it was all quality stuff and probably it was all donated to the charity by women like her they dont give any old rubbish to charity and ill tell you something elsemy lady mark was having the time of her life it was like a dream come true to her someone really and truly wanted her help with something she approved of she didnt have to worry i was spending her money on drink or drugs because it wasnt her money and i was there under her nose spending it on warm clothes even the women behind the counter had a sort of glow on them when i came out from behind the racks with my arms full shed probably told them my story in whispers when my back was turned and that was why i really had needed her help because those nice ladies behind the counter would have chased me out if id gone in on my own theyd have been afraid id pinch their charity it was still coming down in buckets when we left the shop this time it was me carrying all the bags i was about to go when she said look dont be insulted but what you need is a hot bath and somewhere to change she said it in a rush as if she really was afraid of hurting my feelings i live up the hill she said it wont take any time at all nah i said ill get your car seats all dirty it doesnt matter she said please and i thought why not she deserved the satisfaction she ran me a hot bath and squirted loads of scented oil in she gave me her shampoo and a whole heap of clean towels and then my lovely lady mark left me alone in her bathroom i swear she had tears in her eyes when i came out in my new clothes crystal she said you look like a new person this was just what i wanted to hear you look quite like my own daughter when she was younger she said which was a good thing because the law and the bastards who beat marvin up werent looking for someone who looked like my lady marks daughter and no one would bat an eyelash if she had a fiftypound note my lady marks daughter would not turn into an old woman who had to bend over to root around in dustbins and nor i thought would i if i could help it she cooked me eggs and potatoes for my tea and when i left she gave me a fiver and her green umbrella it was a shame really to have pinched her soap but you cant break old habits all at once she even wanted to give me another ride in her car but i wouldnt let her she was a lovely lady but i didnt think shed understand about dawn lovely ladies dont i could give lessons about what to do when you find your mark and the last one would bedont push your luck because if you push your luck and let them take over they start giving you what they think you need instead of what you want if my lady mark knew too much about dawn and what was really going on shed have got in touch with the social services all over again and far from being a lovely lady shed have turned into an interfering old cow i was doing her a favor really im sure shed rather be a lovely lady than an interfering old cow no one who saw me knocking at dawns door in paddington would have known id spent all day down a drain dawn didnt struth crystal she said when she opened up you look like one of those girls from that snob school up the hill from ours i knew what she meant and i didnt like it much but i was lucky really id caught her at a slack time when she was just lying around reading her comic and playing records and now i was all clean and respectable she didnt mind if i sat on her bed you still need your hair cut dawn said she got out her scissors and manicure set and we sat on her bed while she cut my hair and did my nails dawn could be a beautician if she wanted the trouble is shed never stand for the training and the money wouldnt be enough shes used to her creature comforts now is dawn it was a bit like the old daysdawn and me together listening to records and her fiddling with my hair i didnt want to spoil it but i had to ask about the watch because when i was in the lovely ladys bathroom id had another search through philip walkerjoness wallet dawn said what about the watch and she rubbed round my thumb with her little nail file it was real gold i said to remind her your christmas present i cant wear a mans watch she said dawn likes to be very dainty sometimes where is it i said you want it back she asked fine christmas present if you want it back i looked at her and she looked at me then she said well crystal if you must know i was going to give it to my boyfriend for christmas it wasnt for him i said it was for you a mans watch she said and laughed i was going to get his name engraved on the back eternal love from dawn but there wasnt room there were all these numbers on the back and the man at the jewelers said id lose too much gold having them rubbed down hah i said i felt clever because all it takes is some good hot food to help you think and it had come to me in a flash just after id put down my last mouthful of egg and potato i said bet there were twentyfive of them loads of numbers she said she put the nail file back in her manicure set if you must know crystal she said i popped it and i bought him a real gold cigarette lighter instead and she gave me the pawn ticket she hadnt got much for a solid gold watch dawn isnt practical like i am so the pawnbroker cheated her not that it mattered it wasnt her watch in the first place and besides it would cost me less to get back if i wanted it back poor dawn she needs me to take care of her she doesnt think she does because she thinks her boyfriends doing it shes not like me she doesnt want to look after herself thats not her job and if i told her what id been through today to solve my own problems shed say i was a fool but look at it this wayid given detective sergeant michael sussex the slip id dressed up so he wouldnt know me again if i ran slapbang into him nor would brainy brian so he couldnt finger me to the bastards who beat up little marvin id had a bath and id had eggs and potatoes for my tea i had enough money to sleep in a bed for as many nights as i wanted and now i had the watch or i could have it any time i wanted but it was safer where it was i still didnt know why the number was so important but i was sure it would be worth something to me sooner or later i saw dawn looking at me dont get too cocky crystal she said you might look like a girl from the snob school but youre still just like me thats how much she knew full circle by sue grafton a kinsey millhone short story sue graftons private eye kinsey millhone is along with sara paretskys v i warshawski and marcia mullers sharon mccone one of three female investigators who revolutionized crime fiction in the s her alphabetized book titles beginning with a is for alibi sad now extending through g is for gumshoe have proved enormously popular ms grafton lives in santa barbara california a community much like kinseys santa teresa the accident seemed to happen in slow motion one of those stopaction sequences that seem to go on forever though in truth no more than a few seconds have elapsed it was friday afternoon rush hour santa teresa traffic moving at a lively pace my little vw holding its own despite the fact that its fifteen years out of date i was feeling good id just wrapped up a case and i had a check in my handbag for four thousand bucks not bad considering that im a female private eye selfemployed and subject to the feastorfamine vagaries of any other freelance work i glanced to my left as a young woman driving a white compact appeared in my side view mirror a bright red porsche was bearing down on her in the fast lane i adjusted my speed making room for her sensing that she meant to cut in front of me a navyblue pickup truck was coming up on my right each of us jockeying for position as the late afternoon sun washed down out of a cloudless california spring sky i had glanced in my rearview mirror checking traffic behind me when i heard a loud popping noise i snapped my attention back to the road in front of me the white compact veered abruptly back into the fast lane clipped the rear of the red porsche then hit the center divider and careened directly into my path i slammed on my brakes adrenaline shooting through me as i fought to control the vws fishtailing rear end suddenly a dark green mercedes appeared from out of nowhere and caught the girls car broadside flipping the vehicle with all the expertise of a movie stunt brakes squealed all around me like a chorus of squawking birds and i could hear the successive thumps of colliding cars piling up behind me in a drumroll of destruction it was over in an instant a cloud of dust roiling up from the shoulder where the girls car had finally come to rest right side up halfburied in the shrubbery she had sheared off one of the support posts for the exit sign that now leaned crazily across her car roof the ensuing silence was profound i pulled over and was out of my car like a shot the fellow from the navyblue pickup truck right behind me there must have been five of us running toward the wreckage spurred by the possibility of exploding gasoline which mercifully did not ignite the white car was accordionfolded the door on the drivers side jammed shut steam billowed out from under the hood with an alarming hiss the impact had rammed the girl head first into the windshield which had cracked in a starburst effect she was unconscious her face bathed in blood i willed myself to move toward her though my instinct was to turn away in horror the guy from the pickup truck nearly wrenched the car door off its hinges in one of those emergencygenerated bursts of strength that cant be duplicated under ordinary circumstances as he reached for her i caught his arm dont move her i said let the paramedics handle this he gave me a startled look but drew back as he was told i shed my windbreaker and we used it to form a compress stanching the flow of blood from the worst of her cuts the guy was in his twenties with dark curly hair and dark eyes filled with anxiety over my shoulder someone was asking me if i knew first aid and i realized that others had been hurt in the accident as well the driver from the green mercedes was already using the roadside emergency phone presumably calling police and ambulance i looked back at the guy from the pickup truck who was pressing the girls neck looking for a pulse is she alive i asked looks like it i jerked my head at the people on the berm behind me let me see what i can do down there until the ambulance comes i said holler if you need me he nodded in reply i left him with the girl and moved along the shoulder toward a writhing man whose leg was visibly broken a woman was sobbing hysterically somewhere close by and her cries added an eerie counterpoint to the moans of those in pain the fellow from the red porsche simply stood there numb immobilized by shock meanwhile traffic had slowed to a crawl and commuters were rubbernecking as if freeway accidents were some sort of spectator sport and this was the main event sirens approached the next hour was a blur of police and emergency vehicles i spotted my friend john birkett a photographer from the local paper whod reached the scene moments behind the paramedics i remember marveling at the speed with which news of the pileup had spread i watched as the girl was loaded into the ambulance while flashbulbs went off several of us gave our accounts of the accident to the highway patrol officer conferring with one another compulsively as if repetition might relieve us of tension and distress i didnt get home until nearly seven and my hands were still shaking the jumble of images made sleep a torment of sudden awakenings my foot jerking in a dream sequence as i slammed on my brakes again and again when i read in the morning paper that the girl had died i felt sick with regret the article was brief caroline spurrier was twentytwo a senior psychology major at the university of california santa teresa she was a native of denver colorado just two months short of graduation at the time of her death the photograph showed shoulderlength blond hair bright eyes and an impish grin according to the paper six other people had suffered injuries none fatal the weight of the young womans death settled in my chest like a cold i couldnt shake my office in town was being repainted so i worked at home that next week catching up on reports on thursday when the knock came id just broken for lunch i opened the door at first glance i thought the dead girl was miraculously alive restored to health and standing on my doorstep with all the solemnity of a ghost the illusion was dispelled a close look showed a blond woman in her midforties her face etched with weariness im michelle spurrier she said i understand you were a witness to my daughters accident i stepped back please come in im sorry for your loss mrs spurrier that was terrible she moved past me like a sleepwalker as i closed the door please sit down can i get you anything she shook her head looking around with bewilderment as if she couldnt quite remember what had brought her here she set her purse aside and sank down on my couch placing her cupped hands across her nose and mouth like an oxygen mask i sat down beside her watching as she breathed deeply struggling to speak take your time i said when the words came her voice was so low i had to lean closely to hear her the police examined carolines car at the impound lot and found a bullet hole in the window on the passenger side my daughter was shot she burst into tears i sat beside her while she poured out a grief tinged with rage and frustration i brought her a glass of water and a fistful of tissues small comfort but all i could think to do what are the police telling you i asked when shed composed herself she blew her nose and then took another deep breath the case has been transferred from traffic detail to homicide the officer i talked to this morning says it looks like a random freeway shooting but i dont believe it god knows theyve had enough of those down in los angeles i remarked well i cant accept that for one thing what was she doing speeding down the highway at that hour of the day she was supposed to be at work but they tell me she left abruptly without a word to anyone where was she employed a restaurant out in colgate shed been waiting tables there for a year the shift manager told me a man had been harassing her he thinks she might have left to try to get away from him did he know who the guy was she shook her head he wasnt sure some fellow shed been dating apparently he kept stopping by the restaurant calling her at all hours making a terrible pest of himself lieutenant dolan tells me youre a private detective which is why im here i want you to find out whos responsible for this mrs spurrier the police here are very competent im sure theyre doing everything possible skip the public relations message she said with bitterness i have to fly back to denver carolines stepfather is very ill and i need to get home but i cant go unless i know someone here is looking into this please i thought about it briefly but it didnt take much to persuade me as a witness to the accident i felt more than a professional interest in the case ill need the names of her friends i said i made a note of mrs spurriers address and phone number along with the name of carolines roommate and the restaurant where shed worked i drew up a standard contract waiving the advance id bill her later for whatever time i put in ordinarily i bypass police business in an attempt to stay out of lieutenant dolans way as the officer in charge of homicide hes not crazy about private eyes though hes fairly tolerant of me i couldnt imagine what shed had to threaten to warrant the referral as soon as she left i grabbed a jacket and my handbag and drove over to the police station where i paid six dollars for a copy of the police report lieutenant dolan wasnt in but i spent a few minutes chatting with emerald the clerk in identification and records shes a heavy black woman in her fifties usually wary of my questions but a sucker for gossip i hear jaspers wife caught him with rowena hairston i said throwing out some bait jasper sax is one of emeralds interdepartmental foes why tell me she said she was pretending disinterest but i could tell the rumor cheered her jasper from the crime lab is forever lifting files from emeralds desk which only gets her in trouble when lieutenant dolan comes around i was hoping youd fill me in on the spurrier accident i know youve memorized all the paperwork she grumbled something about flattery that implied she felt flattered so i pressed for specifics anybody see where the shot was fired from i asked no maam i thought about the fellow in the red porsche hed been in the lane to my left just a few yards ahead of me when the accident occurred the man in the pickup might be a help as well what about the other witnesses there must have been half a dozen of us at the scene whos been interviewed emerald gave me an indignant look whats the matter with you you know im not allowed to give out information like that worth a try i said equably what about the girls professors from the university has dolan talked to them check it out yourself if youre so interested she snapped come on emerald dolan knows im doing this he was the one who told mrs spurrier about me in the first place ill make it easy for you just one name she squinted at me suspiciously which ones that i took a flier describing the guy in the pickup figuring she could identify him from the list by age grudgingly she checked the list and her expression changed uhoh she said i might know youd zero in on this one fellow in the pickup gave a phony name and address benny seco was the name but he must have made that up telephone was a fake too looks like he took off and nobodys seen him since might have been a warrant out against him he was trying to duck how about the guy in the porsche i heard a voice behind me well well well kinsey millhone hard at work i see emerald faded into the background with all the practice of a spy i turned to find lieutenant dolan standing in the hallway in his habitual pose hands shoved down in his pants pockets rocking on his heels hed recently celebrated a birthday his baggy face reflecting every one of his sixty years i folded the police report and tucked it in my bag mrs spurrier got in touch with me and asked me to follow up on this business of her daughters death i feel bad about the girl his manner shifted i do too he said whats the story on the missing witness dolan shrugged he must have had some reason to give out a phony name did you talk to him at the scene just briefly but id know him if i saw him again do you think he could be of help dolan ran a hand across his balding pate id sure like to hear what the fellow has to say nobody else was aware that the girl was shot i gather he was close enough to have done it himself theres gotta be a way to track him down dont you think maybe he said no one remembers much about the man except the truck he drove toyota dark blue maybe four or five years old from what they say would you object if i checked back with the other witnesses i might get more out of them since i was there he studied me for a moment then reached over to the file and removed the list of witnesses which he handed to me without a word dont you need this i said surprised i have a copy thanks this is great ill let you know what i find out dolan pointed a finger keep in touch with the department i dont want you going off halfcocked i drove out to the campus area to the restaurant where caroline spurrier had worked the place had changed hands recently the decor downgraded from real plants to fake as the nationality of the food changed from mexican to thai the shift manager david cole was just a kid himself barely twentytwo tall skinny with a nose that belonged on a much larger face i introduced myself and told him i was looking into carolines death oh yeah that was awful i talked to her mom she says you mentioned some guy whod been bugging her what else can you tell me thats about all i know i mean i never saw the guy myself she was working nights for the last couple months and just switched back to days to see if she could get away from him she ever mention his name terry something i think she said he used to follow her around in this green van he drove she really thought the dude was bent bent you know twisted he twiddled an index finger beside his head to indicate his craziness whyd she go out with him she said he seemed like a real nice guy at first but then he got real possessive all jealous and like that in the and i guess he was totally nuts he must have showed up on friday which is why she took off i quizzed him but couldnt glean much more from his account i thanked him and drove over to the block of university housing where caroline had lived the apartment was typical of student digs faintly shabby furnished with mismatched items that had probably been languishing in someones garage her roommate was a young woman named judy layton who chatted despondently as she emptied kitchen cabinets and packed assorted cardboard boxes i kept the questions light at first asking her about herself as she wrapped some dinner plates in newspaper shoving each in a box she was twentytwo a senior english major with family living in town how long did you know caroline about a year she said i had another roommate but alice graduated last year caroline and i connected up through one of those roommate referral services how come youre moving out she shrugged going back to my folks its too late in the school year to find someone else and i cant afford this place on my own my brothers on his way over to help me move according to her caroline was a partyhearty who somehow managed to keep her grades up and still have a good time did she have a boyfriend she dated lots of guys but no one in particular she shook her head intent on her work i tried again she told her mom about some guy harassing her at work apparently shed dated him and theyd just broken up do you have any idea who she might have been talking about not really i didnt keep track of the guys in her life she must have mentioned this guy if he was causing such a fuss look she and i were not close we were roommates and that was it she went her way and i went mine if some guy was bugging her she didnt say a word to me she wasnt in any trouble that you knew about no her manner seemed sullen and it was getting on my nerves i stared at her judy i could use a little help people get murdered for a reason it might seem stupid or insignificant to the rest of us but there was something going on what gives you dont know it was murder the policeman i talked to said it might have been some bozo in a passing car her mother disagrees well i cant help you i already told you everything i know i nailed her with a look and let a silence fall hoping her discomfort would generate further comment no such luck if she knew more she was determined to keep it to herself i left a business card asking her to phone me if she remembered anything i spent the next two days talking to caroline spurriers professors and friends from the portrait that emerged she seemed like a likable kid funny goodnatured popular and sweet shed complained of the harassment to a couple of classmates without giving any indication who the fellow was i went back to the list of witnesses at the scene of the accident talking to each in turn i was still tantalized by the guy in the pickup what reason could he have to falsify his identity id clipped out the news account of caroline spurriers death pinning her picture on the bulletin board above my desk she looked down at me with a smile that seemed more enigmatic with the passing days i couldnt bear the idea of having to tell her mother my investigation was at an impasse but i knew i owed her a report i was sitting at my typewriter when an idea came to me quite literally in a flash i was staring at the newspaper picture of the wreckage when i spotted the photo credit i suddenly remembered john birkett at the scene his flash going off as he shot pictures of the wreck if hed inadvertently snapped one of the guy in the pickup at least id have something to show the cops maybe we could get a lead on the fellow that way i gave birkett a call twenty minutes later i was in his cubbyhole at the santa teresa dispatch our heads bent together while we scanned the contact sheets no good john said this ones not bad but the focus is off damn i never really got a clear shot of him what about the truck john pulled out another contact sheet that showed various views of the wrecked compact the pickup visible on the berm behind well you can see it in the background if thats any help can we get an enlargement you looking for anything in particular the license plate i said the california plate bore a sevenplace combination of numbers and letters that we finally discerned in the grainy haze of the two blowups i should have called lieutenant dolan and had him run the license number but i confess to an egotistical streak that sometimes overrides common sense i didnt want to give the lead back to him just yet i called a pal of mine at the department of motor vehicles and asked him to check it out instead the license plate was registered to a toyota pickup navy blue the owner listed as ron cagle with an address on mcclatchy way the house was stucco dark gray with the trim done in white my heart was pounding as i rang the bell the fellows face was printed so indelibly in my memory that when the door was finally opened i just stood there and stared wrong man this guy was probably six foot seven over two hundred pounds with a strong chin ruddy complexion blue eyes auburn hair red moustache yes im looking for ron cagle im ron cagle you are my voice broke in astonishment like a kid reaching puberty youre the owner of a navyblue toyota pickup i read off the number of the license plate he looked at me quizzically yes is something wrong well i dont know has someone else been driving it not for the last six months are you sure he half laughed see for yourself its sitting on the parking pad just behind the house he pulled the door shut behind him leading the way as the two of us moved off the porch and down the driveway to the rear there sat the navyblue toyota pickup without wheels up on blocks the hood was open and there was empty space where the engine should have been whats going on he asked thats what im about to ask you this truck was at the scene of a recent accident where a girl was killed not this one he said this has been right here without another word i pulled out the photographs isnt that your license plate he studied the photos with a frown well yes but the truck isnt mine it couldnt be he glanced back at his pickup spotting the discrepancy theres the problemhe pointed to the license the plate on the truck was an altogether different set of numbers it took me about thirty seconds before the light finally dawned somebody must have lifted your plates and substituted these what would be the point i shrugged maybe someone stole a navyblue toyota truck and wanted plates that would clear a license check if he was stopped by the cops can i use your telephone i called lieutenant dolan and told him what id found he ran a check on the plates for the pickup sitting in the drive that turned out to match the numbers on a vehicle reported stolen two weeks before an apb was issued for the truck with cagles plates dolans guess was that the guy had left the state or abandoned the pickup shortly after the accident it was also possible that even if we found the guy he might not have any real connection with the shooting death somehow i doubted it a week passed with no results the silence was discouraging i was right back where i started from with no appreciable progress if a case is going to break it usually happens fast and the chances of cracking this one were diminishing with every passing day caroline spurriers photograph was still pinned to the bulletin board above my desk her smile nearly mocking as the days went by in situations like this all i know to do is go back to the beginning and start again doggedly i went through the list of witnesses calling everybody on the list most tried to be helpful but there was really nothing new to add i drove back to the campus to look for carolines roommate judy layton had to know something more than shed told me at first maybe i could find a way to worm some information out of her the apartment was locked and a quick peek in the front window showed that all the furniture was gone i picked up her forwarding address from the manager on the premises and headed over to her parents house in colgate the little suburb to the north the house was pleasant a story and a half of stucco and frame an attached threecar garage visible at the right i rang the bell and waited idly scanning the neighborhood from my vantage point on the porch it was a nice street wide and treelined with a grassy divider down the center planted with pink and white flowering shrubs i rang the bell again apparently no one was home i went down the porch steps and paused in the driveway intending to return to my car which was parked at the curb i hesitated where i stood there are times in this business when a hunch is a hunch when a little voice in your gut tells you somethings amiss i turned with curiosity toward the threecar garage at the rear i cupped my hands shading my eyes so i could peer through the side window in the shadowy interior i saw a pickup stripped of paint i tried the garages side entrance the door was unlocked and i pushed my way in the space smelled of dust motor oil and primer the pickups license plates were gone this had to be the same truck though i couldnt think why it hadnt been dumped maybe it was too perilous to attempt at this point heart thumping i did a quick search of the cabs interior under the front seat on the drivers side i saw a handgun a left it where it was eased the cab door shut and backed away from the truck clearly someone in the layton household had been at the murder scene i left the garage at a quick clip trotting toward the street i had to find a telephone and call the cops i had just started my car shoving it into gear when i saw a dark green vw van pass on the far side of the divider and circle back in my direction headed toward the laytons drive the fellow driving was the man id seen at the accident judys brother the similarities were obvious now that i thought of it no wonder shed been unwilling to tell me what was going on he slowed for the turn and thats when he spotted me if id had any doubts about his guilt they vanished the minute he and i locked eyes his surprise was replaced by panic and he gunned his engine taking off i peeled after him flooring it at the corner he skidded sideways and recovered speeding out of sight i went after him zigzagging crazily through a residential area that was laid out like a maze i could almost chart his course ahead of me by the whine of his transmission he was heading toward the freeway at the overpass i caught a glimpse of him in the southbound lane he wasnt hard to track the boxy shape of the van clearly visible as we tore toward town the traffic began to slow massing in one of those inexplicable logjams on the road i couldnt tell if the problem was a fenderbender in the northbound lane or a bottleneck in ours but it gave me the advantage i needed i was catching him as i eased up on his left i saw him lean on the accelerator cutting to his right he hit the shoulder of the road his tires spewing out gravel as he widened the gap between us he was bypassing stalled cars hugging the shrubbery as he flew down the berm i was right behind him keeping as close to him as i dared my car wasnt very swift but then neither was his van i jammed my accelerator to the floor and pinned myself to his tail he was watching me steadily in his rearview mirror our eyes meeting in a deadlock of determination and grit i spotted the maintenance crew just seconds before he did guys in bright orange vests working with a crane that was parked squarely in his path there was no way for him to slow in time and no place else to go his van plowed into the rear of the crane with a crash that made my blood freeze as i slammed on my brakes i was luckier than he my vw came to a stop just a kiss away from death like a nightmare we repeated all the horror of the first wreck police and paramedics the wailing of the ambulance when i finally stopped shaking i realized where i was the road crew was replacing the big green highway sign sheared in half when caroline spurriers car had smashed into it terry layton died at the very spot where he killed her carolines smile has shifted back to impishness in the photograph above my desk i keep it there as a reminder but of what i couldnt say the brevity of life perhaps the finality of death the irony of events that sometimes connect the two we live in a world in which justice is skewed bennys space by marcia muller regarded as the person most responsible for introducing the new realistic and modem woman detective marcia muller has three exciting series characterssharon mccone in eye of the storm and others joanna stark in there hangs the knife and others and elena oliverez in powerful novels like the tree of death these three characters all exhibit a keen ability to understand themselves as well as their suspects ms muller lives in sonoma california amorfina angeles was terrified and i could fully empathize with her merely living in the neighborhood would have terrified meall the more so had i been harassed by members of one of its many street gangs hers was a rundown side street in the extreme southeast of san francisco only blocks from the drug and crimeinfested sunnydale public housing projects there were bars over the windows and grilles on the doors of the small stucco houses dead and vandalized cars stood at the broken curbs in the weedchoked yard next door a mangy guard dog of indeterminate breed paced and snarled fear was written on this street as plainly as the graffiti on the walls and fences fear and hopelessness and a dull resignation to a life that none of its residents would willingly have opted to lead i watched mrs angeles as she crossed her tiny living room to the front window pulled the edge of the curtain aside a fraction and peered out at the street she was no more than five feet tall with rounded shoulders sallow skin and graying black hair that curled in short unruly ringlets her shapeless flowerprinted dress did little to conceal a body made soft and fleshy by bad food and too much childbearing although she was only forty she moved like a much older woman her attorney and my colleague jack stuart of all souls legal cooperative had given me a brief history of his client when hed asked me to undertake an investigation on her behalf she was a filipina who had emigrated to the states with her husband in search of their own piece of the good life that was reputed to be had here but as with many of their countrymen and women things hadnt worked out as the angeleses had envisioned first amorfinas husband had gone into the importexport business with a friend from manila the friend absconded two years later with joe angeless life savings then a year after that joe was killed in a freak accident at a construction site where he was working amorfina and their six children were left with no means of support and in the years since joes death their circumstances had gradually been reduced to this twobedroom rental cottage in one of the worst areas of the city mrs angeles jack told me had done the best she could for her family keeping them off the welfare rolls with a daytime job at a mission district sewing factory and nighttime work doing alterations as they grew older the children helped with parttime jobs now there were only two left at home sixteenyearold alex and fourteenyearold isabel it was typical of their mother jack said that in the current crisis she was more concerned for them than for herself she turned from the window now her face taut with fear deep lines bracketing her full lips i asked is someone out there she shook her head and walked wearily to the worn recliner opposite me i occupied the place of honor on a red brocade sofa encased in the same plastic that doubtless had protected it long ago upon delivery from the store i never see anybody she said not till its too late mrs angeles jack stuart told me about your problem but id like to hear it in your own wordsfrom the beginning if you would she nodded smoothing her bright dress over her plump thighs it goes back a long time to when benny crespo was they called him the prince of omega street you know hearing the name of her street spoken made me aware of its ironic appropriateness the last letter of the greek alphabet is symbolic of endings and for most of the people living here omega street was the end of a steady decline into poverty mrs angeles went on benny crespo was filipino his gang controlled the drugs here a lot of people looked up to him he had power and that dont happen much with our people once i caught alex and one of my older boys calling him a hero i let them have it pretty good you bet and there wasnt any more of that kind of talk around this house i got no use for the gangsfilipino or otherwise what was the name of benny crespos gang the kabalyeros thats tagalog for knights okaywhat happened to benny the house next door the one with the dogthat was where benny lived he always parked his fancy corvette out front and people knew better than to mess with it late one night he was getting out of the car and somebody shot him a drug burn they say after that the kabalyeros decided to make the parking space a shrine to benny they roped it off put flowers there every week on all saints day and the other fiestas it was something to see and that brings us to last march thirteenth i said mrs angeles bit her lower lip and smoothed her dress again when she didnt speak i prompted her youd just come home from work yeah it was late dark isabel wasnt here and i got worried i kept looking out the window like a mother does and you saw the guy who moved into the house next door after benny got shot reg dawson he was black one of a gang called the victors they say he moved into that house to show the kabalyeros that the victors were taking over their turf anyway he drives up and stops a little way down the block waits there revving his engine people start showing up the words been put out that somethings gonna go down and when theres a big crowd reg dawson guns his car and drives right into bennys space over the rope and the flowers well that started one hell of a fightvictors and kabalyeros and folks from the neighborhood and while its going on reg dawson just stands there in bennys space acting macho thats when it happened what i saw and what was that she hesitated wet her lips the leader of the kabalyeros tommy dragónthe dragon they call himwas over by the fence in front of reg dawsons house where you couldnt see him unless you were really looking i was cause i was trying to see if isabel was anyplace out there and i saw tommy dragón point this gun at reg dawson and shoot him dead what did you do then ran and hid in the bathroom thats where i was when the cops came to the door somebodyd told them i was in the window when it all went down and then ran away when reg got shot well what was i supposed to do i got no use for the kabalyeros or the victors so i told the truth and now here i am in this mess mrs angeles had been slated to be the chief prosecution witness at tommy oragóns trial this week but a month ago the threats had started anonymous letters and phone calls warning her against testifying as the trial date approached this had escalated into blatant intimidation a fire was set in her trash can someone shot out her kitchen window a dead dog turned up on her doorstep the previous friday isabel had been accosted on her way home from the bus stop by two masked men with guns and that had finally made mrs angeles capitulate in court yesterday shed refused to take the stand against dragón the state needed her testimony there were no other witnesses dragon insisted on his innocence and the murder gun had not been found the judge had tried to reason with mrs angeles then cited her for contemptreluctantly he said the court is aware that there have been threats made against you and your family he told her but it is unable to guarantee your protection then he gave her fortyeight hours to reconsider her decision as it turned out mrs angeles had a champion in her employer the owner of the sewing factory was unwilling to allow one of his longterm workers to go to jail or to risk her own and her familys safety he brought her to all souls where he held a membership in our legalservices plan and this morning jack stuart had asked me to do something for her what id asked what could i do that the sfpd couldnt to stop vicious harassment by a street gang well he said get proof against whoever was threatening her so they could be arrested and shed feel free to testify sure jack i said and exactly why hadnt the police been able to do anything about the situation his answer was not surprising lack of funds intimidation of prosecution witnesses in cases relating to gang violence was becoming more and more prevalent and open in san francisco but the city did not have the resources to protect them an old story nowadaysnot enough money to go around mrs angeles was watching my face her eyes tentative as i looked back at her her gaze began to waver shed experienced too much disappointment in her life to expect much in the way of help from me i said yes you certainly are in a mess lets see if we can get you out of it we talked for a while longer and i soon realized that amoras she asked me to call herheld the misconception that there was some way i could get the contempt citation dropped i asked her if shed known beforehand that a balky witness could be sent to jail she shook her head a person had a right to change her mind didnt she when i set her straight on that she seemed to lose interest in the conversation it was difficult to get her to focus long enough to compile a list of people i should talk with i settled for enough names to keep me occupied for the rest of the afternoon i was ready to leave when angry voices came from the front steps a young man and woman entered they stopped speaking when they saw the room was occupied but their faces remained set in lines of contention amor hastened to introduce them as her son and daughter alex and isabel to them she explained that i was a detective helping with the trouble with the judge alex a stocky youth with a tracery of moustache on his upper lip seemed disinterested he shrugged out of his high school letter jacket and vanished through a door to the rear of the house isabel studied me with frank curiosity she was a slender beauty with black hair that fell in soft curls to her shoulders her features had a delicacy lacking in those of her mother and brother unfortunately bright blue eyeshadow and garish orange lipstick detracted from her natural good looks and she wore an imitation leather outfit in a particularly gaudy shade of purple however she was polite and wellspoken as she questioned me about what i could do to help her mother then after a comment to amor about an assignment that was due the next day she left through the door her brother had used i turned to amor who was fingering the leaves of a philodendron plant that stood on a stand near the front window her posture was stiff and when i spoke to her she didnt meet my eyes now i was aware of a tension in her that hadnt been there before her children returned home anxiety because of the danger her witnessing the shooting had placed them in or something else it might have had to do with the quarrel theyd been having but werent arguments between siblings fairly common they certainly had been in my childhood home in san diego i told amor id be back to check on her in a couple of hours then after a few precautionary and probably unnecessary reminders about locking doors and staying clear of windows i went out into the chill november afternoon the first name on my list was madeline dawson the slain gang leaders widow i glanced at the house next door and saw with some relief that the guard dog no longer paced in its yard when i pushed through the gate in the chain link fence the creatures whereabouts quickly became apparent a bellowing emanated from the small shabby cottage i went up a broken walk bordered by weeds climbed the sagging front steps and pressed the bell a womans voice yelled for the dog to shut up then a door slammed somewhere within muffling the barking footsteps approached and the woman called yes who is it my names sharon mccone from all souls legal cooperative im investigating the threats your neighbor mrs angeles has been receiving a couple of locks turned and the door opened on its chain the face that peered out at me was very thin and pale with wisps of red hair straggling over the high forehead the dawson marriage had been an interracial one then the woman stared at me for a moment before she asked what threats you dont know that mrs angeles and her children have been threatened because shes to testify against the man who shot your husband she shook her head and stepped back shivering slightlywhether from the cold outside or the memory of the murder i couldnt tell i dont get out much these days may i come in talk with you about the shooting she shrugged unhooked the chain and opened the door i dont know what good it will do amors a damned fool for saying shed testify in the first place arent you glad she did the man killed your husband she shrugged again and motioned me into a living room the same size as that in the angeles house all resemblance stopped there however dirty glasses and dishes full ashtrays piles of newspapers and magazines covered every surface dust balls the size of rats lurked under the shabby danish modern furniture madeline dawson picked up a heap of tabloids from the couch and dumped it on the floor then indicated i should sit there and took a hassock for herself i said you are glad that mrs angeles was willing to testify arent you not particularly you dont care if your husbands killer is convicted or not reg was asking to be killed not that i wouldnt mind seeing the dragon get the gas chamberhe may not have killed reg but he killed plenty of other people what did you say i spoke sharply and madeline dawson blinked in surprise it made me pay closer attention to her eyes they were glassy their pupils dilated the woman i realized was high i said the dragon killed plenty of other people no about him not killing reg did i say that yes i cant imagine why i mean amor must know she was up there in the window watching for sweet isabel like always you dont sound as if you like isabel angeles im not fond of flips in general look at the way theyre taking over this area daly citys turning into another manila ad they do is buy buy buyhouses cars stuff by the truckload you know theres a joke that the first three words their babies learn are mama papa and serramonte serramonte was a large shopping mall south of san francisco the roots of the resentment she voiced were clear to me one of our largest immigrant groups today the filipinos are highly westernized and by and large better educated and more affluent than other recently arrived asiansor many of their neighbors black or white isabel angeles for all her bright cheap clothing and excessive makeup had behind her a tradition of industriousness and upward mobility that might help her to secure a better place in the world than madeline dawson could aspire to i wasnt going to allow madelines biases to interfere with my line of questioning i said about dragón not having shot your husband hey who knows or cares the bastards dead and good riddance why good riddance the man was a pig a pusher who cheated and gouged peoplepeople like me who need the stuff to get through you think i was always like this lady no way i was a nice irish catholic girl from the avenues when reg got his hands on me turned me on to coke and a lot of other things when i was only thirteen liked his pussy young reg did but then i got oldim all of nineteen nowand i needed more and more stuff just to keep going and all of a sudden reg didnt even see me anymore yeah the man was a pig and im glad hes dead but you dont think dragón killed him she sighed in exasperation i dont know what i think its just that i always supposed that when reg got it it would be for something more personal than driving his car into a stupid shrine in a parking space you know what i mean but what does it matter who killed him anyway it matters to tommy dragón for one she dismissed the accused mans life with a flick of her hand like i said the dragons a killer he might as well die for regs murder as for any of the others in a way itd be the one good thing reg did for the world perhaps in a certain primitive sense she was right but her offhandedness made me uncomfortable i changed the subject about the threats to mrs angeleswhich of the kabalyeros would be behind them all of them the guys in the gangs they work together but i knew enough about the structure of street gangsmy degree in sociology from uc berkeley hadnt been totally worthlessto be reasonably sure that wasnt so there is usually one dominant personality supported by two or three lieutenants take away these leaders and the followers become ineffectual purposeless if i could turn up enough evidence against the leaders of the kabalyeros to have them arrested the harassment would stop i asked who took over the kabalyeros after dragón went to jail hector bulis it was a name that didnt appear on my list amor had claimed not to know who was the current head of the filipino gang where can i find him theres a fastfood joint over on geneva near the cow palace fat robbies thats where the kabalyeros hang out the second person id intended to talk with was the young man who had reportedly taken over the leadership of the victors after dawsons death jimmy willis willis could generally be found at a bowling alley also on geneva avenue near the cow palace i thanked madeline for taking the time to talk with me and headed for the daly city line the first of the two establishments that i spotted was fat robbies a cinderblockandglass relic of the early sixties whose specialties appeared to be burgers and ehickeninabasket i turned into a parking lot that was halffull of mostly shabby cars and left my mg beside one of the defunct drivein speaker poles the interior of the restaurant took me back to my high school days orange leatherette booths beside the plate glass windows a long formica counter with stools laminated color pictures of disgustinglooking food on the wall above the passthrough counter from the kitchen instead of a jukebox there was a bank of video games along one wall three filipino youths in jeans and denim jackets gathered around one called invader the kabalyeros i assumed i crossed to the counter with only a cursory glance at the trio sat and ordered coffee from a young waitress who looked to be eurasian the kabalyeros didnt conceal their interest in me they stared openly and after a moment one of them said something that sounded like ticktick and they all laughed nastily some sort of tagalog obscenity i supposed i ignored them sipping the dishwaterweak coffee and after a bit they went back to their game i took out the paperback that i keep in my bag for protective coloration and pretended to read listening to the few snatches of conversation that drifted over from the three i caught the names of two sal and hectorthe latter presumably bulis the gangs leader when i glanced covertly at him i saw he was tallish and thin with long hair caught back in a ponytail his features were razorsharp and slightly skewed creating the impression of a perpetual sneer the trio kept their voices low and although i strained to hear i could make out nothing of what they were saying after about five minutes hector turned away from the video machine with a final glance at me he motioned to his companions and they all left the restaurant i waited until theyd driven away in an old green pontiac before i called the waitress over and showed her my identification the three men who just left i said is the tall one hector bulis her lips formed a little o as she stared at the id finally she nodded may i talk with you about them she glanced toward the passthrough to the kitchen my boss he dont like me talking with the customers when im supposed to be working take a break just five minutes now she looked nervously around the restaurant i shouldnt i slipped a twentydollar bill from my wallet and showed it to her just five minutes she still seemed edgy but fear lost out to greed okay but i dont want anybody to see me talking to you go back to the restroomits through that door by the video games ill meet you there as soon as i can i got up and found the ladies room it was tiny dimly lit with a badly cracked mirror the walls were covered with a mass of graffiti some of it looked as if it had been painted over and had later worked its way back into view through the fading layers of enamel the air in there was redolent of grease cheap perfume and stale cigarette and marijuana smoke i leaned against the sink as i waited the young eurasian woman appeared a few minutes later bastard gave me a hard time she said tried to tell me id already taken my break whats your name anna smith anna the three men who just leftdo they come in here often uhhuh keep pretty much to themselves dont they its more like other people stay away from them she hesitated theyre from one of the gangs you dont mess with them thats why i wanted to talk with you back here have you ever heard them say anything about tommy dragón the dragon sure hes in jail they say he was framed of course they would claim that what about a mrs angelesamorfina angeles not that one no what about trying to intimidate someone setting fires going after someone with a gun uhuh thats gang business they keep it pretty close but it wouldnt surprise me filipinosim part filipina myself my mom met my dad when he was stationed at subic baytheyve got this saying kumukuló ang dugó it means the blood is boiling they can get pretty damn mad specially the men so stuff like what you saidsure they do it do you work on fridays yeah two to ten did you see any of the kabalyeros in here last friday around six that was the time when isabel had been accosted anna smith scrunched up her face in concentration last friday oh yeah sure that was when they had the big meeting all of them all of them uhhuh started around five thirty went on a couple of hours my boss he was worried something heavy was gonna go down but the way it turned out all he did was sell a lot of food what was this meeting about had to do with the dragon who was gonna be character witnesses at the trial what theyd say the image of the three id seen earlieror any of their ilkas character witnesses was somewhat ludicrous but i supposed in tommy dragons position you took what you could get are you sure they were all there uhhuh and no one at the meeting said anything about trying to keep mrs angeles from testifying no that lawyer the dragons got he was there too now that was odd why had dragons public defender chosen to meet with his witnesses in a public place i could think of one good reason he was afraid of them didnt want them in his office but what if the kabalyeros had set the time and placeas an alibi for when isabel was to be assaulted i better get back to work anna smith said before the boss comes looking for me i gave her the twenty dollars thanks for your time sure halfway out the door she paused frowning i hope i didnt get any of the kabalyeros in trouble you didnt good i kind of like them i mean they push dope and all but these days who doesnt these days who doesnt i thought good lord the starlight lanes was an oldfashioned bowling alley girded by a rough cliff face and an auto dismantlers yard the parking lot was crowded so i left the mg around back by the garbage cans inside the lanes were brightly lit and noisy with the sound of crashing pins rumbling balls shouts and groans i paused by the front counter and asked where i might find jimmy willis the woman behind it directed me to a lane at the far end bowling alleysor lanes as the new upscale bowler prefers to call themare familiar territory to me up until a few years ago my favorite uncle jim was a top player on the pro tour the starlight lanes reminded me of the ones where jim used to practice in san diegofrom the racks full of tiredlooking rental shoes to the greasyspoon coffeeshop smells to the molded plastic chairs and cigaretteburned scorekeeping consoles i walked along soaking up the ambiencesome people would say the lack of ituntil i came to lane and spotted an agile young black man bowling alone jimmy willis was a lefthander and his ball hooked out until it hung on the edge of the channel then hooked back with deadly precision i waited in the spectator area admiring his accuracy and graceful form his concentration was so great that he didnt notice me until hed finished the last frame and retrieved his ball youre quite a bowler i said whats your average he gave me a long look before he replied two hundred almost good enough to turn pro thats what im looking to do odd for the head of a street gang that dealt in drugs and death you ever hear of jim mccone i asked sure damned good in his day hes my uncle no kidding willis studied me again now as if looking for a resemblance rapport established i showed him my id and explained that i wanted to talk about reg dawsons murder he frowned hesitated then nodded okay since youre jim mccones niece but youll have to buy me a beer deal willis toweled off his ball stowed it and his shoes in their bag and led me to a typical smokefilled murkily lighted bowling alley bar he took one of the booths while i fetched us a pair of buds as i slid into the booth i said what can you tell me about the murder the way i see it dawson was asking for it so he and dawsons wife were of a mind about that i can understand what you mean but it seems strange coming from you i hear you were his friend that you took over the victors after his death you heard wrong on both counts yeah i was in the victors and when dawson bought it they tried to get me to take over but by then id figured outnever mind how doesnt matterthat i wanted out of that life aint nothing in it but what happened to benny crespo and dawsonor whats gonna happen to the dragon so i decided to put my hand to something with a future he patted the bowling bag that sat on the banquette beside him got a job here nownot much but my bowlings free and im on my way good for you what about dragondo you think hes guilty willis hesitated looking thoughtful why you ask just wondering well to tell you the truth i never did believe the dragon shot reg who did then he shrugged i asked him if hed heard about the kabalyeros trying to intimidate the chief prosecution witness when he nodded i said they also threatened the life of her daughter last friday he laughed mirthlessly wish i could of seen that kind of surprises me though that lawyer of dragóns he found out what the kabalyeros were up to read them the riot act said theyd put dragón in the gas chamber for sure so they called it off when was this week ten days ago long before isabel had been accosted before the dead dog and shooting incidents too are you sure its what i hear you know in a way im surprised that theyd go after mrs angeles at all why the filipinos have this macho tradition specially when it comes to their women they dont like them messed with specially by nonfilipinos so how come theyd turn around and mess with one of their own well her testimony would jeopardize the life of one of their fellow gang members its an extreme situation cant argue with that jimmy willis and i talked a bit more but he couldntor wouldntoffer any further information i bought him a second beer then went out to where id left my car and came facetoface with hector bulis and the man called sal sal grabbed me by the arm twisted it behind me and forced me up against the latticework fence surrounding the garbage cans the stench from them filled my nostrils sals breath rivaled it in foulness i struggled but he got hold of my other arm and pinned me tighter i looked around saw no one nothing but the cliff face and the high board fence of the auto dismantlers yard bulis approached flicking open a switchblade his twisty face intense i stiffened went very still eyes on the knife bulis placed the tip of the knife against my jawbone then traced a line across my cheek dont want to hurt you bitch he said you do what i say i wont have to mess you up the tagalog phrase that anna smith had translated for mekumukuló ang dugóflashed through my mind the blood is boiling i sensed buliss wasand dangerously high i wet my dry lips tried to keep my voice from shaking as i said what do you want me to do we hear youre asking around about dawsons murder trying to prove the dragon did it thats not we want you to quit go back to your own part of town and leave our business alone whoever told you that is lying im only trying to help the angeles family they wouldnt lie he moved the knifes tip to the hollow at the base of my throat i felt it pierce my skina mere pinprick but frightening enough when i could speak i did so slowly phrasing my words carefully what i hear is that dragón is innocent and that the kabalyeros arent behind the harassment of the angelesesat least not for a week or ten days bulis exchanged a look with his companionquick unreadable someones trying to frame you i added just like they did dragón bulis continued to hold the knife to my throat his hand firm his gaze wavered however as if he was considering what id said after a moment he asked all rightwho im not sure but i think i can find out he thought a bit longer then let his arm drop and snapped the knife shut ill give you till this time tomorrow he said then he stuffed the knife into his pocket motioned for sal to let go of me and the two quickly walked away i sagged against the latticework fence feeling my throat where the knife had pricked it it had bled a little but the flow already was clotting my knees were weak and my breath came fast but i was too caught up in the possibilities to panic there were plenty of themand the most likely was the most unpleasant kumukuló ang dugó the blood is boiling two hours later i was back at the angeles house on omega street when amor admitted me the tension id felt in her earlier had drained her body sagged as if the extra weight she carried had finally proved to be too much for her frail bones the skin of her face looked flaccid like melting putty her eyes were sunken and vague after she shut the door and motioned for me to sit she sank into the recliner expelling a sigh the house was quiettoo quiet i have a question for you i said what does ticktick mean in tagalog her eyes flickered with dull interest tiktík she corrected my pronunciation its a word for detective ever since hector bulis and sal had accosted me id suspected as much where did you hear that amor asked one of the kabalyeros said it when i went to fat robbies earlier someone had told them i was a detective probably described me whoever it was said i was trying to prove tommy dragón killed reg dawson why would more to the point who would at the time only four people knew that im a detective she wet her lips but remained silent amor the night of the shooting you were standing in your front window watching for isabel yes do you do that often yes because isabel is often late coming home because youre afraid she may have gotten into trouble a mother worries especially when shes given good cause isabel is running out of control isnt she no she amor when i spoke with madeline dawson she said you were standing in the window watching for sweet isabel like always she didnt say sweet in a pleasant way later jimmy willis implied that your daughter is not exactly a vulnerable young girl amors eyes sparked the dawson woman is jealous of course she is theres something else when i asked the waitress at fat robbies if shed ever overheard the kabalyews discussing you she said no not that one it didnt register at the time but when i talked to her again a little while ago she told me isabel is the member of your family they discuss they say shes wild runs around with the men in the gangs you know that so does alex and so does madeline dawson she just told me the first man isabel became involved with was her husband amor seemed to shrivel she gripped the arms of the chair whiteknuckled its true isnt it i asked more gently she lowered her eyes nodding when she spoke her voice was ragged i dont know what to do with her anymore ever since that reg dawson got to her shes been different not my girl at all is she on drugs alex says no but im not so sure i let it go it didnt really matter when she came home earlier i said isabel seemed very interested in me she asked questions looked me over carefully enough to be able to describe me to the kabalyeros she was afraid of what i might find out for instance that she wasnt accosted by any men with guns last friday she was no amor that was just a story to make it look as if your lifeand your childrenswere in danger if you testified in spite of what you said early on you havent wanted to testify against tommy dragón from the very beginning when the kabalyeros began harassing you a month ago you saw that as the perfect excuse not to take the stand but you didnt foresee that dragóns lawyer would convince the gang to stop the harassment when that happened you and isabel and probably alex too manufactured incidentsthe shotout window the dead dog on the doorstep the men with the gunsto make it look as if the harassment was still going on why would i theyre going to put me in jail but at the time you didnt know they could do thator that your employer would hire me my investigating poses yet another danger to you and your family this is why would i do all that because basically youre an honest woman a good woman you didnt want to testify because you knew dragón didnt shoot dawson its my guess you gave the police his name because it was the first one that came to mind i had no reason to you had the best reason in the world a mothers desire to protect her child she was silent sunken eyes registering despair and defeat i kept on even though i hated to inflict further pain on her the day he died dawson had let the word out that he was going to desecrate bennys space the person who shot him knew there would be fighting and confusion counted on that as a cover the killer hated dawson lots of people did but only one person youd want to protect so badly that youd accuse an innocent man leave my mother alone shes suffered enough on account of what i did i turned alex had come into the room so quietly i hadnt noticed now he moved midway between amor and me a saturday night special clutched in his right hand the missing murder weapon i tensed but one look at his face told me he didnt intend to use it instead he raised his arm and extended the gun grip first take this he said i never should of bought it never should of used it i hated dawson on account of what he did to my sister but killing him wasnt worth what weve all gone through since i glanced at amor tears were trickling down her face alex said mama dont cry im not worth it when she spoke it was to me what will happen to him nothing like what might have happened to dragón alex is a juvenile you however i dont care about myself only my children maybe that was the trouble she was the archetypal selfless mother living only for her children sheltering them from the consequences of their actionsand in the end doing them irreparable harm there were times when i felt thankful that i had no children and there were times when i was thankful that jack stuart was a very good criminal lawyer this was a time when i was thankful on both counts i went to the phone called jack and asked him to come over here at least i could leave the angeles family in good legal hands after he arrived i went out into the gathering dusk an old yellow vw was pulling out of bennys space i walked down there and stood on the curb nothing remained of the shrine to benny crespo nothing remained to show that blood had boiled and been shed here it was merely a stretch of cracked asphalt splotched with oil drippings uttered with the detritus of urban life i stared at it for close to a minute then turned away from the bleak landscape of omega street the puppet by dorothy salisbury davis dorothy daviss first crime novel was the judas cat published in since that time she achieved an enviable reputation for her ability to write novels and stories with both believable rural and urban settings her more than twenty novels include at least four that have been nominated for the edgar award and she was made a grand master of the mystery writers of america in most critics consider a gentle murderer to be her best novel and one of the best crime novels of the postworld war ii era over the ring of the doorbell came the cry help me julie let me in julie out of bed before she was rightly awake pulled on her robe and ran barefoot to the front of the shop it was halfpast one in the morning she unbolted the door and opened it on the latch her upstairs neighbor rose rodriguez was shivering in a silvery dress that glowed in the stark manhattan street light julie let her in then bolted the door and lighted a lamp i dont know where juanita is shes not in her bed i thought maybe she comes to you julie shook her head sit down while i get my slippers the chair creaked with its burden in the years julie hayes had occupied the shop the ground floor apartment on west th street mrs rodriguez had put on weight her one child juanita had grown from a string bean to puberty with a sudden promising beauty mrs rodriguez pointed at the row of dolls when julie returned they sat on a table their backs against the wall they are juanitas no weve been mending them julie said now tell me whats with juanita its boys i know its boys you ought to know julie thought it was apparent mrs rodriguez had just returned from an evening out her husband wouldnt know about it juanita would julie was not a great hater but she would have been hard put to find a kind word for the woman now twisting off the flashy rings from her fingers where do you think she is lets start with that she wants to go to her friend elenas for supper i say okay but you be home by nine oclock the whole holiday weekend and she hasnt done her homework did she come home julie the womans face became a mask of contrition she has a very good father but not so good mother you know julie ignored the ploy for sympathy isnt it possible she tried to call you to ask if she could stay overnight and then stayed anyway when she couldnt reach you she knows better papa will not give permission he will kill me the woman began to sob stop that julie shouted lets call her friends house right now you know her number julie dont you i dont even know her name except elena then you cant do anything till morning i can call the police no no police they come and ask questions yeah mrs rodriguez brushed away green tears her mascara was running you are right she stays with elena i think thats what i tell papa if he looks and sees shes not in her bed a wild man first thing in the morning call the school ask for the principal whoever you get find out elenas last name her phone number the woman laid her hand on julies please will you call say its for me señora rodriguez say i dont speak very good english thats the truth no mrs rodriguez please you call me rose we are friends no julie could not go back to sleep she listened for juanitas father to come home from work a tired bemused man who moonlighted on a second job while his wife moonlighted in her fashion juanita had grown up a silent angry child who beat her dolls and pulled off their arms and legs now she and julie were putting them together again with glue and heavy thread a christmas project for the really poor it had taken julie a long time to make her smile then laugh to make her see the dolls as little juanitas a lot of her own angry childhood had gone into the making mr rodriguez came home julie waited for the explosion the reverberations of which would run through the building but none came the woman would have persuaded him the child was asleep in her bed julie sat up and phoned the local precinct the only complaints involving children were drug related downtown bookings parents contacted how about the prostitutesany young ones the wildest possibility theyre all youngand as old as magdalene the desk sergeant said then this wasnt a sweep night julie nothing came of inquiries to the local hospitals julie lay back and thought about when she had last seen the youngster late afternoon yesterday probably when she was coming home to ask permission to go to elenas what was she wearing besides the red white and green streamers julie couldnt remember the italian colors were for the columbus day street fair nor could she remember juanitas ever mentioning elena she was only beginning to make friends so thank god for elena sleep finally came the girl opened her eyes she seemed to be dreaming of waking up but she had to be still asleep she was lying in a huge strange bed under a blanket with her clothes on the room was dark except for a patch of gray light in the ceiling curled up on her side her thumb in her mouth she stared at the light it looked more like a sheet floating up there but the flickering lights of a plane appeared and moved quickly out of sight again she heard the roar go away it was a skylight in the ceiling something she had seen only in a movie she tried to wake up she bit her thumb and when it hurt she knew that she was already awake then she remembered what had happened to her before the sleep the woman and a man in the dirty lobby of an old theater where she had gone to see the puppets at the fair the woman had told her about them and promised to show her how they worked she had wanted to learn how to make puppets and how to make them act the woman said she was a natural she and julie might even use the dolls and make their own puppet show but there werent any puppets and she knew the minute the door had closed behind her that she should never never have gone there the woman grabbed her and covered her mouth when she started to scream the man held her legs and roped them together then knocked them out from under her sat on her pinned her arm down and must have stuck a needle in her the place in the hollow of her arm hurt now when she touched it she distinctly heard him say five minutes she tried to scratch and bite the man swore at her and the woman said for christs sake danny do you want her looking like a battered child her memory stopped right there now the important thing was she had to go to the bathroom she inched her way to the edge of the bed in the direction she was facing something white stood on the floor a few feet from the beda bucket she made out after a few seconds of study she would have to use it and maybe that was what it was there for she crawled to it it seemed safer to stay close to the floor she wondered if her shoes were in the bed but didnt think so she squatted over the bucket but nothing happened while she waited she made out the shapes of some scary figures on the other side of the beda lot of chalky white people just standing they seemed to be moving toward her she tried to cry out but couldnt and her legs were shaking she was sure she was going to fall she managed not to and the figures didnt come round the bed they werent even moving statues if that was what they were could one of them be the blessed virgin hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee she heard her own voice mumbling the prayer then the beginning trickle of her water then the gush noisy in the pail she had just finished when the door opened behind her and sent a splash of light across the room the man came in and lit a lamp on a table near the door figured out what that was for did you youre a smart girl she made no sound or move get back into bed and stay there till she brings your breakfast i dont want you messing round the studio do you know what a studio is its where artists work if she ran for the door what would happen he was too close to it and she couldnt run she couldnt even move only her heart bumped inside her did you hear me into bed no he grinned at her and took the hypodermic needle from his pocket she lunged stumbling toward the bed the guidance counselor dr alverez sent elena cruz back to her classroom julie used the counselors phone to call mrs rodriguez and tell her the news was not good youd better waken your husband and then call the police nine one one juanita did not go to elenas house at all last night elena was at her aunts house for dinner in other words juanita has been missing since you last saw her you simply must call the police julie please the womans voice rose hysterically ill call you later julie said and hung up the counselor was watching julie with an appraising eye you know dont you youre the best thing that ever happened to juanita doesnt help much now does it if theres anyone shell get in touch with its you so if i dont hear from her where is she whats the worst possibility you can think of doctor the counselor gave an enormous sigh that she was abducted but if she was she must have set herself up for it willinglythe lie about dinner at elenas her mother thinks its all about boys julie said i wish it were ridiculous of me to say that but the boys are a lot more interested in juanita than she is in the boys do you know what her home situation is like alverez nodded her father works long hours whatever her mother does while hes away juanitas ashamed of it she usually stops at my place on the way home if im there yesterday she didnt i just happened to see her go by i think shed been to the street fair if youd ask her classmates whether anyone saw herwhere and what timeit would be great when i went out not long after i saw her i found a flyer stuck in my mail drop now i wonder if she put it there maybe you try to think of everything this was about a rally of the west side women to close up the porn shops in the neighborhood alverez smiled well i can tell you this if theres a budding feminist in the sixth grade its juanita rodriguez take a bite honey or ill eat it didnt your mother ever say if you dont eat it i will juanita did not answer she was sitting at the table the big woman between her and the door it was daylight but the room was lighted mostly by long tubes in the ceiling there werent any windows except the one in the roof the man danny was poking around among the statues and moving some boxes there were paintings too one on a threelegged stand and others stacked on their sides danny wasnt doing anything only moving things around with his little eyes and skinny moustache he didnt look to her like an artist the woman broke off a piece of the danish touched juanitas tight lips with it and then ate it herself her fingernails were like dabs of blood her mouth a red smear even her hair was red she was as old as mama a lot older than julie everybody would be looking for her but where would they look papa would shout and whack her mother then hed cry take some coffee juanita it wont hurt you i promise you promised there were puppets her first words except for the no to the needle we do make puppets the man gave a bark of laughter shut up danny and youre not supposed to touch any of their things back there its in the agreement fuck the agreement dont you talk like that in front of her the woman shouted what in hell is going on with you dee why dont you go out and look for what youre supposed to be looking for because its nine am and nothings open yet he came out from among the statues and stopped at the table the lights in here are no damn good for us we shouldve known that then get some that are honest to god danny youre in new york city dont hassle me dee youre the one jumped the gun though im damned if i see why little miss perfect here he caught a handful of juanitas hair and pulled her head backnot roughly but not gently either he looked at her from her eyes to as far down as he could see and then let go he poked his finger at the womans face just dont get too fond of her shes a puppet remember julie after several phone calls reached an organizer of the antiporn rally she promised an item in the our beat column and then told of the missing youngster its a long shot but if you were handing out flyers at the street fair yesterday i wonder if you saw her i wasnt there myself but there was an incident at the fair that might have involved your young person let me give you the number of sue laughlin you mustnt take her literally if she makes it sound like gang rape thats just sue a chorus of infant and toddler voices rang through julies conversation with sue laughlin i thought the girl was oldersixteen maybe and she did volunteer anywayshut up jamie cant you see mommys on the phoneanyway she was handing out our flyers when this gang of young jocks started to tease herwhats pornography juanita that sort of thing did they call her by name its important how would i know her name if they hadnt then one of them snatched the flyers from her and they all clowned around throwing them into the air and what did she do she grabbed an umbrella from a concession stand and began thrashing the mischief out of them gang rape julie thought they ran off and the guy selling the umbrellas tried to make her buy the one shed taken i was going to say something but a woman whod been watching the whole thing said shed buy the umbrella did you know the woman no i dont think shes from the neighborhood there were hundreds of people you know julie felt herself tighten up did she speak to juanita i couldnt say for sure i just wasnt paying attention after that could you describe the woman a big solid woman well dressed but flashy too much makeup red hair julie reached detective russo at precinct headquarters with her bits of information dominic russo and she were old friends so he could say frankly that he would give it what time he could but from her parents report the youngster sounded like a runaway the case would go to missing persons within twentyfour hours well give out her description at roll call and put it on the bulletin board but you know how many kids hit the streets every day yeah most of them come home in a day or two some dont ever ill keep in touch dom dont i know that he said julie went upstairs to see the rodriguezes as soon as they got home juanitas father was sitting in the kitchen his head in his hands he looked up at her when she laid her hand on his shoulder his eyes were wet why she do this to us why julie to reassure them of the girls resourcefulness told them how juanita had confronted the boys who were taunting her mrs rodriguez turned and stormed at her husband men are pigs youre all pigs it ought to have been funny julie thought but it wasnt juanita sat on the bathroom stool in a silk robe that was much too big for her she had taken a shower she hadnt wanted and washed her hair on the womans command she hadnt wanted to take off her clothes but she was afraid the woman might make her and might come into the bathroom with her she hadnt done that she only made juanita hand out her jeans jacket and sweat shirt her bra panties and socks she hadnt seen her sneakers since they brought her here she knew now that this was a loft the bathroom was fancynew so was the kitchen which didnt have any doors the living room ran all the way from the studiothe room with the big bed and the statuesto what must be the front of the building street noises seemed to come from there and there must be a very big window with heavy curtains covering it threads of light showed at the top and at the floor a castro convertible bed where they must have slept was open the woman who said she must call her dee told her the big door was to the elevator and was kept locked juanita was pretty sure there had to be a fire escape but where come out now juanita i want to fix your hair could i have my clothes please youll get dressed later come on now she went out to where the woman motioned her into a chair in front of a mirror cant i get dressed before he comes back first i want to do up your hair dee had a dryer in hand little dark pompoms might be nice you could look japanese like a geisha girl please i hate this juanita tugged at the robe just be patient youre going to have beautiful new clothes dee blowdried her hair to where she could work with it making little round buns she fastened and then let loose then fashioned again very pretty my little geisha juanitas fear was getting bad again she almost wished the man would come they might have another fight a long one when her mother and father fought she could run away and hide where could she run and hide here shed make a dash for the big window and pound on it she would jump up and down but people would point and laugh and wouldnt do anything unless the man came and tried to give her the needle and she fought him right there in the window maybe then a penny for your thoughts dee smiled at her in the mirror and then looked at herself how i wish i was young like you again dont let him stick the needle in me anymore over my dead body juanita felt a little more secure and tried once more couldnt i have my clothes back now no dear ive already put them in the garbage disposal in the early afternoon with the help of vendor licensing and traffic control detective russo located the greystone puppets truck it was impounded in the twelfth avenue lot for illegal parking overnight according to the gatekeeper the owner had arrived early that morning but without enough money to pay both fine and storage he was due back within the hour otherwise hed owe the city another hundred dollars for storage julie took what money she had in the house and waited outdoors for the squad car to pick her up where she had used to carry a pocketful of coins for blind beggars and street musicians she now carried dollar bills for the homeless she and the two precinct officers russo had commandeered examined the truck it was locked up tight but that didnt mean much given its condition as one of the cops said it was hard to tell what breed it was they could see the skeleton of a stage set on a platform that probably rolled out onto the tailgate there was a trunk marked costumes and some painted scenery scaled to the stage but no puppets very soon a little man with a wisp of a moustache hollow cheeks and great melancholy eyes came up lugging a duffel bag he showed the cops his receipt from the city i had to hock my puppets theyre my kids my goddam living ill help you if you can help me julie said she didnt look as though she had much to help with in sneakers and raincoat but as soon as she started to describe juanita she was in charge she soon had the puppeteer wagging his head he remembered the girl all right she kept asking me questionsdid i make the puppets myself did i make them out of old dolls could she make them she wanted to know where i was going next florida i says i dont want them to catch cold when she saw i was putting her onthe saddest look i ever saw then he was jolted aware shes come up missing since five oclock last night i was there on the street till ten but listen there was this woman i thought at first was the kids mother she was telling her about puppets i was changing the act see i got three different acts julie waited out his setting the scene one of the cops activated a pocket recorder somewhere in there i got the idea this dame was a con artist i dont mean i thought it exactly it just crossed my mind she was like playing to me too thats what kept the youngster interested she watched to see if i was interested that kids no fool the redhead was telling about this old theater she was renovating and how she was collecting puppets that could make like singers where did she say where it was no maam not to me she didnt and ill tell you this she knew about as much about puppets as i know about king tut but thats where i lost touch i got a hand puppet thats my buddy whenever we get enough people around andy and i pass the hat its a living i guess you could call it a living what else about juanita he shrugged one minute they were there gone the next thats how it is when youre playing the street the police pressed him for a description of the redheaded woman then julie asked him if he thought the theater she spoke about might be a real place could be nearby again he shrugged then i dont think that kid would go with her anyplace she couldnt walk to a buzzer signaled dannys return while the elevator groaned its way up juanita glanced toward the heavily draped window at the front of the loft dee clamped her fingers around the girls wrist dont you even think of it do you want to get killed juanita still in the silken robe gathered it tighter in front of her it didnt have any buttons she tried not to see herself in the mirror because it wasnt really her dee had made her up to look oriental but she watched in the mirror for the elevators arrival when it stopped dee had to unlock the door to let danny in he took the key from her and locked it again so dee wanted to know he didnt answer he came near and stared at juanita in the mirror he made a face like he was going to throw up whatve you done to her and what in hell is she doing out of the studio we needed a bath then we need another bath she looks like a midgets whore funnee did you get what you went for no the answer is no dee shes supposed to look like an angel thats why you fell in love with her oh shut up i got a contact thats all i got and im going to go see him as soon as you and i straighten some things out danny how much time do you think we have maybe we dont have any this town ought to be the best but its the worst yet get her inside there so we can talk confined again in the studio juanita put her ear to the frame of the door then to the keyhole then she lay down on the floor and tried to hear from under the door but only the sound of their voices reached her going away as though to the front of the building a new sound startled her until she realized it was her stomach growling shed promised dee she would eat she knew dee liked her thats what made danny mad but there wasnt any food dee looked in the cupboards and the fridge how could they live someplace with no food in the house they didnt live here it was like a hotel only it was a loft they rented their suitcases were on the floor open with clothes falling out of them theyd rented from an artist which was why danny wasnt supposed to touch anything in the studio she sat on the edge of a chair and wound her feet around its legs the dressing gown smelled of perfume and sweat she wished theyd start fighting again so she could hear them if they didnt have any time would they go away and leave her locked in this room with the bucket and the big bed she hated beds more than most things her mother and father fought a lot about beds and her mother had boyfriends she didnt think juanita or papa knew about papa didnt she did she knew that was why her mother let her go when she said she was going to elenas she had a date with a boyfriend juanita thought of the kids getting on her about the flyerswhats pornography juanita how come you know so much about it she knew it was dirty pictures but she wasnt going to say it to them she felt herself going sick again scared she tried to think of julie julie would really try to find her maybe shed find the puppet man he could tell her about dee but what else she hadnt seen danny before she walked into the old building with the handpainted sign on the door puppet show inside julie walked a lot and she might find it juanita began to walk then too round and round the room she went barefoot the silk gown dragging the floor finally she entered the alcove where the statues stood around like people at a funeral there were other things halffinished bodies heads she recognized the smell of clay tools and brushes and tubes of paint lay on a table there was a painting on a threelegged stand and other paintings were stacked in racks this was where danny wasnt supposed to touch anything she came on several camera cases then and something rolled up with metal legs sticking out there were two flat boxes with straps that were marked film these things belonged to danny she felt sure not to the artist danny said the light wasnt any good he was going to take her picture and he wanted her to look like an angel that didnt sound like danny shed have thought he would want her to look like a whore julie was in luck when she reached the actors forum a session had just ended nobody there knew much about puppets but when shed given the actors and apprentices the story most of them volunteered to organize a streetbystreet search of old west side buildings in which a puppet theater might now be playing or where appropriate renovation might be under way they would all go first to precinct headquarters and coordinate with the police mind you julie cautioned the real puppeteer said the woman didnt know anything about puppets it was probably a story made up to lure the youngster shes eleven years old and shes pretty what else can i tell you well find her sister nuba bradley a tall black actor who seemed to have grown three inches with the current hair style bent almost in two to kiss her cheek reggie bauer hung back to talk to julie while the others got under way slight blond and brittle reggie knew new york society from the bowery to the bridge tables these were where it was said he made enough money to support himself as an actor you dont think for a minute its got anything to do with puppets do you julie waited do you want my scenario not if its too far out of course i want it kid porn what does that mean she knew well enough or thought she did but she hoped it wasnt so child pornography the lady was shopping for innocence the real thing in the meantime either shes got a partner for her or somebodys out there looking for an experienced young dude to match her up with julie didnt question him on his expertise she thought she knew how he came by it except that reggie was gay the thought must have shone through her eyes he said a lot of its faked you know especially the pleasure how would they find a boy like that where through somebody in the business somebody knows somebody who likes boys a certain amount of trust is involved in the transaction oh my god julie said maybe i know someone myself juanita stood beneath the skylight and turned around slowly on tiptoe she could see what looked like the top of a barrel bringing one of the chairs to stand on she could see that it was a water tower she could see other buildings and a lot of sky she could also see where water leaked in around the skylight if she could get up there she might be able to push the window out she went back to the door and listened she couldnt hear anything except faraway car horns and the rumble of the city much as it sounded when she was home alone in the daytime maybe theyd both gone out maybe theyd already gone and left her and left the camera and everything she didnt think so she wasnt going to let them photograph her without her clothes on not unless he used the needle again this time shed kick it out of his hand or kick him where she knew it would hurt most over my dead body dee had said but dee was afraid of him too she took the painting off the threelegged stand even if she could step on the stand it wouldnt be high enough again she listened at the door theyd gone out to lunch she decided and dee would bring back something for her it had to be after lunchtime as quietly as she could she pulled the table under the skylight the stand just fit on top of it the dressing gown made it hard for her to climb and she knew it was going to get in her way if she got high enough to try to move the window but it had pockets she found a paintsmeared knife and a chisel which she pocketed she also took a hammer and tied it around her waist with the sash of the robe she tried not to think of danny but in spite of herself she imagined him unlocking the door just as she stepped from the chair onto the table she began to melt again with fear no she cried aloud without meaning to she waited nothing happened she could not climb up on the stand the ledge she wanted to step onto was too high she pulled the chair up onto the table but in doing it she nudged one of the legs of the stand and the whole thing clattered to the floor not a sound came from the other side of the door this time after shed set up the stand and placed the chair beneath it she boosted herself up without tumbling the works she waited and listened there were sounds she hadnt heard before in the building noise like heat coming up in the pipes machinery sounds that might be the elevator but it never seemed to arrive her heartbeat was too loud to hear much else she made it safely up onto the chair she could see the twin towers of the board of trade buildings she was in lower manhattan soho of course where the artists were she got one foot sidewise onto the ledge and tested to see if it would hold her it seemed to but when she tried to lift the other foot the stand wobbled and collapsed she missed the chair and fell and flailing brought the chair down after her before she knew whether or not she was hurt dee threw open the door and came running to her juanita tried to pull the robe close around her i wouldntve believed it he was right i shouldntve left you alone let me look at your face on her knees dee examined her face touched her eyes nose lips say ouch if it hurts juanita determined not to say ouch no matter how much it hurt she managed to loosen the hammer and tie the sash around her dee felt down her arms and pulled the robe open to see her middle juanita closed it again she knew there would be bruises where shed hit the table but she didnt make a sound when dee touched the sore spots dee got to her feet and pulled the girl up youre lucky in more ways than one you little fool lets put these things back where they were i promise i wont tell danny if you promise to do what youre told from now on promise me she gave the girl a shake juanita was trying not to cry she did hurt but she forced a big smile and nodded what could be taken for a promise she had lost the chisel on the way down but she could feel the knife stuck deep in the pocket of the robe julie stopped at the shop to see if any message had come through her service most of the calls pertained to business she put them on hold several women against pornography members had joined the neighborhood search mrs rodriguez had called twice julie ran upstairs the woman had heard nothing her husband had gone to the police station to wait there were a lot of perdidas in her lamentation julie walked the four blocks to kevin bourkes electrical shop on eighth avenue mr bourke was one of the first people shed met after moving into the shop he loaned a friend of hers some lamps to help decorate it he had lived in the neighborhood all his life he attended st malachys where the catholic actors went supported the irish theater and looked a bit like sean ocasey whose plays he admired fervently he had been in trouble when julie met him on the complaint of a boy who turned out later to have been a prostitute julie might not have been so direct if her mission had been less urgent mr bourke looked at her sadly over the top of his rimless glasses ill not waste your time asking why it was me you came to do you know how many years ive been in therapy to amend that fall from grace i wouldnt have come to you at all if i knew anyone else to go to youre not alone and id rather have you remember than most of those who do thank god ill soon be an old man julie thought he already was i wish i could help you julie but ive not been hospitable to that kind of visitor for a long time i understand and im sorry i came mr bourke mercifully a customer entered the shop and she could get away she plunged out the door and almost collided with a street person who stepped back to admire the window he had cleaned of a car illegally parked at the curb what could he see she wondered the windows all blacked out she glanced back at the license platecalifornia all that sunshine they wouldnt let in the windows juanita ate ordinarily she loved chinese food but now she could hardly swallow she had a plan it came out of the daydreams she often made up about julie and herself dee she could see was getting nervous she walked back and forth waiting for juanita to finish eating she stopped and threw a lot of clothes that were lying about into one of the suitcases she listened for the elevator she looked at her watch she was waiting to change juanitas hairdo the pompoms had come undone when she tumbled off the table danny didnt want her to look like a geisha girl anyway dee wouldnt tell her what a geisha girl was she knew what an angel was but she didnt feel like one of them either dee came close and looked at the plate starved werent you dee i dont like danny do you the woman gave a surprised laugh not always are you married to him were partners does that answer your question you just live together right right if youve had enough to eat go sit in front of the mirror dee took the plate to the sink and scraped and rinsed it juanita sat on the bench at the dressing table and drew the robe tightly around her she watched dee approach drying her hands on a dish towel why dont you split from him i mean everybody does it my mother and father talk about it all the time stop talking so much and go wash your face you got some dirt on your cheek the dirt was a sore spot juanita saw that her plan wasnt going to work but she had to try anyway she didnt have any other dee what if you and i ran away before he gets back hes mean to you too ill bet he beats up on you right couldnt we go someplace and make a real puppet show dee folded her arms and looked down at her for a long time dont you ever want to see your parents again not really she gave her shoulders a shrug youre a conniving little bitch juanita did you think id fall for a line like that get up and take off the robe no the knife was in the pocket i dont want to take it off please dee came up behind her and tried to wrench the robe from her shoulders juanita clung to the lapels but when she could hold on no longer she wriggled round on the bench and swung at dee with all her might the red hair leaped off the womans head and plopped on the floor like a birds nest juanita jumped for the wig and ran with it to the front of the loft she tried to get through the heavy curtains but dee was too close she threw herself at the girl and brought her to the floor julie was near despair when she got home reggie bauers scenario could be due entirely to his own aberration great but if that were so what to do next once more she checked in with her service a call had come from nuba bradley of the actors forum they had found a sign saying puppet show inside a homeless person was incorporating the sign into his wind shelter a buildingbybuilding search was under way julie called detective russo he confirmed the search and the discovery of a pair of sneakers that could belong to the missing subject you might as well know the worst russo summarized theyre bringing in a squatter from the building across the way he watched two people load something into a station wagon about eight oclock last night well try to improve his memory but all there is so fara black wagon even the windows looked black to him julie phoned kevin bourke the line was busy she had left his place only ten minutes before and had not even taken off her coat she ran back to and up eighth avenue a cabbie pulled alongside her and tapped his horn she signaled that she wanted him but kept on running she could see the black car at the curb outside bourkes shop not a cop in sight not even a meter maid mr bourke stepped out of the shop with the customer who looked at his watch and poked a cautionary finger at bourke he strode to the wagon and pushed the street person out of his way when he drove off the cabbie took over the spot i tried to call you bourke said youd have known what i meant i got a bead on him the cabbie said as julie jumped in the wagon turned left at the stoplight the late afternoon traffic was building on ninth avenue it was at a crawl the wagon stayed near the middle lane the cabbie to be sure the car he followed didnt opt for the lincoln tunnel kept to the fire lane himself julie made a note of the california license number and asked the driver if he couldnt radio a message to the police no maam im a gypsy i dont have that intercom stuff but dont you worry none he aint going to get away but he almost did get away slipping into a tunnel lane and then spurting out of it instead of turning west he ran the light and went free while the westbound traffic closed in ahead of julies cab he sure drives california style the driver said whatre you after him for im pretty sure he helped kidnap an elevenyearold girl the cabbie shot out on the orange light and within four blocks of progressive lights was headlightstobackbumper with the wagon ill ram him if you want me to for gods sake no i want to see where hes going at fourteenth street the wagon made a couple of starts in the wrong direction before taking off down hudson now julie was afraid hed know the cab was following him at bleecker and bethune he came to a full stop at the playground gate keep going julie said but the driver in the wagon rolled down his window and signaled the cabbie stopped alongside him how in hell do i get to houston street from here he pronounced it like a texan follow me the cabbie said and then to julie as he led the way through the greenwich village maze see my point the cabbie crossed houston a oneway street going west at that point and signaled the wagon but the wagon turned east the wrong way the cabbie swore and ran two lights to get back on houston by way of sixth avenue where houston was twoway by then they kept their distance as the wagon slowed down at every intersection the driver looking for his street he turned in at wooster but wooster they discovered when they got there was blocked this side of prince street a movie shooting there so where were the trailers where were the cops the cops loved movies julie overpaid the cabbie and took her chances on foot she knew soho pretty well she soon spotted the black wagon parked tight against a high wire fence midbloek the driver was wriggling across the front seat to get out on the passenger side he went to the back and unloaded a couple of highwattage lamps and a reflector could be they were on rental from mr bourke the man started up the street with them on the opposite side to the crowd julie stayed on the crowds side but at the fringe at last the distant wail of approaching police two things happened at once the man set down the lamps and reflector and ignoring the crowd took out his keys to unlock a door and the crowd let out a collective cry look look julie looked a woman was dancing nude in the thirdfloor picture window not dancing but jumping up and down flailing her arms and not a woman it was juanita julie plunged across the street waving to the girl and calling out juanita some of the crowd moved with and past her interpreting for themselves they caught hold of the man pushed him from one to another and pulled at his clothes the multilocked loft door swung open the redheaded woman took a step into the street then tried to retreat inside the building again when no one else took hold of her julie lunged and grappled her to the ground the crowd loved it the police came finally swinging their nightsticks to disperse the crowd julie and juanita rode home in the chief inspectors car after they had stopped at one police plaza to swear out the necessary complaints there were things juanita would not or could not talk aboutmostly her fear and what shed imagined might happen to her but she liked to tell the action parts especially how when dee had chased and caught her she clung to the front window drapes and brought them down on top of dee and her by the time dee had found her wig juanita was dancing in the window oh yes she insisted she was dancing in time police across the country fleshed out the chronicle of dee and danny a horror story they would arrive in a city sublet quarters recruit local talent film and move on they supplied a flourishing market in underground cassettes the true horror was not only in their corruption of the innocent but in the despair in which they left the corrupted these unfortunates rarely went home again and almost never broke their silence on the street the scar by nancy pickard a winner of the anthony macavity and american mystery awards nancy pickard is a native midwesterner residing in fairway kansas her jenny cain novels including iou bum steer dead crazy generous death say no to murder and marriage is murder have made her one of the fastest rising stars in the mystery field the reason jean williams took her son to the botanic gardens every day they were in wellington new zealand was that her husband was in such a lousy mood that she wanted to get out of the hotel and far away from him im taking zach to the park jean announced on the second morning of lyles sulk lyle had acquired an upper respiratory infection while they were up north in auckland and that accounted for some of his mood but the truth was that coming to new zealand on this vacation was jeans dream not his lyle wanted to visit only australia and it would be another ten days before they flew there new zealand he complained was too expensive and too cold and he hated driving on the wrong side of the road but its so beautiful jean said so is alaska he griped and we wouldnt have to spend a fortune to get there well if he was going to pout jean decided shed take zach and theyd explore on their own there was no point in ruining the trip for all of them so she said with more enthusiasm than she really felt lets go zach i wanna go to a playground zach informed her that was no surprise only four years old zachary wasnt big on museums art galleries and guided tours zach was big on swings and slides and roundyrounds jean felt locked up and closed in and wanted to spend the day outside anyway right mate she said mimicking an australian accent and making her little boy laugh right mate zach shouted and off they went holding hands the main entrance to the famous wellington botanic gardens lay directly across from their hotel but jean followed the advice of a tour book and hired a taxi to drive them to the entrance at the top of the park its a long and beautiful walk down the book said but a long and exhausting walk up in the middle exactly where adults will want to sit down and take a breather theres a charming playground the little ones will love the guidebook was right on all counts two slides zachary squealed when he saw the playground wow go for it sweetpea ill be on that bench under that big tree over there he raced at breakneck speed down the path toward the playground equipment while jean held her breath watching him when he reached the first slide safely without falling to his chubby bare knees jean walked over to the wooden bench and sat down big tree she thought mocking herself she peered up into its branches some botanist id make big green tree maybe its labeled she looked down at its roots where a label did indeed inform her it was a metrosideros umbellata myrtle rata rata was probably the maori word for it she guessed the maoris jean knew from her reading if not from ever actually having seen one were the polynesians who still inhabited new zealand after more than a thousand years she dug out of her purse the paperback history of new zealand she had brought with her to read while zach played opening it she glanced up again through the branches of the myrtle big green tree at the clear and sunny new zealand sky she sighed happily and then looked down and thumbed to the page where she had last stopped reading about the maoris tribe and family were allimportant every aspect of life was bound together and ruled by principles such as tapu sacredness mana spiritual authority and mekutu sorcery mommy look at me mommy zachary waved to her from atop the tallest slide jean who had been thirtyeight years old when she had him her first and only child felt her heart lurch at the sight of him so high but she only smiled and mouthed up at her son wow he waved furiously all wrist action then swooshed down landing with a thump on his bottom instead of on his feet jean watched him decide whether to cry and run back to her or to laugh and run back to the ladder when he laughed she relaxed and returned to her reading the maori wrote captain james cook in his journal have some arts among them which they execute with great judgement sic and unwearied patience look at me mommy im looking she also looked around her at the other mothers and children the women in their sleeveless cotton blouses and their flowered cotton skirts that clung to their slim legs were almost uniformly pretty and blond but it was the new zealand children who took jeans breath away so blond so tanned in this summer month so blueeyed and milkfed and gorgeously healthy looking pakehas from her book jean had learned that was the maori word for the invading europeans maori on the other hand meant normal she decided shed never seen so many beautiful children all in one place and the prettiest one of all was a little blond beauty swinging by herself jean stared unable to take her eyes from the child who looked about zachs age and whose deeply tanned skin dramatically set off the blue of her almond eyes and her curly blond hair when the beauty hopped down from the swing and ran toward the slide where zachary played jean continued to stare angle the little girl named angie turned toward the woman calling her at the sudden sight of the other side of the childs face jean gasped and then tried to hide her shock by coughing and looking quickly away an appalling scar ran down the left side of that exquisite face as the little girl ran toward the woman who had called to her jean glanced at her again not wanting to stare but unable to look away the scar bisected the childs left cheek it started just below the outer edge of her left eye curved under the eyeball then cut back through the middle of the cheek finally curving down and under her chin below the outer edge of her mouth the scar was deep and as startlingly pink as the hibiscus flowers in the park oddly enough jean told lyle that night at dinner the scar didnt detract from her beauty i know this sounds strange but the poignancy of it the i dont know the sadness of it somehow enhanced her beauty at least for me car accident do you think i hope so jean said her husband looked startled what i mean at least that might be an innocent explanation of how she got it oh you mean maybe it was with a sharp nod of her head toward zachary jean stopped lyle from actually saying the words child abuse although that was what she herself feared still wellington wasnt chicago and new zealand wasnt the united states her guidebooks called it a familyoriented country for both pakeha and maori as jean ate her lamb chops and browned potatoes she thought about the woman who had called the girl away from her play who was she to the girl an older mother like jean herself an aunt a babysitter perhaps or maybe even a grandmother at the park the woman the only one there who had looked as old as jean had taken the childs hand and together they had walked away from the playground heading back up the hill toward the top of the park jean had stared after them feeling like weeping she had glanced back toward the slide and was surprised to see that zachary too was staring after the beautiful scarred little girl over dessert she teased you liked her didnt you zach i love her the little boy said solemnly lyles sulk deepened at breakfast the next morning mainly it seemed to jean because he couldnt abide the british custom of serving cooked tomatoes along with the fried eggs and the bacon wasnt real bacon at all he complained it was ham and didnt the new zealand newspapers realize there were other parts of the world besides the south pacific zach wants to go to the park again jean said swings daddy lyle managed a smile for his son and then a rueful version of it for his wife one that told her he knew he was being a gramp but that he couldnt help it have fun he coughed a couple of times im going back to bed this damned hotels so expensive i dont want to miss a minute of it you might feel better if you got out ill feel better when i get out of new zealand but he softened the cynicism by winking at his son the beautiful little girl with the scar was at the park again that day jean watched the child and her own sonthe two outsiderstentatively greet each other and then happily play together im zachary david williams im angela susan jones what happened to your face how come you talk so funny im a united states for american race you to the slide zachary several times jean tried to catch the eye of the woman who accompanied angie but she never succeeded in doing it the woman short stouter older and more solemnlooking than the other mothers kept her hands folded in her lap and her eyes on her charge after a while jean gave up the effort of making a friend for herself and pulled her book on the history of new zealand out of her purse skipping the chapter on maori art in which she wasnt particularly interested she turned quickly past pictures of wood carvings that looked like alaskan totems and thumbed to the chapters about modernday new zealand greek and italian restaurants are enormously popular she was happy that zachary had found a pal it was still an effort not to stare at angies face but jean noticed that the other people in the park rarely did as if they were used to seeing the child there soon lost in photographs of spectacular scenery lulled by the music of her own childs screams and giggles jean nearly forgot about it herself mom she looked up into zachs face im cold mommy well no wonder look at the time ive been lost in my book whered your little friend go angie went home jean smiled tenderly to see the expression of loss in his eyes you have really made a good friend all this long way from our own home havent you come back tomorrow mommy yes i promise and they did return to the park every day they remained in wellington until it was time to leave for the fjords and glaciers of the south island but when they had to say goodbye to angela for the last time zachary and his little friend couldnt seem to grasp that they would never see each other again jean knelt down on the ground beside them and explained over and over that zachary and his mom and dad had to leave and they wouldnt be able to come back to the park but zach said we come tomorrow angie no darling we wont be able to do that yes he shouted at his mother park yes shh zachy heres what well do jean grabbed her purse and took out a scrap of paper and a pen ill write down our name and address and give it to angie so maybe someday she can write to you okay we come to park zach said stubbornly jean gave the scrap of paper to angela who grabbed it and stuffed it into the pocket of her little skirt goodbye angie jean ached to kiss the childs scarred cheek instead she touched her fingers gently to the curly blond hair and then to the other perfect cheek when angie smiled her wide pretty mouth and her haunting almond eyes turned up sweetly at the corners angie from her park bench the woman called angie hugged her friend and then ran off waving and shouting see you see you tomorrow zach zach argued with his mother about anything and everything all the way down the path to the hotel finally his fury turned to tears then he cried so inconsolably and for so long that jean began to worry and to feel grateful they were leaving so the separation of the two little friends wouldnt be any harder than it already was honestly lyle jean whispered to her husband that night in bed zach was asleep and breathing noisily through his tearclogged nose in the single bed across the room from their double youd think this was that maori legend i read about the one where rangi and papa were separated by tane do i know these people lyle whispered back rangi was sky father papa was earth mother and tane was their son and they were all together in the primordial darkness but tane was also the god of the forests and so he had to push his parents away from him in order to create night and day so that his forests could grow the story was that rangi the sky father was so grief stricken at being separated from papa the earth mother that his tears filled her with oceans and lakes so its old rangis fault that we couldnt drive down here from chicago i feel so sorry for zach ill swear trying to explain why he wont ever see angie again is like trying to explain death to a fouryearold he doesnt understand that its permanent and that shes gone forever from his life i need that tane fellow lyle muttered into his pillow to separate me permanently from new zealand before this hotel separates me permanently from my money oh good night you but jean was wrongthe separation wasnt permanent when zachary was ten he received a postcard from angela susan jones in wellington new zealand the front of the card had a photograph of the playground in the botanic gardens and shed circled the tallest slide with a red indelible marker do you remember it said on the back i put your address in a secret place and saved it all these years will you please please please write back to me she had signed it i still love you angle and printed her address zachary wrote back when zachary was twentyfour and in the second year of medical school at the university of chicago he announced to his parents the specialty he intended to pursue ill be a plastic surgeon he said good maybe you can take a few tucks in my wallet his father joked its feeling loose and flabby after putting you through med school but jean who had never before heard her son mention any special interest in plastic surgery was surprised and a little puzzled by his decision during the last year of zacharys medical residency he told lyle and jean that the little girl from wellington was coming to chicago to stay with him for a visit do you remember her mom youve written to angie all these years honey yeah didnt i ever tell you no but i should have guessed a day later she called her son back zach are you hoping to fix angies scar is that why shes coming is that why you decided to be a plastic surgeon sure he said as if it were a foregone conclusion im going to take a look at it and see what i can do does angie know this of course mom we planned this together a long time ago weve always known shed come up here and id become a doctor and wed fix her face zach what caused that scar i dont know he said matteroffactly because angie doesnt know her mother told her it happened when she was a baby before she was adopted she doesnt have any memory of it angies adopted an image flitted through jeans mind a memory of a silent woman of about jeans age sitting alone on a park bench her hands folded in her lap watching the little girl you dont care do you mom of course not honey but as jean hung up the phone from talking to her son she felt chilled and frightened by something she couldnt identify at first and then she realized that it was this obsession there was no other word for it this obsession of his that unnerved her this fixation on a little girl hed met twentyfive years earlier no she corrected herself this obsession of theirs zachs and angies too since they were four years old she exclaimed to lyle so its romantic he said i think its nice you do sure at least its one good thing to come out of that awful trip to new zealand relax but in spite of all of his newly acquired skill and the help of more experienced surgeons zachary was not able entirely to erase angles scar and so at their wedding the guests whispered to one another about the faint disfiguring mark on her left cheek shes beautiful anyway most of them agreed and she was angie was lovely and so was the baby boy that was born to her several years later when justin joneswilliams was six months old angie called jean and lyle to say were going home zachs taking time off we want to go back to wellington to see my family and show off justin will you come too us go too at seventyfive and seventyfour lyle and jean were still quite healthy and active but jean was startled and a little frightened by this invitation could they possibly manage such a trip oh she said stalling as she smiled into the phone you just want us to come along as babysitters of course we do angies laugh was so light and happy that it flooded jean with memories of the first time shed ever heard it making music with her own sons laughter please jean and so she went along too but without lyle this time i hated new zealand he said at the airport no kidding jean murmured and kissed him goodbye through the endless flights from chicago to san francisco from honolulu to auckland and then on down to wellington jean took turns holding justin feeding him playing with him walking him in the aisles cuddling him when he slept and all the while she was filled with a terrible terror what if angie longed to remain with her family what if zachary decided to look for a medical post in new zealand what if the other grandparents wanted their share of the baby what if she had to go home without them once having those awful thoughts somewhere in the air between honolulu and auckland when she was halfnutty with fatigue jean felt hysterical giggles bubble in her throat and wouldnt that just confirm lyles worst opinions of new zealand she buried her lips in the babys neck to hide her trembling mouth the house where angie grew up and where her parents still lived was only a front yard away from the taxi stop where jean and little zach had been dropped off at the botanic gardens well of course jean thought when she saw that it was fate it was always fate rather than amusing her however the thought tired her after two days on airplanes jean felt as if fate was wearing her out the joneses home was a twostory cottage built on a precipitous slope it had a garage at street level but required walking a long flight of stairs down to reach the front door the woman who answered their knock was the same short stout darkhaired woman of jeans age who had accompanied angie to the playground all those years ago she turned out to be miriam jones angies adoptive mother her father was malcolm jones a tall blond bandylegged man who was a retired government worker jean was weary enough to be nonplussed at the sight of the lines around miriams mouth and the age freckles on miriams hands it was one of those moments when jean was caught off guard by the shock of the passing of her own years what a lovely boy miriam and malcolm said of their grandson but neither of them took himor angieinto their arms to welcome them home at her first glimpse of her daughters mended cheek miriam jones murmured well i see they didnt get it all did they and malcolm looked at his soninlaw and then said to his wife thought she was fine as she was didnt we tears sprang to jeans eyes in defense of her son and out of hurt for angie but she also felt a rush of joy of which she was mightily ashamed these were not warm affectionate parents to whom a daughter might long to return fools jean thought and smiled happily at them that evening after miriam served lamb stew cooked carrots and mashed potatoes she offered coffee to the americans along with a meringue and fruit dessert called a pavlova jean accepted a glass of sweet sherry instead and proceeded nearly to drop off to sleep in a rocking chair cradling justin she could barely hold her jetlagged eyes open it was all she could do to pick up snatches of the conversation and even they seemed only dialogue in a funny kind of surrealistic dream while im here dont want to hurt you or father find my birth parents cant imagine why you never knew did we malcolm except what the social welfare people said whats the good really in the us youd write to the now that we have justin i think we ought to know not always good to know why why not jeans eyes flew open at the uncharacteristically sharp sound of her daughterinlaws voice she was disturbed to see that angies face was flushed making her scar more pinkly visible jean tried to shift a bit to ease her stiffness without waking the baby but when the rocking chair creaked loudly drawing the others attention she settled back quietly if uncomfortably what was going on here what had she missed by dozing off why was zachary looking at angie with such a worried expression tell me what you remember angie half pleaded half demanded of her parents if you dont i shall have to make inquiries that will take such time and trouble and all right miriam jones raised both of her hands in an exasperated gesture of surrender but theres so little we can tell you the names of your biological parents were kept secret but i do think the social worker told us you were born in te kapura angie touched her cheek did they tell you about this no the mother looked straightforwardly at her daughter except to say that you had not received any medical care at the time it happened so it had never even been stitched by a doctor when we got you the wound was still raw but healing jean wondered if she only imagined that miriams glance slid away from her daughter for a moment as she added they didnt tell us anything else about you and we didnt ask we were older than most adoptive parents and you were hard to place jean flinched inwardly for angies sake but then her heart warmed to miriam when the other woman looked up at her adopted daughter and said with a formal but moving simplicity we wanted you so we have never regretted our decision to take you we hope you dont regret it either mother angie looked as if she longed to rush to miriams side but her mothers reserve kept the daughter pinned to her chair of course i dont im so grateful angie who was so easily and openly demonstrative with her american family cleared her throat and said awkwardly i love you both malcolm shifted his weight on the sofa well now youd best forget all about it he advised yes its done now isnt it his wife agreed but if they thought they would deflect their daughter and soninlaw with a taste of the truth they misjudged the young couple jean thought they should have known better than to underestimate angles and zachs tenacity when those two became obsessed about something what town did you say angie asked her mother sighed te kapura do you want to go tomorrow zach asked angie yes she turned to her motherinlaw you too jean no jean said feeling they needed time alone ill stay here and babysit with justin jean smiled at her son maybe ill take him to the playground and hell meet his future wife i think we ought to take him with us zach said yes lets his wife said jean saw miriam and malcolm exchange glances they noticed her observing them and for a moment all three grandparents were united in a strange bond that felt to jean like complicity was she voicing a shared fear jean wondered when she said attempting a light tone well do bring our baby back but jean did go because justinwho was spoiled by the airline flights where the adults gave him anything he wanted just to keep him happywailed at being dragged from her arms after she gave him his bottle the next morning youd better come mom zach said please angie pleaded i dont think i can cope with this day and with him too jean pretended to give in gracefully as if she were sacrificing a perfectly lovely day on her own in wellington but shed go with them if they insisted well all right she said happily although she said nothing about it to anyone she felt a sense of relief at going along with them that wasnt altogether connected to her joy at spending the day with her grandson te kapura they learned from a map was twentyfive miles inland north of wellington along winding country roads angie drove as she was the only one of them who was accustomed to the british way while jean sat in the front narrating the trip from the same old paperback history book that shed brought to new zealand the first time and zach played with justin in the back jean finally gave up the reading however when it became impossible to make herself heard over the squeals and giggles angie she said to her daughterinlaw how are you going to go about this search well angie said i suppose well just knock on doors wont we only twentyfour hours back in new zealand and angies accent was already stronger jean noticed she had also retrieved the british habit of turning statements into interrogatories if the towns as tiny as most of these villages are theyll surely remember a baby with this wont they she twitched her own scarred cheek im afraid its a needle in a haystack jean warned but angie pretty persistent angie only smiled you forget new zealand is a very small haystack small enough to examine every straw if we have to jean reached over her seat to pat the baby and sighed and knowing your mother and father justin no doubt theyll do just that zach and angie who had heard her both burst out laughing te kapura was a tiny haystack indeed five little houses along a sunny mountain road nobody was home at the first two at the third one they found a woman with three babies but she was too young and too new to the village to remember but at the fourth house an old man was waiting for them as they walked up to his front door he had the same blond thin bandylegged look as angies father malcolm but there was a furtive amusement in this old mans smile as if he knew a private rather nasty joke youll be looking for someone wont you he said in a wheezy whispery voice three strangers and a baby walking up our road they must be looking for something im looking for my parents angie said and then she told him shed been born here and the year did you live here then i have this scar do you see it so there may have been an accident of some sort do you remember anything at all can you help me to find my birth family the bony old man leaned toward her to examine the scar and a sly look came into his eyes he started to touch it but angie drew back sharply from his finger that only seemed to amuse him more youll be wanting to inquire across the way at the widows house wont you he said thatll be the ticket now wont it he cackled as if at a joke they didnt get angie zach jean and even the baby turned their heads to look at the tiny blue house that stood by itself across the road who lives there zach asked the widow he said whats her name angie asked he didnt reply but only stared openly at angies cheek good day angie murmured to him thank you good day is it he cackled thank me will you well see about that wont we his eerie laughter sent shivers down jeans spine but it made the baby laugh they started walking across the road the more justin laughed the louder the old man cackled and then the more the baby screamed with delight until the air of te kapura was filled with the loud strange sound of their duet angie with a desperate glance implored jean to quiet the baby she tried bouncing him and trying to distract him until he just as suddenly burst into tears oh dear angie said looking near tears herself clearly this return to her native country to her adoptive parents and maybetodayeven to her roots was beginning to take a heavy emotional toll on her she lifted her son from jeans arms and said seemingly as much for herself as for the boy poor baby please please please poor baby its all right mamas here fate jean thought later of course it was fate and of course the widow would open the door to the little blue house just at the moment that angie said those words mamas here the woman standing in the doorway looked even older than the cracked old man across the street she had beautiful silver hair that hung to her waist and plump brown features and the stillest face that jean had ever seen a face that looked as if it had been carved from a native tree and then aged for generations as if by some unspoken accord zach took justin back from angie and he and jean hung back while angie walked slowly and then ever more quickly forward until she was nearly running up to the old woman in the door breathless the lovely young blond pakeha woman stood before the old brown maori one angie lifted her hair off her scarred cheek the old woman raised both of her hands to touch the scar i am te po she said i am your grandmother a beautiful and bored maori girl named te anamarie from the village of te kapura who met a lost and wandering beautiful pakeha boy named joseph a baby girl a tragic accident only dimly remembered in the birthing and joseph the father stole his baby from te anamarie and from her mother te po and the villagers of te kapura never saw the father or the child again that was the haunting story the old woman told he turned me over for adoption angie said my child the old woman said im here angie whispered to her grandmother what was my maori name but the old woman shrugged off the question as if she didnt remember or it didnt matter now please the old grandmother said let me play with my greatgrandson for a while alone let me imagine that you were never taken from us that he will always be able to visit me let me feed him once and change him and play with him let me sing the old maori songs to my greatgrandson this once let me tell him of his ancestors and his gods please my granddaughter give me this small favor to make up for all the tears of all these many years i will tell him of the canoes that brought us of the flax that clothed us and the fish that fed us i will sing to him of maru and tapu and the beginning of time let me tell him of the land we shared of the feasts of the wars even of the eating of the flesh of one another i will tell him of your mother who did not outlive her grief of his grandmother and my mother before us all and her mother before all of his life he will live among pakehas it is the way of the world but for this small moment in neverending time let me sing to him of his other world go in your car and drive i am his greatgrandmother who values him above all others he is my beloved child whom i will never see again and i must have this time alone with my greatgrandson before i die please i ask you in the name of your mother who never held you leave us go did i do the right thing angie asked the others anxiously a few minutes later outside the blue house how could i say no to her of course you couldnt jean assured her no way zach agreed though jean noticed that he kept glancing back at the tiny blue house shes your grandmother after all hell be fine but whatll we do now to kill an hour lets take a walk angie said and let me get used to the wonderful incredible idea of being part maori this is what my parents were afraid id discover as if i could ever be ashamed of it my mother was maori my curly hair the shape of your eyes and im not as fair as most new zealand women you two go on without me jean suddenly said as the young couple started walking down the side of the road ill stay here maybe find a rock to sit upon you need time to be together and i need time to be alone i think jean saw that it relieved her son to hear her say that she would stay behind the old woman was angies blood relative yes but she was still a stranger to them jean waved them off with a kiss across the road the old man was still out on his porch hanging on to a railing and staring across at the little blue house almost as if he were waiting for something to happen he noticed jean and waved her toward him she shook her head and walked in the opposite direction the rock she finally found was a boulder in the ditch beside the road there in the sun she pulled out of her purse the old history book she had been reading aloud to the kids and turned to the section on maori culture a tribal society she read that nearly became extinct in the s following the depredations of the white mans diseases of the introduction of his animals particularly the rabbit that became the scourge of the native agriculture the sun was so warm and jean was seventyfour years old and exhausted by this incredible emotional journey into her daughterinlaws past and all of their hearts she tried mightily to keep her eyes open against the glare wanting to learn more about the maoris out of respect for the old woman and love for angie and justin after near decimation resurgence of maori population and a shift by the younger generation to the urban centers harder on the older generation to whom the loss of their ancient ways was a bitter pill to swallow so sleepy so warm and her eyes were closing besides she remembered vaguely having read this same chapter more than thirty years before she turned the page to a chapter about maori art which she suspected she had skipped the first time effort to renew maori crafts and customs including wood carving a monstrous face stared out at her from the page a face with its huge tongue stuck out a face on which ceremonial lines were deeply etched boo jean said to the scary face and then she laughed to herself the custom of tattooing in which a straightedge blade is used to carve the lines deeper into the face and breasts of women the face and buttocks of men thereby to inject the die more deeply and to give the design more the look of carving than of the tattooing to which western eyes are more accustomed something about that paragraph jean thought read that paragraph again tattooing straightedge blade deep grooves her glance shifted to the carved wooden face on the other page some of the carved linesmeant to represent tattooingstarted below the figures eyes and then curved back bisecting the cheek and running down below the chin jean screamed and leaped to her feet and then the wailing started a loud dirgelike wailing a womans voice coming from the tiny blue house and the old man across the way began to cackle again and to watch jean running down the road from the rock oh but she wasnt young enough she wasnt fortytwo now she was seventyfour and her breath was coming hard and painfully and she was so frightened so frightened and she wanted to scream and scream to cry out for justin to crawl away to crawl down the dirt road to her justin justin baby baby and the old man called to her its the call of mourning for the dead which only the women can sing and she will put on her black dress of mourning he cackled and cackled a crazy old pakeha watching jean stumble down the road toward the tiny blue house te po her name means the endless night before the birth of the gods did you know that did you know that her heart was beating so unmercifully oh dear god she would have a heart attack she would die on this road before she reached the baby and the other old woman the old woman like a carving like a carving like a tattooed carving no jean flung herself into the blue house blinded by the sudden plunge into dimness she began to sob helplessly no no no no no then she could see the old woman te po dressed all in black as the old man had predicted a straightedge knife raised over the naked baby boy who lay crying on the floor jean threw herself at te po both old women fell to the floor near the baby the knife sliced through soft soft skin carving its ancient tattoo in nearly thirty years the myrtle tree metrosideros umbellata rata beside the bench in the playground had grown magnificently hello tree jean murmured to it big green tree seated there in its shade jean watched zachary put justin on his lap at the top of the tallest slide mom zach called out to her watch us im watching they whooshed down from the top of the tallest slide down to the bottom where angie waited with open arms to embrace them both jean smiled and turned her left arm over to expose her wound to the healing warmth of the sun murder without a text by amanda cross carolyn g heilbrun is a professor of english at columbia university and the author of such scholarly books as writing a womans life and hamlets mother and other women but it is as amanda cross author of the very popular kate fansler mysteries that she is known to hundreds of thousands of devoted readers kate debuted in in the last analysis in at the time of professor beatrice sterlings arraignment she had never set foot in a criminal court as a juror a duty she performed regularly at the close of whatever academic year she was called she had always asked to serve in the civil division she felt too far removed from the world of criminals and because of her age and this was true even when she was younger referring as it did more to the times in which she had been born than to the years she had lived too distanced from the ambience of the criminal to judge him it was almost always a him fairly she was in short a woman of tender conscience and unsullied reputation all that was before she was arrested for murder like most middleclass dwellers in manhattan therefore she had never been through the system never been treated like the felon the das office was claiming her to be it is a sad truth that those engaged in activity they know to be criminal shoddy business practices drug dealing protection rackets contract killings have quicker access to the better criminal lawyers those unlikely to be accused of anything more serious than jaywalking often know only the lawyer who made their will or at best some pleasant member of a legal firm as distant from the defense of felons as from the legal intricacies of medieval england beatrice sterlings lawyer was a partner in a corporate law firm long married to a woman who had gone to school with beatrice he had some time ago agreed to make her will as a favor to his wife his usual practice dealt with the mergers or takeovers of large companies he had never even proffered legal advice to someone getting a divorce let alone accused of murder there was not even a member of his firm knowledgeable about how the criminal system worked at the lower end of manhattan next door though it might have been to where their elegant law firm had its being the trouble was until her arraignment neither beatrice nor her sister considered any other lawyer it is always possible that with the best legal advice in the world beatrice would still have been remanded but as it happened she never had any chance of escaping rides to and from rikers island in a bus reinforced with mesh wiring and incarceration in a cell with other women mostly drug dealers and prostitutes by that time beatrice was alternately numb or seized with such rage against the young woman she was supposed to have murdered that her guilt seemed even to her unhappy corporate counsel likely professor beatrice sterling was accused of having murdered a college senior a student in a class beatrice had been teaching at the time the young woman was found bludgeoned to death in her dormitory room the young woman had hated beatrice beatrice had hated the young woman and in fact every young woman in that particular class she would gladly as she had unfortunately mentioned to a few dozen people have watched every one of her students whipped out of town and tarred and feathered as well she had however insisted that she had not committed murder or even laid a finger on the dead girl this counted for little against the evidence of the others in the class who claimed repeatedly and with conviction that beatrice had hated them all and was clearly not only vicious but capable of murder the police carried out a careful investigation putting their most reliable and experienced homicide detectives on the case these a man and a woman had decided that they had a better than even case against the lady professor and since the case might become high profile got an arrest warrant and went to her apartment to arrest her and bring her into the precinct it is possible even at this stage to avoid being sent to jail but not if the charge is murder in the second degree first degree murder is reserved for those who kill policepersons those accused of minor misdemeanors are issued a desk appearance ticket and ordered to appear in court some three or four weeks hence sometimes they do sometimes they dont but such a choice was not offered to beatrice who would certainly have appeared anytime she was ordered to she was allowed one phone call which she made to her sister to ask for a lawyer a wasted call since the sister whose name was cynthia sterling had already called the corporate lawyer husband of beatrices school friend beatrice was told by the woman detective that it could be anywhere from twentyfour to seventytwo hours until her arraignment and that probably no lawyer could get to her until a half hour before that occurred men who go through the system are held during this period in pens behind the courtrooms since there are in the manhattan criminal system no pens for women beatrice was held in a cell in the precinct the system happened at that time to be more than usually backed upand it was usually backed upso she was not taken directly to central booking at one police plaza police headquarters for all the boroughs and central booking for manhattan until two days had passed neither beatrice nor her sister cynthia had ever married and a more unlikely pair to become caught in the criminal system could not easily be imagined as beatrice in jail alternated between numbness and rage weeping and cold anger cynthia came slowly far too slowly as she later accused herself to the conclusion that what she needed was help from someone who understood the criminal system beatrices school friends husband was useless less than useless because he did not know how little he knew a knowledgeable lawyer could not now save beatrice from her present incarceration and all the shame and humiliation connected with it but he or she might be able to offer some worthwhile perhaps even practical advice we all know more people than we at first realize cynthia could have sworn that she knew no one connected with law enforcement or criminal defense even four times removed she forced herself to sit quietly and upright in a chair calming herself in the manner she had read of as recommended for those undertaking meditation in order to lower thenblood pressure she sat with her feet flat on the floor her back straight to allow a direct line from the top of her head to the base of her spine and in this position she repeated as she thought she remembered from her reading a single word any onesyllable word if simple relaxation as opposed to religious experience were the aim would suffice she chose not without some sense of irony the word law faith in law was what above all she needed slowly repeating this word with her eyes closed and her breathing regular she bethought herself as though the word had floated to her from outer space of angela epstein cynthia after continuing her slow breathing and word repetition for a few seconds out of gratitude contemplated the wonders of angela epstein she had come to cynthias office only a week or two ago to say hello could fate were there any such thing have whispered in her ear cynthia was the dean in charge of finances at a large urban college quite different from the elite suburban institution in which beatrice taught in that capacity cynthia had in the past been able to put angela epstein in the way of fellowship aid and angela unlike the greater number of her kind had continued to be grateful finding herself in the area of her old college she had stopped in to greet cynthia to thank her for her past help and to tell cynthia about her present life what angela didit was something in the investment linecynthia could not precisely remember but a sentence of angelas echoed like the voice of a guardian angel in a legend in cynthias postmeditation ears im living with a wonderful guy hes a public defender and he loves what he does its great to live with someone who loves what he does and who does good things for people caught up in new yorks criminal system between us we can afford a loft in manhattan from information cynthia got the number of angela epstein here as it was night she got a message machine she left as passionate a request for angela to call back as she could muster indeed passion quivered in every syllable but if angela and lover had retired at midnight they might not return her call until morning perhaps not until they returned from work the next day cynthia decidedrather she was seized by a determinationto go and visit angela herself at that very moment perhaps she would not get in perhaps she would be mugged in the attempt but with beatrice behind bars any action seemed better than no action she pictured herself banging on the door of their loft until allowed entrance and the chance to plead she dressed hurriedly descended to the street commandeered a taxi and told the driver to take her to the lower east side insisting over his protests that that was indeed where she wanted to go this time of night you gotta be outta your mind it occurred to cynthia even in the midst of her distracted determination that she had not been driven by an oldfashioned cabdriver for a very long time indeed he was american old shaggy and wonderfully soothing i have to go now she said please take me its your funeral literally im telling you i wouldnt be out on the streets myself this time of night except its my nephews cab my nephews having a baby in the hospital with his wife it takes two to have a baby these days i mean to have it not to start it if you see what i mean me i drive only by day i see cynthia said blessing him for beginning to drive hes working his way through law school drives a cab at night these days in this city you dont need to be a lawyer you need to hire one and a doctor too while youre at it i tell him so hes crazy so youre crazy youre not buying drugs i hope cynthia assured him that she was not was meditation like prayer was it answered like prayer first the name had come to her then this wonderful cabdriver could another miracle happen that they would hear her pounding on the door and let her in and listen to her story another miracle happened though not quite that way as she emerged from the taxi a couple approached her they looked at her oddly she was not it was to be assumed a usual type to be seen in this neighborhood at this hour the couple had also emerged from a taxi even now departing dean sterling someone shouted it was angela epstein what on earth are you doing here im looking for you cynthia said suddenly unbelievably tired worn out by all the sudden good fortune that had come her way so ya gonna pay me or ya forgot and left your purse at home cynthia came to her senses apologizing to the cabdriver and the astonished young couple she reached into her purse and gave the cabdriver a large bill for you and your nephew and the baby she said you are wonderful you too he shouted taking off with a screech of tires cynthia had meant to beg him to return but she merely shrugged it was angela epsteins young man upon whom she now turned her full attention you are a public defender you understand the criminal system she said as though he might deny it and turn out to be something wholly useless yes he said taking her arm are you in trouble why dont we go upstairs and talk about it over her head for he was a tall young man he gave angela a quizzical look she made soothing gestures and rushed ahead to open the building door peering about to see that there were no dangerous types lurking im afraid i dont even know your name cynthia said my names leo he said leo fansler whats yours cynthia sterling my sister beatrice sterling is in jail accused of murder and im afraid they wont even let her out on bail that seemed to be the only coherent statement i could get out of the lawyer i called will you help us ill try leo fansler said they got her settled on the couch with a cup of tea and a blanket over her legs because the loft was chilly besides they wanted to do all the easy things they could think of to help her she had always appeared to angela as a woman of such power and efficiency but she now looked the very picture of distraction and disarray ratherleo later said to angelalike the white queen leo had to explain who the white queen was youve read everything angela lovingly accused him not really he answered i just lived for a time with a literary aunt at last cynthia managed to tell leo in answer to his questions with what her sister was charged when she had been arrested whether or not the detectives had had a warrant and whether she had yet been arraigned he tried as gently as possible to keep her from telling him the whole story from the very beginning not yet he said ill find out from your sister ill talk to her ill get the whole story believe me but right now all i want to know is where she is and whats already happened in court cynthia made a noble attempt to be as coherent as possible to her infinite relief leo understood her interpreted her vague answers knew what to do do you know when the arraignment is he asked did they tell you or her probably tomorrow but they cant be sure okay ill be there leo said her lawyer will try for bail at the arraignment but probably wont get it the chances are shell be remanded and well try again we may do better upstairs at the felony arraignment but if she does get bail for a murder charge it may be in the neighborhood of a million dollars can you raise that much there are bondsmen ill raise it cynthia said the lawyer already spoke to me about that the one who doesnt know anything i think he talked about money because thats all he knows anything about well mortgage our apartment its very valuable its worth over a million now though it wasnt when we moved in thirty years ago it takes a while to get a mortgage even a loan leo said more to himself than her im going to call you a taxi now the company will send one if we offer double otherwise they avoid this neighborhood at night you go home and try to get some rest meet me in the public defenders office on centre street across from the courthouse tomorrow morning at nine can you manage that i could take her angela said i could be late to work ill find it cynthia said please youve done enough ill meet you there get off the subway at chambers street then ask someone the way dont take a taxi youll be stuck in traffic for hours ill be there cynthia said poor beatrice ill be there you will let me convince you shes innocent tomorrow or maybe even later the important thing is youve got someone on your side who knows the system thats all you have to think about right now im going to try to get you another lawyer for the trial i know its impossible but try not to worry too much cynthia arrived at the public defenders office at nine oclock she saw no reason to tell leo who came out to the reception desk to meet her that she had set out at seven and wandered around the confusing streets of lower manhattan for at least an hour until a truck driver finally gave her proper directions leo led her off to his office hung up her coat sat her down and tried to tell her what had happened so far where is beatrice now cynthia asked before he began probably on her way in from central booking we havent much time so you must listen i am listening cynthia said drawing together all her powers of attention the time for action had come all right leo said she was arrested and taken to your precinct where pedigree information name address and so on are taken and a warrant check is made that is to see if she is wanted on any other cases i know i know but were talking about the system here not your sister as youll see when we go to court most of those arrested have records and quite a number do not have an address so shes ahead on that count the detectives will have questioned your sister extensively and we can only pray she had the sense not to say anything at all any statement she made upon arrest can and will be read out at her arraignment it all seems very unfair cynthia said taking advantage of people when theyre upset thats exactly the point and even hardened criminals rarely know enough to shut up i dont know how long she was held in the precinctill find outout it was as long as they had to wait before central booking was ready to process more bodies leo ignored the fact that cynthia had closed her eyes and gone white he kept on talking to bring her around her prints were then faxed to albany where they are matched by computer against all other prints in the state the result is a rap sheet which in your sisters case will be encouragingly blank i assume she has no record he looked at cynthia who nodded certainly thats good news for our side when it comes to pleading for bail leo said the reason shes now in jail is because the system was backed up they had to go to the das office for a complaint to be drawn up and because she had to be interviewed by the criminal justice agency leo noticed that cynthia was beginning to look faint hold on he said were almost finished with this part shes got a cja sheetfor criminal justice agency he added as faintness was now joined by bewilderment everyone in court the judge the da your sisters lawyer will use that sheet it gives her years at her address her employment length of employment and so on thats going to help your sister because shes obviously been a responsible member of the community with a good employment record and a steady address were waiting now until all these papers reach the court well try for bail at the arraignment but dont be hopeful on a murder charge like this shell almost certainly be remanded at arraignment will you be at the arraignment arguing for her bail i cant be leo said shes not eligible for legal aid but ive got her a lawyer a woman i went to law school with shes firstrate she has worked for the da she knows what shes doing shes smart and above all shell understand where your sisters coming from shes already gone to the court to be ready to meet with your sister when shes brought in from central booking to the arraignment thats the whole story are you okay for now will they put her in a cell when she gets here no women arent put into pens shell sit on a bench with other women prisoners at the front of the courtroom shell go into a booth there to talk to her lawyer were going over there now youll see the setup will she see me yes but you mustnt try to talk to her or to reach her sally thats her lawyer will tell her about what youve done so far including finding me ready heres your coat lets go dont you need a coat leo shook his head nothing he thought would keep a woman from noticing he didnt wear a coat racing around the courts no man would ever notice it it had something to do with female nurturing angela would say do you think you could walk down six flights he asked because the elevators take forever good were off there was a lot happening at the court cynthia saw the judge the das and men in white shirts with guns who leo said were court officers they carried the papers between the lawyers and the judge when beatrice was brought in front of the judge holding her hands behind her cynthia thought she would weep and never stop she couldnt hear what any of them said except for the da who spoke loud and clear the people are serving statement notice defendant said i didnt kill her i loathed her but i didnt kill her i couldnt kill anyone no other notices cynthia looked with agony at leo never mind not exactly inculpatory its always better to shut up but a protest of innocence is not the worst listen now sallys asking for bail the da asked that she be remandedsent to jail while awaiting trial sallys answering with all due respect your honor the adas position while predictable takes no account of my clients position in the community the case is not strong against my client the major evidence is circumstantial we have every intention of fighting this case my client not only has no record but is a longhonored professor in a wellestablished and wellknown institution of higher education she has been a member of the community and has lived at the same address for many years there can be no question of my clients returning we ask that bail be set sufficient to insure that return but not excessive my client is a woman in her late fifties who is innocent and intends to prove it there was more but cynthia seemed unable any longer to listen leo had said there was little hope for bail at this point she tried to send thought waves of encouragement and support to beatrice but the sight of her back with her hands held together behind her was devastating the judge spoke withcynthia might have felt under other circumstancesadmirable clarity the defendant is remanded adjourned to ap january sixth for grand jury action that was that beatrice was led away and cynthia wept it wont be too long leo said trying to find some words of comfort the law does not allow anyone to be kept more than one hundred fortyfour hours after arrest without an indictment and now she has a lawyer who knows what shes doing and who will with any luck get bail for her after her felony arraignment upstairs you go home and try to be ready to raise it at least a million thats a guess but probably a good one can you get home all right cynthia looked at where beatrice had been but she was gone she saw the booths like confessionals she thought where beatrice might have talked to her lawyer before leo had brought her but leo hurried her out he was already late for another hearing in another court later leo and sally met for lunch in a chinese restaurant on mulberry street sally was not encouraging am i sure she didnt do it no im not sure so what is a jury going to make of her talk about reasonable doubt id have less doubt if i saw the cat licking its lips before an empty birdcage leo my love my treasure take my advice start thinking about a plea in this case shell get eight and a third to twentyfive if shes maxed out on a manslaughter plea with parole after eight and a third otherwise were talking fifteen to life think of jean harris jean harris shot her lover thats more excusable than bludgeoning to death a twentyyearold girl what happened exactly according to the da the girl was found dead in her dormitory room on a saturday night the dormitory was close to empty and no one saw anything except some boy on his way out who saw an old lady and picked professor b out of a lineup a hell of a lot of good her corporate lawyer did her there professor b says she was home sister away at some institutional revel every one of the girls friends has testified that professor b hated her though only slightly more than she hated the other girls in ha seminar something to do with womens studies mores the pity thats all the das got an eyewitness a lack of other suspects and professor bs prints all over the girls notebook even daphnes friends admit she went rather far in goading the old lady but that hardly excuses murder its not as though were dealing with the battered womans syndrome here thats how it is leo well have to plead her out thanks for agreeing to a japanese restaurant leo said i know its not your thing i needed some raw fish brain food also you like the martinis here i think you better have two before i start on my story kate fansler sipped from the one she had already ordered and contemplated leo he had said he wanted advice the question was about what kate considered the role of aunt far superior to that of parent which did not alter the fact that the young made her nervous this advice however turned out not to be about the young it doesnt sound like a very strong case against her kate said when leo had told her the story and consumed several yellowback somethings he went on to eel its not but its the sort of case theyll win theyll bring on all the girls friends and whats on beatrices side a devoted sister and all the stereotypes in the world to tell you she had a fit of frantic jealousy and knocked the girls head in you sound rather involved im always involved thats why im so good at what i do and why its interesting i also know how to get uninvolved at five oclock and go home unlike highclass lawyers so sallys arguments have a certain cogency naturally thats the trouble its a little early to tell but it looks to me like either she cops or as my clients say shell blow trial and get a life term as far as i can see its a dilemma with only one way out find the real killer right up your alley i rather thought kate who had decided on only one martini waved for the waiter and ordered another ive known you so long she said that im not going to exchange debating points we can both take it as said if i wanted to talk with your murderer would i have to go out to rikers island no anyway im pretty sure sally will get bail after the indictment if we have any luck at all with the judge theres every reason not to keep the old gal in jail and sally can be very persuasive in which case you can visit her in the apartment they have just mortgaged to get the bail leo i want one thing perfectly clear as you said dear aunt kate we know the debating points just talk to the elderly sisters together separately and let me know what you decide end of discussion unless of course you decide theyre innocent and i can help i thought it was just one of them it is but cynthias the one i met first so i sort of think of them as a pair ive never met beatrice just caught sight of her with the other women prisoners at the arraignment but i have met cynthia ive heard angela on cynthia and im not ready to believe that cynthias sister could have murdered anyone leo had told kate that for a woman of professor beatrice sterlings background experience of the criminal system would be a nightmare indeed beatrice as she asked kate to call her had the look of someone who has seen horrors they were meeting in the sisters apartment after bail had been granted cynthia now that beatrice was home was clearly taking the tack that a good dose of normality was what was needed and she was providing it with a kind of courageous pretense at cooperation from beatrice that touched kate who allowed a certain amount of desultory chatter to go on while she reviewed the facts in her mind burglary had always been a possibility but it was considered an unlikely one the victims wallet had not been taken though the cash if any had her college id credit cards and a bank card remained pictures that had been in the wallet had been vigorously torn apart and scattered over the body her college friends although they knew the most intimate facts of her life as was usual these days did not know how much money she usually carried or if anything else was missing from her wallet she had been bludgeoned with a tennis award a metal statue of a young woman swinging a racket that had been heavily weighted at the base the assailant had worn gloves what had doomed beatrice was not so much these facts not even the identification by the young man though this was crushing but the record of deep dislike between the victim and the accused that no one not even the accused denied motive is not enough for a conviction but as leo had put it the grounds for reasonable doubt were also given the likely testimony of the victims friends slim kate put down her teacup and began to speak of what faced them you are our last hope cynthia said before kate could begin if that is true kate answered looking directly into the eyes of first one and then the other then you are going to have to put up with my endless questions and with retelling your story until you think even jail would be preferable now lets start at the beginning with a description of this seminar itself how did you come to teach it were these students you had known before what was the subject i want every detail you can think of and then some start at the beginning beatrice took a deep breath and kept her eyes on her hands folded in her lap i didnt know those particular students at all she said and i didnt particularly want to teach that seminar for two reasons she added catching kates why before it was spoken it was in womens studies which i have never taught im a feminist but my field is early christian history and i have not much expertise about contemporary feminist scholarship the seminar was for writing honors theses in womens studies which meant there were no texts in addition the students were all doing subjects in sociology or political science or anthropology and i know little of these fields beyond their relation to my own rather ancient interests i had worked hard and under some unpleasant opposition to help establish womens studies at our college so i had little excuse not to take my turn in directing this seminar in any case there was no one else available there were twelve students all seniors and yes it did occur to me to relate it to the last supper which i mention only because you will then understand what the seminar invoked in me a sigh escaped but beatrice with an encouraging pat from cynthia continued the young are rude today anyone who teaches undergraduates can tell you that they are not so much aggressively rude as inconsiderate as though no perspective but theirs existed the odd part of this is that the most radical students those who talk of little but the poor and the racially oppressed are if anything ruder than the others courtesy being beneath them forgive me if i rant a bit but you wanted to hear all this the point is they hated me on sight and i them well thats an exaggeration but when i tried to suggest what seemed to me minimal scholarly standards they sneered quite literally they sneered i talked this over with the head of womens studies and she admitted that they are known to be an unruly bunch and that they had not wanted me for their seminar but she couldnt do anything except cheer me on they spoke about early feminists like me as though we were a bunch of coopted creeps worst of all they never talked to me or asked me anything they addressed each other turning their backs on me youre a teacher so perhaps this will sound less silly to you than to the police it was the kind of rudeness that is close to rape or murder oh dont think i dont usually run quite successful classes i do students like me of course my students are selfselected theyre interested in the subject which they elect to take but even when i teach a required history survey i do well im not as intimate with the students as some of the younger teachers and i regret that but i grew up in a different time and it seems best to be oneself and not pretend to feelings one doesnt have do you agree kate nodded her agreement the dead girlthey called each other only by their first names and hers was daphne but i remembered her last name which the police found suspicious because it was potterjones and that sounded to me like something out of a drama from the bbcshe was the rudest of the lot and was writing on prostitutes or as they insisted on calling them sexworkers i should add that all their subjects were enormous totally unsuitable to undergraduates and entirely composed of oral history all history all previously published research was lies they would talk to real sexworkers real homeless women real victims of botched abortions that sort of thing when i suggested some academic research they positively snorted daphne said that being a sexworker was exactly like being a secretarythey were equally humiliating jobsbut at least we might try to see that sexworkers got fringe benefits my only private conversation if you can call it thatthey never any of them came to my office hours or consulted me for a minutewas with daphne she had been advised at a seminar to pretend to be a sexworker and try to get into a house so that she might meet some prostitutes she had not surprisingly to me but apparently to her and all the others found it difficult to get prostitutes to talk to her i took her aside at the end of the class and told her i thought that might be rather dangerous she laughed and said she had told her mother who thought it was a great idea i know all this may sound exaggerated or even the wanderings of a demented person but this is i promise you a straightforward rendition of my experience i have spared you some details considering them repetitive no doubt you get the picture it occurred to me when i was in rikers island that perhaps i might now be of some interest to the members of the seminar except of course that they thought i had murdered their friend so i failed to interest them even as an accused murderer cynthia thought i oughtnt to mention that but my view is if knowing it all you cant believe me i might as well plead to manslaughter as my young but clearly smart lawyer urges kate did not break for some minutes the silence that fell upon them she was trying to order her perceptions to analyze her responses could the hate beatrice felt have driven her to violence kate put that thought temporarily on hold tell me about the night of the murder she said you were here the whole time alone is that the whole truth all of it the irony is cynthia tried to persuade me to go with her to the party which she thought might be better than most i almost went but i had papers to correct and in the end i stayed home thereby sacrificing my perfect alibi do you think the moral is always accept invitations when did you last see daphne i last saw them all the day before at the meeting of the seminar i think they had been told that i would give them a grade and that attendance would count the director was probably trying to help me but that of course only increased their resentment which increased mine i dont want to exaggerate but at the same time you should know that this was the worst teaching experience i have ever had were you shocked when that young man picked you out of the lineup at the time yes shocked and horrified but soon after it all began to seem like a kafka novel i wasnt guilty but that didnt matter they would arrange it all so that i was condemned and they had found my fingerprints on daphnes notebook it was like mine and i had picked it up by mistake at the last seminar daphne always sat next to me i never knew why but i supposed because from there as i was at the head of the table she could most readily turn her back to me and address her comrades i had opened her notebook before i saw my mistake ive no doubt i left my fingerprints all over it but that also told against me you might as well hear the worst before i was arrested i would have told you that i was incapable of bludgeoning anyone to death now i think i am quite capable of it some days later kate summoned leo to dinner requesting that he bring along beatrices lawyer they met this time in an italian restaurant kates tolerance for watching leo consume raw fish had its limits sally had clearly come prepared for kates admission that any defense would be quixotic if not fatal im not so sure kate told her theres nothing easy about this case beatrices reaction to this seminar was unquestionably excessive on the other hand had murder not occurred she would probably have forgotten the whole thing by now no doubt her words would seem extreme to anyone who had not labored long in the academic vineyards ill only mention that when beatrice took up teaching she saw respect for the scholar as one of the perks of the job she has in addition risked much and undergone considerable pain as an early feminist to her it seems as though all this has become less than nothing add that to what may well be a period of personal depression and you have this reaction do we also have murder i dont think so and for three reasons first i think the last thing beatrice would do would be to go to that girls room under any pretense whatsoever beatrice claims never to have entered a dormitory and i believe her i know so far nothing counts that much with youkate held up a cautioning hand to sallybut i have two other reasons both of them i think persuasive one i purchased a cheap gray wig donned some rather raggy clothes and wandered into the dorm where beatrice was supposedly spotted im prepared to stand in a line and see if that young man or anyone else picks me out to youth one grayhaired frumpish woman looks very like another doffing my wig donning my usual dress i returned to the dormitory half an hour later needless to say no one recognized me i was there this time to interview daphnes roommate who was also in the seminar she told me how close she and daphne werethey even looked alikeand how devastated she was she it turned out was writing on the homeless and had had almost as much difficulty in interviewing her subjects as had daphne her animus against beatrice was pronounced but that was hardly surprising i asked how her paper was going she had gotten an extension under the circumstances but had in fact found only one homeless woman to interview she told me about her no dont interrupt good pasta isnt it i tried to find this homeless woman and failed but i did get a description i would suggest that when you find her she and some others similarly dressed be put in the lineup with beatrice to let that young man reconsider no that isnt my clincher heres my clincher kate took a sip of wine and sat back for a moment i noticed that daphne had a mastercard an american express card and no visa card now thats perfectly possible not all of us carry every card but i was as you know grasping at straws or at least thinnish reeds nudged by me the police arranged to see every credit card bill that came in after daphnes death that merely seemed like another crazy idea of the lady detective until yesterday the visa bill came in yesterday here it is kate passed it to sally leo looked at it too see anything of interest kate asked yes sally said theres a charge during the days when beatrice was in rikers island two in fact but these charges arent always recorded on the day theyre charged those from supermarkets are kate said ive checked with this particular supermarket which is in a shopping center near the college beatrice never goes there since she lives in the city but its also doubtful that daphne did she was in any case dead at the time of this charge let me be sure i have this right leo said as sally continued to stare at the bill youre saying daphnes roommates homeless interviewee killed daphne tore up the pictures in anger perhaps mistook daphne for her roommate or was too full of rage to care stole the cash and one credit card that she later used to buy food at a supermarket the police will have to find her thats for sure i think if the police put their minds to it theyll find more evidence still what youve got to do sally after youve got the charges against beatrice dismissed is take up the defense of the homeless woman ill pay the legal costs given one of those uppity girls questioning and patronizing her and probably inviting her once or twice to their comfy dormitory room i should think youd get her a suspended sentence at the very least extreme provocation please god she hasnt got previous convictions sally said i doubt it kate said it could well take an undergraduate to send even the most benign homeless person over the edge the trouble with the police she added sanctimoniously is that theyve never tried to teach a class without a text one can do nothing without the proper equipment as they should be the first to understand i have urged beatrice to write a calm letter to the director of womens studies suggesting an entire revamping of the senior thesis seminar they must require texts under the circumstances it seems the least they can do more wine

times ms kellerman and her author husband live in southern california because hed hung around long enough malibu mike wasnt considered a bum but a fixture all of us locals had known him had accustomed ourselves to his stale smell his impromptu orations and wild hand gesticulations malibu preaching from his spota bus bench next to a garbage bin perfect for foraging with a man that weatherbeaten it had been hard to assign him an age but the police had estimated hed been between seventy and ninety when he dieda decent stay on the planet originally theyd thought malibu had died from exposure the winter has been a chilly one a new arctic front eating through the godawful myth that southern california is bathed in continual sunshine winds churned the tides graygreen charcoal clouds blanketed the shoreline the night before last had been cruel but malibu had been protected under layers and layers of clothinga barrier that kept his body insulated from the low of forty degrees malibu had always dressed in layers even when the mercury grazed the hundreddegree mark that fact was driven home when the obituary in the malibu crier announced his weight as id always thought of him as chunky but now i realized it had been the clothes i put down the newspaper and turned up the knob on my kerosene heater rubbing my hands together i looked out the window of my trailer although it was gray rain wasnt part of the forecast and that was good my roof was still pocked with leaks that i was planning to fix today but then the phone rang i didnt recognize the womans voice on the other end but she must have heard about me from someone i knew a long time ago she asked for detective darling former detective i corrected her this is andrea darling who am i talking to a throat cleared she sounded in the range of middleaged to elderly well you dont know me personally i am a friend of greta berstat a pause allowing me to acknowledge recognition she was going to wait a long time greta berstat she repeated you were the detective on her burglary you found the men who had taken her sterling flatware and the candlesticks and the tea set the bell went off and i remembered greta berstat when id been with lapd my primary detail was grand theft auto gretas case had come my way during a brief rotation through burglary greta gave you my phone number i inquired not exactly the woman explained you see im a local resident and i found your name in the malibu directorythe one put out by the chamber of commerce you were listed under investigation right between interior design and jewelers i laughed to myself what can i do for you ms mrs pollack the woman answered deirdre pollack greta was over at my house when i was looking through the phone book when she saw your name her eyes grew wide and myohmy did she sing your praises detective darling i didnt correct her this time glad to have made a fan how can i help you mrs pollack deirdre please deirdre it is whats up deirdre hemmed and hawed finally she said well i have a little bit of a problem i said does this problem have a story behind it im afraid it does perhaps it would be best if we met in person yes perhaps it would be best give me your address i said if youre local i can probably make it down within the hour an hour deirdre said well that would be simply lovely from deirdres living room i had a oneeightydegree view of the coastline the tides ripped relentlessly away at the rocks ninety feet below you could hear the surf even this far up the steady whoosh of water advancing and retreating deirdres estate took up three landscaped acres but the house instead of being centered oil the property was perched on the edge of the bluff shed furnished the place warmlyplants and overstuffed chairs and lots of maritime knickknacks i settled into a chintz wing chair deirdre was positioned opposite me on a loveseat she insisted on making me a cup of coffee and while she did i took a moment to observe her she must have been in her late seventies her face scored with hundreds of wrinkles she was short with a loose turkey wattle under her chin her cheeks were heavily rouged her thin lips painted bright red she had flaming red hair and false eyelashes that hooded blue eyes turned milky from cataracts she had a tentative manner yet her voice was firm and pleasant her smile seemed genuine even if her teeth werent she wore a pink suit a white blouse and orthopedic shoes youre a lot younger than i expected deirdre said handing me a china cup i smiled and sipped im thirtyeight and have been told i look a lot younger but to a woman deirdres age thirtyeight still could be younger than expected are you married detective deirdre asked not at the moment i smiled i was married for fortyseven years deirdre sighed mr pollack passed away six years ago i miss him im sure you do i put my cup down children two a boy and a girl both are doing well they visit quite often thats nice i said so you live by yourself well yes and no she answered i sleep alone but i have daily help one woman for weekdays another for weekends i looked around the house we seemed to be alone and it was ten oclock tuesday morning your helper didnt show up today thats the little problem i wanted to tell you about i took out my notebook and pen we can start now if youre ready well the story involves my helper deirdre said my housekeeper martina cruz thats her name i wrote down the name martinas worked for me for twelve years deirdre said ive become quite dependent on her not just to give me pills and clean up the house but weve become good friends twelve years is a long time to work for someone i agreed thinking twelve years was a long time to do anything deirdre went on martina lives far away from malibu far away from me but she has never missed a day in all those years without calling me first martina is very responsible i respect her and trust her thats why im puzzled even though greta thinks im being naive maybe i am being naive but id rather think better of people than to be so cynical do you think something happened to her i said im not sure deirdre bit her lip ill relate the story and maybe you can offer a suggestion i told her to take her time deirdre said well like many old women ive acquired things over the years i tell my children to take whatever they want but there always seem to be leftover items discards old flower pots used cookware outofdate clothing and shoes and hats my children dont want those kinds of things so if i find something i no longer need i usually give it to martina last week i was cleaning out my closets martina was helping me she sighed i gave her a pile of old clothes to take home i remember it well because i asked her how in the world shed be able to carry all those items on the bus she just laughed and oh how she thanked me such a sweet girl twelve years she worked for me i nodded pen poised at my pad i feel so silly about this deirdre said one of the robes i gave her it was mr pollacks old robe actually i threw out most of his things after he died it was hard for me to look at them i couldnt imagine why i had kept his shredded old robe she looked down at her lap not more than fifteen minutes after martina left i realized why i hadnt given the robe away i kept my diamond ring in one of the pockets i have three different diamond ringstwo of which i keep in a vault but its ridiculous to have rings and always keep them in a vault so this onethe smallest of the threei kept at home wrapped in an old sock and placed in the left pocket of mr pollacks robe i hadnt worn any of my rings in ages and being old i guess it simply slipped my mind i waited until martina arrived home and phoned her just as she walked through her door i told her what i had done and she looked in the pockets of the robe and announced she had the ring i was thrilleddelighted that nothing had happened to it but i was also extremely pleased by martinas honesty she said she would return the ring to me on monday i realize now that i should have called my son and asked him to pick it up right at that moment but i didnt want to insult her i understand do you deirdre said grabbing my hand do you think im foolish for trusting someone who has worked for me for twelve years wonderfully foolish you didnt want to insult her i said using her words exactly deirdre answered by now you must have figured out the problem it is now tuesday i still dont have my diamond and i cant get hold of martina is her phone disconnected i asked no it just rings and rings and no one answers it why dont you just send your son down now because she sighed because i dont want him to think of his mother as an old fool can you go down for me ill pay you for your time i can afford it i shrugged sure wonderful deirdre exclaimed oh thank you so much i gave her my rates and they were fine with her she handed me a piece of paper inked with martinas name address and phone number i didnt know the exact location of the house but i knew the area i thanked her for the information then said deirdre if it looks like martina took off with the ring would you like me to inform the police for you no she said adamantly why not i asked even if martina took the ring i wouldnt want to see her in jail we have too many years together for me to do that you can be my boss anytime i said why deirdre asked do you do housekeeping too i informed her that i was a terrible housekeeper as i left she looked both grateful and confused martina cruz lived on highland avenue south of washingtona street lined by small houses tattooed with graffiti the address on the paper was a woodsided white bungalow with a tar paper roof the front lawnmowed but devoid of shrubswas bisected by a cracked red plaster walkway there was a twostep hop onto a porch whose decking was wet and rotted the screen door was locked but a headsize hole had been cut through the mesh i knocked through the hole but no one answered i turned the knob and to my surprise the door yielded screen and all i called out a hello and when no one answered i walked into the living rooman eightbyten rectangle filled with handmedown furnishings the sofa fabric once gold had faded to dull mustard two mismatched chairs were positioned opposite it there was a scarred dining table off the living room its centerpiece a blackandwhite tv with rabbit ears encircling the table were six folding chairs the kitchen was tiny but the counters were clean the food in the refrigerator still fresh the trash hadnt been taken out in a while it was brimming over with corona beer bottles i went into the sole bedroom a fullsize mattress lay on the floor no closets clothing was neatly arranged in boxessome filled with littlegirl garments others stuffed with adult apparel i quickly sifted through the piles trying to find mr pollacks robe i didnt find itno surprise picking up a corner of the mattress i peered underneath but didnt see anything i poked around a little longer then checked out the backyarda dirt lot holding a rusted swing set and some deflated rubber balls i went around to the front and decided to question the neighbors the house on the immediate left was occupied by a diminutive thickset latina matron she was dressed in a floral print muumuu and her hair was tied in a bun i asked her if shed seen martina lately and she pretended not to understand me my spanish though far from perfect was understandable so it seemed as if we had a little communication gap nothing that couldnt be overcome by a tendollar bill after i gave her the money the woman informed me her name was alicia and she hadnt seen martina martinas husband or their two little girls for a few days but the lights had been on last night loud music booming out of the windows does martina have any relatives i asked alicia in spanish ella tiene una hermana pero no sé a donde vive martina had a sister but alicia didnt know where she lived probing further i found out the sisters nameyolanda flores and i also learned that the little girls went to a small parochial school run by the iglesia evangilica near western avenue i knew the church she was talking about most people think of hispanics as always being catholic but i knew from past work that evangelical christianity had taken a strong foothold in central and south america maybe i could locate martina or the sister yolanda through the church directory i thanked alicia and went on my way the pentecostal church of christ sat on a quiet avenuean aquablue stucco building that looked more like an apartment complex than a house of worship about twentyfive primarygrade children were playing in an outdoor parking lot the perimeters defined by a cyclone fence the kids wore greenandred uniforms and looked like moving christmas tree ornaments i went through the gate dodging racing children and walked into the main sanctuary the chapel wasnt largearound twenty by thirtybut the high ceiling made it feel spacious there were three distinct seating areasthe pentecostal triad married women on the right married men on the left and mixed young singles in the middle the pews faced a stage that held a thronelike chair upholstered in red velvet in front of the throne was a lectern sandwiched between two giant urns sprouting plastic flowers off to the side were several electric guitars and a drum set the name revelacidn taped on the bass drum i heard footsteps from behind and turned around the man looked to be in his early thirties with thick dark straight hair and bright green eyes his face held a hint of aztec warriorbroad nose strong cheekbones and chin dressed in casual clothing he was tall and muscular and i was acutely aware of his male presence i asked him where i might find the pastor and was surprised when he announced that he was the very person id expected someone older i stated my business his eyes never leaving mine as i spoke when i finished he stared at me for a long time before telling me his namepastor alfredo gomez his english was unaccented martinas a good girl gomez said she would never take anything that didnt belong to her some problem probably came up im sure everything will work out and your patrona will get her ring back what kind of problem the pastor shrugged immigration problems i probed another shrug you dont seem concerned by her disappearance he gave me a cryptic smile can you tell me one thing i asked are her children safe i believe theyre in school gomez said oh i brightened did martina bring them in no gomez frowned no she didnt her sister brought them in today but thats not unusual you havent seen martina today gomez shook his head i thought he was telling me the truth but maybe he wasnt maybe the woman was hiding from the ins still after twelve years youd think shed have applied for amnesty and then there was the obvious alternative martina had taken the ring and was hiding out somewhere do you have martinas husbands work number id like to talk with him jose works construction gomez said i have no idea what crew hes on or where he is what about martinas sister yolanda flores i said do you have her phone number the pastor paused im not from the ins i fished around inside my wallet and came up with my private investigators license he glanced at it this doesnt mean anything yeah thats true i put my id back in my purse just trying to gain some trust look pastor my client is really worried about martina she doesnt give a hoot about the ring she specifically told me not to call the police even if martina took the ring gomez stiffened and said martina wouldnt do that okay then help us both out pastor martina might be in some real trouble maybe her sister knows something silently gomez weighed the pros and cons of trusting me i must have looked sincere because he told me to wait a moment then came back with yolandas work number you wont regret this i assured him i hope i dont gomez said i thanked him again taking a final gander at those beautiful green eyes before i slipped out the door i found a pay booth around the corner slipped a quarter in the slot and waited an accented voice whispered hello using my workable spanish i asked for yolanda flores speaking english the woman informed me that she was yolanda in the background i heard the wail of a baby im sorry if this is a bad time i apologized im looking for your sister there was a long pause at the other end of the line quickly i said im not from inmigración i was hired by mrs deirdre pollack to find martina and was given your work number by pastor gomez martina hasnt shown up for work in two days and mrs pollack is worried about her more silence if i hadnt heard the same baby crying i would have thought shed hung up the phone you work for missy deirdre yolanda asked yes i said shes very worried about your sister martina hasnt shown up for work is your sister okay yolandas voice cracked es no good monday en la tarde martina husband call me he tell me she don work for missy deirdre and she have new job he tell me to pick up her girls cause martina work late so i pick up the girls from the school and take them with me later i try to call her shes not home i call and call but no one answers i don talk to josé i don talk to no one i

can go to martinas house tonight yes ill do that i said ill give you my phone number you give me yours if you find out anything call me if i find out something ill call you okay okay we exchanged numbers then said goodbye my next call was to deirdre pollack i told her about my conversation with yolanda deirdre was sure that martina hadnt taken a new job first of all martina would never just leave her flat secondly martina would never leave her children to work as a sleepin housekeeper i wasnt so sure maybe martina had fled with the ring and was lying low in some private home but i kept my thoughts private and told deirdre my intention to check out martinas house tonight she told me to be careful i thanked her and said id watch my step at night martinas neighborhood was the mean streets the sidewalks supporting pimps and prostitutes pushers and buyers every half hour or so the homeboys cruised by in soupedup low riders their ghetto blasters pumping out bodyrattling bass vibrations i was glad i had my colt with me but at the same time i wished it were a browning pump i sat in my truck waiting for some sign of life at martinas place and my patience was rewarded two hours later a ford pickup parked in front of the framed house and out came four darkcomplexioned males dressed nearly identically jeans dark windbreakers zipped up to the neck and hats three of them wore ratty baseball caps the biggest and fattest wore a bright white painters cap bigandfat was shouting and singing i couldnt understand his spanishhis speech was too rapid for my earbut the words i could pick up seemed slurred the other three men were holding sixpacks of beer from the way all of them acted the sixpacks were not their first of the evening they went inside i slipped my gun into my purse and got out of my truck walking up to the door i knocked my luck bigandfat answered up close he was nutmegbrown with fleshy cheeks and thick lips his teeth were rotten and he smelled of sweat and beer im looking for martina cruz i said in spanish bigandfat stared at meat my anglo face he told me in english that she wasnt home can i speak to josé hes no home too i saw him come in it wasnt really a lie more of an educated guess maybe one of the four men was josé bigandfat stared at me then broke into a contemptuous grin i say he no home i heard spanish in the background a male voice calling out the name jose i peered around bigandfats shoulders trying to peek inside but he stepped forward making me back up his expression was becoming increasingly hostile and i always make it a point not to provoke drunk men who outweigh me im going i announced with a smile pasqual someone said a thinner version of bigandfat stepped onto the porch pasqual qué pasó opportunity knocked i took advantage im looking for jose cruz i said as i kept walking backward ive been hired to look for martin the thinner man blanched go away pasqual thundered out go or i kill you i didnt stick around to see if hed make good on his threat the morning paper stated that malibu mike having expired from natural causes was still in deep freeze waiting for a relative to claim his body hed died buried under tiers of clothing his feet wrapped in three pairs of socks stuffed into size twelve mismatched shoes two pairs of gloves had covered his hands and three scarves had been wrapped around his neck a dodgers cap was perched atop a ski hat that cradled malibus head in all those layers there was not one single piece of id to let us know who he really was after all these years i thought he deserved a decent burial and i guess i wasnt the only one who felt that way the locals were taking up a collection to have him cremated maybe a small service tooa few words of remembrance then his ashes would be mixed with the tides i thought malibu might have liked that i took a twenty from my wallet and began to search the trailer for a clean envelope and a stamp i found what i was looking for and was addressing the envelope when yolanda flores called me dey find her she said choking back sobs she dead the police find her in a trash can she beat to death es horrible yolanda im so sorry i really was i wish i could do something for you you wan do somethin for me yolanda said you find out what happen to my sister generally i like to be paid for my services but my mind flashed to little dresses in cardboard boxes i knew what it was like to live without a mother besides i was still fuming over last nights encounter with pasqual ill look into it for you i said there was a silence across the line yolanda i still here she said i surprise you help me no problem thank you she started to cry thank you very much i pay you forget it no i work for you on weekends yolanda i live in a trailer and couldnt find anything if you cleaned up my place forget about paying me lets get back to your sister tell me about jose martina and him get along there was a very long pause yolanda finally said jose no good he and his brothers is pasqual one of joses brothers how you know i told her about my visit with pasqual the night before about bigandfats threat has he ever killed anyone before i don know he drink and fight i don know if he kill anyone when hes drunk did you ever see pasqual beating martina no yolanda said i never see that what about josé another moment of silence yolanda said he slap her mebbe one or two time i tell her to leave him but she say no cause of the girls do you think jose could kill martina yolanda said he slap her when he drink but i don think he would kill her to kill her he wouldnt do it on purpose essackly yolanda would jose kill martina for money no she said firmly hes evangélico a bad bvangélico but not el diablo he wouldnt do it for lots of money no he don kill her for money i said what about pasqual i don think so martina have any enemigosl nunca persona yolanda said no one want to hurt her she like sugar es so terrible she began to cry i didnt want to question her over the phone a facetoface meeting would be better i asked her when was the funeral service tonight en la iglesia a las ocho after the culto funeral we go to cementerio you wan come yes i think that might be best i told her i knew the address of the church and would meet her eight oclock sharp i was unnerved by what i had to do next break the bad news to deirdre pollack the old woman took it relatively well never even asked about the ring when i told her id volunteered to look into martinas death she offered to pay me i told her that wasnt necessary but when she insisted i didnt refuse i got to the church by eight then realized i didnt know yolanda from adam but she picked me out in a snap not a plethora of fivefooteight blond blueeyed salvadoran women yolanda was petite barely five feet and maybe ninety pounds tops she had yards of long brown hairevangelical women dont cut their tressesand big brown eyes moistened with tears she took my hand squeezed it tightly and thanked me for coming the church was filled to capacity the masses adding warmth to the unheated chapel in front of the stage was a table laden with broth hot chocolate and plates of bread yolanda asked me if i wanted anything to eat and i declined we sat in the first row of the married womens section i glanced at the mens area and noticed pasqual with his cronies i asked yolanda to point out jose the man who had come to the door with pasqual the other two men were also brothers josés eyes were swollen and bright red crying or postalcohol intoxication i studied him further hed been stuffed into an illfitting black suit his dark hair slicked back with grease all the brothers wore dark suits jose looked nervous but the others seemed almost jocular pasqual caught me staring and his expression immediately darkened his eyes bearing down on me i felt needles down my spine as he began to rise but luckily the service started and he sank back into his seat pastor gomez came to the dais and spoke about what a wonderful wife and mother martina had been as he talked the women around me began to let out soft muted sobs i did manage to sneak a couple of sidelong glances at the brothers i met up with pasquals dark stare once again when the pastor had finished speaking he gave the audience directions to the cemetery pasqual hadnt forgotten about my presence but i was too quick for him making a beeline for the pastor i managed to snare gomez before pasqual could get to me the fat slob backed off when the pastor pulled me into a corner what happened i asked gomez looked down i wish i knew do the police police the pastor spat they dont care about a dead hispanic girl one less flea in their country i was wearing my work clothes when i got the call this morning id been doing some plumbing and i guess they thought i was a wetback who didnt understand english his eyes held pain they joked about her they said it was a shame to let such a wonderful body go to waste that stinks yes it stinks gomez shook his head so you see i dont expect much from the police im looking into her death gomez stared at me whos paying you to do it not yolanda i said martinas patrona she wants her ring i think she wants justice for martina the pastor blushed from embarrassment i said i would have done it gratis ive got some suspicions i filled him in on my encounter with pasqual gomez thought a moment pasqual drinks even though the church forbids alcohol pasquals not a bad person maybe you made him feel threatened maybe i did ill talk to him gomez said calm him down but i dont think you should come to the cementerio with us nows not the time for accusations i agreed he excused himself as another parishioner approached and suddenly i was alone luckily pasqual had gone somewhere else i met up with yolanda explaining my reason for not going to the cemetery she understood we walked out to the school yard into a cold misty night josé and his brothers had already taken off their ties and replaced their suit jackets with warmer windbreakers pasqual took a deep swig from a bottle inside a paper bag then passed the bag to one of his brothers look at them yolanda said with disgust they no even wait till after the funeral they nothing but cholos es terrible i glanced at josé and his brothers something was bothering me and it took a minute or two before it came to me three of themincluding joséwere wearing old baseball caps pasqual was the only one wearing a painters cap i dont know why but i found that odd then something familiar began to come up from the subconscious and i knew id better start phoning up bus drivers from behind me came a gentle tap on my shoulder i turned around pastor gomez said thank you for coming ms darling i nodded im sorry i never met martina from what ive heard she seemed to be a good person she was gomez bowed his head i appreciate your help and i wish you peace then he turned and walked away id probably never see him again and i felt a little bad about that i tailed josé the next morning he and his brothers were part of a crew framing a house in the hollywood hills i kept watch from a quarter block away my truck partly hidden by the overhanging boughs of a eucalyptus i was trying to figure out how to get jose alone and then i got a big break the roach wagon pulled in and jose was elected by his brothers to pick up lunch i got out of my truck intercepted him as he carried an armful of burritos and stuck my in his side telling him if he said a word id pull the trigger my spanish must have been very clear because he was as mute as dopey after i got him into the cabin of my truck i took the gun out of his ribs and held it in my lap i said what happened to martina i don know youre lying i said you killed her i don kill her jose was shaking hard yo juro i don kill her who did i don know you killed her for the ring didnt you jose as i spoke i saw him shrink martina would never tell you she had the ring she knew you would take it from her but you must have found out you asked her about the ring and she said she didnt have any ring right jose didnt answer i repeated the accusation in españoll but he still didnt respond i went on you didnt know what to do did you jose so you waited and waited and finally monday morning you told your brothers about the ring but by that time martina and the ring had already taken the bus to work all we wan do is talk to her jose insisted nothin was esuppose to happen what wasnt supposed to happen i asked jose opened his mouth then shut it again i continued pasqual has a trucka ford pickup i read him the license number you and your brothers decided to meet up with her a truck can go a lot faster than a bus when the bus made a stop two of you got on it and made martina get off jose shook his head i called the bus company i said the driver remembered you and your brothertwo men making this woman carrying a big bag get off at the stop behind the big garbage bin the driver even asked if she was okay but martina didnt want to get you in trouble and said todo está bieneverything was fine but everything wasnt fine was it tears welled up in josés eyes you tried to force her in the truck but she fought didnt she josé remained mute but you did get her in pasquals truck i said only you forgot something when she fought she must have knocked off pasquals dodgers cap he didnt know it was gone until later did he josé jerked his head up how you know how do i know i have that cap josé not exactly true but close enough now why dont you tell me what happened jose thought a long time then he said it was assident pasqual no mean to hurt her bad just get her to talk she no have ring when we take her off the bus not in her bagsu bolsa ella no tiena niuna bolsa she no have bags she tell us she left ring at home so we took her home but she don fin the ring that make me mad i saw her with ring no good for a wife to lie to husband his eyes filled with rage his nostrils flared no good a wife must always tell husband the truth so you killed her i said jose said pasqual he did it it was assident i shook my head in disgust i sat there in my truck off guard and full of indignation i didnt even hear him until it was too late the drivers door jerked open and the gun flew out of my lap i felt as if id been wrenched from my mothers bosom pasqual dragged me to the ground his face looming over me his complexion florid and furious he drew back his fist and aimed it at my jaw i rolled my head to one side and his hand hit the ground pasqual yelled but not as loud as jose did shouting at his brother to stop then i heard the click of the hammer pasqual heard it too and released me immediately by now a crowd had gathered gun in hand jose looked at me seemed to speak english for my benefit you kill martina jose screamed out to pasqual im going to kill you pasqual looked genuinely confused he spoke in spanish you killed her you little shit you beat her to death when we couldnt find the ring jose looked at me his expression saying do you understand this something in my eye must have told him i did i told him to put the gun down instead he turned his back on me and focused his eyes on pasqual you lie you get drunk you kill martina in spanish pasqual said i tried to stop you you asshole you lie jose said and then he pulled the trigger i charged him before he could squeeze another bullet out of the chamber but the damage had been done pasqual was already dead when the sirens pulled up the two other brothers backed josés story theyd come to confront martina about the ring she told them she had left it at home but when they returned to the house and the ring wasnt around pasqual in his drunken rage heat martina to death and dumped her body in the trash jose will be charged with second degree murder for pasqual and maybe a good lawyerll be able to bargain it down to manslaughter but i remembered a murderous look in joses eyes after hed stated that martina had lied to him if i were the prosecutor id be going after jose with charges of manslaughter on martina murder one on pasqual but thats not how the system works anyway my verdictrightly or wronglywouldnt bring martina back to life i called mrs pollack after it was all over through her tears she wished shed never remembered the ring it wasnt her fault but she still felt responsible there was a small consolation i was pretty sure i knew where the ring was im not too bad at guesseslike the one about pasqual losing his hat in a struggle that simple snapshot in my mind of the brothers at the churchthree with beatup dodgers caps the fourth wearing a new painters cap something off kilter so my hunch had been correct pasqual had once owned a dodgers cap where had it gone same place as mr pollacks robe martina had packed the robe in her bag monday morning when she was forced off the bus by jose and his brothers i pictured her quickly dumping the bag in a garbage bin at the bus stop hoping to retrieve it later she never got that chance as for the ring it was right where i thought it would be among the discards that had shrouded malibu mike the night he died the dodgers cap on malibus head got me thinking in the right direction if malibu had found pasquals cap maybe he found the other bag left behind by martina after all that bin had been his spot good old malibu one of his layers had been a grimy old robe wedged into the corner of its pocket a diamond ring had malibu not died that monday josé might have been a free man today mrs pollack didnt feel right about keeping the ring so she offered it to yolanda flores yolanda was appreciative of such generosity but she refused the gift saying the ring was cursed mrs pollack didnt take offense yolanda was a woman with pride finally after a lot of consideration mrs pollack gave the ring to the burial committee for malibu mike malibu never lived wealthy but he sure went out in high style getting to know you by antonia fraser lady antonia fraser a london resident is the widely heralded author of several bestselling biographies of notable british figures including mary queen of scots royal charles and cromwell to millions of mystery readers she is known as the creator of jemima shore television interviewer and capable detector of criminals ms shore has appeared in more than ten adventures to date including a splash of red the wild island and oxford blood as well as in a collection of stories jemima shores first case the moment the door was shut behind her the man put the security chain across it then he ordered jemima shore to take her clothes off all of her clothes but you can leave your shoes on if you like theyre pretty jemima found that the sheer unreality of the situation prevented her from taking in what he was saying she could hear the words all right the man was standing right beside her his breath on her cheekalthough he was not in fact breathing particularly heavily they were about the same height his eyes very widely set the color of glossy chestnuts were level with hers the mans hair was dark very thick and quite long and shaggy they were so close that she could see one or two silver threads in the dark mass he had a moustache sideburns and soft dark down on his cheeks that was what gave him a mediterranean look his accent however faint but discernible she could not place he wore a clean white tshirt with some kind of logo on it and jeans the broad shoulders and the heavy arms revealed by the contours of the tshirt gave an impression of considerable physical strength in spite of his calm breathing jemima was aware that he was sweating slightly she was carrying a large green chaneltype handbag of quilted leather slung over her shoulder by two gilt chains the man took the bag from her and put it carefully on the kingsize bed that dominated the hotel room the curtains were drawn and the lamp by the bed was lit although it was in fact only eleven oclock in the morning the man repeated his command take off your clothes he added i want to get to know you it was idiotic thought jemima the previous television program she had worked on had actually been about rape during that period she had spoken to at least a dozen victimsof widely differing ageson the subject the words she had heard most frequently went something like this you just dont understand what its like helplessness if its never happened to you until its happened to you naturally she had never sought to argue the point her intention as an investigative television reporter had been to present her evidence as sympathetically but candidly as possible in order to illustrate just that gulf between sufferers and the rest however well intentioned the program about rape had been the last in a series of which the overall title had been twice punished it had concentrated on the tragic social aftereffects of certain crimes helplessness you just dont understand until it happens to you now it seemed jemima was going to find out for herself the truth of those sad despairing cries rather too late for her program ironically enough and she had a feeling she was going to need all the sense of irony or detachment she could hang on to in the present situation and then something more take off your clothes the man said for the third time i want to get to know you he was still not hurried or breathing heavily only the slight perspiration on his upper up betrayed any kind of agitation jemima now guessed him to be moroccan or algerian maybe even turkish his actual use of english was more or less perfect who are you and where is clemency vane i have come to interview clemency vane jemima decided the best course was to ignore the ludicrous frightening command altogether and attempt in some way to gain a mastery of the situation she was glad to find that her own voice was absolutely steady even if she unlike the man himself was panting a little she found that she was also able to manage a small sweet composed smile the one the viewers loved because jemima generally went to demolish the recipient of that sweet smilesome pompous political leader perhapspolitely but totally clemmiehe accented the last syllable just slightlyis not here i have come instead now you will take off your clothes please or he paused as if to consider the situation in a rational manner i could perhaps take them off for you but you would probably prefer to do it yourself the man bent forward and undid the loose drawstring tie at the neck of jemimas creamcolored jersey dress his hands like his shoulders were large and muscular they were covered with dark hair the nails jemima noticed automatically were very clean as if scrubbed and well kept he undid the first pearl button and made as if to touch the second then he drew back this is where i scream thought jemima argument stops here there must be somebody in earshot in this damn barn of a hotel dont touch me please she said aloud and i must tell you that whoever you are my camera crew are due to arrive in this room in exactly one minute they took the next lift oh dont be frightened the man ignored her remark about the camera crew which was in itself a worrying signsince it was in fact quite untrue jemima doubted whether at this precise moment anyone in the world knew exactly where she was not even cherry her faithful pa at megalith television im not going to hurt you he said even if you screamhe had clearly read her mindi shall not hurt you only silence you with this for the first time jemima realized the man was carrying a large white scarf or cloth on his arm but please do not scream there would be no point i think since both the rooms near us are empty and the maid is far away the man hesitated then he led jemima quite gently but firmly in the direction of the large bed they both sat down that brought herpossiblywithin reach of her green handbag but what kind of weapon was a soft quiltedleather handbag however large the man gazed at her earnestly with those wideapart brown eyes i have seen you on television jemima i think youre very beautiful and youre intelligent too i like that very much youll find i really appreciate your intelligence when we get to know each other better women should cultivate their intelligence so as to be of interest to men how can a stupid woman be of any interest to a man education is very important for women in order to help their man now that the man was talking almost rattling along poking his face close to hers talking at manic speed but not attempting otherwise to touch her or her clothing in any way the best plan seemed to be to keep him at it the education of women a bizarre subject to discuss perhaps under the present circumstances but one on which jemima did at least have strong viewsif not precisely these views youre absolutely right she agreed her tone still resolutely equable resisting the temptation to adjust the loose tie and button of her dress on the subject of education would it be a good plan or a very bad planto reintroduce the subject of clemency vane her captorfor such he waseither knew her or knew of her as it was one could indeed fruitfully talk about the education of clemency vane and at some length in view of what had happened to her following that education had the missing clemency been actually present in the hotel room where she promised to be jemima herself would have shot off some pertinent questions on the subject even if she would have recorded the answers in her own welltrained memory and not as yet with a camera crew clemency had asked for her to take no notes and certainly not use a tape recorder at these preliminary interviews and jemima who at this stage was committed to nothing clemency having made all the running herself had nothing to lose by agreeing to her terms clemency vane was a convicted criminal who had recently been released from prison where she had spent something over five years on a charge of drug dealing it was an odd case nobody seemed to know quite where all the money had gone some really large sums had vanished jemima remembered that the original sentence had been for eight years and that clemency had been released for good behavior it had certainly been a strong sentence for a first offender on the other hand the proved details of clemency vanes drug dealing were pretty strong too and it was undeniably dealing no question of a desperate addict merely trying to service her own expensive habit quite apart from the fact that she had pleaded guilty the oddness lay in the hint of political background to it all a hint that mysteriously and totally disappeared when the case came to be tried and the guilty plea was entered what was the country concerned jemima tried to remember red clemmie blue clemmie green clemmie not the latter presumably in view of the drug dealing since none of this had finally been proffered by the defense at her trial temporarily the name of the country eluded her which was ridiculous but she would have reminded herself of all the details of the case beforehand if clemency vanes summons to an interview in the anonymous barn of a west london hotel had not come so peremptorily to her this morning that had altered their previous morelongterm arrangements no it cant wait i thought it could when i spoke to you originally but now it cant santangela that was it santangela one of those little states whose precise connection with drug traffic antidrug traffic measures nationalism and antiimperialism was so difficult to establish even for those who were keenly interested which most britons and jemima was no exception frankly were not that was the hint of political background that had come and then mysteriously gone away after all shortly after clemency vane was imprisoned there was a successful revolution in santangela in any case so the whole situation had changed santangela where exactly was the place latin america central america south america it was ridiculous to be so ignorant about sheer geography which was after all a matter of fact but then that was europecentered britainincluding jemima shorefor you jemima looked at the man again not a moroccan an algerian or a turk then but a santangelino if that was what its nationals were called as she seemed to remember they were more vagueness she ruefully admitted all the same for the first time her gaze was inquisitive not challenging and selfprotective a santangelino somehow connected to clemency vanes drug charge once deemed in some way political then all of a sudden quite apolitical just criminal what she was not yet in any way clear about as yet was exactly how clemency and her drugs fitted into jemimas current series she had been wondering that ever since clemency vane had made the first contact but there seemed plenty of time to find out jemimas new seriesvery much at the planning stagewas tentatively entitled for the love of the cause it concerned the rival claims of public campaigning and private life she had already made various soundings concerning it and had had one or two preliminary interviews with dedicated campaigners of various sortsincluding one with a man who very much against jemimas own beliefs wanted to bring back capital punishment but whose wife opposed him to her irritation she was failing to turn up sufficient numbers of strong women who fitted this particular bill they existed all right but preferred to keep their private lives and or disputes to themselves jemima sympathized of course but remained professionally irritated then clemency vane telephoned out of the blue jemima herself would certainly never have thought of a reformedone hopeddrug dealer in connection with this series yet clemencys original call fielded by cherry indicated that this area of conflict was what she wished to discuss various other calls followed guarded conversations all on the telephone with jemima herself with no direct information offered absolutely pertinent to the program yet a good deal of talk about the principles involved love and duty their rival demands and so forth they had met only once as now in a hotel an anonymous block in a different part of london as now the summons had come suddenly giving jemima little time to prepare i can get away now clemency vane had said please come and jemima to the sound of a few protests about work load from cherry had gone for clemency vanes appearance jemima had been dependent on the numerous newspaper and television news images the strong features particularly the nose which might be described kindly as patrician otherwise as beaky the circular tinted glasses that added a somewhat owlish look and the pretty softening halo of blond curly hair at her trial in fact clemency was darker than jemima had expected or perhaps the blond hair had been allowed to darken in prison as it was her hair also much straighter was scraped back and her face behind the circular tinted glassesthey at least were familiarvirtually devoid of makeup you got the impression of someone deliberately rendering herself unattractive or at least unappealing gone was the feminine softness of the prisoner on trial at the same time clemency was quite tiny physically that along with her cultivatedly plain appearance was another surprise well you never really knew about people from their newspaper photographs did you that was one certain rule even television could be oddly delusive about size and scale it was still a strong face despite the unexpectedly small scale of it all a strong face and a strong character too judging from the evidence yielded up by the trial i need to find out about you clemency had said at this meeting she spoke quite abruptly dragging on her cigarette she had smoked throughout the interview stubbing out each cigarette with fury when it was about halfway finished i need to know if i can trust you her attitude was certainly not conciliatory defiant if anything but she was also nervous as it happens you can trust me jemima was prepared to be patient but i hope you will find that for yourself with time thats the best way im in no hurry about this series weve only just started to research it as a matter of fact for the love of the cause its a fascinating topic but a tricky one i need to get exactly the right people that piece in the paperthe woman spy in love with an israeli ah you saw that i wondered premature im afraid she wont talk to us too much conflict already about what she did for love i too did it for love clemency said interrupting her you could say that i too gave up everything for love she was busy stubbing out yet another of those wretched cigarettes and she did not look at jemima as she spoke you mean there was a man involved jemima spoke tentatively clemencys nervousness was perhaps not surprising under the circumstances but quite marked all the same including this sudden outoftheblue request for a facetoface interview she had no wish to frighten her off at this stage correct there was a man clemency pulled on her cigarette with increasing ferocity and then once again stubbed it out that didnt come out at the trial i didnt want it to i pleaded guilty and that was that is he still involved or rather are you still involved with him you were in prison a long time or is it over is it this loveversusduty question of the woman spy and the israeli you mentioned when you first contacted me is that what we might talk about on the program jemima realized too late that she had posed too many questions too quickly an obstinate closed expression on clemency vanes face warned her of her mistake i dont want to say anything more at the moment you must understand there are problems and clemency declined to explain any further sharply and inexorably that was all jemima was left withuntil the summons this morning so there was a man involved and this was him was jemima now looking at the man for whom clemencyproduct of a privileged education showered with worldly advantages by her doting parents clever enough to achieve university achieve anything she wished in truthhad thrown it all away infatuation was a fascinating subject one womans infatuation was another womans poison take this man very strong physically perhapsshe hoped not to find outand certainly quite handsome this was the man for whom a privileged english girl had wasted five years of her life this santangelino without even a name my name is alberto he said to her with a smilehis first smile and that might be a good sign might it not once again however he had apparently read her thoughtsnot such a good sign that first of all you will take off all these clothes even the shoes now then we will know each other better and perhaps we will love each other alberto put both his big hands on her shoulders as though he were measuring her for something shouldnt we get to know each other first jemima spoke in the most reasonable tone she could muster she must at all costs she knew from studying such things humor him she must not arouse his violence his hostility give him that psychological impetus he needed to transform the situation from polite parleying to physical action it was the feeling of helplessness that was so terrible just as she had been told so many times and perhaps we will love each other for gods sake it wasnt the stripping that mattered jemima had a beautiful body or at least had been assured of it enough times to lack selfconsciousness on the subject she had no particular feeling about nudity and privacy either sunbathing topless or even naked when it seemed right without giving much thought to the subject the exposure of her body however disagreeable the demand in this secret claustrophobic context was not the point but to love each other how near for example was the hotel telephone looking round she saw the telephone was on the far side of the bed her eye then fell on an ashtray with stubs in it that gave her an inspiration it was worth a try even for a dedicated nonsmoker like herself could you let me have a cigarette first please then i promise alberto hesitated finally he said i have no cigarettes jemima gazed again at the stubs halfsmoked in spite of herself she found she was trembling and her voice shook when she spoke she had not realized before how much she had been countingsubconsciouslyon clemencys arrival to interrupt them somehow save her clemency vane was after all the one person in the world who really did know where she was jemima looked at the bathroom door it was closed she had not really thought about it but now the blank door had a sinister look whats happening here is shewait a minuteis she still here is this a plot alberto smiled again jemima her fear rising decided that his smile was not after all a good sign a plot yes you could call it that he said a plot to get to know you you thought it was your plot with your silly program about love and dutyeven an intelligent woman like you with your fine education can be a little silly sometimes but it was not your plot it was our plot clemency knows about this exclaimed jemima well she must how else did you know i was coming listen clemencys here thats what youre saying dont you understand clemency would do anything for me shes my woman the drugs everything prison that was all for me and now she has brought you here for me she set you up for me clemmie told me to come here he went on with that strange horrible exhilaration she laughed yes she laughed at you for thinking that she would take part in your stupid program he was becoming vehement again but apparently unaware of what he was doing as the grip on her arm tightened im a strong man you see the kind of man women love women love to support and help men like me clemency knew that strong man she said you get to know jemima shore then if you want get to know jemima shore if you like because during all those years you never knew anything really about me and now you never will poor alberto you will never know me albertos hand loosened again and his voice too had changed subtly as though he were imitating clemency herself her abrupt rather scornful tones there was a silence between them you will never know me but it was alberto who had said that quoting clemency not jemima it was alberto himself imitating clemency she did do it all for me didnt she he was questioning jemima now there was something pathetic about him despite his fierceness and the strong hands that still held her prisoner but then that temporary glimpse of something pathetic was quite gone alberto started to pull at jemimas clothes the beige jersey dress came off quite easily or would have done so but the very violence of his actions hindered him those scrubbed strong hands seemingly frustrated by his own haste i must not struggle thought jemima desperately i must not even scream i know what to do i must be passive i must endure i must survive otherwise hell kill me now she was in her silk petticoat and the man was panting horribly sweating much more he began to talk gabble women you like this this is what you really want bitches traitors he talked on and then half hissed half shouted at her you im really going to possess in spite of herself jemima lost control the careful passivity went she began to struggle in albertos grip to shout at him even if you killed mehaving raped me was the unspoken phrase for still she did not wish to pronounce the words in spite of everythingeven if you killed me and especially if you killed me you would not get to know me you would not possess me alberto stopped he still held her now they were both sweating panting she said that clemency but before alberto spoke the words jemima knew the truth understood suddenly and clearly what had been implicit all the time what had been done for love once long ago and once only recently alberto she spoke more strongly now release me then let me go into the bathroom no its not right some of the power was waning in him the passion jemima felt it her own increased shes there clemmie he added in a low voice ii want to see her said jemima theres nothing you can do you must let me go in there there may be something i can do alberto shook his head its too late he said listen for gods sake its too late it was already too late when you arrived here now the force she had felt in him was totally extinguished she was in command in command as clemency vane had once beenhad been until the very end i followed her here he went on i knew she was stealing out to come and see you i pleaded with her when i got here i knew she was trying to leave me that she was getting frightened of what i might do to her she found me so violent so demanding after she came out of prison she said sex didnt interest her she never ever wanted to make love with me she said i bored her alberto began to sob convulsively then when i pressed her more she said she never loved me in the first place she did it all for the cause yet i helped her i protected her she wouldnt listen the money was needed then she said so she did what she had to do now it was not santangela was safe and she would tell the world why she did it allnot for me but for the country the cause he sobbed more terribly for love clemencys words came back to her you could say indeed that i gave up everything for love dry wry defiant words but for love of the cause not the man jemima jumped up and alberto did not even try to stop her she pulled on her dress and he made no move to stop that either she went into the little clean white hotel bathroom saw the shower the bright pristine towels on the rail not very big towels and an unremarkable beige colorit was that kind of hotel all the towels were clean and untouched except one that was the towel draped inadequately over the body of clemency vane lying in the bath the towel left her face exposed or perhaps alberto had not wished to cover it certainly he had not closed clemencys eyes they stared at jemima sightless and bulging above the purpled discoloration of her face the mouth and the tongue there was no sign of what alberto had used to strangle herbut the memory of his strong blackhaired welltended wellscrubbedafterward muscular hands came back to her the hands that had held her jemima and tried to know her as in the end they had never known clemency vane i told you it was too late alberto said from the bedroom he had not moved you can go away now he added in a remote voice as though the subject no longer interested him i shant harm you go its nothing to do with you anymore much later back at the megalith office about seven oclock cherry said to jemima with that cheerfulness she maintained even toward the end of the office day where were you this morning there were quite a few calls you left a message saying you were out seeing that woman whats her name the drug runner who did it all for love the persistent one who kept ringing up about the new program but you never left me a number did you see her i saw her said jemima later she would tell cherry of course as she told her everything and later still everyone would probably know but not just now was there anything in it for the program inquired cherry she was so sure she could help us no after all nothing in it for the program ah well said cherry comfortably you never really know about people do you jemima shore agreed a match made in hell by julie smith like marcia muller julie smith is a californiabased writer berkeley and has given us three splendid series detectivesrebecca schwartz a lawyer with clients in deep trouble skip langdon an officer with the new orleans police department and paul mcdonald a mystery writer with considerable personal experience in things criminous the fact that ms smith is a former journalist may help account for the rugged realism of her writing cursing the inventors of pantyhose june weddings and southern tradition skip took the arm of the frecklefaced young usher and walked down the damn aisle her pantyhose swished as her thighs touched the skinny little usher made her feel like a freak he was about five six skip was six feet and junoesque or that was one way to put it other ways were less polite arent you skip langdon i remember you from icebreakers icebreakers seventhgrade subscription dances the kids face at twelve popped into focus rhett buchanannot again the usher giggled and dropped her off they had been a terrible mismatch as junior high dancing partners and they still were as far as skip was concerned she was mismatched with everyone and everything in new orleansmaybe shed come back to work out something who knew it was a weird thing she knew she didnt fit in had never fit in probably never would fit in but when shed decided to become a cop she also knew she had to do it in new orleans she didnt know why it was just that way the success of the exercise had yet to be determined uptown new orleans where skip had grown up despite her daddys mississippi beginnings seemed to her as ingrownand as stiflingas any town in west virginia but it looked as if once youd graduated from mcgehees and pledged kappa you were part of the equation even if you were a sixfoot female cop from marsone of the gang whether you liked it or not frequently she hated itat the moment for instance the congregation stood for the wedding march clouds of clashing floral perfumes engulfed skip and she felt her left shoe begin to rub a blister on her heel the soft gray pumps were new to go with the lilac suit shed probably never wear again the bride darling weezee rounsaville flashed thousands of dollars of wondrous white at her admirers skip knew for a fact from alison gaillard who had made her come to this carnival of silliness in the first place that weezees daddy had practically gone into hock to pay for his little girls cosmetic dentistry the standard straightening wasnt good enough for a future queen of comus but the investment had paid off handsomely mardi gras queens were a dime a dozen marrying aubrey delacroix was a stellar achievement aubrey had dark creole good looks and several million dollars as for the bride darling weezee looked like an anemic angelthe white wispy hair milkwhite skin and pouty lips style of beauty absolutely ethereal in ivory satin if that train were any longer skip thought theyd have to call it the chattanooga choochoo the congregation sat the minister mentioned why they were there to join together etc etc damn there was her egregious brother conrad king of the suppies southern urban pains in the butt this was his sort of thing not hers what was she doing here pleasing alison gaillard that was whatit had become almost a career with her if any of you intoned the minister can show just cause why they may not lawfully be married speak now or else forever hold your peace that part tended to wake skip up she always sat up straighter half wishing for someone to accept the invitation and liven up the proceedings something banged at the rear of the sanctuary before she had time to turn something else banged at the front a figure burst from a door to the left a man dressed in black watch cap on head stocking over face he was holding a metal object at his sidea handgun automatically she reached for her purse her but damn she hadnt brought it it wouldnt fit into the leather envelope alison had talked her into never again never never never shit she ground her teeth in agony watching the man raise the gun i can show just cause the voice came not from him but from the rear of the church the grooms dead the man in black fired fired again skip couldnt tell if aubrey was hit the best man standing next to him lifted off his feet and fell against him knocking him backward blood gushing onto his white shirt over weezees screams the bridesmaids screams all the screams in creole hell the voice from the rear spoke again everyone stay where you are anybody move and i waste the place skip turned the man in the back also was dressed in black also wore a stocking he was pointing an uzi the shooter joined him count to ten said the speaker and they were out the door skip was halfway down the aisle before a round of gunfire tore through the heavy air of the afternoon a warning now the aisle was filling up should she try to get to the victims no a doctor would go maybe half a dozen that was the kind of crowd it was police let me through police she might as well have been reciting hail marys for all the good it did her alison gaillard caught up with her tugged at her elbow she had on a peachcolored dress and straw hat with matching floaty band like some caricature of a southern belle in a rum adtry some of this in your scorpion talk about deadly except the woman in the ad would be running barefoot on a beach instead of teetering on heels that were more like stilts and she wouldnt have tears welling in her chinablues oh skippy not aubrey oh alison not this crap skip thought it but she said get me through this crowd will you alison had the right shoes for it some might have kicked ass alison wasted insteps sailing past the injured skip finally made it outside it was june last chance for a june wedding but the weather was more like august humid and still air you practically had to swim through she felt her suit wilt as she ran to the curb getting there just in time to watch a gray car turn the corner a maverick breeze caught alisons hatband it fluttered artistically nobody ever thought buddy carothers meant it i mean everybody says theyre gon kill their girl friends new flame alison hold it weezee dumped someone for aubrey there was a big scene at the twelfth night revelersdidnt you hear about it skip shook her head the revelers held their ball on the night in question which meant the big scene would have been almost six months earlier plenty of time for tempers to cool buddy said hed kill aubrey on his wedding day who knew he meant it skip heard sirens good someone had thought to call the police but for the moment she was the sole representative thereof she went back inside made her way to the front and found aubrey well standing outside a small crowd shaking their heads around the fallen best man three doctors had tried to help him they told her in that southern way that simultaneously celebrates euphemism and false piety that there was nothing they could do for him they also told her he was aubreys father noel the delacroix patriarch and head of the shipping company the family had founded she called homicide and returned quickly to help the uniformed officers whod be the first to arrive since it was a saturday it was a while before the detectives camewhen they did there was good news and bad news the two who turned up were joe tarantino a prince of a guy in skips book and frank orourke who had personal problems and liked to make skip his personal scapegoat hey skip said joe you a witness hello langdon said frank tried weight watchers yet she gave them her buddy carothers gossip made herself useful taking statements and in the end succeeded in behaving in so puppylike a fashion that joe asked if she wanted to take a ride over to buddys orourke was outraged she cant investigate shes a witness joe only shrugged so maybe she can id the guy buddy lived in half a double shotgun up near carrollton a small gray car parked outside could have been the one skip had seen at the church but buddy didnt answer the door it opened when frank tried it the three looked at each other and shrugged all knowing they shouldnt enter all agreeing they were going to it was clammy and dark inside they built these old places to stay cool no matter how hot it got and the ac was on as well skip shivered there was no one in the living room all was quiet but they found a heavybreathing lump under a sour sheet on the bed beer bottles were everywhere and a halfdrunk bottle of bourbon on the floor hadnt been reclosed the bedroom reeked a lay on a nearby dresser skip sniffed the barrel recently fired stuffed into buddys closet thrown on the floor in a heap were one pair of black jeans one black turtleneck and half a pair of pantyhose all slightly sweatsoaked theyd stink when they dried out but not as much as the rest of the setup skip thought she didnt like the open door the lump didnt move didnt hear a thing or else buddy had taken acting lessons the two men finally shook him awake enough to read him his rights buddys story was that hed been drunk for two days because the woman he loved was getting married he didnt own a or a black outfit hed had a visitor the day before a jehovahs witness maybesomething like that hed opened the door talked to the person and closed it maybe locking it maybe not skip could almost buy the case against him buddy had done the shooting with the accomplice doing the talking because buddys voice was known the accomplice had dropped buddy off and driven away in the gray car buddy had faked the whole drunk number even down to his blood alcohol level just by drinking fast he might have even had a heat on at the church which would explain his poor marksmanship but if he hadnt really been drunkif the binge was a coverthen why leave the evidence lying around and was there some other reason the accomplice had done the talking perhaps because the shooter was a woman it wasnt her problem it was homicides the next thing she knew about it was what the timespicayune said in the morning buddyd been booked what the hell if he was innocent it would come out it just wasnt her problem it had rained that night and the weather was fresher it was am on a beautiful summer day and she had the only walking beat in the city one of the most gorgeous urban walks in the country vcd was her district the vieux carré to other new orleaniansthe french quarter to people from away louis twonose caught her on bourbon just above canal and dragged her over to iberville where no one could see them whereyat skip how you makin it louis she didnt know how old he was fifty maybe or maybe thirtyfive a complex design covered his face pinkyred going to purple on his namesake honker today he wore a bandaid on his forehead probably from a fall he needed dental work and about a barrel of leafy green vegetables and a month at the betty ford cento he spoke in the bronxsounding patois uptown people call yat killer fumes came with the words i heard somepn i thought you could use dey got da wrong man on da church murda what makes you say that a conversation i heard skip waited you interested she shrugged i heard dese two guys settin up da hit what two guys he looked astonished i don know i never seen em before whatd they look like

pictures of white dudes and black dudes and also arrange a lineup with buddy in it louis would be sorry hed ever brought up the subject oh well skip thoughtill give him a few more bucks tomorrow she went back to her district and called joe at pm when her working day was over louis hadnt recognized anyone and joe was sorry but he and frank just couldnt buy louiss storyhe knew skip knew buddy maybe was a friend of his but they thought it was a good bust well hell it was her problem nowlouis twonose might be a drunk and an unreliable one but he had neither the brains nor the initiative to make up a story like that she traded her uniform for the lilac suit and headed for the delacroix place cursing louiss oversized proboscis and the messes he stuck it into the delacroix family lived on audubon place a short ribbon of elegance that had never had a moments competition for the street in its way as glaring an anachronism as new yorks gramercy parkit was a private street with a guard and a gatehouse everyone whod ever curried a moments favor with the delacroix would be there today expressing sympathy and drinking skip knew her name would get her in her father the social climber was family doctor to half the old families in town but once there and asking questions she might get thrown outit had happened before fortunately alison was there nobody was going to mess with skip with her sponsor around alison had been one of her kappa sisters during her brief and unsuccessful tour of sophie newcomb theyd barely spoken then but now that skip was back in town and so delicious an oddity as an officer of the law alison couldnt be stopped she was determined to show skip off or save her soul or maybe make a lady out of her skip couldnt begin to figure it out all she knew was alison was always getting her invited to thingslike weezee rounsavilles weddingand making her go and why was skip such a wimp she couldnt say no to some uptown version of a jewish mother because alison was a truly great source of information not all criminals came from the lower echelons as skip had learned quite early in her career she was the department expert on the uptown crowd and she owed her expertise largely to alison and she admitted grudgingly to her dork of a brother though his payoff was cheaperhe thought she fixed his parking tickets what she really did was pay them herself and put in for informants fees love that suit skippy did buddy confess or anything skip smiled im surprised you dont know gossip goddess quickly so alison wouldnt press her she changed the subject listen i know aubrey and his mother but they might not remember me could you reintroduce me i dont see aubreycome to think of it i dont see weezee either maybe theyre having a private moment of grief her eyebrow went up and so did the corners of her mouth theres clarice over there aubreys mother was tall thin nervous she looked selfabsorbed and unfriendly closer skip saw that her eyes were bright angry dots periods punctuating a face in which all the lines pointed downward skip doubted if shed smiled twice in her life she wondered about the anger in her eyesit could have been there because clarice had just lost her husband because aubrey had taken a few minutes off any number of things skip thought it was simply her habit clarice stared at her as if she were a maggot perhaps a potato bugsomething loathsome you could squash youre don langdons daughter arent you skip nodded i dont know if you know im with the police department now i wonder if we could talk a moment i really dont think that would be appropriate aubrey may still be in danger skip thought fear flickered on her face but maybe it was just calculation frankly i dont see how you people have made an arrest havent you her voice was belligerent we want to be sure we have the right man are you implying my son has enemies he certainly has at least one of course not were just completing our investigation i really think youd better leave could i talk to aubrey first i think youd better just go alison dear would you escort miss langdon but clarice get this woman out of my house so much for skips fantasies of protection as clarice turned away alison only sighed tarantulawoman strikes again sorry you had to be the victim but if its any comfort you wont be the only one she usually gets two or three a day you know what just occurred to me aubrey isnt dead and his dad is well now that is a brilliant deduction maybe shes not a tarantulamaybe shes a black widow alison laughed had him killed for his money whats the point to run away with her lover whod have clarice skips mind was reeling contemplating its own stupidity aubrey might or might not have had enemies but rich powerful noel delacroix was bound to have had dozensperhaps some in his own family she wished she knew who stood to inherit is aubrey an only child why no alison looked as if shed just realized shed been as obtuse as skip theres gina shes about our age where in hell is gina and where was she yesterday who aubreys sister gina comes from regina she pronounced both words with long is isnt it obscene she had a bad drug problem a few years ago dropped out of school i think i havent seen her in years come to think of it none of the delacroix ever mentions her they were nearly at the door now whod know the story on gina cammy i guessthe maid alison snapped her fingers tante adelle and tante taytay greatauntsnoels fathers sisters her head swiveled they were here a while ago the two aunts lived in a house on prytania adelle was a widow and taytay a maiden lady if such females still existed they were napping when skip arrived having probably had a drop or two at their late nephews she was let in by a maid who acted the perfect hostess while the aunts pulled themselves together but skip declined her offer to sit preferring to prowl looking at pictures and books adelle appeared first still smoothing a hastily donned knit skirt over the monobuttock a girdle makes she stood erect had shoulderlength black hair with a white streak in it her mouth was a little tight for skips taste adelle gibert she said youre don langdons daughter arent you once skip had hated to admit it had longed to be known for herself and not her family but that wasnt the way new orleans was made sit down said adelle i hear taytay so did skipunless a rhino was charging lampshades shook as the floor vibrated taytay entered the room with the air of one who owns the parish possibly the state someone used to authority skip had a flash retired schoolteacher she was a large ladygrayhaired deepbosomed grandmotherly wearing shorts that showed varicose veins and a tshirt that couldnt quite do its workshe had a solid line of bust to go with adelles monobutt she looked as if she could give a flying flirt octavia delacroix without further ceremony she plopped into a needlework rocker how can we help i was wondering about aubreys sister adelles eyebrows went up gina gina horrified taytay was placid poor little gina what about her i wondered if you know where she is adelle sat in censorious silence taytay smiled well i guess were gon be awhile something cool miss langdon or should i say officer how about skip and you must call me taytay or tante taytay if you like everyone else does skip felt engulfed by the warmth of her shed probably taught first or second grade let the kids crawl up in her lap ill speak to leeanna when she had left adelle said ginas a very lovely girl miss langdon i cant think where youre going with this taytays heavy step announced her return she said i guess you noticed she wasnt at the wedding you think she could have been one of those black figures thats it isnt it i have to ask thats all well she wasnt shes not even in town ginas estranged from the family her daddy never had a moments time for her after he found out she had a drug problem threw her out of the house when she was eighteen taytay adelle shes gon find out anyway might as well be from somebody that loves gina she turned back to skip who wouldnt take drugs with those two for parents ive met clarice well noel was a delacroix staunch churchmen the whole lot of them a little too staunch skip gathered anyway next thing you know gina got pregnant and he still refused to help her even when the baby was born the good news is she quit using for the babys sake she smiled darlin little heather cutest thing old tante taytay ever saw in her life adelle said we tried to help her but noel found out is she disinherited do people still do that leeanna arrived with a tray of iced tea overhearing she snorted adelles lips drew together again but taytay laughed well its pretty hard in this state but it can be done youre looking at two of the only taytay i beg you adelle for heavens sake everybody knows the story what are you being so silly about skip made her face a polite blank adelle tells it herself at partiesor used to before everyone in new orleans had heard it three times you know about forced heirship skip shook her head mystified well louisianas the only state in the union thats got ityou cant cut a child completely out of the will except in twelve very unusual circumstances or lets say eleven of those and one thats all too usual which is how adelle got caught when she was fifteena minor you seeshe ran away and got married adelle said damn the delacroix and all they stand for hear hear said taytay raising her iced tea glass skip suspected she was still a little high from whatever shed been drinking at the wake they dont even cut their wives in any more than they have to the bulk of noels estate will go to aubrey you watch clarice will get a housethough certainly not the one on audubon placeand just enough to live on and gina will get the fourth required by law a bitter pill for noelshe wouldnt even get that if it werent for us weve schooled the girl very carefully in the art of forced heirshipwere experts she always made sure she contacted him at least once every two yearsif she hadnt she could have been disinherited thats one of the twelve ways and incidentally one of the three our father got us on both of you are disinherited absolutely and all because of our dear brother charles now deceased taytay looked delighted about that you see he was the one who told daddy he could do it and howhe was the lawyer in the family and the one who stood to get the entire estate adelle sniffed thats what daddy wanted anyway the name male chauvinist was invented for delacroix taytay was enjoying herself they got me two ways but one of them was fraudulent a child can be disinherited if he hits a parent daddy and charles claimed i hit daddy when he told adelle he was going to do it to herbut really i only threw a vase anyway after it all happened we never spoke to either of them again not even knowing that was one of the twelve grounds what are the other grounds skip knew as did everyone in louisiana that the states famous napoleonic code was eccentric but this was such a preposterous twist she was fascinated oh what are they adelle addle held her tongue lets see said taytay refusing to ransom a parent is one and accusing a parent of a capital crime except high treason that is because thats your duty my personal favorite is refusing to take care of a parent whos become insane how would you prove he was competent to make a will she turned serious im sorry it isnt funnyim just used to it to get back to our lovely family adelle has a little money from her late husband and i have my pension but weve had to depend on noels good nature for a house to live in adelle snorted his whims you mean clarice bullied noel into giving us this one only because it would have looked bad if wed had to find a hovel somewhere he didnt give it to us adelle he let us live here so thats why we couldnt help gina have her come live with us when she needed it he wouldnt permit it do you have her address adelle thought they shouldnt give it to her but taytay prevailed softly on the way out she apologized for her sisters coldness shes just upset about aubrey the wedding being ruined and all gina lived in baton rouge and worked at a drug abuse counseling center skip caught her at home her eyes red her hair slightly dirty she didnt look as if shed slept skip made sympathy sounds gina blew her nose im crying because i couldnt go to my own fathers house today the day after he died you were forbidden to no i couldnt bring myself to mamas catholic too they both thought i was a sinner that couldnt be forgiven and a social embarrassment the apartment was tiny furnished with goodwill bargains every surface covered with the toys clothes and supplies of a fiveyearold heather herself was watching an old blackandwhite tv there being barely any room in the place to do anything else i gather you werent at the wedding either why not just defy your parents and go that started a fresh flood of tears aubrey didnt invite me she shrugged he did what daddy wanted skip was trying to figure out what could make a man like noel ticka man so heartless so rigid so out of sync with contemporary mores when gina said its a delacroix tradition hating women there was a bitter edge to her voice they even gave me a name that sounds like vagina generic female here dont bother naming it have you met my mother yes my grandmother was just like her their mothers are bitches they marry more bitches and they keep on hating women but theyre so mired in catholic tradition they never admit to themselves what their wives are to them all women are either mary or mary magdalene and mary is never a bitch so they spend their lives getting pushed around by these female storm troopers and pretend theyre in control by being tyrants about money you seem to have thought this out you would have too in my shoes i dont think you could possibly know how pathological my family is skip thought of her own family i dont know look at this gina handed her a letter dear regina this is to let you know that on july the louisiana law on forced heirship will change on that day and afterward children twentythree and over can be disinherited enclosed please find a copy of the will i will sign that day my god my daddy was a real sweetheart wasnt he it wasnt enough to do it he had to make damn sure i knew about it he was killed june i guess that makes me an heiress huh now i can move to a real house and go back to school she blew her nose aint life grand her lips moved a little to no apparent end skip thought shed tried a smile but just couldnt manage it gina i have to ask you where were you saturday afternoon drowning my sorrows you and buddy carothers i was with a girl friend alicia ravenel and we were in a bar called the glass menagerie i think quite a few people would remember i was making a spectacle of myself skip stayed late in baton rouge visiting the glass menagerie drinks in glasses animalshaped and calling on alicia ravenel the alibi checked out the case against buddy carothers was looking better but if he did it where did the black man come in had he been the man with the uzi he hadnt had a black accent and louis twonose had been very clear about it the black man had been the one doing the hiring and hed hired two men the one in the bar and his partner whod cover the congregation had buddy sent a friend to hire a thug for him had gina skip called all the numbers in buddys address book and even consulted her least favorite source her brother conrad who knew everyone even a little bit socially important no one had ever seen buddy speak with any black person who wasnt a servant or a bellman the reason they could be so sure was he was a notorious racist as always in these situations skip wished shed gotten it together and learned to meditate she felt the need to focus her mind she couldnt see how noels timely death considering his letter could be a coincidence but if gina had had him killed why show skip the letter and who was the black man she knew only two black people involved with the delacroix familynoels maid cammy and leeanna but there must be others she phoned alicia ravenel ginas boss and friends of ginas whose names shed gotten from alicia she also called alison who made a few calls of her own that afternoon she found herself visiting a man named raybon broussard after that she dropped in on the aunts this time they both wore white slacks adelles elegant taytays the sloppy kind with drawstring waist adelle had pulled her hair back against the heat she looked younger and a little vulnerable taytay worked on a needlepoint pillow i talked to raybon today taytay looked up in alarm oh no leeanna adelle said ill send her to the store when she returned skip saw that her color had gone raybon was leeannas son hes sweating said skip and not because his acs on the blink hes one of the most scared young men ive seen lately has something gone wrong with his parole i dont think i can take it if that boy has to go back to prison taytay looked ready to cry theres no harm in raybon no harm at all armed robbery he was just a baby why hes still a babywont be twentyone till january adelle said taytay never forgets his birthday i sometimes think she loves raybon better than gina thats not true adelle and you know it i love all my children just the same skip was sure shed been right about taytayshe had to have been a teacher he must love you too she said hes trying really hard to protect you but its not going to work i have the name of the man he sent you to she didnt though not yet raybon had been a challenge he was frightened all right which was how she knew she was on the right track but fear didnt loosen his tongue any shed had to tell him taytay had already confessed to get him talkingand then hed only said one thing and it wasnt enough for an arrest but she was hoping hard what on gods earth are you talking about he says it wasnt you who called him adelle started to speak i had to tell him it was for taytay skip stopped her not yet i have to mirandize you adelle nodded stoically her color was better shed probably gotten a jolt of adrenaline whats happening taytay was panicked looked as if her world was falling apart and it was thought skip feeling for her when shed read adelle her rights skip asked if she wanted to waive them oh hell yes i want to talk and i dont want some stuffy lawyer in here clamming me up she might be a murderer but skip liked her spirit she saw now that adelle was no stifflipped sunday school teacher shed seemed uptight because shed been under the biggest stress of her life adelle no hush up taytay dont you see what shes doing shes blackmailing me if i talk raybon gets off skip said i cant make any deals but this way you wont take him to some horrible interrogation room and badger him will you because im going to give you what you need and tell you flatout that he didnt have the least idea what it was all about he just gave me a name thats all wouldnt take a penny for it thought he was doing a favor for taytay thats how i got him to cooperate she spoke directly to skip avoiding her sisters eye gina called in tears about the letterabsolutely hysterical poor little baby anyway taytay wasnt home and i made up my mind not to tell her about it i just made my plans i told raybon taytay had a problem and i wanted to solve it for her i asked him to give me the name of a very bad man someone from prison i think he thought i wanted to scare somebody because he didnt give me a murderer but his friend knew some italians i had to pay him five thousand dollars for the introduction the italians cost twenty apiece did you know it was so cheap to hire hit men thats all the money you have in the world skip noticed taytay had changed the subject unable yet to face what had happened gina will help me i know she will she was getting a glazed look now but taytay was snapping back to reality taking it in adelle murder you did murder poor little heathermy heart just sank every time i saw that child in that tiny little crackerbox her bland face wore a look skip had seen in court a judge pronouncing sentence somebody had to get this family back on track but the weddingwhy poor aubreys wedding for the first time adelle smiled i thought we needed a ritual murder horror replaced the shock on taytays gentle face she spoke as if explaining it to herself youre crazy adelle youre really mad thats right little sister im really mad but not crazymad she paused and took a breath for maximum volume im furious skip thought little heather probably heard her aunt up in baton rouge theft of the poet by barbara wilson barbara wilson is the author of several novels and a collection of short stories in addition to the pam nilsen series murder in the collective sisters of the road and the dog collar murders she has recently published gaudi afternoon the first mystery to feature londonbased translator cassandra reilly barbara wilson is the cofounder of seal press in seattle it started gradually here and there on london streets new blue plaques that might have been placed there by the authorities if the authorities had been reasonably literate and unreasonably feminist began to appear at hyde park gate the enamel plaque stating that leslie stephen the noted biographer had lived here was joined by a new metal plate much the same size and much the same color which informed the passerby that this was where writer virginia woolf and painter vanessa bell had spent their childhoods over in primrose hill the plaque that read that yeats had once been resident in this house was joined by a shiny new medallion gravely informing us that sylvia plath had written the poems in ariel here before committing suicide in above the blue plaque at hallam street the birthplace of dante gabriel rossetti another one appeared to emphasize that poet christina rossetti had lived here as well the plate at maresfield gardens which recorded that sigmund freud had passed the last year of his life here was joined by a new one telling us that anna freud had passed fortytwo years at this address a medallion to jane carlyle letter writer joined that of her famous husband thomas at cheyne row and a plaque telling us about fanny burney author of evelina and other novels appeared above that describing sir isaac newtons dates and accomplishments on the outside of a library in st martins street the appearance of these blue plaques was at first noted sympathetically if condescendingly by the liberal newspapers and a certain brave editor at the guardian was bold enough to suggest that it was high time more women writers who had clearly achieved a certain stature be recognized the editor thus managed to give tacit approval to the choice of authors awarded blue plaques and to suggest that the perpetrators had gone quite far enough we wouldnt want blue plaques on every house in london after all but the plaquing continued heedless of the guardians pointed admonition to the growing excitement of many and the consternation of quite a few who was responsible and how long would it go on would the authorities leave the plaques up or bother to remove them apparently they had been manufactured out of a lighter metal than the original plaques but instead of being bolted to the buildings they had been affixed with super glue some residents of the buildings were delighted other inhabitants in a conservative rage defaced the medallions immediately the next blue plaques to go up were placed on houses previously unrecognized as having been the homes of women worth remembering and honoring a plaque appeared outside the house in maida vale where authors winifred holtby and vera brittain had shared a flat for several years a similar plaque commemorating the relationship of poets hd and bryher appeared in knightsbridge mary seacole a victorian black woman who had traveled widely as a businesswoman gold prospector and nurse in the crimean war and who had written an autobiography about her life was honored on the wall of upper george street off portman square as was constance markievicz many times imprisoned irish republican who was the first woman elected as a member of the british parliament though she refused to take her seat in protest over the irish situation and who was born in westminster on buckingham street of course my friends in the progressive backwater of east dulwich were delighted when louise michel the french revolutionary socialist and communard was honored with a plaque and those of us who are interested in printing and publishing were quite thrilled when a plaque appeared at great coram street home in the s to victoria printers which emily faithfull set up in order to train women as printers and where she published britains first feminist periodical the list could go on and on and it did you would have thought the authorities would be pleased new tourists flocked to obscure neighborhoods guidebooks to the new sites proliferated tours were organized handwritten notes appeared on walls suggesting plaques letters to the editor demanded to know why certain women hadnt been honored other letters criticized the manner in which only bourgeois individuals were elevated and suggested monuments to large historical events such as epping forest where boudicca the leader of the celts fought her last battle with the romans in ad or the parliament street post office where emily wilding davison set fire to a letter box in the first suffragist attempt at arson to draw attention to the struggle for womens rights one enterprising and radical artist even sent the newspapers a sketch for a monument of glass to be placed on a busy shopping street in knightsbridge to commemorate the day of march when a hundred suffragists walked down the street smashing every plate glass window they passed the tory and gutter papers were naturally appalled by such ideas and called for thatcher whom no one had thought to plaquate to put a stop to the desecration of london buildings and streets vigilant foot patrols were called for and severe penalties for vandalization were demanded this then was the atmosphere in which the news suddenly surfaced that the grave of a famous woman poet had been opened and her bones had gone missing as it happened the small village in dorset where the poet had been buried was also the home of a friend of mine andrea addlepoot once a writer of very successful feminist mysteries back when feminist mysteries had been popular and now an obsessive gardener and letter writer it was she who first described the theft to me in detail the theft that the london papers had hysterically headlined poets grave vandalized my dear cassandra by now you have no doubt heard that francine crofts putter is no longer resting eternally in the small churchyard opposite my humble country cottage my first thought heretically was that i would not miss hermeaning that i would not miss the hordes of visitors primarily women primarily young american women who had made the pilgrimage to her grave since her death i would not miss how they trampled over my tender flowers nor pelted me with questions as if i had known the woman as if anyone in the village had known the woman and yet it is still quite shocking and everyone here is in an uproar over it you of course realize that the theft is not an isolated action but only the latest in a series of terrorist acts i quote peter putter the late poets husband perpetrated on the grave and most likely not totally unrelated to the unchecked rememorializing of london and surrounding areas discreet plaquing is one thing but i really could not condone the defacing of jane austens grave in winchester cathedral surely in memory of jane austen youngest daughter of the late reverend george austen formerly rector of steventon says everything necessary there was no reason on earth to stencil onto the stone the words author of pride and prejudice and other novels these terrorist acts consisted of the last name putter in raised lead lettering being three times chipped off from the headstone the headstone was repaired twice but the third time mr putter removed the headstone indefinitely from the grave site that was over a year ago and it has not been reerected which despite what you might think has not made my life any easier i cannot count the number of times that sincere young women have approached me as i stood pruning my roses and beseeched me most often in fiat american accents to show them the unmarked grave of francine crofts never francine putter or francine crofts putter for francine crofts was her name you know even if at one time she had been rather pathetically eager to be married to the upcoming young writer peter putter and had put aside her own poetry to type his manuscripts francine crofts is the name the world knows her by and of course thats what putter cannot stand i know him you must realize although his boyhood was long long over by the time i moved here after the enormous financial success you recall of murder at greenham common his parents margery and andrew and sister jane fitzwaterthe widow who runs the local tearoom and who has a penchant for telling anyone who will listen what a shrew francine was and what a saint dear peterstill live in the large house down the road that peter bought for them this little village represents roots for peter and sometimes youll see him with one or another young girlfriend down at the pub getting pissed when hes really in his cups hell sometimes go all weepy telling everyone what a raw deal hes getting from the world about francine it wasnt his fault she died he really did love her she wasnt planning to get a divorce they were soul mates its enough to make you vomit everybody knows what a cad he was how it was his desertion of her that inspired francines greatest poetry and the realization that he wasnt coming back that led to her death its hard to see now what she saw in putter but after all he was younger then and so was she so were we all but cassandra im rambling you know all this im sure and im equally sure you take as large an interest in the disappearance of francines bones as i do why not think about paying me a visit for a few days bring your translating work ill cook you marvelous meals and together well seefor old times sakewhether we can get to the bottom of this when i arrived at andreas cottage by car the next day she was out in her front garden chatting with journalists as usual she was wearing jeans and tall boots and a safari hat in spite of her disdain for americans she was secretly flattered when anyone mentioned that she rangy and weathered looked a bit like the marlboro man at the moment she was busy giving quotes to the journos in her usual deep measured tones peter putter is an insecure insignificant man and writer who has never produced anything of literary value himself and could not stand the idea that his wife was a genius he drove her to oh hello cassandra she broke off and took my bag waving goodbye to the newspaper hacks and dont forget its addlepootnot pate author of numerous thrillers come in come in she opened the low front door and stooped to show me in oh the media rats we love to hate them i suspected that andrea loved them more than she hated them it was only since her career had slipped that shed begun to speak of them in disparaging terms during the years that the feminist thriller had been in fashion andreas name had shone brighter than anyones if jane austen were alive today and writing detective stories she would be named andrea addlepoot gushed one reviewer all of her early booksmurder at greenham common murder at the small feminist press murder at the antiapartheid demonstrationhad topped the city limits alternative best seller lists and she was regularly interviewed on television and in print about the exciting new phenomenon of the feminist detective alas any new phenomenon is likely to be an old phenomenon soon and thus no phenomenon at all it never occurred to andrea that the feminist detective was a bit of a fad and that like all fads in a consumer culture its shelf life was limited oh andrea and her detective london pi philippa fanthorpe had tried they had taken on new social topicsthe animal rights movement the leaky nuclear plants on the irish seabut the reviews were no longer so positive too rhetorical too issueoriented too strident the critics wrote wearily and andrea addlepoots fortunes declined in the bookstores feminist mysteries were replaced with the latest bestselling genre womens erotica and andrea who had never written a sex scene in her life retired for good to dorset cassandra its shocking how this is being reported she announced as we sat down in the tiny parlor she took off her safari hat and her gray curls bristled peter putter is here giving interviews to the bbc news every few hours and now the americans have gotten in on it cable news network is here and ive heard diane sawyer is arriving tomorrow well francine crofts was born in america i said and thats where a lot of her papers are arent they yes everything that putter couldnt get his hands on is there i read somewhere that he destroyed her last journal and the manuscript of a novel she was working on oh yes its true he couldnt stand the idea of anything bad about himself coming to the publics attention any chance he could have removed the bones himself i asked andrea nodded oh i would say theres a very good chance indeed all this rowing over her headstone has not been good publicity for our peter putter it puts him in a bad light it keeps bringing back the old allegations that he was responsible in great measure for francines death its quite possible i think that he began to read about the appearance of all these new blue plaques and thought to himself right ill get rid of the grave entirely blame it on the radical feminists and therell be an end to it im sure hes sorry he ever thought to bury the body here in the first place and to put putter at the end of her name but he cant back down now so the only solution was to arrange for the bones to disappear i dont suppose we could go over to the graveyard and have a look andrea peered out her smallpaned front window well go when its quieter lets have our tea first we had our tea lavish with devonshire cream and fresh scones and then andrea went off for a brief liedown and i left to my own resources in the parlor went to the bookcase and found the volume of croftss most celebrated poems they struck me with the same power now as they had when i read them twenty years ago especially the poems written at the very end when translucent from rage and hunger francine had struck out repeatedly at the ties that bound her to this earth and that man even as she was starving herself to death in the most barbaric and selfpunishing way she still could write like an avenging angel around five when the autumn mists had drifted down over the small village in the valley andrea roused herself and we walked across the road to the tiny churchyard of st stephens the small church was from the thirteenth century and no longer in use its front door was chained and padlocked the churchyard was desolate as well under the purple twilight sky and covered with leaves that were damp with rain it was enclosed on all sides by a low stone wall and shielded by enormous oaks we went in through the creaking gate the ground was trampled with footprints and many of the graves were untended i could barely see my feet in front of me through the cold wet mist but andrea led the way unerringly to a ropedoff hole there had been no effort to cover the grave back over and the dirt was heaped hastily by the side it had the effect of eerie loneliness and ruthless desecration and even andrea creator of the coldblooded philippa fanthorpe seemed disturbed you can see they didnt have much time she murmured suddenly we heard a noise it was the gate creaking without a word andrea pulled me away from the grave and around the side of the church someone was approaching the site of the theft a woman with a scarf heavy coat and wellington boots she stood silently by the open grave a moment and then we heard her begin to cry ten minutes later we were warming ourselves in the local pub the kings head a few journos were there soaking up the local color the color in this case being the golden yellow of lager andrea bought me a half of bitter and a pint of old peculiar for herself and we seated ourselves in a corner by the fireplace the woman in the churchyard had left as quickly as she had come we were debating who she could be when the door to the pub opened and a paunchy man in his fifties came in wearing a tweed jacket and carrying a walking stick thats how he dresses in the country andrea muttered sodding old fart it was putter i assumed and i had to admit that there was a certain cragginess to his face that must have once been appealing if i had been a young american working at a publishing house as a secretary in the early sixties perhaps i too would have been flattered if chatup and windowss rising male author had shown an interest in me and asked me if id like to do a spot of typing for him putters first novel the man in the looking glass had been published to enormous acclaim and he was working on his second an authentic workingclass writer his father was actually a bank clerk but he kept that quietwho would have guessed that this voice of the masses would eventually degenerate into a very minor novelist known mostly for his acerbic reviews of other peoples work in the sunday telegraph poor francine when she was deserted by her young husband with just one book of poetry published to very little acclaim at all she had no idea that within two years their roles would have completely reversed peter putter would in the years to come be most famous for having been francine croftss husband i wish it were possible to have a certain sympathy for him andrea said gruffly downing the last of her old peculiar after all we both know what it is to experience the fickleness of public attention i went up to the bar to order us another round and heard putter explaining loudly to the journos its an outrage her married name was francine putter and thats how i planned to have the stone engraved in the first place i only added crofts because i knew what she had brought off in that name and i wished in some small way to honor it but the radical feminists arent satisfied oh no it didnt satisfy them to vandalize the headstone over and over they had to actually violate a sanctified grave and steal francines remains no regard for me or her family no regard for the church no regard for her memory god only knows what they plan to use her bones for one shudders to think goddess rituals or some sort of black magic youre suggesting a satanic cult got hold of francine a journo asked and i could see the story in the daily mail already wouldnt surprise me in the least putter said and he bought a round for all the newspapermen i returned to andrea if you were a radical feminist and or satanic cultist how would you have stolen the bones she glowered at putter it was probably dead easy drive over from london in a minivan or even a car with a large boot maybe two of you in the hours before dawn one keeps watch and the other digs the wooden casket has disintegrated in twenty years you carefully lay the bones in a sheetso they dont rattle around too muchwrap the whole thing up in a plastic bag and bobs your uncle i shuddered blue plaques were one thing but grave robbery and bonesnatching even in the cause of justified historical revisionism were quite another why not just another gravestone this time with the words francine crofts do you really think putterandrea shot him a vicious lookwould allow such a stone to stand no im sure whoever did it plans to rebury her what makes you think that i asked maybe theyll just chip off pieces of bone and sell them at american womens studies conferences dont be medieval andrea said absently no i think its likely they might choose a site on the farm not far from here where francine and peter lived during the early days of their marriage the poems from that period are the lyrical ones the happy ones a simple monument on the top of a hill francine crofts poet andrea looked up from her old peculiar and turned to me in excitement thats it well stake the farm out well be the first to discover the monument maybe well catch them in the act of putting it up what good would that do dont be daft she admonished me its publicity isnt it andrea wanted to rush right over to the farm but when we came outside the pub the fog was so thick and close that we decided to settle in for the night instead i went up to the guest room under the eaves with a hotwater bottle and croftss collected poems id forgotten she had been happy until andrea reminded me her memory was so profoundly imbued with her manner of dying and with her violent despair that it was hard to think of her as celebrating life and love but here were poems about marriage about the farm about animals and flowers it made one pause if she had married a faithful and loving man perhaps her poetry would have stayed cheerful and light perhaps putter did make her what she was a poet of genius perhaps it was right that he still claimed her by name but nohere were the last poems in that first collection the ones that had been called prefeminist protofeminist and even urfeminist some critics now argued that if only francine had lived to see the wornens movement her anger would have had a context she wouldnt have turned her fury at being abandoned against herself and seen herself a failure but other critics argued that it was clear from certain poems even early ones that francine understood her predicament quite well and was constantly searching for ways out and they quoted the poem about mary anning the early nineteenthcentury fossil collector who was the first to discover the remains of an ichthyosaurus in lyme regis not far from here in it was called freeing the bones the next morning andrea and i drove over to the farm and skirted the hedges around it looking for a spot that the unknown gravediggers might decide was suitable for a memorial of some sort this is such a long shot i said i think its quite possible that some americans were involved and that theyve taken the remains back to america wasnt she from iowa theyll bury them in cedar rapids francine would hate that if she knew said andrea she was such an anglophile she couldnt wait to get out of cedar rapids it was the pinnacle of happiness for her to study at oxford and then to get a job afterward no one not even her family tried to make a case for sending her bones back to iowa the farm was owned by an absentee landlord it was solitary and lovely on this midautumn day we broke through a weak hedge and tramped the land settling on one or two likely little rises where the monument might go francines spirit seemed all about us that afternoon or perhaps it was just because id been reading her poetry it would be nice if she were reburied out here in the open rather than in that dank little closedin churchyard i imagined picnics and poetry readings under the oak trees with bowls of food left on the grave to feed her starved soul late in the afternoon we returned to the village and decided to have tea in francines sisterinlaws tea shop it had occurred to me that perhaps it had been jane fitzwater crying at francines grave last night the cozy cup tea shop was packed with journalists however and one look at jane was enough to convince me that it had not been she in the dowdy coat and wellingtons jane a bit younger than her brother was less craggy but still imposing with bleached blond hair and a strong jaw that gave her the look of a female impersonator her dress was royal blue and so was her eye shadow coordinated no doubt for the cameras she barely gave andrea and me a second glance when we entered but consigned us to an outoftheway table and a waitress who looked to be only about twelve and who brought us very weak tea stale scones and whipped cream instead of clotted cream whipped cream said andrea severely to the little waitress who hunched her shoulders and scurried away jane fitzwater had seated herself at a table of journalists and was holding forth in quite loud tones on the absolutely undeserved amount of publicity that francine had gotten through her death i say if youre unhappy take a course in weaving or a holiday abroad dont stew in your own selfpity and i tried to tell francine that all marriages go through difficult times but peter would have come back to her eventually men will be men instead she had to hide away in that little flat of hers and stop eating oh i tried to talk to her i even brought her a casserole one dayi could see shed gotten thinnerbut it never occurred to me im sure it never occurred to peter that she was deliberately trying to starve herself to death and then he gets all the blame its made a broken man of him you know never recovered from the shock of it he hasnt ruined his career his life she should have thought of that when she did it but no always thinking of herself thats how she was right from the beginning my mum and dad noticed it right off seems a little full of herself my dad said the first time peter brought her to dorset talks too much my mum felt sorry for her of course francine didnt have a clue about life really her head was in the clouds it will end in tears my mum said and she was right ive got to get out of here andrea muttered to me or it will end in something redder than tears we left the tea shop and strolled through the village which was scattered with posh cars and vans emblazoned with the logos of television stations native and foreign peter putter was over in the churchyard giving an interview to what appeared to be a german film crew its enough to make one lose ones appetite entirely andrea said and slammed the door to her little cottage that night i was awakened from a deep sleep by the sound of a car driving down the road to the village normally it would not have been anything to wake up to but i had a sudden odd feeling that it was my car i staggered over to the little garret window but saw nothing i crept down the steep stairs and peeked into andreas room she was not there i went out the back door and saw that my little ford was gone since andrea didnt have a car i supposed shed taken mine perhaps shed decided to visit the farm by herself to stake out the gravediggers perhaps shed heard someone elses car driving down the road and decided to follow it whatever my suppositions my actions were limited the farm was a good four miles away it was raining andi finally looked at the clockfour in the morning i got dressed just to keep warm and paced around a bit then remembered that andrea had a bicycle out in the shed behind the cottage with the feeling that there was nothing else to do i steeled myself for cold and rain and set off into the dark night with water streaming down my face i pedaled furiously wondering why roads that always seemed to be perfectly flat when you drove over them by car suddenly developed hills and valleys when you were traveling by bicycle still the cold rain gave me an incentive for speed and i arrived at the farm in record time there were no cars at the side road leading to the farmhouse so i got off the bike and began to reconnoiter on foot around the hedges there must be another road leading to the farm but i would waste more time looking for it than going on foot by this time my clothes were soaked and my boots caked with mud i tried to retrace the steps andrea and i had taken the day before but in the darkness it was hard to see the difference between land and sky much less between a rise and a fall in the earth then through the hedges i saw a small light i broke through and started staggering over the land toward it it was joined by another small light the lights seemed to be dancing together or were they struggling one of the lights vanished i began to hear voices had andrea discovered the perpetrators was she fighting with them but then i heard a voice i thought i recognized put those bones down ill have you in court for this grave robbing is a criminal offense as well as a sin what you did to francine is a sin and a crime another even more familiar voice shot back give me back my shovel she deserves to have a better resting place than the one you gave her i was her husband i have a right to decide where shes buried you gave up your rights long ago then there was only the sound of grunts as they grappled again peter i said andrea stop this stop this right now i picked up one of the flashlights and shone it at each of their faces in turn whats going on here i suspected her from the beginning said peter looking like a large wet muskrat in his brown oilskin jacket ive been keeping an eye on her lives right across from the churchyard easy enough to break into the grave tonight i heard the car starting up and decided to follow her called the journalists first theyll be here in a minute youll go to jail for this addlepoot oh cassandra groaned andrea im sorry i had it planned so differently but she didnt have time to exonerate herself the journalists were suddenly on us like a pack of hounds there were bright lights everywhere illuminating a stone marker that said francine crofts poet and a muddy sheet piled haphazardly with thin white bones some weeks after this when i was back in london andrea came up to see me if it hadnt been for the surprising intercession of mrs putter peters mother for she had been the woman wed seen crying at the grave andrea would have been on trial now as it was francines bones were back in the churchyard of st stephens and andrea had closed up her cottage and was thinking of moving back to london i didnt have completely ignoble motives she said i always did believe that francine deserved better than a putterized headstone or no headstone in a grim little grave under the eye of people who had hated her but i have to admit that i saw an opportunity when the blue plaques started to appear i thought why not someones bound to do it why not me i wouldnt say i was the one whod done it of course id steal the bones rebury them erect a marker and thenwith you as a witnessid discover the new site and let the media know it would have been the best kind of publicity for me and for francine i would have solved a mystery my name would be back in the news my publisher might have decided to reissue my books but instead instead the newspapers called you a grave robber and filled the pages of the tabloids with photos that made you look like a refugee from nightmare on elm street and they spelled your name wrong andrea shuddered im going to have to put all this behind me start over science fiction perhaps or why not feminist horror skeletons that walk in the night the ghosts of mary wollstonecraft and emily bronte that haunt us still today i did read in the newspaper today i interrupted that the owner of the farm has decided to put up a marker to francine himself and to open the farm up to readings and poetry workshops apparently hes something of an artist himself in addition to being a stockbroker he said he never knew that francine had lived there so something good came of it andrea cheered up and putter didnt look so terribly fabulous in those photographs either we started to laugh embarrassed at first and then with gasping and teary amusement recalling our wet night in the mud and then we went out for a walk to look at some of the blue plaques that had gone up recently for you see the remembering and honoring hadnt stopped there were now more blue plaques to women than ever death and diamonds by susan dunlap one of the fastest rising stars of mystery fiction susan dunlap has created three memorable detectivesberkeleybased jill smith in novels like diamond in the buff pi kiernan oshaughnessy who works out of san diego in books like rogue wave and the only meter reader sleuth in history vejay haskell in the wonderfully named and wonderful the last annual slugfest ms dunlap makes her home in albany california the thing i like most about being a private investigator is the thrill of the game i trained in gymnastics as a kid i love cases with lots of action but alas you cant always have what you love kiernan oshaughnessy glanced down at her thickly bandaged foot and the crutches propped beside it kicked a little too much ass huh the man in the seat beside her at the southwest airlines gate grinned there was an impish quality to him average height sleekly muscled with the toodark tan of one who doesnt worry about the future he was over forty but the lines around his bright green eyes and mouth suggested quick scowls sudden bursts of laughter rather than the folds of age setting in amid the san diegans in shorts and tshirts proclaiming the zoo tijuana and the chargers he seemed almost formal in his chinos and sports jacket and the forest green polo shirt he crossed then recrossed his long legs and glanced impatiently at the purser standing guard at the end of the ramp the gate waiting area was jammed with tanned families ready to fly from sunny san diego to sunnier phoenix the rumble of conversations was broken by childrens shrill whines and exasperated parents barking their names in warning we are now boarding all passengers for southwest airlines flight twelve fortyfour to oakland through gate nine a mob of the oaklandbound crowded closer to their gate clutching their blue plastic boarding passes beside kiernan the man sighed but there was a twinkle in his eyes lucky them i hate waiting around like this its not something im good at one of the reasons i like flying southwest is their open seating if you move fast you can get whatever seat you want which seat is your favorite oneb or onec so i can get off fast if they ever let us on the phoenixbound flight was half an hour late with each announcement of a southwest departure to some other destination the level of grumbling in the phoenixbound area had grown till the air seemed thick with frustration and at the same time old and overused as if it had held just enough oxygen for the scheduled waiting period and now half an hour later served only to dry out noses and to make throats raspy and tempers short the loudspeaker announced the albuquerque flight was ready for boarding a woman in a rhinestoneencrusted denim jacket raced past them toward the albuquerque gate rhinestones hardly diamonds but close enough to bring the picture of melissa jessup to kiernans mind when shed last seen her melissa jessup had been dead six months beaten and stabbed her corpse left outside to decompose gone were her mothers diamonds the diamonds her mother had left her as security melissa hadnt been able to bring herself to sell them even to finance her escape from a life turned fearful and the man who preferred them to her it all proved as kiernan reminded herself each time the memory of melissa invaded her thoughts that diamonds are not a girls best friend that mother or at least a mother who says dont sell them does not know best and that a woman should never get involved with a man she works with melissa jessup had done all those things her lover had followed her killed her taken her mothers diamonds and left not one piece of evidence melissas brother had hired kiernan hoping that with her background in forensic pathology she would find some clue in the autopsy report or that once she could view melissas body she would spot something the local medical examiner had missed she hadnt the key that would nail melissas killer was not in her corpse but with the diamonds finding those diamonds and the killer with them had turned into the most frustrating case of kiernans career she pushed the picture of melissa jessup out of her mind this was no time for anger or any of the emotions that the thought of melissas death brought up the issue now was getting this suitcase into the right hands in phoenix turning back to the man beside her she said the job im on right now is babysitting this suitcase from san diego to phoenix this trip is not going to be a kick couldnt you have waited till you were off the crutches he said looking down at her bandaged right foot crime doesnt wait she smiled focusing her full attention on the conversation now besides courier work is perfect for a hobbled lady dont you think mruh he glanced down at the plain black suitcase then back at her detecting all the time huh there was a definite twinkle in his eyes as he laughed well this ones easy getting my name is not going to prove whether youre any good as a detective im jeff siebert and you are kiernan oshaughnessy but i cant let that challenge pass anyone can get a name a professional investigator can do better than that for a start i surmise youre single he laughed the delighted laugh of the little boy whos just beaten his parent in rummy no wedding ring no white line on my finger to show ive taken the ring off right admittedly that was one factor but youre wearing a red eit since its nowhere near christmas i assume the combination of red belt and green turtleneck is not intentional youre colorblind well yeah he said buttoning his jacket over the offending belt but they dont ask you to tell red from green before theyll give you a marriage license so if you were married your wife might not check you over before you left each morning but chances are she would organize your accessories so you could get dressed by yourself and not have strange women like me commenting on your belt this is the final call for boarding southwest airlines flight twelve fortyfour to oakland at gate nine kiernan glanced enviously at the last three oaklandbound passengers as they passed through gate if the phoenix flight were not so late she would be in the air now and that much closer to getting the suitcase in the right hands turning back to siebert she said by the same token id guess you have been married or involved with a woman about my size a blonde he sat back down in his seat and for the first time was still got your attention huh kiernan laughed i really shouldnt show off like that it unnerves some people others like you it just quiets down actually this was pretty easy youve got a tiny spot of lavender eyeshadow on the edge of your lapel i had a boyfriend your height and he ended up sending a number of jackets to the cleaners but no one but me would think to look at the edge of your lapel and you could have that jacket for years and not notice that but why did you say a blonde blondes tend to wear violet eyeshadow he smiled clearly relieved flight seventeen sixtyseven departing gate ten with service to phoenix will begin boarding in just a few minutes we thank you for your patience he groaned well see how few those minutes are across from them a woman with an elephantine carryon bag pulled it closer to her siebert turned to kiernan and giving her that intimate grin she was beginning to think of as his look siebert said you seem to be having a good time being a detective the picture of melissa jessup popped up in her mind melissa jessup had let herself be attracted to a thief shed ignored her suspicions about him until it was too late to sell her mothers jewels and she could only grab what was at hand and run pulling her suitcase closer kiernan said investigating can be a lot of fun if you like strange hours and the thrill of having everything hang on one maneuver ill tell you the truthit appeals to the adolescent in me particularly if i can pretend to be something or someone else its fun to see if i can pull that off how do i know youre not someone else i could show you id but of course that wouldnt prove anything she laughed youll just have to trust me as i am you after all you did choose to sit down next to me well thats because you were the bestlooking woman here sitting by herself or at least the one nearest the hallway where you came in and this is the only spot around where you have room to pace you look to be a serious pacer she laughed again but i like your explanation better shrieking a small girl in yellow raced in front of the seats whooping gleefully a slightly larger male version sprinted by he lunged for his sister caught his foot on kiernans crutch and sent it toppling back as he lurched forward and crashed into a man at the end of the checkin line his sister skidded to a stop serves you right jason mom look what jason did siebert bent over and righted kiernans crutch travel can be dangerous huh damn crutches its like theyve got urges all their own she said like one of them sees an attractive crutch across the room and all of a sudden its gone they virtually seduce underage boys he laughed his green eyes twinkling impishly theyll come home to you theres not a crutch in the room that holds a crutch to you she hesitated a moment before saying my crutches and i thank you this was she thought the kind of chatter that had been wonderfully seductive when she was nineteen and jeff siebert was the restless impulsive type of man who had personified freedom then but nearly twenty years of mistakesher own and more deadly ones like melissa jessupshad shown her the inevitable end of such flirtations siebert stood up and rested a foot against the edge of the table so what else is fun about investigating she shifted the suitcase between her feet well trying to figure out people like i was doing with you a lot is common sense like assuming that you are probably not a patient driver perhaps youve passed in a nopassing zone or even have gotten a speeding ticket he nodded abruptly on the other hand she went on sometimes i know facts beforehand and then i can fake a sherlock holmes and produce anythingbutelementary deductions the danger with that is getting cocky and blurting out conclusions before youve been given evidence for them has that happened to you she laughed and looked meaningfully down at her foot but i wouldnt want my client to come to that conclusion we had a long discussion about whether a woman on crutches could handle his delivery client he said shouting over the announcement of the yuma flight at the next gate in a normal voice he added in your courier work you mean whats in that bag of your clients that so very valuable she moved her feet till they were touching the sides of the suitcase he leaned in closer he was definitely the type of man destined to be trouble she thought but that littleboy grin that conspiratorial tone were seductive particularly in a place like this where any diversion was a boon she wasnt surprised he had been attracted to her clearly he was a man who liked small women she glanced around pleased that no one else had been drawn to this spot the nearest travelers were a young couple seated six feet away and too involved in each other to waste time listening to strangers conversation i didnt pack the bag im just delivering it he bent down with his ear near the side of the suitcase well at least its not ticking sitting up he said but seriously isnt that a little dangerous women carrying bags for strangers thats how terrorists have gotten bombs on planes no she snapped im not carrying it for a lover with an m im a bonded courier the casual observer might not have noticed sieberts shoulders tensing slightly briefly in anger at her rebuff silently he looked down at her suitcase how much does courier work pay not a whole lot particularly compared to the value of what i have to carry but then theres not much work involved the chances of theft are minuscule and i do get to travel last fall i drove a package up north that was a good deal since i had to go up there anyway to check motel registrations in a case im working on it took me a week to do the motels and then i came up empty an entire week to discover that melissas killer had not stopped at a motel or hotel between san diego and eureka the whole thing would have been a bust if it hadnt been for the courier work he glanced down at the suitcase she suspected he would have been appalled to know how visible was his covetous look finally he said what was in that package the one you delivered she glanced over at the young couple no danger from them still kiernan lowered her voice diamonds untraceable thats really the only reason to go to the expense of hiring a courier untraceable huh he said grinning didnt you even consider taking off over the border with them maybe she said slowly if i had known they were worth enough to set me up for the rest of my actuarial allotment i might have we will begin preboarding southwest airlines flight seventeen sixtyseven with service to phoenix momentarily please keep your seats until preboarding has been completed she pushed herself up and positioned the crutches under her arms it was a moment before he jerked his gaze away from the suitcase and stood his foot tapping impatiently on the carpet all around them families were hoisting luggage and positioning toddlers for the charge to the gate he sighed loudly i hope youre good with your elbows she laughed and settled back on the arm of the seat his gaze went back to the suitcase he said i thought couriers were handcuffed to their packages youve been watching too much tv she lowered her voice handcuffs play havoc with the metal detector the last thing you want in this business is buzzers going off and guards racing in from all directions i go for the lowkey approach always keep the suitcase in sight always be within lunging range he took a playful swipe at it what would happen if say that bag were to get stolen stolen she pulled the suitcase closer to her well for starters i wouldnt get a repeat job if the goods were insured that might be the end of it but if it were something untraceableshe glanced at the suitcaseit could be a lot worse with a grin that matched his own she said youre not a thief are you he shrugged do i look like a thief you look like the most attractive man here she paused long enough to catch his eye of course looks can be deceiving she didnt say it but she could picture him pocketing a necklace carelessly left in a jewelry box during a big party or a seiko watch from under a poolside towel she didnt imagine him planning a heist but just taking what came his way returning her smile he said when you transport something that cant be traced dont they even provide you a backup no im a professional i dont need backup but with your foot like that im good with the crutches and besides the crutches provide camouflage whod think a woman on crutches carrying a battered suitcase had anything worth half a miwatch out the little girl and her brother are loose again she pulled her crutches closer as the duo raced through the aisle in front of them we are ready to begin boarding southwest airlines flight number seventeen sixtyseven to phoenix any passengers traveling with small children or those needing a little extra time may begin boarding now the passengers applauded it was amazing she thought how much sarcasm could be carried by a nonverbal sound she leaned down for the suitcase preboarding thats me are you going to be able to handle the crutches and the suitcase he asked youre really fascinated with this bag arent you guilty he grinned should i dare to offer to carry it id stay within lunging range she hesitated in the aisle a woman in cerise shorts carrying twin bags herded twin toddlers toward the gate ahead of her an elderly man leaned precariously on a cane the family with the boy and girl were still assembling luggage he said youd be doing me a big favor letting me preboard with you i like to cadge a seat in the first row on the aisle the seat for the guy who cant wait right but i got here so late that im in the last boarding group im never going to snag oneb or onec so help me out i promise he said grinning i wont steal well i wouldnt want my employer to see this i assured him i wouldnt need any help but she shrugged no time to waver now theres already a mob of preboarders ahead of us he picked up the bag some heavy diamonds good camouflage dont you think of course not everythings diamonds just something untraceable she gave him a half wink it may not be untraceable it may not even be valuable and you may be just a regular mail carrier he said starting toward the gate she swung after him the crutches were no problem and the thickly taped right ankle looked worse than it was still it made things much smoother to have siebert carrying the suitcase if the opportunity arose he might be tempted to steal it but not in a crowded gate at the airport with guards and airline personnel around he moved slowly staying right in front of her running interference as they neared the gate a blond man carrying a jumpy toddler hurried in front of them the gate phone buzzed the airline rep picked it up and nodded at it to the blond man and the elderly couple who had settled in behind him kiernan and siebert he said sorry folks the cleaning crews a little slow itll just be a minute sieberts face scrunched in anger whats cleaning crew a euphemism for a tire fell off and theyre looking for it theyve spotted a crack in the engine block and theyre trying to figure out if they can avoid telling us kiernan laughed ill bet people dont travel with you twice he laughed i just hate being at someone elses mercy but since were going to be standing here awhile why dont you do what you love more than diamonds investigator tell me what youve deduced about me like reading your palm the crutches poked into her armpits she shifted them back putting more weight on her bandaged foot slowly she surveyed his lanky body his thin agile hands con mans hands hands that were never quite still always past ready coming out of set okay youre traveling from san diego to phoenix on the friday evening flight so chances are you were here on business but you dont have on cowboy boots or a stetson youre tan but its not that dry tan you get in the desert in fact you could pass for a san diegan i would have guessed that you travel for a living but youre too impatient for that and if youd taken this flight once or twice before you wouldnt be surprised that its late youd have a report to read or a newspaper no you do something where you dont take orders and you dont put up with much she grinned hows that thats pretty elementary sherlock he said with only a slight edge to his voice he tapped his fingers against his leg but all in all he looked only a little warier than any other person in the waiting area would as his secrets were unveiled southwest airlines flight number seventeen sixtyseven with service to phoenix is now ready for preboarding okay folks the gate attendant called sorry for the delay the man with the jittery toddler thrust his boarding pass at the gate attendant and strode down the ramp the child screamed the elderly couple moved haltingly hoisting and readjusting their open sacks with each step a family squeezed in in front of them causing the old man to stop dead and move his bag to the other shoulder siebert shifted from foot to foot stretching up to whisper in his ear kiernan said it would look bad if you shoved the old people out of your way how bad he muttered grinning then handed his boarding pass to the attendant as she surrendered hers she said to siebert go ahead hurry ill meet you in onec and d thanks he patted her shoulder she watched him stride down the empty ramp his tan jacket had caught on one hip as he balanced her suitcase and his own but he neither slowed his pace nor made an attempt to free the jacket clutching tight to her suitcase he hurried around the elderly couple moving with the strong stride of a hiker by the time she got down the ramp the elderly couple and a family with two toddlers and an infant that sucked loudly on a pacifier crowded behind siebert kiernan watched irritably as the stewardess eyed first siebert then her big suitcase the head stewardess has the final word on carryon luggage she knew with all the hassle that was involved with this business anyway she didnt want to add a confrontation with the stewardess she dropped the crutches and banged backward into the wall flailing for purchase as she slipped down to the floor the stewardess caught her before she hit bottom are you okay embarrassed kiernan said truthfully she hated to look clumsy even if it was an act even if it allowed siebert and her suitcase to get on the plane unquestioned im having an awful time getting used to these things you sure youre okay let me help you up the stewardess said ill have to keep your crutches in the hanging luggage compartment up front while were in flight but you go ahead now ill come and get them from you thats okay ill leave them there and just sit in one of the front seats she said taking the crutches and swinging herself on board the plane from the luggage compartment it took only one long step on her left foot to get to row she swung around siebert who was hoisting his own suitcase into the overhead bin beside hers and dropped into seat d by the window the elderly couple was settling into seats a and b in another minute southwest would call the first thirty passengers and the herd would stampede down the ramp stuffing approved carryons in overhead compartments and grabbing the thirty most prized seats that was a smooth move with the stewardess siebert said as he settled into his coveted aisle seat that suitcase is just about the limit of what theyll let you carry on ive had a few hassles i could see this one coming and i suspected that youshe patted his armwere not the patient person to deal with that type of problem you moved around her pretty smartly yourself id say that merits a drink from my client he smiled and rested a hand on hers maybe he said leaning closer we could have it in phoenix for the first time she had a viscerally queasy feeling about him freeing her hand from his she gave a mock salute maybe so she looked past him at the elderly couple sieberts gaze followed hers he grinned as he said do you think theyre thieves after your loot little old sprinters probably not but it pays to be alert she forced a laugh im afraid constant suspicion is a side effect of my job the first wave of passengers hurried past already the air in the plane had the sere feel and slightly rancid smell of having been dragged through the altera too many times by tacit consent they watched the passengers hurry on board pause survey their options and rush on kiernan thought fondly of that drink in phoenix she would be sitting at a small table looking out a tinted window the trip would be over the case delivered into the proper hands and she would feel the tension that knotted her back releasing with each swallow of scotch or so she hoped the whole frustrating case depended on this delivery there was no fallback position if she screwed up melissa jessups murderer disappeared that tension was what normally made the game fun but this case was no longer a game this time she had allowed herself to go beyond her regular rules to call her former colleagues from the days when she had been a forensic pathologist looking for some new test that would prove culpability she had hoped the lab in san diego could find something they hadnt the fact was that the diamonds were the only something that would trap the killer melissas lover who valued them much more than her a man who might not have bothered going after her had it not been for them affairs might be brief but diamonds after all are forever they would lead her to the murderers safe house and the evidence that would tie him to melissa if she was careful she shoved the tongue of the seat belt into the latch and braced her feet as the plane taxied toward the runway siebert was tapping his finger on the armrest the engines whirred the plane shifted forward momentarily then flung them back against their seats as it raced down the short runway the fasten seat belt sign went off the old man across the aisle pushed himself up and edged toward the front bathroom sieberts belt was already unbuckled muttering be right back he jumped up and stood hunched under the overhead bin while the old man cleared the aisle then siebert headed fullout toward the back of the plane kiernan slid over and watched him as he strode down the aisle steps firmer steadier than shed have expected of a man racing to the bathroom in a swaying airplane she could easily imagine him hiking in the redwood forest with someone like her a small slight woman the blond woman with the violet eyeshadow she in jeans and one of those soft patagonia jackets kiernan had spotted in the ll bean catalog violet with blue trim he in jeans turtleneck a forest green down jacket on his rangy body forest green would pick up the color of his eyes and accent his dark curly hair in her picture his hair was tinted with the first flecks of autumn snow and the ground still soft like the spongy airplane carpeting beneath his feet when he got back he made no mention of his hurried trip hed barely settled down when the stewardess leaned over him and said would you care for something to drink kiernan put a hand on his arm this ones on my client for that client who insisted you carry his package while youre still on crutches im sorry it cant be lafiterothschild gin and tonic will have to do he grinned at the stewardess kiernan could picture him in a bar flashing that grin at a tall redhead or maybe another small blonde she could imagine him with the sweat of a san diego summer still on his brow his skin brown from too many days at an ocean beach that is too great a temptation for those who grab their pleasures scotch and water kiernan ordered to him she said i notice that while im the investigator its you who are asking all the questions so what about you what do you do for a living i quit my job in san diego and im moving back to phoenix so im not taking the first friday night flight to get back home im taking it to get to my new home i had good times in san diego the beach the sailing balboa park when i came there a couple years ago i thought id stay forever but the draw of the desert is too great i miss the red rock of sedona the pines of the mogollon rim and the high desert outside tucson he laughed too much soft california life it was easy to picture him outside of show low on the mogollon rim with the pine trees all around him some chopped for firewood the ax lying on a stump a shovel in his hand or in a cabin near sedona lifting a hatch in the floorboards the stewardess brought the drinks and the little bags of peanuts giving jeff siebert the kind of smile kiernan knew would have driven her crazy had she been sieberts girlfriend how often had that type of thing happened had his charm brought that reaction so automatically that for him it had seemed merely the way women behave had complaints from a girlfriend seemed at first unreasonable then melodramatic then infuriating he was an impatient man quick to anger had liquor made it quicker as the rhyme said and the prospect of unsplit profit salved his conscience he poured the little bottle of gin over the ice and added tonic cheers she touched glasses then drank are you going to be in phoenix long probably not ive come into a little money and i figure ill just travel around sort of like you do find someplace i like so well just have time for our drink in town then he rested his hand back on hers well now i may have reason to come back in a while or to san diego i just need to cut loose for a while she forced herself to remain still not to cringe at his touch cut loosewhat an apt term for him to use she pictured his sunbrowned hand wrapped around the hilt of a chefs knife working it up and down up and down cutting across pink flesh till it no longer looked like flesh till the flesh mixed with the blood and the organ tissue till the knife cut down to the bone and the metal point stuck in the breastbone she pictured melissa jessups blond hair pink from the blood she didnt have to picture her body lying out in the woods outside eureka in northern california she had seen photos of it she didnt have to imagine what the cracked ribs and broken clavicle and the sternum marked from the knife point looked like now jeff siebert had seen that too and had denied what melissas brother and the eureka sheriff all knewknew in their hearts but could not provethat melissa had not gone to eureka camping by herself as hed insisted but had only stopped overnight at the campground she and jeff had been to the previous summer because she had no money and hadnt been able to bring herself to sell the diamonds her mother had left her instead of a rest on the way to freedom shed found siebert there now siebert was flying to phoenix to vanish hed pick up melissas diamonds wherever hed stashed them and hed be gone what about your client he asked will he be meeting you at the airport no no one will meet me ill just deliver my goods to the van collect my money and be free what about you no no ones waiting for me either at least ill be able to give you a hand with that bag theres no ramp to the terminal in phoenix you have to climb down to the tarmac there getting down those metal steps with a suitcase and two crutches would be a real balancing act all she had to do was get it into the right hands she shook her head thanks but ill have to lug it through the airport just in case my client didnt handcuff the suitcase to me but he does expect ill keep hold of it he grinned like you said youll be in lunging range all the time no she said firmly i appreciate your offer jeff the bag weighs a ton but im afraid its got to be in my hand those green eyes of his that had twinkled with laughter narrowed and his lips pressed together okay he said slowly then his face relaxed almost back to that seductively impish smile that once might have charmed her as it had melissa jessup i want you to know that ill still find you attractive even if the bag yanks your shoulder out of its socket he gave her hand a pat then shifted in his seat so his upper arm rested next to hers the stewardess collected the glasses the plane jolted and began its descent kiernan braced her feet through his jacket she felt the heat of his arm the arm that had dug that chefs knife into melissa jessups body she breathed slowly and did not move to kiernan he said theres a great bar right here in sky harbor airport the sky lounge shall we have our drink there she nodded her mouth suddenly too dry for speech the plane bumped down and in a moment the aisles were jammed with passengers ignoring the stewardesss entreaty to stay in their seats siebert stood up and pulled his bag out of the overhead compartment and then lifted hers onto his empty seat ill get your crutches he said as the elderly man across the aisle pushed his way out in front of him siebert shook his head picking up both suitcases he maneuvered around the man and around the corner to the luggage compartment siebert had taken her suitcase you dont need to take both suitcases to pick up the crutches kiernan stared after him her shoulders tensing her hands clutching the armrests her throat was so constricted she could barely breathe for an instant she shared the terror that must have paralyzed melissa jessup just before he stabbed her jeff she called after him a trace of panic evident in her voice he didnt answer her instead she heard a great thump then him muttering and the stewardesss voice placating the airplane door opened the elderly man moved out into the aisle in front of kiernan motioning his wife to go ahead of him then they moved slowly toward the door kiernan yanked the bandage off her foot stepped into the aisle excuse me she said to the couple pushing by them as siebert had so wanted to do she rounded the corner to the exit the stewardess was lifting up a garment bag four more bags lay on the floor so that was the thump shed heard a crutch was beside them she half heard the stewardesss entreaties to wait her mutterings about the clumsy man she looked out the door down onto the tarmac jeffrey siebert and the suitcase were gone in those few seconds he had raced down the metal steps and was disappearing into the terminal by the time she could make it to the sky lounge he would be halfway to show low or sedona now she felt a different type of panic this wasnt in the plan she couldnt lose siebert she jumped over the bags grabbed one crutch hurried outside to the top of the stairs and thrust the crutch across the hand rails behind her to make a seat as the crutch slid down the railings she kept her knees bent high into her chest to keep from landing and bucking forward onto her head instead the momentum propelled her on her feet as it had in gymnastics in those routines shed had to fight the momentum now she went with it and ran fullout she ran through the corridor toward the main building pushing past businessmen between parents carrying children siebert would be running ahead but no one would stop him not in an airport people run through airports all the time beside the metal detectors she saw a man in a tan jacket not him by the luggage pickup another lookalike she didnt spot him till he was racing out the door to the parking lot siebert ran across the roadway a van screeched to a halt before kiernan could cross through the traffic a hotel bus eased in front of her she skirted behind it she could sense a man following her now but there was no time to deal with that siebert was halfway down the lane of cars bent low she ran down the next lane the hot dusty desert air drying her throat by the time she came abreast of siebert he was in a light blue chevy pickup backing out of the parking slot he hit the gas and wheels squealing drove off she reached toward the truck with both arms siebert didnt stop she stood watching as jeffrey siebert drove off into the sunset there was no one behind her as she sauntered into the terminal to the sky lounge she ordered the two drinks siebert had suggested and when they came she tapped her glass on his and took a drink for melissa jessup then she swallowed the rest of the drink in two gulps by this time jeff siebert would be on the freeway hed be fighting to stay close to the speed limit balancing his thiefs wariness of the highway patrol against his gnawing urge to force the lock on the suitcase jeffrey siebert was an impatient man a man who had nevertheless made himself wait nearly a year before leaving california his stash of selfcontrol would be virtually empty but he would wait awhile before daring to stop then hed jam a knife between the top and bottom of the suitcase pry and twist it till the case fell open he would find diamonds more diamonds diamonds to take along while he picked up melissa jessups from the spot where hed hidden them she wished melissa jessup could see him when he compared the two collections and realized the new ones hed stolen were fakes she wished she herself could see his face when he realized that a woman on crutches had made it out of the plane in time to follow him to point out the blue pickup truck kiernan picked up jeffs glass and drank more slowly how sweet it would be if melissa could see that grin of his fade as the surveillance team surrounded him drawn by the beepers concealed in those fake diamonds hed be clutching the evidence that would send him to jail just for life not forever as melissa could have told him only death and diamonds are forever kill the man for me by mary wings mary wingss amateur detective emma victor has solved two cases to dateshe came too late and she came in a flash novels that

graphic designer it was okay you said after the first time wed made love you said it very neutrally as if youd been talking about the weather or snowflakes or cornflakes it was okay nobodys ever told me that before i joked you were lying next to me saying its no big deal no big deal to say its okay you leaned up on your elbow i traced your collarbone with my eyes you tried tracing my eyes with your eyes its our first time you said we need to learn some more things about each other your voice was warm instructive of course youd been in practice a long time or so they had said sure i crowed learn some more things discourse about intercourse sex as perception i burbled at you sure but i also knew that you were telling me that we had a future i laughed in the darkness i would get what i wanted and i would get you later i would tell you that when i made love with you the memories of former lovers abandoned all claim upon my body i told you i was free we curled up together and fell asleep the next day we would be stuck in gridlock traffic for three hours on the way home i joined in the sighs of relief when you spoke at public gatherings youd summarize make the contradictions manageable wed been anxious youd satisfy us one of them came to a lecture once but it wasnt a problem you were attentive to me at these gatherings youd ruffle my hair i was a portrait by your side youd let me know with the slightest of gestures at the end of a publicly spoken phrase that you were in fact only speaking to me of course all you told anyone was what they wanted to hear pure pap except this morning when you said after wed come out of the shower dont you ever comb your hair and then i remembered thats what you used to tell them you were laughing what did your parents ever do to you you were hardly exasperated at all and id spilled the garbage bag on the floor for the third time that week i was on the floor too i was watching jackson the terrier make pesto sauce paw prints the color of avocado she was making them on the rug of desert tan i was crying and i was tan we were all tan we lived in los angeles what did your parents ever do to you you repeated but you knew better than i did what my parents had done to me youd been my shrink youd been theirs too youd never thought about advertising not that id ever suggest it but id asked mr geramus the neighbor to the north of us for tennis doubles then he asked you to join the agency i knew he would it was autumn and you said your soul had been searched you said yes but later you didnt seem too happy to me and the first time you did it you felt really bad it was the loss of control you were so devastated it was easy to want to comfort you and eventually you let me later you didnt even comment when i spent extra time at the mirror powdering my bruise they had bought me oilbased foundation its better because it doesnt run with the sweat they told me and always follow up with matte powder then it was christmastime and the agency had fired you right before having to give you your christmas bonus your old shrink circle had laughed when you said you were going into advertising marketing youd called it theyd envied your salary and now they were triumphing over your unemployment yes your old shrink circle had shrunk but we were going to one of those parties anyway mrs watkin the neighbor to the south of us peered out her window as we walked down the driveway in our festive holiday attire you always opened the door for me and this time you had to and we always wore our safety belts we floated in with a liquor delivery if i was very quiet it was because my arm hurt but it was one more bond between us it was our private story about how youd lost control and id given it back to you by forgiving you as the people floated by faces talked about auto insurance termites weekend resort prices those subjects would latch on to other topics and become health care roach motels and freeway ramps but you knew and i knew that youd come damned close to breaking my arm last night the throbbing and swelling of that arm filled up the whole room for me the pain devoured hours of small talk generated by holiday anxieties and large quantities of hard liquor and i knew that next time id make enough noise near a south window that the neighbor would call the cops patrol officer laura deleuse the call was a dv on del mar drive domestic violence in a neighborhood that is usually just domestic all assaults used to be lumped together as s now we sort out the dvs makes it easier for the people at the university to study the statistics these calls are never my favorites the worst are the hold me back couples when you arrive on the scene they really go out of control because they know that now that youre there nothing really bad is going to happen but of course this wasnt the story with these folks we pulled up to malibu lighting alarm systems and bleached oak designer fencing of course the husband with the big excuse opened the door the sobbing wife would be in the background somewhere this would take application of social skills i thought id done all that on my dinner date last night i explained that a neighbor phoned complaining about noise i asked him the usual questions whats happened here has there been an accident is someone hurt that scared him he mumbled some polite denials who else is at home wheres your wife may i see her please he invited us in opening the door too quickly too widely as if to say what do you think this is a torture chamber what it was was a sea of chintz upholstery and a woman with a cut above her eye sinking into it she had long hair and short legs her hair was pulled up in a complicated chignon not a hairpulling fight apparently and her feet were curled up underneath her a fresh fire crackled on the grate of a marble fireplace i squinted my eyes looking at that cut but when her husband glanced at her she turned her face away the skin is so delicate there i thought if you get hit your cheekbone can actually cause a tear in the skin i looked over at my partner kevin his eyes were roaming the room there were no weapons or anything that could be construed as a weapon lying around but these days a fist is enough to cause corporal injury and can be regarded as a weapon in court what can i do for you she asked and as i approached she uncurled her legs and bent over to poke at the fire which was beginning to smolder she fumbled with the iron the only sign of nervousness she was wearing stockings without a snag or run she kept her face averted from me although she had given me a good enough look when id first come in but other than that she didnt act like your usual humiliated uppermiddleclass victim what a difference from the scene id visited last week basically a couple trying to tear each other to shreds the technique of separating them and defusing the fight wouldnt be necessary here when that couple made eye contact it set them to spittingspittingat each other this woman in her stocking feet poking at the fire with the husband nervously shifting his weight from side to side was a different setup altogether but the reason i was there was that phone call and the cut above her eye as in all these cases i had to get her alone id like to ask you a few questions could we speak privately she nodded and slipped on her black pumps which were neatly paired by the skirt of the sofa she led me down a hallway into a phony english library setup with leather books and leather furniture we settled into wing chairs but i didnt want to be too comfortable i didnt want her to be too comfortable either i assume theres some sort of injury here i pointed with my pencil to the cut beneath her eye you assume correctly i fell down the stairs her tone was too measured i thought this woman was too smart not to know that that is the cliché she was almost throwing it in my face ive never seen an eye cut like that from a fall down stairs maam a blow to the face is usually what causes this sort of thing i could hear irritation in my voice are you sure im sure i sighed what a waste of my time and the taxpayers money and the laws have changed in california too used to be theyd have to press charges hire a lawyer still hubby would get out the same night now all we have to do is get her to admit that he hit her and we can cool his heels in jail at least overnight until he can get before a judge but this woman wasnt going to help herself out you sure about that if you can just confirm that he hit youthats all you have to do he didnt and the bruise on your arm she looked down and moved the skin on her upper arm around to see a purple spot she looked surprised she hadnt noticed it so maybe she just wasnt even feeling pain must have happened on the stairs looks a few days old she shrugged i shrugged thats all i guess later i thought maybe if my social skills had been better i could have charmed the words out of her but now i was getting hungry kevin and i were helping each other out with our diets i wondered who would try and talk whom out of the latenight salad bar this time we stood up and walked back into the living room she had her head tilted up high but not with the pride of the humiliated or the pain of a broken jaw i liked the tilt of her head and something else some strength i couldnt place or maybe she was just crazy i watched her eyes settle upon her husband as we walked into the room and saw how much space she chose to put between them shes not afraid of him i thought maybe she did fall down the stairs it didnt matter anymore kevin had a crush on the hamburger joint waitress with great repartee and i was dating a paramedic with awesome social skills thats the way it was with night work your society becomes waitresses at allnight restaurants nurses lap dancers paramedics and criminals couples with malibu lighting were the exception kevin and i made our polite goodbyes and went back to the car to call in and write up a report my feeling is we wont have to go back there again tonight ive never seen a dv so calm after the storm if everybodys so copacetic what can you do ill bet that guy doesnt ever have to be up before the judge but what i was thinking was i hope he doesnt cut her up into little tiny pieces either we settled on hamburgers and drove to a neonlighted latenight part of town they were right things got much easier after that it became so simple to fuck up i not only burned your shirts when i ironed them i developed a cowering posture lowering my eyes that darted only over to your shoe soles and i knew that as things became worse for you as the pressure started to mount youd beat me but you were dependent upon me i was the only thing you could control in your life or so you thought you had no idea how out of control you really were i went to several doctors under assumed names but i never wore sunglasses i looked them straight in the face and i introduced memorable topics with the receptionist at every appointment of course i had to show some kind of escalation but i wasnt about to rent slasher films for your athome video entertainment besides i was afraid the video places would have receipts but i didnt know how to time it it was like taking a wishbone and pulling on it hoping that it would break in the right place the place that would be in my favor and thats what i wanted to do i didnt want to get broken anymore but i didnt know then how easy it would be once id remembered what theyd told me when i showed them the photos probably not admissible in court but nevertheless interesting it was emotionally upsetting for them to see the photos the pictures traced bruises with bilious yellow centers that blossomed into purple and black or red welts like bars across my back it brought back memories that were not pleasant for them and they expressed sympathy for me they encouraged me to finish the work soon i knew i would get all the elements right it was christmas again id disconnected the heater in your car and you were worried about losing the rather menial lectureship that you had finally landed after you arrived with nearly frostbitten fingers id hidden your gloves i arranged for my cousin to stop by blow marijuana smoke in your face shout loudly at you some story about a sports victory and slap you on the back we were having a dinner party read potential job prospect and i lied to you about the arrival time of our guests so you were caught off guard when they came half an hour early i managed to bum the roast anyway later i made insipid comments and quite frequently had no opinion at all although four times i managed to contradict you over matters at hand the brand of the oven the age of alexander dubcek and the cost of pouring a cement patio last summer you bickered with me publicly until you remembered where you were and with whom you were hating me really good by the time your nolongerpotential employer left patrol officer laura deleuse its easier to take on a violation of a restraining order these women dont want to be hassled and have made their demand public record they dont cover up for someone thats causing them corporal injury i put personal interest in carrying out violation of restraining orders one particular weasel was calling a woman twenty times a day at her work her boss had sympathy for her but after a few months it was getting seriously in the way of business what could he do she was going to lose her job i got to know her going over there and taking reports quite often she had a daughter and two kittens two kittens she was just trying to raise her kid a working mom and here was some jerk ruining her life hanging on her doorbell standing outside her window at night and the stupid bastard had his timing down right shed call the station but he never lingered more than three or four minutes after shed noticed him we cant make it in less than five minutes and he knew it he was always gone before we made the scene so who hasnt known somebody pretty unstable even gotten involved with them you only really find out when you try and pull away theres not too much you can do get a restraining order but if somebody wants to harass you make your life miserable if that somebody is making that his career even with bodyguards theres not much to be done but a restraining order is the only way to start thats why i really wanted to get this particular weasel she called and said he was calling her from a pay phone he said that he was watching her that he could see her from where he was in between calls she reached the dispatch unit and i just drove up to that lighted booth recognized him from a mug shot threw him on the hood cuffed him up and case closed this particular woman had great documentation thats what i tell them all write it down where it happened when what was said how many times he rang the doorbell whatever few think to do that first of all you dont want to believe that this person in your life has turned out to be crazy then you just want them to go away it doesnt inspire you to play secretary so when the dv at del mar drive came up again i wasnt happy i was going to get the cold shoulder and the short stockinged legs all over again but i didnt have any choice after the anonymous tip from the neighbor had been received after the first visit such types would usually learn to keep their voices to a provocative growl but this growl had had quite different consequences we walked up the malibulighted path i rang the bell this time it wasnt the husband with the big excuse it was the wife with a little gun it hung off her hand like ripe fruit the elegant chignon had come apart and hair was falling off her shoulders pointing in all directions a ratty knot was caught behind her left ear her stocking had been ripped on one leg it hung nearly down to her ankle beige cobwebs covering her foot she didnt turn her head to avoid my glance this time her face told of a pummeling that was physically painful to see and the front of her blouse i took the gun from her it was easyit just fell into my hand an acrid whiff of gunpowder was in the air and we ran into the house we ran past the chintz lshaped sofa past the library a wing chair was overturned and into the kitchen we looked down the stairs he was lying at the bottom i ran down to check his pulse stepping around a pool of sticky blood surrounding his big back a knife lay close by his side a large german meat knife even without a pulse excluding gray matter or maggot face as even the coroner calls it and oh yes decapitation we cant make a death call even paramedics cant pronounce a death on the scene without pretty obvious physical decomposition this guy was going to get an ambulance like every other dead citizen i wondered which paramedic would be on duty tonight dinner dates had stopped because my social skills apparently werent up to snuff meaning her friends didnt like me i didnt like to think her elitism was so compelling the payoff was still some great compliments id garnered i went back upstairs and started cuffing our suspect she was compliant but i was still glad when it was over and i didnt have to sort of hold hands with her she was talking the whole time too he pushed me down the stairs she was saying he threatened me i had the gun he laughed he said i didnt have the nerve and he came closer and closer kevin wasnt asking her any questions and spontaneous statements are admissible in court didnt sound like she was incriminating herself in any event i sat her down and recited miranda to her anyway selfdefense would be the case made for her no doubt i wondered when the court date would come up and how sleepy id be having to get up in the middle of the day i remembered the details of my first visit to del mar drive i remembered how my social skills were never up to snuff i didnt feel good about seeing her months earlier immune to pain denying that anything had happened to her so maybe this was the natural consequence but why did i have to see it on my beat tonight i could just guess which paramedic would be showing up too i called the supervisor on the radio the sergeant would make notifications the oncall homicide inspector and the oncall photographer would come and id go to the hospital with her for a quick checkup before she got booked on the sixth floor of the hall of justice after id shot you it was so easyyou came after me like attila the hun rattling your saber roaring epithets i felt so relieved it was simple to pull that trigger i aimed for your heart but i think i ended up shooting you in the head your body actually fell on me id run to the bottom of the stairs away from you as id explain later so there you were staining my silk blouse with your blood and gray matter pinning me to the floor i pushed you off me keeping hold of the gun i waited a few minutes standing over you looking at your back not believing that i wouldnt have to follow your orders anymore not believing you were actually dead and knowing that this sort of shock response would be the most believable to the police later theyd take me to the hospital i think i had a broken rib and then to the sixth floor of the hall of justice id done my homework i knew just what would happen to me i would explain to them how the fight started in your study i would say that i grabbed the gun there but actually i had already gotten it that afternoon i wasnt going to take any chances when i finally had you ready with rage but the story began almost a year ago my dear when you the doctor at my most vulnerable and trusting moment i had thought i was losing my mind had sat next to me on the couch and caressed me talking to me about trust and transference since you were my only reality check at the time i was pretty disconcerted i ran out of your office after a few days i decided that my reality check deserved to be researched it was only later that i decided on revenge public records revealed that you had been arrested once on charges of assaulting a woman you were living with but she dropped charges i remembered the name of the building receptionist who had left shortly after i started treatment she was somewhat bitter over sexual misconduct on your part and mentioned that you had gone out with one of your former patients i got her name and called her and then there was your first wife a woman perhaps even angrier than i was youd never abused your doctorclient privilege with her but i found out after interviewing her personally that she had suffered mental and physical torment before getting out of the marriage with no alimony and the minimum of child support you were late with the checks too she didnt know about the distraught exclient who had you arrested but later dropped charges but she did know about the whole life insurance policy youd taken out at thirty when your practice was booming when you were making five even pushing six digits a year and i knew that an insurance policy more than two years old was incontestable to the beneficiaries which at the moment included your son and could include a new wife as we talked it over your former wife and i we decided to call your other former patient the one who had suffered the broken jaw and the cracked ribs when she suggested shed turn you in to the board of medical quality assurance and thats when we all agreed we werent going to turn you in we were going to turn you over patrol officer laura deleuse i hate going to court i hate standing up in front of people and i hated remembering that night i had to sit through a bunch of testimony for the defense before my turn came up seems the guy had beaten up a woman who was an exclient and there was an exwife who had some gruesome stories locked her in a closet while he beat the kid public humiliation rape we got to hear it all and a chorus line of doctors attesting to the multifarious wounds of the defendant it didnt make me want to get up and go to work the next day either so it was open and shut with him coming down the stairs at her like that imminence wasnt even a remote improbability but thats not why i didnt want to remember that night it was the paramedic who strolled up the driveway hung out waiting for the photographer and pretty much ignored me walking right past me like i was a tree i got her out of earshot when she was busy inspecting her manicure and said hi remember me the one you had an affair with last week yeah she looked up and some kind of recognition played across her face oh yeah she said i was there sometimes her social skills werent too good either do i have any regrets no well maybe only one i was a bit hasty in organizing our victory lunch lee your exwife was there and rachel the girl friend shes not only going to get her jaw fixed shes going for a facelift and a phd in media studies lee and i always wanted to learn italian so well buy a villa on capri we chose one already through an estate agent you see what we didnt count on was that accidental death clause that includes selfdefense and awards a double policy weve well endowed every charity that remotely tugged on our heartstrings i was a bit worried about being hasty with the luncheon after all we were supposed to have set eyes on each other only in court and there we were chatting away like old friends after all theyd seen me through bruises and beatings fixed me upand sent me back we were drinking champagne high on the knowledge of total financial security for life jubilant that wed done it ourselves wed never had a conflict about the split either when i saw her that police officer she was behind a pillar lunching in fact with the sourfaced paramedic that had scooped up the gray matter around your head i did something id never done before i looked her straight in the eye and raised my champagne glass to her she spotted me and her eyes swept with mounting recognition across the faces of my luncheon companions i saw her process the whole thing she seemed to freeze but then slowly she turned her back the whole time i was thinking about my research double indemnity double jeopardy and insurance companies that are not mandated to recollect and as she turned around i saw what was in her hand a champagne glass and she raised it toward me the cutting edge by marilyn wallace the cases of police detectives carlos cruz and jay goldstein have entertained readers for several years and such excellent novels as a single stone a case of loyalties and primary target are among the best books of their type the lastnamed combines an excellent puzzle with strong political commentary in addition marilyn wallace is the editor of the very successful sisters in crime series of anthologies ms wallace resides in san anselmo california if i werent ricos mother and if i didnt live miles away i probably would have reacted differently to catherines twosentence note and to the invitation someone slipped this under the gallery door what do you make of it her curlicued scrawl asked the note was paperclipped to an invitation to the opening of porterfields her new art gallery on west st street thursday december seven to nine pm meet the artists etc i was familiar with the text not only because rico was one of the artists but because my new york office happenings east was coordinating the event it wasnt until i turned the invitation over to look at the image on the other side a montage portrait of the three artists each standing in front of one of their paintings that i noticed a gash running from the right edge in toward the center of the card it cut right across the picture of rico the edge of the cut appeared to be smeared with dried blood dried blood surely i was imagining that like my attempts to persuade him to finish his undergraduate studies any implied threat would only make ricofull of promise so damned stubbornmore determined to pursue painting my shudder of fear was his frisson of excitement so what else was new i showed the card to david after twentyfive years of marriage we still count on each other to put a new spin on things he held it close to the light touched his finger to the cut why dont you call rico and see what he thinks id guess its probably just a tear a coffee stain nothing to get worked up about he kissed my cheek he seemed more concerned about my worrying than he was about catherines note i granted the possibility that someone had slipped the note under the gallery door that it had caught on a splinter that perhaps coffee or somethingwine painthad been spilled on it but my anxiety level continued to rise as i dialed ricos number and listened to the phone ring and ring unanswered ive never been very good at waiting and that seemed to be all i could do wait for rico to answer the phone wait for thursday when david and i were scheduled to fly to new york for the opening david was just starting a fournight piano gig at yoshis and couldnt get away earlier by nine oclock despite davids calm assurances i had convinced myself that my new york staff needed my help after all the final mailing had to be done the wine and hors doeuvres ordered the work hung i turned over the details of the california events to my happenings west staff and bought a nightflight ticket from sfo to jfk i sat by the window watching for those staccato glitters of light that are the small towns of nocturnal america i tried to occupy my mind with one of monks atonal melody lines that resolves itself three bars later than i always expect it to and with keeping the plane in the air by the strength of my will after a while convinced that the plane would be fine on its own my mind was free to tend to other things i thought about my friend catherine after struggling for twenty years to gain critical or commercial recognition for her own paintings she had given up a mother for the first time at fortytwo she spent a year at home with michael before she decided that if she couldnt paint at least she would make a place for herself in the art world and open a gallery images of rico kept intruding i remembered the moment i first held him and looked at his red wrinkled fade and knew that my most difficult task as the mother of this miracle would be to learn how to let him go i pictured his delight when he uncurled his fingers from mine and took three steps on his own i recalled the pained confusion when he found out that two of his seventhgrade friends forgot to ask him to go to the movies with them somewhere over nebraska i demoted the torn invitation to a prank perpetrated by some bored artscene crisis junkie no one would want to hurt ricowhy should they i put on the earphones and let the jazz channel distract me the rest of the way across the continent the gray mist that hung over the city welcomed me home the light so familiar that i wanted to embrace it i headed for the first cab in the long yellow line and got in murray feldman number nodded when i gave him catherines brooklyn address i needed to hear what she thought before i laid my motherworries on rico the cab careened into the kennedy exit maze take the van wyck to atlantic avenue i said murray grumbled and pulled into the proper lane and i closed my eyes happy to be cm the ground sooner than i expected the cab turned left onto tenth street and pulled to the curb in a squeal of brakes i squinted to see the meter through the dingy plastic shield thats twentyfour and sixtyeight the cabbie said if youda took the subway you coulda bought a new pair of glasses i love new york i peeled a ten and a twenty from the roll in my wallet and waved away murrays change he flashed me his best youaintabadtipperforabroad smile hey you have a nice day lady he said with enthusiasm i groaned the city was deteriorating losing its old abrasive edge at least park slope a neighborhood of brownstones and gaslights and brave little window boxes hadnt changed much even though david and i moved to california two years earlier i had insisted on keeping the happenings east office open brooklyn still felt like home brooklyn is a state of mind ask walt whitman or marianne moore a genuine brooklyn soul doesnt last too long without forsythia in march egg creams in july and the minimum daily requirement of unidentified particulate matter blowing into your eyes in october catherine more a creature of the ether than of brooklyn met me at the door without makeup her dark eyes and her springy brown curls made her look particularly vulnerable we exchanged hugs and niceties in the entry foyer its oatmealcolored walls lined with japanese artifacts i purposely kept my back to her husbands collection of samurai swords i would wait until we were comfortablein the kitchen where we told all our secretsto ask about the slashed invitation michael led the way down the hall he had a sixteenmontholds roundfaced squatlegged chubbiness and looked somehow already bigger than catherine who was still exotically small no one has ever accused me of being willowy but i can still shop the outlets for sizeten samples still catherine is the one friend who makes me feel like a valkyrie in full armor that hadnt changed in twelve years nor had her questions do you ever sabotage yourself gina she spoke in a whisper as though saying it aloud would make some negative reality more tangible catherine always had questions i used to think of it as a sign of some mild mental disorder a dementia inquisitas manifesting itself in an inability to follow the rules of normal conversation then i discovered that i enjoyed looking for answers to give her i even quite consciously at some point started to ask catherinequestions myself you didnt tamper with that invitation just to get some free publicity for the gallery did you i hadnt slept much that thought must have crept up when my mental censors were off duty maybe this was how catherine lived all the time she made a face your office can manage better publicity than that did you come out early because of that invitation i mean im glad youre here and happy youre working on the event but i think youre overreacting gina i guess i was a little worried at first but now it seems i dont know silly she held out a half sandwich tiny moon shapes scalloping the crust edge about at michaels mouth level and he pulled her hand down to take a bite when he was a toddler rico had settled for nothing less than holding the sandwich in his own dimpled hands ricos age is enough to get some good press featured in a major gallery at twentytwo patrick says theyll call him a wunderkind she laughed a small sound and licked grape jelly from her fingers i asked him if he slipped that invitation under the gallery door and he looked at me like i had finally lost my mind i believe him about not doing it i mean did she mean rico or patrick before i could ask she wrinkled her nose and said i dont have enemies and i doubt that rico does its probably not a threat at all maybe youre right but why was the invitation stained only along that slash with a shrug and a noisy sigh catherine sat in the rocking chair and folded her hands in her lap madonna becalmed i drank my coffee and remembered that april day seven months earlier when catherine and i sat on the steps in front of her brownstone hands wrapped around mugs of hot coffee we had pretended that the sun was warm but it was our friendship that felt so good did you ever wish rico would disappear catherine had said just be unborn i mean not ever have been born a real catherinequestion not once not ever i said unable to entertain the notion of no rico the stone steps felt cold hard i stopped painting when i got pregnant her dark eyes had looked into my very heart as though she were asking me to change something rico will never have to face that now as i sat in her kitchen i wondered whether she would blame michael later secretly for this transformation from painter to purveyor of paintings michael plopped himself at her feet and she reached down and stroked his cheek the gallery has to work the rest isnt enough for me she said the silver gleam of the sky framed by the window behind her hurt my eyes not enough how intellectually emotionally i asked she was quiet catherines pauses took some getting used to it was her timing i had learned not my fault just her way i want to soar i dont soar at home catherine wanted a poet to play his words in accompaniment to her rapture to join her in freedom from the law of gravity arent things good with you and patrick i had meant to ask her if she soared in her marriage it hadnt come out that way staying home i dont get much you know stimulation during the day at first when i told him my ideaabout the gallerypatrick said he wanted me to stay home with michael for a few more years her face was lost behind those wild curls but then he changed his mind just like that hes even financing the first twelve months that sounds good almost too good i thought patrick indulged this whim too readily and helped catherine give up on herself as a painter so when the gallery opens youll be happy catherine stood stretched on her toes and reached both arms up her fingers pointing i expected her to lift off the ground and float to the ceiling to beat her wings against the window until someone opened it and let her out to catch the smoky november wind moving among the citys spires mostly she said i guess mostly i left catherines and wheeled my suitcase down the street just a tear nothing to get worked up over david had said i think youre overreacting catherine had told me probably they were right and i had fixed on this for some motherreason born of my struggle to let my son live his own life surely rico would consider my worries proof of a relapse into the role of overprotective mother with an overactive imagination he was after all a grownup a man whose dark hair longlashed brown eyes broad shoulders and narrow hips are attractive to women his natural reserve gives way easily to his genuine interest in people he keeps himself in cadmium yellow by working at a record store called riffs shelters neighborhood strays likes old movies and returns library books on time hes good but not perfect what he hasnt yet acquired even after two years in new york is an everyday instinct for selfpreservation he lives mainly on salami and mallomars and would never buy a new toothbrush unless his old one fell into the toilet he rides the subway at all hours falls in and out of love with the most terrific woman several times a year and is determined to be a painter and not acquire any credentialed marketable skills we all have our blind spots and i had to allow rico his and keep mine from getting in his way i resolved not to mention the slashed stained picture i set my bag in front of the grillwork gate pressed the buzzer looked through the justbelowstreetlevel window inside a tiffany table lamp glowed in the midday pallor ribbons of light fell to the floor through a jungle of foliage in lieu of paying rent to david and me rico has been restoring the threelevel brownstone to its original victorian glory he calls the jungle room the conservatory shades of colonel mustard the room was empty the tips of my fingers curled toward my palms in an attempt to get warm the cold bit at my toes through the thin leather of my pumps which had been fine for the degrees id left in california then ricos face appeared in the window his expression leaping from wariness to surprise and finally settling into a broad smile i hoped he would still be smiling in fifteen minutes i hugged him his face felt good against my chilled cheek he smelled good when he pulled back i noticed a scrap of toilet paper stanching a shaving cut on his jaw i suppressed a shudder and began i tried to call last night but you werent home and riffs was closed i didnt decide i was coming until late about nine california time so much for urbane patter he set my suitcase beside the hall table a spindlylegged affair sporting a drop cloth covered with plaster dust you could have had dad call me or something i know this is your house but you said youd give me some notice i didnt expect you until thursday it was a lame excuse clearly i had lost some ground in the struggle to let go im sorry for the lack of warning on cue a rumpled little redhead wrapped in a wrinkled terrycloth robe appeared at the top of the stairs mom this is laura she plays keyboards for the rompettes laura this is my mom gina capobella laura smiled and said hello and disappeared another of his womenwed discussed safe sex since he was fifteen but maybe we needed a little brushup talk about safe relationships he hung my coat on a brass hook in the hall and we went into the kitchen his mouth was tight his shoulders up around his ears he lit a burner on the stove and set a teakettle over the flame in the tense silence i heard my own breathing and the pounding water filling the upstairs bathtub i hope lauras not in any hot water i said emphasizing the key phrase as i pointed at the ceiling in the general direction of the bathroom ricos face was blank his silence stony he was turning down the invitation to our old game i hope shes not in too deep i said giving it one last try the corners of his mouth edged into a smile shes prepared to sink or swim on her own he said shell talk about it when shes ready to come clean we both grinned but i knew that punning our way to familiar ground was only a start rico had lived in this house on his own since his twentieth birthday two years ago it was peremptory to claim territorial prerogatives on such short notice i really should have tried harder to call maybe you could think of my being here as a doublereverse emptynest syndrome i offered youve been reading good housekeeping again thats dangerous he lifted a serrated knife out of its slot and cut a french bread in half very funny listen im quiet in the mornings and i might even be persuaded to make you some bracciola i smiled sweetly home cooking and word games cant make everything all right mom its good when your kid keeps you honest reminds you that youve done a decent job of it knife in hand he hugged me and then set to piling turkey cheese lettuce mustard and mayo on the bread he sawed through the huge tower with a knife then scooped the sandwiches onto plates and carried them to the table does this visit have anything to do with catherine shes seemed a little weird or something the past couple of days she desperately wants the gallery to be a success i thought it would put her at ease if i was here every word true but sins of omission would surely be my undoing they felt too much like getting away with something shes more anxious about the gallery than i thought concern for my friendhis friend toocreased his brow what a face not only a mother could love it its been so hard on her trying to make it as a painter shes giving up her dreams dont you thinkwhat that he should give up before hes given it a try what are you trying to tell your childthat shes entitled to be a little weird rico didnt answer enough water for me to have some tea ricos friend her face scrubbed and sparkling but her hair still a wiry auburn tangle stood in the doorway the terrycloth robe had been traded for jeans a citrusgreen turtleneck and a tattered purple sweater that looked big enough for her to hold a party in rico wiggled his eyebrows like groucho marx then disappeared into the pantry and emerged with a teabag dangling between two fingers almond sunset for you my lovely you two look just like each other the girl made a circle of her thumb and forefinger and held it up to her right eye closing her left eye as though she were looking through a lens id recognize you anywhere not just from the pictures but because your mouth is so much like ricos and your eyes its neat she put one hand in her lap propped her head on the other fist and watched rico prepare the tea what kind of music do the rompers play i envisioned a band for the sesame street set somehow this pretty sleepy woman didnt seem the type but maybe the small ruby stud in her left nostril gave the wrong impression rompettes ska laura smiled benignly at my blank look you know kind of like world beat or reggae were not very good but my boyfriend is making a documentary about us hes studying filmmaking nyu graduate level ricos back was to me this was a little confusing her boyfriend interesting i said rico looked over his shoulder and smiled interesting was a longshared code for judgment temporarily deferred he got very intense a couple of weeks ago watching me like he was framing every action for a sceneit made me nuts so i came here and got my mother to promise not to tell him where i was with the unlisted phone here i dont even have to talk to him unless i want to the quiet feels healing i guess youd say in california rico was terrific to offer me a place she got up and stood behind rico massaging his shoulders so she was another of his strays not a romantic relationship at all i never met her boyfriend rico said as he set the teapot on the table but she swears hes handsomer than me well he is anyway you cant compare dark and dashing with blond and brooding laura stared at her crimsontipped nails and then arranged her face in a smile are you staying long she asked me i told her i would be in brooklyn until the day after the gallery opening the three of us sipped our tea and talked about friends and school the art scene and old neighbors rico showed me the five paintings hed be exhibiting at porterfields they were abstract with the suggestion of a face serving as the focal point for each this ones a selfportrait he said pointing to the largest canvas i balanced my swelling pride with the desire to shield him from the frustrations of being a painter catherine and patrick were doing things right with the gallery rico said except that patrick got stuck in traditional thinking sometimesbut what else could you expect from someone whose family had lived in the hudson valley since rip van winkle went to sleep she needed someone like that i said to gaze at her fondly while she explored her place in the arts by thursday morning i had sublimated any leftover worries about rico with vast and unnecessary expenditures of energy despite the presence of my willing and competent staff i took care of everything personally i hired the harpist selected the champagne calculated the number of hors doeuvres tested the lighting and called my media contacts only a few times during those hectic days did i catch myself staring at rico memorising the details of his face the angle of his cheekbones the ridge of his jaw the clear taut skin only one last detail to settlewhat to wear do you like this one better i swirled into the kitchen with what i hoped was the grace of a runway model in the bulky gray suit with the leather trim i felt more like a no contest the white jumpsuit my boyfriend says white is the ultimate sophistication he wants me to wear white all the time he says it enhances inner purity laura wrinkled her nose tugged at the collar of her houndstooth jacket pulled down the sleeve of her cinnamonandnutmeg striped jersey maybe wear the green silk i like what it does for your eyes that sounded nice what about you rico youre the star what are you wearing i asked rico who had become involved with a cleaver garlic celery and bok choy said through his gritted teeth ive done okay dressing myself for the past two years mom ill figure out something that told me mothers are supposed to care about these things rico laura gave ricos cheek a pinch before she turned to me if you wear the silk you need some outrageous earrings im going to see my boyfriend before i go to the opening so remind me before i leave and ill lend you mine did she mean the safety pins or the christmas ornaments i was saved from a reply by the insistent shrill of the doorbell i unlocked the inner door a blast of arctic air swept into the vestibule as i opened the grill work gate shivering i moved aside to let a grapecolored woolen bundle step in catherines face was barely visible between the wool beret and the scarf pulled up around her nose her eyes warned that this was not a simple social call come into the kitchen and stand by the stove i said she didnt budge with her gloved hand she reached into her coat pocket and handed me an envelope someone slipped this under the gallery door early this morning i just found it i opened the envelope and pulled out a folded page from the new york post entertainment section greatthey were doing a piece on the gallery not the times to be sure but maybe after the opening i unfolded the page rico face centered in front of one of his paintings stared up at me a slash outlined in reddish brown sliced through the page dried blood or cranberry juice it hardly mattered the intent was clear enough this doesnt feel like a prank catherine someone is sending a message that they intend to hurt rico or me or the gallery her eyes downcast she jammed her hands into her pockets ricos not the only possible target and no i dont know anyone who thinks rico cheated them out of a place in the show patrick already asked me that exasperated with her selfindulgence and fearful for rico i sent her home and called frankie fretelli an old friend with an nypd desk job if i brought along some johnnie walker black instead of art gallery white wine frankie said hed come to the opening and keep an eye on things david would be there too if the weather didnt delay his flight wed all keep our eyes open now despite my neat avoidance of the subject rico would have to be told i could no longer convince myself that it was just a prank perhaps professional jealousy was the poison here how many times had catherine pointed out how young rico was other artists embittered after years of struggle might also resent ricos success the delicious smell of vegetables sizzling in sesame oil filled the kitchen rico stirred them then grated fresh ginger into the wok was that catherine i thought i heard her voice but it sounded kind of funny time to plunge in lettuce begin i thought shes worried she uh orange you going to tell him i demanded of myself she found a newspaper article slipped under the galleiy door a picture of you and one of your paintings it was cut and the edge was stained with something that looked like dried blood rico dribbled tamari over the vegetables and i went on thats the second time the first was eight days ago it looks like someone is threatening you rico he set the wooden stirrer on the stove me who would threaten me his bewilderment was genuine i hated asking him to think the way id been thinking off and on for the past week but i had to another artist maybe someone whose girl you stole someone you had an argument with at the record store with each suggestion he shook his head none of the above listen i get to have my first gallery opening once in my life and nobodyno nameless enemy no one playing jokesnobody is going to keep me from enjoying it he smiled at me and stopped just short of admonishing me to do the same it was ten after five when the taxi deposited me at the curb in front of the gallery fat snowfiakes drifted lazily to the ground dusting everything with a sugary whiteness no wind temperature hovering near thirty if i could let go of the nagging anxiety that had kept me company all afternoon the weather might even feel festive i pushed open the door and surveyed the gallery the minifioods cast an even untinted light on the paintings white movable walls arranged with enough angles to keep the space from feeling predictable carried attention to the paintings rather than to the room itself false modesty aside catherine and i had done a superb job of hanging this show and of placating artists egos sensitive to such questions as which was the better wall and what critics would see first when they entered the gallery ricos large canvases those faces emerging from abstract swirls of strong clear colors hung at the far end of the room to the left of the door a profusion of tiny paintingsflorals a la o keeffe but signed siandradotted the wall on the right ken arties monochromatic detailed landscapes of new england scenes served as somber balance the total effect was stunning hello anybody here i called ill be out in a moment the voice was exactly as i remembered a rich baritone a little haughty but approachable redolent of old money and harvard i brushed the snow from my hair and peeled off my gloves took off my coat and shook it very fetching you look like a mary cassatt highnecked demure dress dark eyes patrick was tall goldenhaired and polished if he had been bald he would have resembled an oscar statuette wearing a gray wool suit thanks i think how do you like it i said sweeping my arm to take in the whole room a flicker of something i didnt understand shone in his eyes youve both done a fine job of it he said fine i gathered my coat and walked toward the small rear office thinking about faint praise and damning myself for not pursuing my uneasiness over his feelings about the gallery catherines a little nervous about tonight i said as i deposited the johnnie walker in a desk drawer shes done a wonderful job she has some terrific artists even if you do say so yourself his voice was flat when i walked back into the gallery he was standing in front of one of ricos paintings arms crossed against his chest the habitual skeptics pose his head was tilted considering that he was a corporate attorney his hair curled toward his collar in an almost decadent way the man had taste this was the painting on the invitation the one in the newspaper catherine and rico had chosen carefully it was the best work rico had ever done the painting surged with compressed power that swept the eye to the upper left quadrant where a web of magenta lines delineated eyes nose mouth and a spidery jumble of hair amid the gradations of blue and gray if i squinted it really did resemble rico particular about titles he had called it feature this im terribly oldfashioned patrick said stepping back from the canvas i believe that paintings should be of recognizable things that music should have a melody one can hum and that books should tell a story and that women belong in the kitchen and the bedroom i wondered well then its a good thing catherine has such an eclectic trio of artists something for everyone you might say oldfashioned doesnt mean ineducable maybe someday ill get the point of these paintings patricks smile made him look less like the portrait of a disapproving mather paterfamiliascotton not jerryand more like someone my friend catherine might fall in love with anything i can do to help he asked thanks but its all under control bound to be surprisesthere always arebut as far as i can tell theres nothing to do now patricks gaze swept the room how about if i dice up this meat he said as he held up a crusty wrinkled italian salami the caterer would kill me if i let anyone else touch her food the knife lay on the table gleaming fiercely in the light i wanted to hide it throw it away the door swung open and the harpist and her unwieldy burden stumbled in i pointed her to a corner to practice and busied myself with checking artists statements price lists champagne glasses half listening as she brought davids composition to life the music was solid lithe fanciful substantial the notes flew around the room or marched as the theme changed i couldnt wait to see david i shifted some of my anxiety to concern about his plane landing in the snow pushed away the imagined sight of ricos face with a raw scar running down his cheek left my worries in one corner of my mind while i attended to the problem of the three cases of chablis that had arrived instead of the champagne id ordered by six fortyfive the caterers assistant had replaced the wine everything else was in order and i was holding davids hand his tumbled hair glistened with snow and his smile as the music spilled from the harp thrilled me nearly as much as his whispered description of how he intended to make up for lost time i had just finished telling him about this mornings slashed newspaper when the door flew open and catherine hurried in stomping her feet and rubbing her hands this is terrible no ones going to come out in this weather the press will be covering the first snow of the season and the opening will be a flop the whole thing is a terrible idea and the critics are going to crucify me she shrugged out of her coat mumbling all the way to the back room in fact it had crossed my mind that the weather might keep some people away i wondered if our correspondent would show up unless he she was already here nonsense the same reporters dont cover snow and gallery openings you know that the guest list is loaded with people with a personal interest in you the artists or being seen at the new and happening place and tonight my dear this is it catherine tried not to smile you really think so im sure of it patrick took her in his arms you look wonderful your artists are marvelous and porterfields is going to be a success so supportive for someone who just a while ago told me how much he favored traditional values at least in art and music just then the door tinkled and a round woman swathed in a rainbow of gauzy stuff a gold turban wound around her head undulated toward the coat rack catherine she purred the ten of pentacles in the future spot i did a reading on the gallery and thats what it said pentacles money money money the tarot never lies she blew on her fingers and frowned isnt it cold in here the thermostat was set for seventy but the red temperature indicator pointed to sixty this was one of those things that ages an event coordinator beyond the mere passage of time like the broken water pipe outside the central park tent where four elephants were waiting for their cue in the benefit performance of aïda this was something i had to fix i soon discovered that the only piece of electrical equipment not on a circuit breaker was the furnace by the time i found a fuse installed it and then made the necessary repairs to my dress and makeup the party was well under way i scanned the bright noisy crowd for rico a man in a dark suit and white shirt nodded to me one of frankies nypd buddies no doubt any others would be easy to spot too the invited guests dressed along a fashion continuum from hells angels chic to kamali slouch with hardly any room for brooks brothers faux or vrai i finally spotted rico on the other side of the room i would not transmit my worries to him i would not tonight of all nights be the hovering overprotective mother i would not ruin this celebration the lighting and the harp music and the tinkle of glasses and conversation were festive i couldnt help smiling as rico elegant in a camelcolored sweater and dark slacks walked through the crowd toward me you want a name tag how about capobellas mother rico his arm around david grinned down at me frankie fretelli stood nearby clutching his glass half filled with amber liquid a chiaroscuro mom in a rocking chair no thanks i hugged rico a little longer than he would have liked but a little shorter than would have pleased me he was beautiful radiating pleasure from his smile from his perfect unmarred skin the paintings look wonderful i whispered as i kissed his cheek and squeezed his arm thanks so do you he kissed me back then a leatherskirted lady appeared slipped her arm through his and led him into a thicket of wellwishers in the middle of the floor frankie stuck close behind him youre ricos friend a blueeyed platinumhaired classically handsome young man stood beside me a smile crinkled his face in his right hand he held a champagne flute the cast on his left arm was cradled in a sling as fresh and white as his shirt and the scarf around his neck how did you know i saw the two of you talking he shifted his arm i nodded i would make pleasant talk with this fellow and not pursue rico with my eyes all over the room i hope youre not lefthanded and not a painter im not a painter im an aficionado a particular fan of ricos he sipped from the champagne glass can i get you some thanks no i craned my neck to look for davids tousled head which should have been towering above the crowd i caught catherines eye she beamed back a message of gratitude so ricos living with his girlfriend now right they must be really serious about each other i mean to be living together the young mans gaze flitted around the room resting for microseconds here and there then he turned to look at me his eyes were blue intense and direct the conversation had taken a decidedly personal turn what did you say your name was peter peter webster harp music wafted through the din the angel with blond hair and a cast on his arm grinned at me but before i could say anything rico materialized at my right side his worried eyes scanned the crowd you see laura yet i thought shed be here by now shell be here soon i assured him now i could worry about her too i expected that laura who had seemed almost as excited about the opening as rico would have been here an hour ago his leatherclad lady called his name and he winked at me and walked away he hadnt said a word to this supposed friend standing beside me not even hello youve known rico a long time i smiled because it seemed the thing to do weve got a mutual friend he said his pale face expressionless youre his mother arent you my smile this time was genuine it shows doesnt it since rico came into my life i cant work cant concentrate before i could ask why he turned and was gone maneuvering through the crowd to the large silver coffee urn hed said he was a fan but he never really said a fan of the paintings it was rico himself he had a crush on rico and rico trying to discourage peter was ignoring him i stepped back to let someone pass and almost bumped into catherine the times critic told someone that rico is aquotebright new talentunquote she said i really am soaring and she drifted away not quite on the ground the crowd should have been thinning but apparently reluctant to go out into the snow they continued to pick over the last crumbs of pat and drain the last sips of wine rico was at my side again beaming as the front door flew open theres laura i wonder how things worked out with her boyfriend she was going to tell him that shes ready to start seeing him again snow swirling around her head laura waved and stepped inside rico went to greet her i let out my breath and relaxed the evening was almost over david was here laura was here and no one had tried to cut ricos face rico and laura swept toward the champagne table as i followed their progress i noticed the young man peter whatshisname standing with his back to ricos largest canvas sling knotted at his neck peter held his good arm up his thumb and forefinger closed into a circle and he held the circle up to his eye as though he were looking through a lens as laura had that first morning i met her her filmmaker boyfriend he was neither admirer nor art aficionado his questions now made sense not like catherinequestions at all but attempts to trick me into offering him information to confirm his suspicions i was half a room away peter backed up two large steps his fingers still held to his eye like a makebelieve camera the air vibrating with chatter and laughter and harp music parted as i pushed my way toward peter a glint of light caught an object in his right hand a silver pen perhaps or a cigarette lighter or a knife he took a step toward one of ricos paintings arm raised stop i screamed as i pushed past three people who stood frozen between me and peter i was two steps away when peters arm came down dragging the knife across a corner of the canvas i could almost hear the imageface scream could almost feel the ooze of warm blood and fluid leak through the rent cloth peter pulled the knife out and raised his arm again i grabbed his elbow and slid my hand down to his forearm i dug my thumb into the soft inner flesh of his wrist the knife clattered to the floor and i snatched it up what are you doing i snapped someone took the knife from me frankie clamped his beefy hand on peters good arm i was evening the score peter said his body slack as frankie led him toward the door a little suffering a little pain for both of them for the hurt i feel every time i think of them together his misplaced jealousy and those sad beautiful eyes filled his twisted angelface shocked and pale rico put his arm around me my painting im glad you he shook his head and drew me closer we watched laura run to peter tears spilled over onto her cheeks when peter shrugged away from her touch poor girl all she had wanted was some quiet i turned away from her pain and found myself staring at the square white card beside the painting in neat letters dark and clear it announced the title of the painting feature this the selfportrait ricos face had been slashed mom its a pretty small rip rico said examining the canvas dont get all torn up about it you stopped him just in the nick of time i didnt feel at all casual but i joined the old game anyway maybe someday what happened tonight will seem like just another slice of life rico hugged me a good long time and then smiled sadly i wonder if its always like this out here on the cutting edge looking for thelma by gillian slovo born in south africa gillian slovo has lived in england since she was twelve a journalist and television producer she has written several excellent mystery novels featuring londonbased kate baeier including morbid symptoms and death by analysis i was in the middle of doing my accounts when the doorbell rang or to be more accurate my accounts were in the middle of doing me the center column was being cooperative it was the ones either side of it that were making trouble the bell sounded again i ignored it i didnt feel like visitors and besides id just made a momentous decision id decided to compromisea few pence to the left subtracted from the right would achieve the proper balance it wasnt entirely on the level but if the customs and excise noticed all they would learn was what they must already knownamely that i couldnt add to save my life the door was open a timid voice said frowning at the distraction i looked toward the door my eyes came to rest not on a face but on a wide patentleather belt i shifted my gaze upward the man in front of me was hugenearer to seven than to six feetwith a body to match he was made to be noticed and he flaunted the fact he had shaved his head clean and his bald pate shone a deep black against the rest of his clothes it was quite an outfithis threepiece suit was tailored to fit his broad frame and sewed from all colors of the rainbow a broad silver tie nestled under the garish waistcoat and a pair of shining black shoes that seemed to go on forever had silver buckles the size of my hands i gulped the door was open he said again the voice was not only small but melodic with it on the principle that there was no point in antagonizing giants even ones with ingratiating voices i threw a smile his way my neck hurt with the effort of twisting so i stood in an attempt to equalize the distance he strode toward me the man was big real big and close up he towered above me there was no point in competing i sat can i help you i asked good i thought my voice sounds normal he smiled and the long graybrown scar that ran the full length of his left cheek smiled with him he lowered himself onto the chair in front of me and planted two huge fists on my desk i backed away and hit the wall with my head i rubbed it surreptitiously i hope you can help he said i turned the rub into an encouraging nod and waited i was ready for anything i want you to find somebody for me he said name of thelma something clicked in my head so tangibly that i bet i lost a hundred thousand brain cells making the connection got it in one i thought smiling cynically i leaned my chair against the wall and stretched my legs out so that my feet landed on the desk right in the middle of my accounts book my only regret was that i didnt have a cigarette to hang out of the side of my mouth and complete the impression and whats your name i asked moose by any chance he looked puzzled moose he thought about it a bit no martin martin malloy i smiled again and this time the cynicism was not an act that figures i said he leaned across and shifted my feet to the right uncovering the columns of numbers his thick index finger pointed at the center row but this doesnt he said youve inverted one of those numbers there in the middle easily done i returned my legs to the ground and pulled the book nearer to me meaning to close it but i couldnt help looking at where his finger had once been and i couldnt help seeing that he was right i frowned he grinned almost by way of apology im good at figures he explained always have been and i learned to read upside down when i was inside youve been in prison then i stated he nodded and this thelma put you there his brow creased and i remembered his size and the scar that creased in its redness on his cheek he was no longer doing an impression of the genial giant i had angered him i pulled at the telephone wire edging the instrument closer to me thelma didnt put me there he said in fact if anybody got me out it was thelma he glared at me i dont like people who say bad things about thelma he concluded with a supreme effort of will i fixed his eyes with mine i kept looking at him while i nudged the receiver off the phone and let it drop on my lap i rested my hand on the headless phone thanking the heavens that i now had digital dialing his frown deepened tell me more i said in a voice that was more fear than fake i hit the first nine on the phone while i tried to work out whether i could manage to make a successful break for the door in one effortless motion he reached across the desk and pulled the receiver from my lap he put it down on the desk he stretched across again he put a finger on one of the buttons and pressed it down that makes two nines he said youve only got to dial one more and youre connected go ahead i wont stop you the brain cells were going fast by now it was a dare i thought hed get me before my first cry for help he was toying with me and probably enjoying it and yet what option did i have i was isolated and alone up in my grimy office in the center of london a cry for help wafting to the street would be cause for a quickening of pace rather than investigation i had no choice without the phone i had no line to the world i lifted my hand slowly as the seconds expanded i could try it i thought and maybe id succeed my hand began to shake im really a gentle guy he said slowly watching that hand my size militates against me but i wouldnt harm a fly certainly not a woman thats for sure and whats that i asked using the poised finger to point at his scar shaving accident he shrugged and i saw how the rocks in his shoulders bulged prisons a rough place he said it makes you or it breaks you and it made you thelma made me he said thats why i want to find her we were both back in fiction land i replaced the receiver on the phone and breathed out i no longer felt scared only foolisha foolishness tinged with anger he was a pro i thought a real good actor and i might as well face the fact that he had me he and whoever had sent himand i had a good idea as to who that was well all i had to do was get rid of him finish my accounts close the office for perhaps the last time and then be free to wreak my own kind of revenge but id do it subtly i thought i reached into the top drawer of my desk and pulled out a pad as a heading i chose the name m malloy i underlined it it looked better that way on the next line i inscribed the name thelma in block capitals parsons he said thelma parsons a dancer i asked without looking up a social worker he said he blinked but she did like to dance she showed me pictures of herself when she was a kid all dressed up in a white tutu she was social worker i wrote failed ballet dancer thelma never failed at anything he said loudly it was the first time he had raised his voice i smiled placatingly it took two to tango i thought and i was finally in step i wasnt going to break my rhythm for any fake display of righteous anger by a giant gullible enough to involve himself in one of sams pranks why dont you tell me the whole story i suggested he leaned back in the chair it creaked he frowned and began to toy with the gold watch fob that was attached to his waistcoat thelma liked to visit me in prison he began she turned me on to books i glanced up and my eyes strayed to my accounts he laughed or at least i think that was what described the creaking that issued from his big mouth not those kind he said i always had a knack with them thats what got me into trouble in the first place no thelma revealed the world of literature to me social worker reforms con by opening his eyes to the joys of the nineteenth century i wrote modern literature he said loudly i gulped i kept forgetting that he could read upside down it changed my whole world view he continued opened new horizons i want to be able to thank her not in the claustrophobia of prison but in the real world in the free world free world i thought more like anticommunist modern literature then so go round to her office and thank her i said he shook his head unhappily shes left her job he said she was never happy with it it cramped her style she said and now shes had the courage to leave they wont tell me where she wentthey dont do that on principle in case some excon has a grudge against them and you want me to find her i stated thats it he said delighted that the slow pupil had finally caught on and then you will thank her he nodded he reached a fist into a pocket of his garish plaid suit here comes the punch line i thought he placed a piece of paper in front of me right side up on it was written the name thelma parsons along with an address in islington thats where thelma used to work i asked for reply he reached once more into his pocket ahaa i thought here it comes i was wrong again in front of me dead in front he placed a wad of new bank notes i stared at him and he smiled i picked up the notes and felt their crispness two hundred and fifty pounds he said retainer is that what they said it would cost i asked they he frowned i resolved in future not to aggravate the scar its a guess he continued your retainer plus something toward expenses give me a record when you finish and ill settle up with you im good at figures you know i didnt say anything and he had finished as well i watched as he stood up and began to stride to the door i suppose that youll be in touch with me rather than leaving me your address i said he turned thats right he said circumstances have conspired to make me a bit of an itinerant at the moment he waved a hand in my direction before turning away again ill be in touch he said one more thing i called just as he had bent his head down far enough to fit ever read any chandler no i havent he replied without bothering to look back and my reading days are over i only want to thank thelma and then i can get on with my life they were conveniently seated around the kitchen table when i arrived all three of them the ones i had decided were guilty sam was doing what he liked bestexplaining in laypersons terms a particularly neat solution to the latest spacetime continuum problemwhile anna and daniel were doing what they did bestpretending to understand into this cozy scene i strolled i took a swig from the half bottle of bells id picked up on the way bad day sam asked i shoved the bottle into my jacket pocket it bulged in the linen but you cant have everything at least i was suitably crumpled i thought i shook my head great day i said i was having problems balancing the books but moose solved that for me they looked at one another and the first hint of a doubt insinuated itself into my mind they were giving a good impression of confusion i thought but then i discarded the thought anna and daniel must surely have picked up some tips from the actors they directed and as for sam well hed learned impassivity from years of teaching aspirant nobel winners i changed tack i reached into my bag pulled out the wad of money and threw it at them it landed just where i had wanted it to plum in sams lap both anna and daniel stretched across the table to get a better look nice crisp notes daniel commented did this moose rob a bank maybe sam did i said lets ask him sam looked at the notes in that abstracted way he had moose he said speculatively the big sleep farewell my lovely daniel said impatiently i thought mathematicians were literate these days sam opened his mouth to defend himself i decided that it was time to stop playing i know you think i should give up the business i said as a matter of fact i was coming to the same conclusion myself but sending a ninefoot moose to my office is not what i call a subtle hint nor is it funny this time there was no mistaking the confusion in their eyes i knew them well these three and they knew me they wouldnt i thought continue the game this far would they except he said his name was martin i told them in a voice that was no longer so certain martin malloy looking for thelma they glanced briefly at one another but they didnt speak i saw annas eyes come to rest on my jacket pocket the concern in her eyes spoke of her innocence spoke of all their innocence i gulped took the whiskey out walked to them and deposited it on the table i pulled myself a chair and sat heavily on it i better start again i said i told them all about it each piece of stinted dialogue and by the time i had finished i was sure they werent involved which left me with a problem a big one so who sent him i asked they had no answer to that and neither did i like most individuals i knew people who didnt like me and i knew people i didnt like but they could hardly be called enemies not the kind who would go to such elaborate lengths to hoax menever mind produce crisp new ones to aid them any dissatisfied clients daniel asked no disatisfied clientsno clients at all come to think of it so what are you going to do annas voice broke into my reverie i drew myself up straight as if i had already made the decision that was only then forming in my brain investigate i answered find thelma what else can i do what if the moneys stolen i shrugged i guess ill cross that bridge when i come to it i said i picked up the bottle of bells and dropped it lightly into the dustbin lets celebrate with a real whiskey i said now that im no longer filing for a divorce from the lot of you i was nicely oiled by the time i arrived at tonys golders green office street times was peopled by hacks like tony whod wakened up one day to the realization that their ulcers were never going to get any smaller a few of them got together and decided that if they were going to start developing bosses diseases they might as well be their own bosses theyd started a londonbased magazine thatnow in its middle ageno longer tried to compete for the youth market in a way i suppose they were one of the few remaining relics of the sixties although they had long since grown away from nostalgia or angst and had settled instead for what they could do in a world grown increasingly hostile their new offices were however not exactly friendly workaday would be a better description sited between a dorothy perkins and a grimy solicitor with a smell courtesy of grodzinski the baker giving the only hint of atmosphere i made a mental note to pick up a sliced rye and some cheese danish as i located tony in his glass cubicle his shirt sleeves i observed were held up by rubber bands still preserving the image i commented tony glanced up from his computer and shot what for him approximated a smile bloody kid bit the buttons off he said and how is she this time the smile was definite great he gushed catching himself he ran a hand through his mousey brown hair for a monster want a coffee if it comes with a danish i said tony frowned they make them by machine now he said in some warehouse out in bromley the smells bottled to give us the impression that the good old days are still with us m pass then i said i perched myself on the edge of his desk and peered around in an attempt to read his screen impressive symbols i said street times going postmodernist tony moved the screen away accounts he said curtly he didnt need to say more i knew all about accounts which brought me to my business name of martin malloy mean anything to you i asked tony yawned im losing my knack he said youre no longer even bothering with the foreplay he yawned again you used to at least pretend to be giving me something in exchange for my gems of information he explained but since weve been exiled to the green i suppose you think i come cheap i shrugged nothing much to offer i said business is slow slow to get off the ground or slow to die the latter well in that case tony said he hit a cue on his keyboard and the machine began to whir bloody noisy this new technology he said now lets see if the data base moved with us he typed fast with two fingers malloy he said out loud martin mr i waited while he squinted his eyes at the screen and then a few seconds later he hit a key and the bytes of information stopped rolling thought i remembered him tony said an interesting case martin malloy so he actually existed i thoughtinteresting indeed martin aka mouse malloy tony offered mouse a reference to his size never met him but apparently hes on the big side you could say that and mouse as well on account of the fact that he never talked to the cops tonys eyes scanned rapidly down the screen malloys a genius with numbers he said when his face first hit the front pages the gutter press got excited and tried to pin an idiotsavant label on him he wouldnt play ball so they dumped him what was their interest in the first place i asked malloy was associated with some east end hoods tony answered part of a crack gangyou know the scenenew york comes to london the word was that the police picked the mouse up in an attempt to get him to finger the big men he didnt and someone started to kick up a stink about habeas corpus the cops eventually got themselves out of trouble by persuading the inland revenue to charge him with tax evasion tax evasion tony grinned modern innit the case against him was weak but all the jury saw was a giant and a black giant to boot who refused to talk they threw the book at him sad really although by the sounds of his physique hed have no trouble in jail i thought about the scar and wondered any woman involved i asked tony hit another key not that i can see he rolled the screen on again and then finding nothing wiped it clear want me to check this out further if you have the time tony yawned again sure he said ill be in touch if he didnt finish the sentence he started up on his computer again that was it no goodbye he had done with me it wasnt personaltony never was one for social niceties and i knew hed contact me if he found anything of interest and besides who was i to stand between a man and his collectives accounts i left him to them or tried to id forgotten how much tony liked to hold his conversations in transit kate he called when i was almost at the door i turned maybe you should let the business die he said i shrugged and left i spent the evening on my ownalone that is so long as you dont count my alto i counted it id just had the whole thing resprung and i spent a few hours rediscovering both its range and my limitations i usually played to get away from work but this time i failed an image of a man they called the mouse kept weaving its way through the blues i played i saw him as he stood there in my office his bright clothes contrasting with those sad eyes a man with no home trapped for tax evasion i was beginning to feel sorry for himsorry that i had treated his visit as a hoax sorry that i hadnt asked him more that i thought was why i liked the joband why i would miss it so much when i was forced to close it wasnt often that you get the opportunity to meet giants who want to thank their social worker for introducing them to literature thelma must be quite a woman i thoughtcertainly more trusting than i i should have been more friendly i should have tried harder i shook my head moved the beat up tempo to fit with my version of south african township jazz and put a brake on my regrets thelma if she existed was the social worker not me i would try and find her thats all i could do i had enough troubles of my own i had the business to worry about without noticing i slipped back into the blues it was hot when i got up the kind of heat that visits london once every thirteen years i opened the wardrobe in the hall the one where i stored the clothes i never got a chance to wear and stared at the uninspiring choices in the end i decided to go for broke fitted myself out in a tight black cotton skirt and flimsy pink tshirt threw a pair of thonged sandals on my feet and took a jacket for protection from the vagaries of the english climate the flimsy pink number was already showing signs of wilting when i arrived at the address martin malloy had given me whats more it clashed with my destination the building was plum in the middle of the arsenal a cheerful item if ever i saw one it was round and squat and red and yellowa low thing in the middle of a long row of detached gray brick a kind of eighties version of a sixties domed tent it was part of the councils attempt to decentralize its services in order to benefit the community the community consisting mainly of women and children who were crowded into a big room with narrow slanted windows did not look impressed i cant say i blamed than the place was hot and although cheerful downright uncomfortable when i asked for the duty social worker i was told to take a seat i gingerly lowered myself into a red plastic item that bolted to the floor resembled a bucket with large holes gets to your bum after an hour or two said the woman to my left our johnny got stuck in one once said the woman to my right had to get the fire brigade to cut him out they blamed me of course she reached over and slapped her johnny who seemed to be making a second bid for fire brigade fame miss baeier a voice called i was shown into a small cubicle of a room airless and lit by fluorescent in which stood two chairs a table and a woman in her early thirties she smiled at me from her seat and gestured to the second one when i sat i could hardly see her for the mound of papers piled in front of her she shifted to the right pulled a manila file from the pile and opened it it was i saw lined with blank paper she frowned turned to her side dug into a bag that could have doubled as a haversack and that hung on the back of her chair and pulled out a biro i saw that it was doing extra work as an advert for sausages she used the pen to transfer my name from the slip i had filled in onto the first sheet of paper what can i do for you she asked im trying to find someone i said the woman glanced up sharply saw that i wasnt joking and shut the file with a bang ms baeier she said clearly we are not allpowerful we have strict guidelines to which we always adhere i can tell you without needing to check that we draw the line at tracing missing persons you might care to try the policewe never have much luck with them but dont let that stop you the lines in her face belied the aggression in her voice she looked too tired to have only just started work i smiled at her bad morning she half returned my smile the worst she said except for yesterday and tomorrow i wont waste your time then i said im looking for a thelma parsons a look of alarm crossed the womans face a flash of response quickly concealed as she ducked behind the pile of papers when she reemerged she had gone bland again i wondered whether id been imagining the sheer panic that had cut through her fatigue she raised an eyebrow thelma was a social worker i continued based here once hated the job as much as you all do and managed to escape shes an old friend of mine i was hoping you could help me find her it was weak and i knew it marlowe would have done better but then i wasnt marlowe was i i was just a private detective in a land that didnt like detectives and a woman not a man but then i thought brightly as her face seemed to soften at the mention of my friendship with thelma neither was this woman a reluctant witness with something to hidejust an overworked social worker fighting the disillusionment that seemed to come with the job these days maybe it would work it didnt we never release addresses of former employees she said nor for that matter of current employees she was good at her job but not good enough her eyes were narrowed beaming hostility contradicting her seeming unconcern i opened my mouth to try again but she shook her head in the general direction of the door dismissing me with a determined finality she discarded the manila file and began her way through the one underneath i got the message i left my way out was blocked by a woman who thrust a small child toward me here do me a favor and watch him for a second she said got to change the baby and those chairs are useless she was a pro she sped down the corridor with yelling infant in arms i looked down at the abandoned child he was a cute enough item if you managed to ignore the effluent issuing from his nose i couldnt ignore it so i took a tissue from my bag and moved it downward he was out of range before the tissue had even a chance of reaching his face i recognized him johnny i asked he wiped his nose with the back of his hand and nodded sullenly i smiled a gift from heaven i thought snot and all howd you like to earn fifty pence i asked visibly he sized me up a pound he said seventy pence a quid or nuffing he said firmly he folded his small arms together and stood there facing me his feet planted stubbornly on the ground i knew when i was beaten i knelt down beside him and explained what i wanted he nodded when i had finished he held out his hand palm up into it i placed a pound coin that rapidly disappeared into his pocket then he nodded again as agreed i walked away from him until i had rounded the comer then i waited nothing happened i waited some morestill nothing ive been had i thought maybe tonys right im no detective then suddenly from around the corner issued a scream a bloodcurdling scream the likes of which i had never before had the privilege of hearing once it came paused and then once again it worked like a dream i heard a door open and a woman my woman call out what the hells going on she got another scream for a reply and some words this time my brovver johnny screamed my brovver hes stuck oh save me the woman muttered johnny screamed again all right all right she said ill get him out just do me a favor and stop screaming will you they rounded the comer at a brisk pace johnny leading the woman following as they passed me johnny let out another yell and the woman quickened her pace giving him a push as she did so i walked fast in the opposite direction running when i had rounded the corner i opened the door of her office and stumbled over to her chair i grabbed her bag and began to rifle through it one ear on the commotion outside it was a bottomless chasm i faced and a messy one at that i pulled things out at random the screaming had stopped and i heard the sound of a slap i had little time left the bag was incredible i dug deep throwing out old kleenex keys a plethora of credit cards social workers must be better paid these days i thought and the occasional halfeaten nut none of the contents fitted my preconception of what should be there i dug again i was on the verge of giving up when i found what id been looking foran address book small and black except i was probably too late i heard footsteps outside i opened the book to the p section no parsons there the footsteps were coming closer i turned to the t section and there it was the name thelma no surname just thelma except it did me no good because underneath the name was a blank piece of paper stuck on tight i know it was tight because i tried to get it off no luck i heard a rustling outside the door so i did what i had to i pulled the page out shoved the book along with the rest of the garbage back into the bag threw the bag over the chair and ran for the door i collided with her there forgot my pen i said one day ill forget my head the anger in her face faded tell me about it she muttered before closing the door on me in a workers café across the road i sat over a cup of milky hot water masquerading as tea and stared at the stolen page there was no way i could remove the covering blankness id tried again and all id managed to do was to tear a corner off it i turned the paper over i could see the writing there faint and inviting but still indecipherable i held the page up to the light and it became clearer but still incomprehensible well it would be i thought its backward i left my tea to its own devices and went to the toilet i held the back of the page up to the scratched mirror above the basinagain the writing appeared but still illegibly i got a pen out of my bag and holding the paper up to the exposed bulb i slowly started to trace the lines that i could see it took a long time but i managed it in the end and when id finished i could see in writing that was not mine an address clearly written my tea was still waiting for me i put some coins beside it and left them all to their own devices thelma lived in a small terraced house almost opposite the football ground hers was in the middle of a row of lookalikes all built from dingy gray brick with lace curtains covering small square windows low front gardens whose walls could never hold back the tide of litter from the fans and darkredstained front steps that would once in another age have been daily scrubbed i stood on the steps and rang her bell i got no response no sound at all i rang again but again without luck i turned to go and it was then that out of the corner my eye i saw a portion of the dingy lace twitch i waited but still nothing happened i got the message i turned away and walked back to my car climbed in rewed it ostentatiously and drove off i drove around the block and then returned to her street parking a few doors down away from the lace curtain i switched off the engine and waited it was two hours before anything happened i concentrated mostly on my business or lack of it i sat and i boiled and i wondered what i was doing trapped in my own car on a sunny day watching the minutes tick by and the money diminish waiting for a fictional thelma to make a move so i could report back to the fantastic mouse tony was right i thought and sam as wellit was time to move on time to reenter the real world my hand was on my car keys ready to switch on and leave when i heard the footsteps i ducked down landing heavily on the floor i strained my neck as i peered through the side mirror it was her all right the woman from thelmas old office walking briskly down the pavement she crossed in front of my car so close that i could almost smell the anxiety emanating from her and walked purposively up to thelmas door it was opened almost immediately and kept open i saw a hint of blue but otherwise my social worker concealed her protagonist from me for protagonists they obviously were i didnt need to hear their conversation to guess that it was uglyi could see it in the gestures of the social worker in the hard set of her back in the way she reached into her bag and flung something toward the door in the way she walked away and in the bang that sounded as the door closed i crouched down as she passed by me but i neednt have bothered she walked fast and angrily lost in a world of her own making muttering to herself at one point she stopped and hit herselfquite literally hit herself on the head with the flat of her hand i heard the sound of the blow from twenty yards away she started up again and only when she had turned the corner did i get out of my car i ignored the front of the house and instead walked round the block counting houses until i reached thelmas back gate i pressed against it and it yielded slightly one long push was enough to break the lock i made my way down the narrow path past the overflowing dustbin and the small outhouse that must once have been the houses only toilet until i reached the kitchen door i put my hand on the doorknob and it opened as if it had been waiting for me i stepped in i found myself in a kitchen that stank of neglect dishes were piled on both sides of the sink unwashed and uncleared on the floor stood two saucers one with the dregs of old milk the other piled high with cat food plants wilted on the windowsill geraniums that instead of enjoying the sun were being finished off by it and yet it was not a kitchen that i would ever have described as poor it was packed with consumer durables with microwaves coffee percolators automatic juicers stainless steel knives still wrapped and shining and a variety of food processors of the latest design an ideal home gone mad i thought as i walked through the room and into the hall i was faced with the choice of two doors that opened onto the narrow corridor and i chose the one at the front the one from which the lace curtain movement had originated i found myself in a small room dirty but tastefully furnished there was one person in it a woman in her middle thirties clad in jeans and a lowslung silk blouse her thin blond hair hanging weakly down the sides of her long face she was standing by a small antique maple desk staring at something on it she turned and saw me as soon as i entered but otherwise she didnt move her face did but not her body on that pale face a gamut of emotions crosseddisplays of shock of fear and finally of a kind of resignation what are you doing here she asked dully the door was open i said the back door have you got a warrant she asked i shook my head im not the police i said i watched as the resignation turned to slow anger well in that case she said ill call them she reached across the desk for the phone and picked up the receiver but the movement seemed to have exhausted her she stood still holding it and staring at me what do you want she asked the anger was replaced with despair i walked over and looked behind her on the desk i saw were pieces of paper scrawled with writing there was some tracing paper there too askew on one piece of the writing but when she saw my eyes light on it she brushed against it catapulting it to the floor she stared at me defiantly my names kate baeier i said im a private detective a man called martin malloy hired me to find you martin her voice rose and she repeated it martin you used to visit him in prison i said her face cleared as she remembered and then it disintegrated again not in fear this time but rather in hilarity the laughter came slowly at first from deep inside her surfacing as a giggle but soon transformed into near hysteria i stood and waited as she laughed in my face laughed and laughed until the tears streamed down her cheeks gradually the laugh subsided she sniffed and wiped her eyes with the back of one hand she looked at me and giggled again controlling herself only by looking away a private detective she muttered youre not for real i shrugged martin wants to see you i said well he cant her words had a final ring to them he just wants to thank you i explained the look she threw me was one of pure contempt not for me i thought but for martin gimme a break she said to thank you for opening up the world of fiction to him she looked as if she was going to laugh again and i didnt really blame her put like that it sounded ridiculous if i hadnt met martin malloy i too would have laughed and thelma had met martin she didnt laugh she smiled but not in mirth he taught me something too she said in a voice that was pure malice the dumb bastard i didnt know until then how much i had cared how much i wanted to deliver to martin malloy what he had requested i acted without thinking first i saw the tracing paper on the floor with new eyes with eyes that were looking at a mirror then i took in the writing on the desk and then i acted i quickly moved behind her and wrenched open a drawer she was too surprised to prevent me and we both watched as it tumbled to the floor spilling its contents she flung herself on them but too late to stop me from confirming what i had already guessed fraud i said thats what it is from the floor she looked up at me surrounded by small pieces of plastic her eyes flashing anger i remembered the social workers bag and the visit that she had just paid and i remembered the goods in the kitchen it made sense credit card fraud i said thinking out loud the tracing paper is how you copy the signatures she was down but not out no longer vulnerable in a way she glared up at me so what are you going to do about it she shot i didnt answer and she didnt need me to nothing she said youre the dogooder type arent you i should know ive tried that game it gets you nowhere except the occasional thanks i commented dont give me that she said thanks never buttered any bread ive met enough martin malloys in my time i dont need to meet any more a casualty of the system thats all he is a wellmeaning idiot without a chance he even gave me tips on how to forge signatures until he realized that my interest was more than academic then he had the cheek to lecture me as if i was the one who had been jailed well ive served my own kind of time im free now i dont owe anybody anything i dont owe martin malloy the time of day i can tell you i knew she was right she could have told me she looked set to go on for a good few hours i didnt need to listen i walked out of the room through the hall opened the front door and stepped into the bright sunshine i left the door open hoping that some of the air would flow in i wasnt optimistic martin malloy turned up two days later i was in my office waiting for him i had nothing else to do but wait and i couldnt shake off the feeling of uselessness that had settled on me ever since id met thelma id left the door open and he didnt bother to ring the bell this time he just arrived in my office a huge man with a surprisingly light tread did you find her he asked i nodded when he smiled his face opened up like an exotic flower that the scar did nothing to spoil when can we meet he asked i stood up she doesnt want to see you i said i dont know what i expectedfury sorrow violence even but all i got was a vague look of disappointment he nodded and made as if he were about to go but then he changed his mind is thelma all right he asked wrongfooted i didnt know how to answer i looked into those warm brown eyes and i shivered i remembered the sight of that smile and i knew that i didnt want to disappoint it shes fine i lied just busy i should have known better malloy was no fool dont try and kid me he said and his voice was as hard as his body dont treat me like a child i sat down im sorry i said i shouldnt have pretended thelma is far from fine shes involved in some kind of credit card fiddle i paused and im not sure shes doing too well i finished quickly feeling somehow that i had betrayed someone i looked away out the window and at the faultless blue sky anything i could do to help he asked she helped me you know his voice was sad i shook my head and looked at him again im not sure i started but he was lost in his own thoughts and he spoke them out loud i knew it was something stupid he said i tried to tell her that people like us just dont win i thought if i was no longer behind bars she would listen to me i remembered what thelma had said about him and i couldnt help myself shes a bitch i snapped beyond saving dont say that he said shes just confused nobodys beyond saving i nodded in recognition of sentiment rather than in agreement with the meaning i reached into my desk and pulled out his money the money that i had not yet touched it didnt take me long i said youre due some back he looked at me and smiled but his smile was no longer open keep it he said airily theres plenty more where that came from payment for keeping my trap shut guilt money for doing hard time his face softened i knew thelma was desperate he said thats why i wanted to thank her i thought if somebody anybody told her how much shed done for them it might give her hope i guess i was too late i didnt say anything what was there to say he hadnt finished did you get somebody to look for me he asked i nodded my landlord chucked me out he said you should have known nobody wants to house a convict especially one who looks like me why did you do it i felt i owed him the truth and so i gave it to him because i wasnt sure you really existed i said he nodded to himself rather than me i feel sorry for your type you know he said again almost as if to himself i came to literature late but theres one thing i can do that you cant i can distinguish between fact and fiction i shrugged and i looked at him at this huge man dressed this time in gold threads that shimmered when he moved i smiled its not always easy i said he saw my look and he returned my smile he strode over to me enfolded one of my hands in his big paws and clasped it nice to have met you kate baeier he said he let go of my hand can i give you one last piece of advice how can i refuse open the windows he said let the sun shine in breathe the air thanks i said he shrugged and looked at me a balance sheet isnt everything he said i should know im good at numbers business will pick up youre good at your jobyou found thelma didnt you he left the room as quietly as he had arrived i climbed on my chair so i could watch him in the street but somehow i missed his exit i was in the right position so i took his advice i opened the windows it was difficult but i managed deborahs judgment by margaret maron margaret marons books featuring the new york police departments sigrid harald are both complex mysteries and intense character studies harald appears in over half a dozen books to date including such notable works as corpus christmas and one coffee with ms maron lives in raleigh north carolina and deborah judged israel at that time an inaudible ripple of cognizance swept through the congregation as the pastor of bethel baptist church paused in his reading of the text and beamed down at us i was seated on the aisle near the front of the church and when barry blackmans eyes met mine i put a modest smile on my face then tilted my head in ladylike acknowledgment of the pretty compliment he was paying me by his choice of subject for this mornings sermon a nice man but hardly christianitys most original preacher id announced my candidacy back in december so this wasnt the first time id heard that particular text and my response had become almost automatic he lowered his eyes to the huge bible and continued to read aloud and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment from your mouth to gods ear barry i thought eight years of courtroom experience let me listen to the sermon with an outward show of close attention while inwardly my mind jumped on and off a dozen trains of thought i wondered without really caring if barry was still the terrific kisser hed been the summer after ninth grade when we both drove tractors for my oldest brother during tobaccobarning season there was an s curve between the barns and the back fields where the lane dipped past a stream and cut through a stand of tulip poplars and sweetgum trees our timing wasnt good enough to hit every trip but at least two or three times a day itd work out that we passed each other there in the shady coolness one on the way out to the field with empty drags the other headed back to the barn with drags full of heavy green tobacco leaves nobody seemed to notice that i occasionally returned to the barn more flushed beneath the bill of my baseball cap than even the august sun would merit although i did have to endure some teasing one day when a smear of tobacco tar appeared on my pink tshirt right over my left breast looks like somebody tried to grab a handful my sisterinlaw grinned i muttered something about the tractors targummy steering wheel but i changed shirts at lunchtime and for the rest of the summer i wore the darkest tshirts in my dresser drawer now barry blackman was a preacher man running to fat the father of two little boys and a new baby girl while deborah knott was a stillsingle attorney running for a seat on the court bench a seat being vacated against his will by old harrison hobart who occasionally fell asleep these days while charging his own juries as barry drew parallels between old testament israel and modem colleton county i plotted election strategy after the service id do a little schmoozing among the congregation strike schmoozing my subconscious stipulated sternly and i was stricken myself to realize that lev schusters yiddish phrases continued to infect my vocabulary here in rural north carolina schmoozings still called socializing and id better not forget it before the primary i pushed away errant thoughts of lev and concentrated on lunch at beulahs for that matter where was beulah and why werent she and jc seated there beside me beulah had been my mothers dearest friend and her daughterinlaw helen is president of the local chapter of mothers against drunk driving they were sponsoring a meetthecandidates reception at four oclock in the fellowship hall of a nearby presbyterian church and three of the four men running for hobarts seat would be there too the fourth was finishing up the community service old hobart had imposed in lieu of a fine for driving while impaired but he really didnt expect to win many madd votes anyhow barrys sermon drew to an end just a hair short of equating a vote for deborah knott as a vote for jesus christ the piano swung into the opening chords of just as i am and the congregation stood to sing all five verses happily no one accepted the hymns invitation to be saved that morning and after a short closing prayer we were dismissed im not a member at bethel but id been a frequent visitor from the month i was born so i got lots of hugs and howdies and promises of loyal support when the primary rolled around i hugged and howdied right back and thanked them kindly all the time edging toward my car it was starting to bother me that neither beulah nor jc had come to church then miss callie ogburn hailed me from the side door talking sixty to the yard as she bustled across the grass beulah called me up first thing this morning and said tell you about jc and for you to come on anyhow she phoned all over creation last night trying to let you know shes still expecting you to come for dinner that explained all those abortive clicks on my answering machine beulah was another of my parents generation who wouldnt talk to a tape i waited till miss callie ran out of breath then asked her what it was beulah wanted to tell me about jc he fell off the tractor and broke his leg yesterday and hes not used to the crutches yet so beulah didnt feel like she ought to leave him this morning you know how she spoils him i did jc was beulahs older brother and hed lived with her and her husband sam almost from the day they were married more than forty years ago jc was a born bachelor and except for the war years when he worked as a carpenters helper at an air base over in goldsboro hed never had much ambition beyond helping sam farm sam always said jc wasnt much of a leader but he was a damn good follower and earned every penny of his share of the crop profits although id called them cousin beulah and cousin sam till i was old enough to drop the courtesy title strictly speaking only sam johnson was blood kin but beulah and my mother had been close friends since childhood and beulahs two children fit into the age spaces around my older brothers which was why wed spent so many sundays at bethel baptist when sam died seven or eight years ago sammy junior took over and jc still helped out even though hed slowed down right much at least jc called it right much i could only hope id feel like working half days on a tractor when i reached seventytwo five minutes after saying goodbye to miss callie i was turning off the paved road into the sandy lane that ran past the johnson home place the doors there were closed and none of their three cars were in the yard but helens methodist and id heard beulah mention the longwinded new preacher at her daughterinlaws church helen and sammy junior had remodeled and painted the shabby old twostory wooden farmhouse after old mrs johnson died and it was a handsome place these days gleaming white aluminum siding and dark blue shutters sitting in a shady grove of hundredyearold white oaks beulahs brick houseeven after forty years everyone in the family still calls it the new housewas farther down the lane and couldnt be seen from the road or the home place my car topped the low ridge that gave both generations their privacy then swooped down toward a sluggish creek that had been dredged out into a nicesize irrigation pond beyond the house as newlyweds sam and beulah had planted pecans on each side of the lane and mature nut trees now met in a tall arch the house itself was rooted in its own grove of pecans and oaks with underplantings of dogwoods crepe myrtles redbuds and flowering pears pink and white azaleas lined the foundation all around on this warm day in late april the place was a color illustration out of southern living i pulled up under a chinaball tree by the back porch and tapped my horn expecting to see beulah appear at the screen door with her hands full of biscuit dough and an ample print apron protecting her sunday dress against flour smudges a smell of burning paper registered oddly as i stepped from the car it wasnt cool enough for a fire and no one on this farm would break the fourth commandment by burning trash on the sabbath there was no sign of beulah when i crossed the wide planks of the wooden porch and called through the screen but the kitchen was redolent of baking ham jcs old hound dog crawled out from under the back steps and wagged his tail at me hopefully the screen door was unhooked and the inner door stood wide beulah i called again jc no answer yet her buick and jcs ford pickup were both parked under the barn shelter at the rear of the yard the kitchen dining room and den ran together in one large lshaped space and when a quick glance into the formal seldomused living room revealed no one there either i crossed to the stairs in the center hall through an open door at the far end of the hall i could see into donna sues old bedroom now the guest room the covers on the guest bed had been straightened but the spread was folded down neatly and pillows were piled on top of the rumpled quilt as if jc had rested there after beulah made the bed he wouldnt be able to use the stairs until his leg mended so hed probably moved in here for the duration a stack of field and stream magazines and an open pack of his menthol cigarettes on the nightstand supported my hypothesis the house remained silent as i mounted the stairs anybody home beulahs bedroom was deserted and as immaculate as downstairs except for the desk she and sam had devoted a corner of their bedroom to the paper work connected with the farm although sammy junior did most of the farm records now on a computer over at his house beulah had kept the oak desk one of my own document binders lay on its otherwise bare top id drawn up her new will less than a month ago and had brought it out to her myself in this very same binder i lifted the cover the holographic distribution of small personal keepsakes she had insisted on was still there but the will itself was missing for the first time since id entered this quiet house i felt a small chill of foreboding sammy juniors old bedroom had been turned into a sewing room and it was as empty as the bathroom ditto jcs as a child id had the run of every room in the house except this one so id never entered it alone from the doorway it looked like a rerun of the others everything vacuumed and polished and tidy but when i stepped inside i saw the bottom drawer of the wide mahogany dresser open inside were various folders secured by brown cords bundles of tax returns account ledgers bank statements and two large flat candy boxes which i knew held old family snapshots more papers and folders were loosely stacked on the floor beside a low footstool as if someone had sat there to sort through the drawer and had then been interrupted before the task was finished beulah would never leave a clutter like that thoroughly puzzled i went back down to the kitchen the ham had been in the oven at least a half hour too long so i turned it off and left the door cracked the top burners were off but each held a pot of cooked vegetables still quite hot wherever beulah was she hadnt been gone very long year round she and jc and sam too when he was alive loved to walk the land and if they werent expecting company it wasnt unusual to find them out at the pond or down in the woods but with me invited for sunday dinner along with sammy junior and helen and their three teenagers and with jcs broken leg not hardly likely as my daddy would say nevertheless i went out to my car and blew the horn long and loud buster the old hound nuzzled my hand as i stood beside the car indecisively and that was another thing if jc were out stumping across the farm on crutches buster wouldnt be hanging around the back door hed be right out there with jc it didnt make sense yet if theres one thing the law has taught me its that it doesnt pay to formulate a theory without all the facts i headed back inside to phone and see if helen and sammy junior were home yet and as i lifted the receiver from the kitchen wall i saw something id missed before at the far end of the den beyond the highbacked couch the fireplace screen had been moved to one side of the hearth and there were scraps of charred paper in the grate i remembered the smell of burning paper that had hung in the air when i first arrived i started toward the fireplace and now i could see the coffee table strewn with the sunday edition of the raleigh news and observer as i rounded the high couch i nearly tripped on a pair of crutches but they barely registered so startled was i by seeing jc lying there motionless his eyes closed glory jc i exclaimed you asleep that must be some painkiller the doctor i suddenly realized that the brightly colored sheet of sunday comics over his chest was drenched in his own bright blood i knelt beside the old man and clutched his callused workworn hand it was still warm his faded blue eyes opened rolled back in his head then focused on me debrah his voice was faint and came from far far away i swear i plumb forgot he gave a long sigh and his eyes closed again dwight bryant is detective chief of the colleton county sheriffs department after calling the nearest rescue squad id dialed his mothers phone number on the off chance that hed be there in the neighborhood and not twentytwo miles away at dobbs the county seat four minutes flat after i hung up the phone i saw his chevy pickup zoom over the crest of the lane and tear through the arch of pecan trees he was followed by a bright purple tr and even in this ghastly situation i had to smile at his exasperation as miss emily bryant bounded from the car and hurried up the steps ahead of him damn it all mother if you set the first foot inside that house im gonna arrest you and i mean it she turned on him a feisty little carrottop chihuahua facing down a sandybrown saint bernard if you think im going to stay out here when one of my oldest and dearest friends may be lying in there shes not miss emily i said tremulously jcs blood was under my fingernails from where id stanched his chest wound i promise you i looked in every room and under all the beds and in every closet she stamped her small foot imperiously on the porch floor i wont touch a thing dwight but ive got to look no that was the law talking not her son and she huffed but quit arguing okay deborah said dwight holding the screen door open for me show me fortyfive minutes later we knew no more than before the rescue squad had arrived and departed again with jc who was still unconscious and barely clinging to life sammy junior and helen were nearly frantic over beulahs disappearance and were torn between following the ambulance and staying put till there was word of her eventually they thought to call donna sue who said shed meet the ambulance at the hospital and stay with jc till they heard more a general apb had been issued for beulah but since nobody knew how she left there wasnt much besides her physical appearance to put on the wire dwights deputies processed the den and jcs room like a crime scene after they finished dwight and i walked through the house with sammy junior and helen but they too saw nothing out of the ordinary except for the papers strewn in front of jcs bedroom dresser sammy juniors impression was the same as mine its like mama was interrupted doing what asked dwight probably getting uncle jcs insurance papers together for him i said id take em over to the hospital tomorrow in all the excitement yesterday when he broke his leg we didnt think about em he started to leave the room then hesitated yall find his gun gun said dwight sammy junior pointed to a pair of empty rifle brackets over the bedroom door thats where he keeps his much as wed all like to believe this is still gods country everything peaceful and nice most people now latch their doors at night and they do keep loaded guns around for more than rats and snakes and wild dogs helen shivered and instinctively moved closer to sammy junior the back doors always open dwight ill bet you anything some burglar or rapist caught her by surprise and forced her to go with him and then jc probably rared up on the couch and they shot him like youd swat a fly i turned away from the pain on sammy juniors face and stared through the bedroom window as dwight said been too many cars down the lane and through the yard for us to find any tread marks any lawyer knows how easily the lives of good decent people can be shattered but ill never get used to the abruptness of it trouble seldom comes creeping up gently giving a person time to prepare or get out of the way its always the freakish bolt of lightning out of a clear blue sky the jerk of a steering wheel the collapse of something rock solid only a second ago from the window i saw puffy white clouds floating serenely over the farm the sun shone as brightly as ever on flowering trees and newplanted corn warming the earth for another round of seedtime and harvest a soft wind smoothed the field where jc had been disking before his accident yesterday and in the distance the pond gleamed silvergreen before a stand of willows my eye was snagged by what looked like a redandwhite cloth several yards into the newly disked field probably something buster had pulled off the clothesline i thought and was suddenly aware that the others were waiting for my answer to a question id barely heard no i replied id have noticed another car or truck coming out of the lane couldnt have missed them by much though because the vegetables on the stove were still hot beulah must have turned them off just before going upstairs its a habit with her sammy junior said he had his arm around helen and was kneading her shoulder convulsively it would probably be bruised tomorrow but helen didnt seem to notice mama burned so many pots when we were kids that she got to where she wouldnt leave the kitchen without turning off the vegetables shed mean to come right back but then there was always something that needed doing and you know how mama is we did we surely did whatsoever thy hand findeth to do must have been written with beulah in mind she always reacted impulsively and couldnt pass a dusty surface or a dirty windowpane or anything out of place without cleaning it or taking it back to its rightful spot in the house maybe thats why that scrap of redandwhite cloth out in the field bothered me if i could see it so would beulah she wouldnt let it lie out there ten minutes if she could help it and it was with a need to restore some of her order that i slipped away from the others downstairs the crime scene crew had finished with the kitchen and for lack of anything more useful to do miss emily had decided that everybodyd fare better on a full stomach shed put bowls of vegetables on the counter sliced the ham and set out glasses and a jug of sweet iced tea at this returning semblance of the ordinary helen and sammy juniors three anxious teenagers obediently filled their plates and went outside under the trees to eat their parents and dwight werent enthusiastic about food at the moment but miss emily bullied them into going through the motions even dwights men had to stop and fix a plate no one noticed as i passed through the kitchen and down the back steps past the johnson grandchildren who were feeding ham scraps to buster and talking in low worried tones the lane cut through the yard skirted the end of the field then wound circuitously around the edge of the woods and on down to the pond but the redandwhite rag lay on a beeline from the back door to the pond and i hesitated about stepping off the grass my shoes were twoinch slingback pumps and theyd be wrecked if i walked out into the soft dirt of the newly disked field as i dithered i saw that someone else had recently crossed the field on foot a single set of tracks with growing horror i remembered the redandwhite hostess aprons my aunt zell had sewed for all her friends last christmas i ran back to my car grabbed the sneakers i keep in the trunk and then rushed to call dwight it was done strictly by the book dwights crime scene crew would later methodically photograph and measure and take pains not to disturb a single clod till every mark beulah had left on the soft dirt was thoroughly documented but the rest of us hurried through the turned field paralleling the footprints from a tenfoot distance and filled with foreboding by the steady unwavering direction those footsteps had taken beulahs apron lay about two hundred feet from the edge of the yard she must have untied the strings and just let it fall as she walked away from it the rifle though had been deliberately pitched we could see where she stopped the depth of her footprints where she heaved it away from her as if it were something suddenly and terribly abhorrent after that there was nothing to show that shed hesitated a single second her footprints went like bullets straight down to the pond and into the silent silvergreen water as with most farm ponds dredged for irrigation the bottom dropped off steeply from the edge to discourage mosquito larvae how deep is it there dwight asked when we arrived breathless and panting twelve feet said sammy junior and she never learned how to swim his voice didnt break but his chest was heaving his face got red and tears streamed from his eyes why in gods name why dwight helen debrah you all know uncle jc near bout worships mama and weve always teased her that jc stood for jesus christ the way shes catered to him it was almost dark before they found beulahs body no one tolled the heavy iron bell at the home place the old way of alerting the neighborhood to fire or death has long since been replaced by the telephone but the reaction hasnt changed much in two hundred years by the time that second ambulance passed down the lane this one on its way to the states medical examiner in chapel hill cars filled the yard and lined the ditch banks on either side of the road and there was no place in helens kitchen or dining room to set another plate of food it would have taken a full roll of tinfoil to cover all the casseroles biscuits pies deviled eggs and platters of fried chicken sliced turkey and roast pork that had been brought in by shocked friends and relatives my aunt zell arrived whitefaced and grieving the last of three adventuresome country girls whod gone off to goldsboro during world war ii to work at the air base i grew up on stories of those war years how jc had been sent over by his and beulahs parents to keep an eye on my mother beulah and aunt zell and protect them from the dangers of a military town how theyd tried to fix him up with a wac from new jersey the saturday night dances the innocent flirtations with that steady stream of young airmen who passed through the army air forces technical training school at seymour johnson field on their way to the airfields of europe it wasnt till i was eighteen the summer between high school and college the summer mother was dying that i learned it hadnt all been lighthearted laughter wed been sorting through a box of old blackandwhite snapshots that mother was determined to date and label before she died among the pictures of her or aunt zell or beulah perched on the wing of a bomber or jitterbugging with anonymous interchangeable airmen there was one of beulah and a young man they had their arms around each other and there was a sweet solemnity in their faces that separated this picture from the other clowning ones whos that i asked and mother sat staring into the picture for so long that i had to ask again his name was donald she finally replied then her face took on an earnest look id come to know that summer the look that meant i was to be entrusted with another secret another scrap of her personal history that she couldnt bear to take to her grave untold even though each tale began now you mustnt ever repeat this but donald farraday came from norwood nebraska she said exactly halfway between omaha and lincoln on the platte river thats what he always said after he shipped out beulah used to look at the map and lay her finger halfway between omaha and lincoln and make zell and me promise that wed come visit her i thought sam was the only one she ever dated seriously i protested beulah was the only one sam ever dated seriously mother said crisply he had his eye on her from the time she was in grade school and he and jc used to go hunting together she wrote to him while he was fighting the japs but they werent going steady or anything and shed have never married sam if donald hadnt died oh i said suddenly understanding the sad look that sometimes shadowed beulahs eyes when only minutes before she and mother and aunt zell might have been giggling over some goldsboro memory donald farraday was from a nebraska wheat farm mother told me on his way to fight in europe beulah met him at a jitterbug contest put on by the canteen and itd been love at first sight deep and true and allconsuming they had only sixteen days and fifteen nights together but that was enough to know this wasnt a passing wartime romance their values their dreams everything meshed and they had so much fun together youve never seen two people laugh so much over nothing she didnt even cry when he shipped out because she was so happy thinking about what marriage to him was going to be like after the war was over how did he die we never really heard said mother she had two of the sweetest most beautiful letters you could ever hope to read and then nothing that was near the end when fighting was so heavy in italywe knew he was in italy though it was supposed to be secret they werent married so his parents wouldve gotten the telegram and of course not knowing anything about beulah they couldnt write her so what happened the war ended we all came home i married your daddy zell married james sam came back from the south pacific and with donald dead beulah didnt care who she married donna sue i said suddenly yes mother agreed sue for me donna in memory of donald she doesnt know about him though and dont you ever tell her her face was sad as she looked at the photograph in her hand of the boy and girl whod be forever young forever in love beulah wont let us mention his name but i know she still grieves for what might have been after mother was gone i never spoke to beulah about what i knew the closest i ever came was my junior year at carolina when jeff creech dumped me for a psych major and i moped into the kitchen where beulah and aunt zell were drinking coffee i moaned about how my heart was broken and i couldnt go on and beulah had smiled at me youll go on sugar a womans body doesnt quit just because her heart breaks sudden tears had misted aunt zells eyeswe stephensons can cry over telephone commercialsand beulah abruptly left she was remembering donald farraday wasnt she i asked sue told you about him yes aunt zell had sighed then i dont believe a day goes by that she doesnt remember him the endurance of beulahs grief had suddenly put jeff creech into perspective and i realized with a small pang that losing him probably wasnt going to blight the rest of my life as i put my arms around aunt zell i thought of her loss mother gone now beulah only jc left to remember those giddy girlhood years at least the doctors were cautiously optimistic that hed recover from the shooting why did she do it i asked but aunt zell was as perplexed as the rest of us the house was crowded with people whod known and loved beulah and jc all their lives and few could recall a true cross word between older brother and younger sister oh mamad get fussed once in a while when hed try to keep her from doing something new said donna sue every wake ive ever attended the survivors always alternate between sudden paroxysms of tears and a need to remember and retell for all the pained bewilderment and unanswered questions that night beulahs wake was no different remember sammy how uncle jc didnt want her to buy that place at the beach he never liked change her brother agreed he talked about jellyfish and sharks and sun poisoning helen said with a sad smile as she refilled his glass of iced tea dont forget the sun poisoning changed his tune soon enough once he got down there and the fish started biting said a cousin as he bit into a sausage biscuit one of dwights deputies signaled me from the hallway and i left them talking about how jcd tried to stop beulah from touring england with one of her alumnae groups last year and how hed fretted the whole time she was gone afraid her plane would crash into the atlantic or be hijacked by terrorists dwight wants you back over there said the deputy and drove me through the gathering dark down the lane to where beulahs house blazed with lights dwight was waiting for me in the den theyd salvaged a few scraps from the fireplace but the ashes had been stirred with a poker and there wasnt much left to tell what had been destroyed maybe a handful of papers dwight thought and this it fell behind the grate before it fully burned the sheet was crumpled and charred but enough remained to see the words last will and testament of beulah ogburn johnson and the opening paragraph about revoking all earlier wills you were her lawyer said dwight whyd she burn her will i dont know i answered honestly puzzled unless unless what ill have to read my copy tomorrow but theres really not going to be much difference between what happens if she died intestate and i interrupted myself remembering in fact if jc dies itll be exactly the same dwight sammy junior and donna sue still split everything and if he lives if this were still a valid instrument i said choosing my words carefully jc would have a lifetime right to this house and beulahs share of the farm income with everything divided equally between bar two children when he died without the will hes not legally entitled to stay the night theyd never turn him out i didnt respond and dwight looked at me thoughtfully but without the will they could if they wanted to he said slowly dwight bryants six or eight years older than i and hes known me all my life yet i dont think hed ever looked at me as carefully as he did that night in beulahs den in front of that couch soaked in her brothers blood and if hed done something bad enough to make their mother shoot him and then go drown herself they could turn him out and not a single voice in the whole community would speak against it i finished for him was that what beulah wanted dead or alive she was still my client but i wondered when she shot jc and burned her will had she been of sound mind by next morning people were beginning to say no there was no sane reason for beulahs act they said so it must have been a sudden burst of insanity and wasnt there a greataunt on her daddys side thatd been a little bit queer near the end jc regained consciousness but he was no help i was resting on the couch he said and i never heard a thing till i woke up hurting and you were there debrah he was still weak but fierce denial burned in his eyes when they told him that beulah had shot him she never her fingerprints are on your rifle said dwight she never he gazed belligerently from donna sue to sammy junior she never not her own brother where is she you better notve jailed her dwight he went into shock when they told him beulah was dead great sobbing cries of protest racked his torn and broken body it was pitiful to watch donna sue petted and hugged him but the nurse had to inject a sedative to calm him and she asked us to leave i was due in court anyhow and afterwards there was a luncheon speech at the jaycees and a pigpicking that evening to raise funds for the childrens hospital i fell into bed exhausted but instead of sleeping my mind began to replay everything that had happened sunday scene by scene suddenly there was a freezeframe on the moment i discovered jc next morning i was standing beside his hospital bed before anyone else got there what was it you forgot i asked him the old man stared at me blankly huh when i found you you said deborah i swear i plumb forgot forgot what jc his faded blue eyes shifted to the shiny getwell balloons tethered to the foot of his bed by colorful streamers i dont remember saying that he lied from the hospital i drove down to the town commons and walked along the banks of our muddy river it was another beautiful spring day but i was harking back to sunday morning trying to think myself into beulahs mind youre a sixtysixyearold widow i thought youre cooking sunday dinner for your children and for the daughter of your dead friend shes running for judge sue did you ever imagine it and theres jc calling from the den about his insurance papers so you turn off the vegetables and go upstairs and look in his drawer for the policies and you find what do you find that sends you back downstairs with a rifle in your hands and papers to burn why bother to burn anything after youve shot the person who loves you best in all the world and why destroy a will that would have provided that person with a dignified and independent old age was it because the bequest had been designated to my beloved only brother who has always looked after me and on this beautiful sunday morning jc has suddenly stopped being beloved and has instead become someone to hurt maybe even to kill why why why i shook my head impatiently what in gods creation could jc have kept in that drawer that would send beulah over the edge totally baffled i deliberately emptied my mind and sat down on one of the stone benches and looked up into a dogwood tree in full bloom with the sun above them the white blossoms glowed with a paschal translucence mother had always loved dogwoods mother aunt zell beulah a spring blossoming more than fortyfive years ago i thought of dogwoods and spring love and into my emptied mind floated a single what if i didnt force it i just sat and watched while it grew from possibility to certainty a certainty reinforced as i recalled something mother had mentioned about shift work at the airfield it was such a monstrous certainty that i wanted to be dissuaded so i went to my office and called aunt zell and asked her to think back to the war years when you ail were in goldsboro i said did you work days or nights days of course she answered promptly the weight started to roll off my chest leastways we three girls did she added jc worked nights why for a moment i thought the heaviness would smother me before i could stammer out a reason and hang up sherry my secretary came in with some papers to sign but i waved her away bring me the phone book i told her and then leave me alone unless i buzz you astonishingly it took only one call to information to get the number i needed he answered on the second ring and we talked for almost an hour i told him i was a writer doing research on the old army air forces technical schools he didnt seem to think it odd when my questions got personal he sounded nice he sounded lonely you look like hell sherry observed when i passed through the office you been crying anybody wants me ill be at the hospital i said without breaking stride donna sue and helen were sitting beside jcs bed when i got there and it took every ounce of courtroom training for me not to burst out with it instead i made sympathetic conversation like a perfect southern lady and when they broke down again about beulah i said you all need to get out in the spring sunshine for a few minutes go get something with ice in it and walk around the parking lot twice ill keep jc company till you get back jc closed his eyes as they left but i let him have it with both barrels you bastard i snarled you filthy bastard i just got off the phone to donald farraday he still fives in norwood nebraska jc halfway between omaha and lincoln the old man groaned and clenched his eyes tighter he didnt die he wasnt even wounded except in the heart by you so much anger roiled up inside me i was almost spitting my words at him he wrote her every chance he got till it finally sank in she was never going to answer he thought shed changed her mind realized that she didnt really love him and every day beulah must have been coming home asking if shed gotten any mail and you only gave her sams letters you rotten nogood sam was homefolks jc burst out that other one hed have taken her way the hell away to nebraska she didnt have any business in nebraska sam loved her she didnt love him i snapped sure she did oh it took her a bit to get over the other one but she settled only because she thought farraday was dead you had no right you sneaking sanctimonious pharisee you wrecked her whole life her life wasnt wrecked he argued she had donna sue and sammy junior and the farm and if it was such a starspangled life i interrupted hotly whyd she take a gun to you the minute she knew what youd done to her the fight went out of him and he sank back into the pillow sobbing now and holding himself where the bullet had passed through his right lung why in gods name did you keep the letters thats what she found wasnt it still sobbing jc nodded i forgot they were still there i never opened them and she didnt either she said she couldnt bear to she just put them in the grate and put a match to them and she was crying i tried to explain about how id done what was best for her and all at once she had the rifle in her hands and she said shed never forgive me and then i reckon she shot me he reached out a bony hand and grasped mine you wont tell anyone will you i jerked my hand away as if itd suddenly touched filth please debrah donald farraday has a daughter almost the same age as donna sue i said know what he named her jc he named her beulah dwight bryant was waiting when i got back from court that afternoon and he followed me into my office i hear you visited jc twice today so i slid off my high heels they were wickedly expensive and matched the power red of my linen suit i waggled my stockinged toes at him but he didnt smile judge not he said sternly is that with an n or a k i parried sherry tells me you never give clients the original of their will nevers a long time and sherry may not know as much about my business as she thinks she does but it was a copy that beulah burned wasnt it im prepared to go to court and swear it was the original if i have to it wont be necessary though jc wont contest it dwight stared at me a long level moment whyre you doing this to him i matched his stare with one about twenty degrees colder not me dwight beulah he swears he doesnt know why she shot him but you know dont you i shrugged he hauled himself to his feet angry and frustrated if you do this deborah jcll have to spend the rest of his life depending on donna sue and sammy juniors good will you dont have the right nobody elected you judge yet yes they did i said thinking of the summer i was eighteen and how mother had told me all her secrets so that if i ever needed her eyewitness testimony id have it and deborah was a judge in the land damn straight a mans home by shelley singer a former journalist shelley singer is the author of the popular jake samsonrosie vicente mysteries the latter sleuth is almost certainly the only carpenter detective in the history of the genre they have starred in such excellent novels as free draw full house spit in the ocean samsons deal and suicide king ms singer lives in the san francisco bay area the woman spoke slowly in a deep voice edged with tears the message she left on the office answering machine was concise she needed help her husband had been murdered would i please call her the name wittles sounded familiar i glanced through that mornings san francisco chronicle and oakland tribune and found brief followup stories in both of course alan wittles the berkeley attorney whod been shot to death in his living room a couple of nights before signs of a breakin the papers said i had to wonderdidnt the dead mans wife have anything better to do with her money than pay a private investigator for a job the police were already doing still i dialed the number shed left on the tape while the phone rang i thumbed quickly through the phone book to verify that the number actually belonged to her and not to some stray lunatic whod seen her name in the paper the call was legitimate i found alan and julia wittles in the book at the right number and at a very right address she answered with her name as though she were an upscale clothing store this is barrett lake i told her im returning your call to broz investigations how can we help you oh yes thank you for calling back quickly but id rather talk to mr broz himself im sorry mr broz isnt available hes left me in charge very impressive i didnt tell her i was an apprentice working out my term under titos license she hesitated for a good ten seconds youre a woman yes i am i was a little surprised that a proper berkeley matron would be caught dead expressing what sounded like unfeminist thoughts but she redeemed herself all right good that might be even better id like you to come over right away so we can talk so you can get started and clear this all up not so fast i told myself perhaps first you could tell me a bit more about what you want me to do for you she sighed and spoke in her slow soft way my husband was shot to death here at home three nights ago yes i know im sorry but arent the police working on the case they are did i have a point her tone of voice was asking well we dont like to compete with the berkeley police they have resources oh they never catch anyone theyre busy they have too much to do please just come over here and talk to me about it i know you can help me ridiculous i thought if anyone could find a homicidal burglar it would be the police but she sounded so desperate and so unhappy i glanced at the work sheet on titos desk according to him i didnt have anything to do that daynothing really to be in charge ofexcept stick around in case something showed up and here was a poor sad woman in obvious distress certainly needing someones help wasnt that the whole point besides making a living even tito the semipractical admitted he had thought i was a natural for the investigating business the first time he came to my apartment and saw the suit of armor in the entry he enjoys my romantic delusions and i enjoy the ones he says he doesnt have i told julia wittles i was on my way the house was about worth of stucco and spanish tile in the upper elmwood section one of berkeleys best i noticed a man sitting in a car parked across the street an ordinarylooking car with a long radio aerial were the police with her now i headed for the door up a terracotta walk flanked by two large palm trees when i pressed the bell button i heard a chord sound somewhere deep inside the door opened almost immediately the woman and i appraised each other we were about the same height five seven or so the same ageearly fortiesand the same build a bit on the thin side but her coloring was much lighter my french and chippewa ancestors are more dominant genetically than the minnesota swedes but all her material came from northern europe she had pale blond hair long and fine pale blue eyes and pale skin she also had a limp handshake but i thought that had more to do with environment than heredity the day was hot the house was cool the entry hall two stories high with a sweep of staircase leading to a gallery was bright and airy but in the living room the windows were heavily curtained the only light came from the far end of the room a good thirty feet away where a young man dressed in tshirt and jeans standing in the bright sun of the patio was working on the open french doors from inside the dark room i watched him turn away and walk a couple of paces through the sunlight to a toolbox lying on the patio stones this is the room where it happened she said make yourself comfortable ill get us some iced tea she disappeared through a swinging door i glanced around in the dimnessnice fireplace hardwood floor as for the furnishings though my mother would have said they were different a tactful condemnation except for a couple of overstuffed couches that looked like relatives of the pillsbury doughboy the furniture was flimsylooking and looked as though it had been painted gaudily by children my possible client returned with two glasses and two coasters on a tray and placed the tray on the redwhiteandgreen coffee table between the couches this is a very lovely house architecturally i said she smiled a radiant smile of white teeth against pale lips an ivory woman thank you would you like to see more of it she was eager happy to refuse would have been almost cruel clearly she wanted to postpone talking about what had happened to her husband she led me first to the dining room a large light expanse furnished with a gigantic table eight chairs a sideboard and two smaller cupboards the table was a simple rectangle soft edged carved from hard reddish wood the chairs were more free form with blobshaped solid wood backs the sideboard matched the table i had seen furniture like this once before at a gallery show of handmade pieces each of the chairs i knew cost several hundred dollars the prices of the table and sideboard i did not even want to think about the two smaller cupboards looked like some of the pieces i had seen in the living room here in the bright uncurtained dining room i recognized the style there are a couple of shops in the bay area that specialize in amazingly expensive southweststyle handmade furniture some of it is charming bright and whimsical even if it doesnt seem to stand quite right on its legs but some of it goes beyond artistic whimsy to artists joke and the two small cupboards in julia wittless dining room fit into that last category they were particularly rickety versions of that genre or school or whatever they were calling it both were covered with crude shapes painted in bitingly sharp primary colors one of them had little tin cutouts of coyotes or maybe wolves tacked to the wood above the open shelves those cupboards were made by ian feather she said a very famous artist who lives in taos i nodded and smiled it took months to get them months after demonstrating that the cupboard doors actually opened she led me upstairs to a master bedroom and bath both of which had a bit too much brass for my taste the quilt on the bed though was a beautiful geometric creation in blues and greens the quilt was made in by a woman in nebraska a farmers wife she said it was in that quilt show at the art museum in san francisco about five years ago interesting i said politely my compassion was slipping away i was beginning to feel restless i have always disliked guided museum tours as she led me through the rest of the upstairs lovingly pointing out skylights alcoves and window seats and telling me where and how she had acquired each piece of furniture i thought about how much it had all cost this woman had spent more on furniture than id earned in half my twentyyear teaching career i do love this house so much she said as we trailed down the stairs again ive dedicated my life these past eight years to decorating it to setting off its beauty properly certainly i said as we walked into the kitchen everything you have is unique exactly that was the effect i wanted everything is perfect just the way i wanted it the kitchen was basic california modern with a greenhouse window and a center island stove top a big fireplace and lots of redwood and copperall the things you see in the magazines dentists buy for their waiting rooms you mentioned eight years i said is that how long youve lived here we were back in the living room at last i took a long swallow of my reclaimed iced tea and sat on one of the soft couches yes that was when i married alan and moved in his first wife had done the house in victorian it didnt work at all was he divorced no she died years before i met him they bought the house together it was theirs and then it was his and then it was ours and nowshe sighedits mine i didnt like sitting on the couch after all i felt as though it might begin to digest me i moved to an unpadded wooden chair and placed my coaster and then my tea on the footsquare redandwhitepaintspattered table beside me i was relieved when the table didnt collapse now i said we need to talk about your husbands death although i know how difficult that must be for you she dropped her head drawing her hand across her forehead it is you say it happened in this room i take it the intruder broke in through those doors i nodded toward the french doors the young blond man was reaching up toward the top of the doorframe with a screwdriver as he stretched his tshirt rode up to expose a hairless expanse of muscular stomach yes you find him and ill identify him and we can get this whole thing over with once and for all i saw him i saw him running away but the police havent asked me to a single lineup yet she made it sound like theyd neglected to invite her to tea lets back up just a little bit ms wittles you were here when it happened i was upstairs i heard alan shout and then i heard all these terrible noisesfurniture crashing yellingand then a gunshot i ran downstairs and there was this man standing over alan with a gun the patio doors open furniture everywhere and alan lying on the floor the man looked at me dropped the gun and ran back out the door a power tool whined i followed her gaze as she looked anxiously toward the light the carpenter was running a belt sander up the side of the door oh no she shouted waving at him catching his eye he turned off the sander and looked at her quizzically the dust is coming into the house he nodded thoughtfully and began to take the door off its hinges i turned back to julia wittles he dropped the gun he didnt shoot at you no he dropped it it was alans gun and the killer was wearing gloves did i say that no and you saw him clearly enough to identify him she nodded i glanced back toward the doorway the carpenter had removed the door and was carrying it across the patio in the sunshine everything out there the stones the shrubs the man himself looked warm and bright i turned back to julia wittles the sadfaced woman sitting across from me in the cool dimness i concentrated on that face where was your husband when you found him on the rug in front of the fireplace there was no rug in front of the fireplace she anticipated my next question its at the cleaners so what must have happened then is that your husband caught this man breaking in and went to get his gun where did he keep it usually she pointed to a small blue desk near the patio doors in there always okay so he grabbed his gun but there was a struggle yes thats what i think there was a struggle the burglar got the gun and shot him the room must have been a mess i said it was a stupid thing to say but everything looked so perfectly tidy now every piece just so every rug straight and lint free the hardwood floor mirrorlike where there was light to reflect i couldnt quite imagine this room tossed around she frowned at me studied my face for a moment it was and poor alan lying there she dropped her head into her hands for a moment sat up straight again and took a deep breath and you gave the police a description of the man did they do one of those drawings from your description we tried to do that but i wasnt very good at it but id know him if i saw him and im sure you could find him down in west berkeley where all the bums are down on san pablo or sacramento you say you think the police arent working on the case oh theyre working on it i suppose but they certainly havent asked me to identify anyone i think theyre working on it i think theres a plainclothesman parked across the street right now have they been watching the house her small mouth dropped open her eyes widened she stared at me we were both silent for a moment out on the patio the power sander whined theyre going to try to blame me she said shaking her head isnt that what they always do blame the spouse you have to help me we can go down to san pablo together ill point him out to you she was gripping the mushy arm of her couch her voice rising i was getting a pain in my right temple i rubbed it why do you think the police are after you people know weve been having problems what kinds of problems were you having he wanted a divorce did i show you the conservatory i had it added to the house last year would you like to see it her eyes were pleading she was like a lost kitten sitting demurely prettily tail wrapped around her paws hoping to please no i thought no more museum tours no more digressions we needed to stick to the subject which was getting more complicated possibly later he wanted to divorce you yes and make me leave the house wasnt it legally half yours community property had she signed some sort of prenuptial agreement yes i suppose so but he wouldnt have let me have it he would have sold it he said it was his home his and marshas his first wife but youd get half the money thats not enough i wouldnt get this house i wouldnt get enough to buy one like it did you talk to a lawyer about all this no no alan was a lawyer all the lawyers i knew were his friends i couldnt fight him legally i wouldnt have known how her voice had risen in pitch again high and breathless and soft she sounded startlingly like marilyn monroe like an echo out of the past bouncing around the room i wanted to scream at her where had she been for the past three decades she was watching me warily we need another glass of tea she said and fled to the kitchen with our glasses i got up and walked to the square of sunlight crossed the flagstones to where the young man stood screwdriver in one hand a new lock in the other the french door hed removed rested across a pair of sawhorses i couldnt even bring myself to flirt with him was there a lot of damage to the doors i asked he smiled at me no hardly any the wood was barely marked the burglar pried real gently until the lock gave way must have taken a long time and the bolts top and bottomhe pointed at the top of the door with his screwdriverthey werent shot so there wasnt anything broken there not bad at all thank you he looked at me oddly yes i thought youre very pretty and very charming and you have a sweet smile and youre not used to women staring at you dully and walking away sorry julia wittles was standing at the coffee table waiting for me the tea glasses were full again well what are you going to do she demanded i went to the big front windows and pulled open the drapes then i turned on a few lamps tell me how the furniture was that night when you came into the room she pointed out various pieces and described their positions although she said she couldnt remember exactly in all cases a couch was overturned one chair was on its back near the entry door and some of the tables were thrown around the room and that rug and that one were out of place and thats how it was when the police came she nodded i examined the chair that had been displaced turning it over looking at it carefully i looked at the coffee table the end tables where was this i asked touching the small redandwhitespattered table over there she pointed to a spot near the kitchen door some fifteen feet away i crossed the room and studied the floor then i went back to the table took a deep compassionexpelling breath and gave it a good kick julia wittles yelled the table shot up hit the floor and skidded a few feet coming to rest about where she had pointed i walked over to it gingerly because id hurt one of my toes the floor had a new shallow sixinch scratch with a flake of blue paint in it the previously pristine table now had one loose leg and one chipped corner she came to stand beside me i didnt look at her i hope that wasnt one of your favorite pieces i said she didnt answer none of this furniture has a scratch on it the only scratch on the floor is the one i just made did you think the police were complete idiots youre smarter than they are even if they had called you in for a lineup you know you might have picked someone they knew couldnt be guilty sometimes they put cops in them she moved across the room standing just two feet from me her eyes were red and the fine wrinkles around them deepened as she stared into mine trying i suppose to read my mind youre not going to help me you need a lawyer and a doctor or two the carpenter was back at the doorframe again reinstalling the door she turned to watch him i dont want to do that she said i dont like lawyers her good name by carolyn g hart millions of mystery readers love mystery bookstores and carolyn g hart has given them and the bookstore owners someone to cheer forannie laurence whose own store is the base for exciting and intellectually stimulating cases in such books as a little class on murder something wicked and death on demand ms hart lives in oklahoma city annie laurance darling willed the telephone to ring but the undistinguished gardenvariety black desk telephone remained mute dammit max could at least call the more she thought about it the more she wished that she had gone of course it was undeniably true that ingrid wasnt available to mind the bookstore but it wouldnt have been a disaster to close for a few days in november she didnt let herself dwell on the fact that saturday had been her best fall day ever shed sold cartons of the latest by lia matera nancy pickard and sara paretsky but there was max off to patagonia and adventure and here she was stuck in her closed bookstore on a rainy sunday afternoon with nothing to do but unpack books and wonder if max had managed to spring laurel even laurel should have known better than to take up a collection for amnesty international in the main hall of the justice ministry in buenos aires a tiny worm of worry wriggled in annies mind she knew of course that her husband was absolutely capable totally in command unflappable imperturbable annie snapped the book shut and bounced to her feet but oh sweet jesus who knew what kind of mess laurel had the phone rang annie leaped across the coffee area and grabbed up the extension behind the coffee bar she didnt bother saying death on demand the finest mystery bookstore on the loveliest resort island off the coast of south carolina wasnt open hello she tried not to sound concerned but maybe if she caught a jet tonight maxwell darling the tone was peremptory cutthroughtothebone direct annies shoulders tensed she immediately recognized the dry crackly voice that rustled like old paper what did chastain south carolinas most aristocratic imperious absolutely impossible old hag want with annies husband miss dora how are you annie could remember her manners even if some others could not annie could imagine the flicker of irritation in miss doras reptilian black eyes no time to waste get him to the phone i wish i could annie snapped where is he patagonia a thoughtful pause on the other end then a sniff laurel no doubt the old ladys voice rasped like a rattlesnake slithering across sand as she disgustedly pronounced the name of maxs mother of course annie groused and i darn well should have gone he might need me you know how dangerous it is in argentina a lengthening pause freighted with emanations of chagrin malevolence and rapid thought well ive no choice youll have to do meet me at oneohthree bay street at four oclock annies eyes narrowed with fury miss dora was obviously the same old hag shed always been and just who the hell did she think she was ordering annie to a matter of honor the phone banged into the receiver annie stalked down the stormdark street the november rain spattering against her yellow slicker clumps of sodden leaves squished underfoot the semitropical carolina low country was not completely immune to winter and days such as this presaged january and february annie felt another quiver of outrage why had she succumbed to the old bat why was she even now pushing open the gate and starting down the oystershell path to bay street the aged sandpapery voice sounded again in her mind a matter of honor the sign to the right of the front door hung unevenly one screw yielding to time and weather an amateur had painted the outstretched cupped hands the thumbs overlarge the palms lumpy the legend was faded but decipherable helping hands annie was almost to the steps of the white frame cottage when she saw miss dora standing regally beneath the low spreading limbs of an ancient live oak annie was accustomed to the gnomelike old ladys eccentric dresslastcentury bombazine dresses and hats scarlett would have adoredbut even annie was impressed by the full gray cloak the widebrimmed crimson hat protecting shaggy silver hair mid the ivory walking stick planted firmly in front of hightopped black leather shoes a welcoming smile tugged at annies lips then slid to oblivion as miss dora scowled and thumped the stick youre late the carillons play at four oclock carillons a vexed hiss gome come well go inside wanted you to hear the carillons its too neat you know the shot at precisely four oclock know it must have been then otherwise somebody would have heard thumping stiffly to the door miss dora scrabbled in her oversize crocheted receptacle no ones taking constances character into account not even her own brother blackening her name a damnable lie she jammed a black iron key into the lock as the door swung in miss dora led the way a tiny limping figure she clicked on the hall light then regarded annie with an obvious lack of enthusiasm would do it myself she muttered obscurely but sciatica with the rain in november the parchment face wrinkled with age also held lines of pain annie almost felt sorry for her almost the stick swished through the air a dependency of course small cramped cold floors in the winter constance had no use for her own creature comforts never gave them a thought sixty years she took care of the poor and the helpless here in chastain everybody welcome here the rasp muted to a whisper and may her murderer burn in hell the hair prickled on the back of annies neck she looked around the dimly lit linoleumfloored hallway worn straight chairs lined both sides of the hall near the door turned sideways to allow passageway sat a yellow pine desk the stick pointed at the desk manned by volunteers ten am to four pm every day but sunday emma louise rammert yesterday youll talk to her the calm assumption irritated annie look miss dora youre taking a lot for granted i only came over here because you hung up before i could say no now ive got things on my mind murder annie fervently hoped not surely max and laurel were safe max had promised to be careful he was going to hire a mercenary fly in to the secret airstrip hijack laurel from her captors a potful of money always worked wonders whatever the political persuasion and fly right back out oh hell she should have gone what if he needed her oh who knows annie moaned dont be a weak sister the old lady scolded asinine to fret hell cope despite his upbringing a thoughtful pause perhaps because of it any event youve work to do here the cane pointed at a closed door theres where it happened the rasp was back implacable ice hard vindictive the old lady moving painfully stumped to the door threw it open turned on the light her bloods still there im on the board gave instructions nothing to be disturbed annie edged reluctantly into the room she couldnt avoid seeing the desktop and the darkishbrown splotches on the scattered sheets of paper the lowbeamed ceiling and roughhewn unpainted board walls indicated an old leanto room no rugs graced the warped floorboards an unadorned wooden chair sat behind the scarred and nicked desk in one corner a small metal typewriter table held a remingtoncirca gloved fingers gripped annies elbow like talons the walking stick pointed across the room her chair thats the way the police found it propelled by the viselike grip annie crossed the few feet to the desk and stared at the chair the very unremarkable oak chair old yes but so was everything in the room old with a slat missing the ivory stick clicked against the chair seat no pillow constance always sat on a pillow bad hip never complained of course now you tell me young miss wheres that pillow right at four oclock and no pillow annie was so busy wondering if miss dora had finally gone around the bendwhich would be no surprise to her that was for surethat it took her a moment to realize she was young miss annie slanted a sideways glance miss dora hunched over her stick now her gloved hands tight on the knob she stared at the empty chair her lined face sorrowful sixty years i knew constance always doing good works didnt simper around with a pious whine or a holierthanthou manner came here every day and every day the poor in chastain came to her for help no electricity they came here husband beat you son stole your money they came here a sick child and no food they came here a tear edged down the ancient sallow cheek i used to tell her constance the worlds full of sorrow always has been always will be youre like the little dutch boy at the dike the old lady reached out a gloved hand and gently touched the straight chair then the reptilian eyes glittered at annie know what constance said no the dark little room and the bloodspattered desk held no echo of its former tenant this was just a cold and dreary place touched by violence constance said why dora love its so simple i was hungry and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me beyond the dry whisper was an echo of a light and musical voice miss doras stick cracked sharply against the wooden floor she stared at annie with dark and burning eyes a woman she rasped hard as stone against stone who saw her duty and did it a woman who would neverthe cane struckneverthe cane struckneverthe cane struckquit the course annie reached for the telephone then yanked her hand back dammit she dreaded making this call miss dora had almost persuaded her yesterday afternoon indeed constance boltons life did argue against her death annie studied the picture miss dora had provided of a slender whitehaired woman in a navy silk dress constance bolton looked serious capable and resourceful a woman accustomed to facing problems and solving them her wideset brown eyes were knowledgeable but not cynical her mouth was firm but not unpleasant stalwart steady thoughtfulyes she had obviously been all of these and more yetannie glanced down at the poorly reproduced copy of the autopsy report on constance maude bolton white female age seventytwothe answer seemed inescapable however unpalatable to constance boltons friends annie hated to destroy miss doras faith but facts were facts she dialed in a rush here miss dora this is annie im at the store listen i got a copy of the autopsy report on miss bolton annie took a deep breath she was sick miss dora dying bone cancer she hadnt told many people but she knew her doctor said so and there were powder burns on her hand gusts of polar wind could not have been colder than miss doras initial silence then she growled doesnt matter young miss get to work think the receiver thudded with the same force as the cane had struck the floor in that dingy office nevernevernever quit the course annie slammed down her own receiver and glared at the phone then jumped as it rang again death on demand the pillow miss dora intoned the pillow young miss the pillow and the receiver banged again annie jumped to her feet and paced across the coffee area agatha the bookstores elegant and imperious black cat watched with sleepy amber eyes dammit agatha the old bats going to drive me crazy agatha yawned unreasonable illtempered stubbornannie stopped at the coffee bar and reached for her mugbut not stupid agatha as she drank the delicious french roast brew annie stroked agathas silky fur and thought about miss dora irascible yes imperious yes stupid no and about as sentimental as an alligator so if she knows in the depth of her creaky bones that constance bolton wasnt a quitter where does that leave us if it wasnt suicide it had to be murder how could it be powder burns on her right hand constance bolton was righthanded a contact woundstarshapedto the right temple bone cancer and the gunannie returned to her table and riffled through the police reportthe gun had been identified by miss boltons housekeeper sammie calhoun a caliber revolver it had belonged to constance boltons late brother everett it had as long as sammie worked there lain in the bottom drawer of the walnut secretary in the library she had seen the gun as recently as late last week the fact that this gun had been brought from miss constances home was another pointer to suicide butif she had been murderedthe use of that gun sharply circumscribed the list of possible killers it had to be someone with access to the bottom drawer of that walnut secretary suicide or murder on the one hand terminal illness powder marks a contact wound a gun brought from home on the other hand miss doras unyielding faith in her friends character and a missing pillow annie sipped at her coffee a pillow there didnt seem to be any reasonshe thumped the mug on the counter and clapped her hands of course of course it could only have been done with a pillow and that explains why the murder had to occur at four oclock when the carillons sounded it wouldnt have been necessary to mask a single shot but it was essential to mask two shots oh my god the old devil was smart as hell annie pictured the dingy room and constance sitting behind the desk a visitorsomeone constance knew well surelystanding beside the desk the movement would have been snakequick a hand yanking the pistol from a pocket pressing it against her temple and firing that would have been the moment demanding swiftness agility then it would have been a simple matter edging the pillow from beneath her pressing her hand against the gun and firing into the pillow that would assure the requisite powder residue on her hand the stage then was set for suicide and it remained only to slip away taking the pillow and once home to wash with soap and water to remove the powder marks upon the killers hand oh yes annie could see it all even hear the tiny click as the door closed leaving death behind but was there anything to this picture was this interpretation an illusion born of miss doras grief or the work of a clever killer annie could hear the crackly voice and behind it the musical tones of a good woman i was hungry by god nobody was going to get away with the murder of constance bolton not if annie could help it annie focused on miss constances last few days if it was murder why now why on saturday november the housekeeper agreed that miss constance was sick but she paid it no nevermind miss constance she always kept on keepin on even after mr peter was killed in that car wreck up north that broke her heart but she never gave in howsomever she was dragged down last week thursday night she hardly pecked at her supper annie made a mental note about thursday she compiled a list of miss constances visitors at helping hands the past week the visitors were allto the volunteersfamiliar names familiar troubles familiar sorrows except on thursday portia finley said energetically we did have someone new late that afternoon a young man very thin he looked ill a yankee wouldnt tell me what his trouble was said he had to talk to miss constance personally he wrote out a note and asked me to take it in to her she read it and said shed see him immediately they were still in her office talking when i went home it took all of annies tact but she finally persuaded portia finley to admit shed read that short note on lined notepad paper i wanted to be sure it wasnt a threatening note or obscene oh by all means annie said encouragingly it didnt amount to much just said he was a friend of peters and peter had told him to come and see her fridays volunteer cindy axton reluctantly had nothing out of the ordinary to report but saturdays volunteer emma louise rammert had a sharp nose inquisitive steelgray eyes and a suspicious mind dont believe it was suicide they could show me a video of it and i still wouldnt believe it oh yes i know she was sick but she never spoke of it certainly that wouldnt be motive enough not for constance but something upset her that morning and i think it was the paper the clarion she was fine when she came in oh serious enough looked somber but not nervy she went into her office i came in just a moment later with the mail and she was staring down at the front page of the clarion like it had bitten her besides it seems a mighty odd coincidence that on the afternoon she was to die shed send me off early on what turned out to be a wild goose chase supposed to be a woman with a sick child at the happy vale trailer court and there wasnt anybody of that name so i think constance sent me off so she could talk to somebody without me hearing otherwise id of been there at four oclock just closing up was the volunteers absence engineered to make way for suicideor for an appointment constance bolton had she planned to die easily could have waited until the volunteer left for the day but if she wanted to talk to someone without being overheard what better place than her office at closing time annie picked up a copy of the saturday morning clarion and took it to the sip and sup coffee shop on main street the lead story was about arafat and another plo peace offer the town council had met to consider banning beer from the beach property owners attacked the newest beach nourishment tax proposals island merchants reported excellent holiday sales a story in the bottom right column was headed autopsy reveals car occupant murder victim beaufort county authorities announced today that a young man found in a burning car thursday night originally thought to have

feet seven inches tall weighed pounds was caucasian and suffered from aids the car was found by a passing motorist late thursday evening on culowee road two miles south of the intersection with jasper road the car was rented at the savannah airport on thursday by a richard davis of new york city authorities are seeking information about daviss activities in chastain anyone with any information about him is urged to contact sheriff chadwick porter annie called miss dora tell me about peter constances grandnephew his father morgan was the son of everett her older brother everett died about twenty years ago not long after morgan was killed in vietnam peter inherited the plantations but he never worked them james did that the other brother but they went to peter the oldest son of the oldest son inherits in the bolton family peter inherited from his mother too she was one of the cinnamon hill morleys grieved herself into the grave when morgan was killed in vietnam so constance raised the boy and james ran the plantations when he was grown peter went to new york a photographer didnt come back much then he was killed last winter a car wreck one car wreck had masked murder had another annie wished for max as she made one phone call after another but she knew how to do it when it became clear that peter bolton didnt die in a car wreckdespite that information in his obituary which had been supplied by his greatuncle jamesshe redoubled her efforts she found peters address his telephone number and the small magazine where his last photograph had been published and talked to the managing editor but peter wasnt murdered peter died in a new york hospital of aids and richard davis had been dying of aids before he was strangled and left in a burning car in beaufort county south carolina richards note to constance bolton claimed he was a friend of peters more than a friend maggie sutton had the apartment above richards in an old brooklyn brownstone her voice on the telephone was clipped and unfriendly you want to know anything about richard davis you ask before she could hang up destroy annies link to richard and through him to peter annie interrupted quickly richards dead murdered please talk to me i want to find his murderer it took a lot of explaining then maggie sutton said simply my god poor richie did you know richard was coming to south carolina yes he was sick i know and they fired him they arent supposed to but they do it anyway before most people with aids can appeal file a lawsuit theyre dead richie was almost out of money his insurance was gone they only want to insure healthy people you know nobody with real health problems can get insurance richie and peter lived downstairs from me nice guys she paused repeated forcefully nice guys a sigh god its all so grim richie took care of peter he died last winter last week richie told me he was going on a trip and he asked me to feed their cat big boy while he was gone richie said peter had written a will before he died leaving everything to richie but he didnt do anything about it then i mean he didnt want peters money but now he was desperate and he thought maybe if he went down there showed the will to the family her voice trailed off the family the last surviving member of the family stood with his head bowed his freshly shaved face impassive his hands clasped loosely behind his back as mourners dispersed at the conclusion of the graveside service on tuesday afternoon a darksuited employee of the funeral home held a black umbrella to shield james caldwell bolton from the rain the day and james bolton were a study in grays the metallic gray of constance boltons casket resting over the dark pit of her grave the steel gray of boltons pinstripe suit the soft gray of weathered stones the misty gray of the weeping sky the silver gray of miss doras rain cape the flinty gray of the stubby palmettos bark the ashgray of the rectors grizzled hair annie huddled beneath the outspread limbs of a live oak a thick wool scarf knotted at her throat her raincoat collar upturned rain splashed softly against gravestones as mourners came forth to shake boltons hand and murmur condolences annie stared at the man who had inherited the bolton and morley family plantations james bolton didnt look like a murderer he lookedas indeed he waslike a substantial and respectable and wealthy member of the community there was a resemblance to his dead sister brown eyes white hair a firm chin but where constances face was memorable for its calm pity and gentle concern there was an intolerant and arrogant quality to his stolid burghers face as the last of miss constances friends trod away across the spongy ground of the graveyard annie left the oystershell path skirting behind a stand of pines she moved into the oldest part of the cemetery stopping in the shadow of a crumbling mausoleum some twentyfive yards distant from the new grave site bolton waved away the undertaker with the umbrella had any of the mourners looked back they would have glimpsed his figure head again bowed lingering for a last moment with his sister but annie could see his face it was for a singular heartstopping instant transformed his lips curved up in satisfaction annie knew as clearly as if hed shouted that james bolton was exulting a murderer twice over safe secure successful a rich and powerful man james his face reformed into sad repose as he turned toward miss dora the old lady took her time each step obviously a painful task annie slipped free of her raincoat unfurled a navy umbrellasammie calhoun had quite willingly given her mistresss umbrella to miss doraand undid the scarf covering the curly white wig miss dora her wizened face contorted in a worried frown peered up at james bolton james ive had the oddestthe raspy voice waveredcommunication the ouija board last night never been a believer in that sort james annie held a high light musical tone than let her voice waver and drop like the sigh of a winter wind in her own ears it didnt sound enough like the recorded interview the local radio station had found of constance bolton speaking out in a league of women voters forum on abortion she tried again a little louder james it must have been better than shed thought james boltons head whipped around seeking out the sound his face was suddenly gray too the color of old putty annie glided from behind the cover of the mausoleum one hand outstretched james then she backed away just as a dimly seen figure might drift forth then disappear once out of boltons sight she darted in a crouch from stone to stone until she gained the street quickly pulling on the scarf and raincoat she hurried to miss doras heh heh heh miss doras satisfied cackle would chill the devil she poured a cup of steaming tea annie sneezed the heat against her fingers helped a little but she didnt feel that her bones would ever warm from the graveyard cold miss dora glowered no time to flag young people today too puny im fine annie retorted crisply and knew she was catching a cold but she couldnt afford to sneeze tonight she and miss dora werent finished with james bolton scared him to death miss dora gloated he looked like bleached bones her raisindark eyes glittered mouth open whites of his eyes big as a platter and when i pretended i hadnt seen or heard a thing thought he was going to faint thats when i told him about the ouija message pillow find pillow she cackled again annie took a big gulp of tea and voiced her concern miss dora how can we be sure he didnt destroy the pillow miss doras disdainful look infuriated annie classical education taught people how to think the old lady muttered crystal clear young miss he dared not leave it behind he had to take it with him then what he couldnt keep it in his house old beulah willens his housekeeper not a single spot safe from her eyes so not hidden in his house no incinerators permitted in the city besides its too bulky to burn well joe bill tompkins drives james so not in his car i talked here and there hes not been out to any of the plantations since constance died so where is it somewhere not too far young miss another malicious cackle james thinks hes so smart well see wont we the rain had eased to a drizzle annie was warm enough a black wool cap thermal underwear a rainproof jacket over a wool sweater rainproof pants sturdy black reeboks the nylon hose over her face made it hard to breathe but it sure kept her toasty from her vantage point she could see both the front and rear doors to james boltons house she had taken up her station at nine thirty miss dora was to make her phone call at nine thirtyfive and play the recording annie had made and remade until annies whispered james im coming for the pillow sounded sufficiently like constance bolton to satisfy miss dora the back door opened at nine forty james bolton too was dressed for night in dark clothing he paused on the top step and looked fearfully around then hurried to the garage annie smiled grimly he reappeared in only a moment carrying a spade annie followed him across the bolton property and through a dank and dripping wood she stepped softly along the path keeping his shaded flashlight in view stopping when he stopped moving when he moved whoooooooooo annies heart somersaulted and she gasped for breath bolton cowered by a live oak annie wasnt sure which one of them the owl had frightened the most iron hinges squealed and bolton stepped through the opened gate to the old graveyard leaving the gate ajar he moved more cautiously now and the beam from his flashlight poked jerkily into shadowy pockets did he fear that his dead sister awaited him annie tiptoed scarcely daring to breathe one hand slipped into her jacket pocket and closed around the sausagethick canister of mace a relic of the days when she lived in new york the other hand touched the leica that hung from a strap around her neck bolton stopped twice to listen annie crouched behind gravestones and waited when he reached the oldest section of the cemetery he moved more boldly confident now that he was unobserved he walked directly to a winged angel atop a marble pedestal stepped five paces to his right and used the shovel to sweep away a mound of leaves annie was willing to bet the earth beneath those leaves had been recently loosened he shoveled quickly but placing the heaps of moist sandy dirt in a neat pile to one side annie crept closer and closer the leica in hand she was not more than ten feet away and ready when he reached down and lifted up a soggy newspaperwrapped oblong the flash illuminated the graveyard with its brief brilliant light capturing forever and always the stricken face of james bolton he made a noise deep in his throat wielding the shovel he lunged blindly toward the source of light annie danced sideways to evade him now the canister of mace came out and as he flailed the shovel and it crashed against a gravestone annie pressed the trigger and mace spewed in a noisome mist annie held her breath darted close enough to grab up the sodden oblong where he had dropped it paused just long enoughshe couldnt resist itto moan jaaammees then she ran faster than shed ever managed in a k leaping graves like a fox over water hazards the headline in next mornings clarion told it all james bolton charged in murder of sister miss dora rattled the newspaper with satisfaction then poured annie another cup of coffee the old ladys raisindark eyes glittered we showed him didnt we saved constances good name for onceand it was such an odd feelingannie felt total rapport with the illtempered opinionated impossible creature awaiting her answer annie grinned miss dora we sure as hell did annie bought her own copy of the newspaper before she took the ferry back to the island she wanted to have it to show to max especially since his telegram had arrived last night retrieval accomplished no fireworks boring actually only action caused by fleas laurel picked up in jail plus tourista tummy me home soon but not soon enough love max ghost station by carolyn wheat a brooklynbased attorney carolyn wheat naturally has a criminal lawyer cass jameson as her series detective cass has solved cases in at least two wonderful books where nobody dies and dead mans thoughts the latter novel was nominated for an edgar allan poe award if theres one thing i cant stand its a woman drunk the words burned my memory the way irish whiskey used to burn my throat only there was no pleasant haze of alcohol to follow just bitter heartburn pain it was my first night back on the job back to being sergeant maureen gallagher instead of the patient wasnt it hard enough being a transit cop hurtling beneath the streets of manhattan on a subway train that should have been in the transit museum wasnt it enough that after four weeks of detox i felt empty instead of clean and sober did i have to have some rookies casually cruel words ricocheting in my brain like a wildcard bullet why couldnt i remember the good stuff why couldnt i think about oharas beefy handshake greenspans glad to see ya mo ianuzzos smiling welcome why did i have to run the tape in my head of manny delgado asking captain lomax for a different partner hey i got nothing against a lady sarge cap hed said dont get me wrong its just that if theres one thing i cant stand et cetera lomax had done what any standup captain wouldkicked delgados ass and told him the assignment stood what he hadnt known was that id heard the words and couldnt erase them from my mind even without delgado the night hadnt gotten off to a great start swinging in at midnight for a twelvetoeight id been greeted with the news that i was on graffiti patrol the dirtiest most mindnumbing assignment in the whole transit police duty roster i was a sergeant damn it on my way to a gold shield and i wasnt going to earn it dodging rats in tunnels or going after twelveyearolds armed with spray paint especially when the rest of the cop world both under and aboveground was working overtime on the torch murders of homeless people thered been four human bonfires in the past six weeks and the cops were determined there wouldnt be a fifth was lomax punishing me or was this assignment his subtle way of easing my entry back into the world either way i resented it i wanted to be a real cop again back with sal minucci my old partner he was assigned to the big one in the thick of the action where both of us belonged i should have been with him i was anticrime for gods sake i should have been assigned or should i did i really want to spend my work nights prowling new yorks underground skid row trying to get information from men and women too zonked out to take care of legs gone gangrenous whose lives stretched from one bottle of cool breeze to another hell yes if it would bring me one step closer to that gold shield id interview all the devils in hell on my day off if theres one thing i cant stand its a woman drunk what did lomax thinkthat mingling with winos would topple me off the wagon that id ask for a hit from some guys short dog and pass out in the bleecker street station was that why hed kept me off the big one and had me walking a rookie through routine graffiti patrol was i getting paranoid or was lack of alcohol rotting my brain manny and i had gone to our respective locker rooms to suit up plain clothesand i do mean plain long johns first damp winter had a way of seeping down into the tunnels and into your very blood then a pair of denims the goodwill would have turned down thick wool socks fishermans duck boots a black turtleneck and a photographers vest with lots of pockets a black knit hat pulled tight over my red hair then the gear flashlight more important than a gun on this assignment handcuffs ticket book radio gun knife a slapper an oversize blackjack hidden in the rear pouch of the vest they were against regulations id get at least a command discipline if caught with it but experience told me id rather have it than a gun going against a pack of kids id forgotten how heavy the stuff was i felt like a telephone lineman i looked like a cat burglar delgado and i met at the door it was obvious hed never done vandal duty before his tan chinos were immaculate and his hiking boots didnt look waterproof his red plaid flannel shirt was neither warm enough nor the right dark color with his latin good looks he would have been stunning in an ll bean catalogue but after ten minutes in a subway tunnel hed pass for a chimney sweep where are we going he asked his tone a shade short of sullen and there was no respectful sergeant at the end of the question either this boy needed a lesson in manners i took a malicious delight in describing our destination the black hole of calcutta i replied cheerfully explaining that i meant the unused lower platform of the city hall station downtown the oldest darkest dankest spot in all manhattan if there were any subway alligators they definitely lurked in the black hole the expression on probationary transit police officer manuel delgados face was all i could have hoped for i almostbut not quitetook pity on the kid when i added and after that well try one or two of the ghost stations ghost stations now he looked really worried what are those this kid wasnt just a rookie he was a suburbanite every new yorker knew about ghost stations abandoned platforms where trains no longer stopped they were still lit though and showed up in the windows of passing trains like ghost towns on the prairie they were ideal canvases for the aspiring artists of the underground city i explained on the subway heading downtown the car which rattled under the city streets like a tin lizzie was nearly riderless at am a typical monday late tour the passengers were one orthodox jewish man falling asleep over his hebrew bible two black women both reading thick paperback romances the obligatory pair of teenagers making out in the last seat and an old chinese woman i didnt want to look at delgado more than once id seen a fleeting smirk on his face when i glanced his way it wasnt enough for insubordination the best policy was to ignore it i let the rhythm of the subway car lull me into a litany of the aa slogans i was trying to work into my life easy doesit keep it simple sweetheart one day at a time i saw them in my mind the way they appeared on the walls at meetings illuminated like old celtic manuscripts this night i had to take one hour at a time maybe even one minute at a time my legs felt wobbly i was a sailor too long from the sea id lost my subway legs i felt white and thin as though id had several major organs removed then the drunk got on one of the black women got off the other one looked up at the station sign and went back to her book and the drunk got on if theres one thing i cant stand its a woman drunk one day at a time easy does ft i stiffened the last thing i wanted was to react in front of delgado but i couldnt help it the sight of an obviously intoxicated man stumbling into our subway car brought the knowing smirk back to his face there was one at every aa meeting no matter how nice the neighborhood how well dressed most people attending the meeting were there was always a drunk a real drunk still reeling still reeking of cheap booze my sponsor margie said they were there for a reason to let us middleclass recoveryoriented types remember that there but for the grace of god i cringed whenever i saw them especially if the object lesson for the day was a woman hey kid the drunk called out to delgado in a voice as inappropriately loud as a deaf mans how old are you the doors closed and the car lurched forward the drunk all but fell into his seat old enough manny replied flashing the polite smile a wellbroughtup kid saves for his maiden aunt the undertone wasnt so pretty little sidelong glances at me that said see how nice i am to this old fart see what a good boy i am i like drunks sergeant gallagher to avoid my partners sly face i concentrated on the subway ads as though they contained all the wisdom of the big book heres to birth defects proclaimed a pregnant woman about to down a glass of beer two monks looked to heaven thanking god in spanish for the fine quality of their brandy werent there any signs on this damn train that didnt involve booze finally an ad i could smile at the moon in black space on it someone had scrawled alice kramden was here my smile faded as i remembered sal minuccis raised fist his jackie gleason growl one a these days gallagher youre goin to the moon to the moon it wasnt just the murder case i missed it was sal the easy partnership of the man whod put up with my hangovers my depressions my wild nights out with the boys yknow how old i am the drunk shouted almost falling over in his seat he righted himself fiftyfour in september he announced an expectant look on his face after a quick smirk in my direction manny gave the guy what he wanted you dont look it he said no trace of irony appeared on his spanish altar boys face it was as though hed never said the words that were eating into me like batteryacid aa coffee the sudden jab of anger that stabbed through me took me by surprise especially since it wasnt directed at delgado no you dont look it i thought you look more like seventy white wisps of hair over a bright pink scalp the face more than pink a slab of raw calves liver road maps of broken blood vessels on his nose and cheeks thin white arms and matchstick legs under toobig trousers when he lifted his hand ropy with bulging blue veins it fluttered like a pennant in the breeze like uncle pauls hands i turned away sharply i couldnt look at the old guy anymore the constant visual digs delgado kept throwing in my direction were nothing compared to the pain of looking at a man dying before my eyes i didnt want to see blue eyes in that neardead face as blue as the lakes of killarney uncle paul used to say in his mockirish brogue i focused on the teenagers making out in the rear of the car a couple of spanish kids wearing identical pink tshirts and black leather jackets if i stared at them long enough would they stop groping and kissing or would an audience spur their passion uncle paul after daddy left us he was my special friend and i was his best girl i squeezed my eyes shut but the memories came anyway the red bike uncle paul gave me for my tenth birthday the first really big new thing bought just for me that id ever had the best part was showing it off to cousin tommy for once i didnt need his handmedowns or aunt bridgets clucking over me for being poor god bless the child whos got her own i opened my eyes just as the lex passed through the ghost station at worth street closed off to the public for maybe fifteen years it seemed a mirage dimly seen through the dirty windows of the subway car bright color on the white tile walls told me graffiti bombers had been there a good place to check but not until after city hall i owed manny delgado a trip to the black hole uh sergeant i turned a patronizing smile played on delgados lips hed apparently been trying to get my attention sony i said feigning a yawn just a little tired yeah sure his look remarked were coming to brooklyn bridge shouldnt we get off the train right leave uncle paul where he belongs at the brooklyn bridge stop we climbed up the steps to the upper platform showed our id to the woman token clerk and told her we were going into the tunnel toward city hall then we went back downstairs heading for the south end of the downtown platform as we were about to go past the gate marked no unauthorized personnel beyond this point i looked back at the lighted platform which made a crescentshaped curve behind us almost in a mirror image the old drunk was about to pass the forbidden gate and descend into the tunnel heading uptown he stepped carefully holding on to the white bathroomtile walls edging himself around the waisthigh gate he lowered himself down the stone steps the exact replica of the ones manny and i were about to descend then disappeared into the blackness i couldnt let him go there were too many dangers in the subway dangers beyond the torch killer everyone was on the hunt for how many frozen bodies had i stumbled over on the catwalks between tunnels how many huddled victims had been hit by trains as they lay in sodden sleep and yet i had to be careful my friend kathy denzer had gone after a bum sleeping on the catwalk only to have the man stab her in the arm for trying to save his life i couldnt let him go turning to delgado i said lets save city hall for later i saw some graffiti at worth street on the way here lets check that out first he shrugged at least he was being spared the black hole his expression said entering the tunnels blackness leaving behind the brightly lit world of sleepy riders a tiny rush of adrenaline like msg after a chinese dinner coursed through my bloodstream part of it was pure reversion to childhoods fears hansel and gretel snow white lost in dark woods with enemies all around in this case rats their scuffling sent shivers up my spine as we balanced our way along the catwalk above the tracks the other part was elation this was my job i was good at it i could put aside my fears and step boldly down into murky depths where few new yorkers ever went our flashlights shone dim as fireflies i surveyed the gloomy underground world id spent my professional life in my imagination often took over in the tunnels they became caves of doom or an evil wood out of lord of the rings the square columns holding up the tunnel roof were leafless trees the constant trickle of foul water between the tracks a poisonous stream from which no one drank and lived jones beach uncle pauls huge hand cradling my foot then lifting me high in the air and flinging me backward laughing with delight into the cool water droplets clinging to his red beard and uncle paul shaking them off into the sunlight like a wet irish setter me and mo were the only true gallaghers the only redheads i got straight as in english nobodys grammar was safe from meexcept uncle pauls i thought all men smelled like him whiskey and tobacco as manny and i plodded along the fourblock tunnel between the live station and the dead one we exchanged no words the acrid stench of an old track fire filled my nostrils the way memories flooded my mind trying to push uncle paul away i bent all my concentration on stepping carefully around the foulsmelling water the burned debris i didnt want to identify i suspected delgados silence was due to fear he wouldnt want a shaking voice to betray his tension i knew how he felt the first nighttime tunnel trek was a landmark in a young transit cops life when the downtown express thundered past we ducked into the coffinsized alcoves set aside for transit workers my heart pounded as the wind wake of the train pulled at my clothes the fear of falling forward landing under those relentless steel wheels never left me no matter how many times i stood in the well i always thought of anna karenina once in a while in my drinking days id wondered how it would feel to edge forward to let the trains undertow pull me toward death i could never do it id seen too much blood on the tracks light at the end of the tunnel the worth street station sent rays of hope into the spidery blackness my step quickened delgados pace matched mine soon we were almost running toward the light like cavemen coming from the hunt to sit by the fire of safety we were almost at the edge of the platform when i motioned delgado to stop my hunger to bathe in the light was as great as his but our post was in the shadows watching a moment of panic id lost the drunk had he fallen on the tracks the electrified third rail roasting him like a pig at a barbecue not possible wed have heard and smelted i had to admit the graffiti painting wasnt a mindless scrawl it was a picture full of color and life humanlike figures in bright primary shades grassgreen royalblue orange sunyellow and carnationpinkcolors unknown in the blackandgray tunnelsstood in a line waiting to go through a subway turnstile sexless they were cookiecutter replicas of one another the only difference among them the color inside the black edges a rhythmic clicking sound made delgado jump what the hell relax manny i whispered its the ball bearing in the spraypaint can the vandals are here as soon as the paint hits the tiles we jump out and bust them four rowdy teenagers ranging in color from light brown to ebony laughed raucously and punched one another with a theatrical style that said we bad we real bad they bounded up the steps from the other side of the platform and surveyed their artwork playful as puppies pointing out choice bits they had added to their mural it should have been simple two armed cops with the advantage of surprise against four kids armed with dayglo spray paint two tilings kept it from being simple the drank wherever the hell he was and the fact that one of the kids said hey bro when cool and jojo gettin here a very black kid with a nylon stocking on his head answered jojo be comin with pinto cool say he might be hringin slasher and tp great instead of two against four it sounded like all the graffiti artists in new york city were planning a convention in the worth street ghost station sarge delgados voice was urgent weve gotta i know i whispered back get on the radio and call for backup then i remembered worth street was a dead spot lead in the ceiling above our heads turned our radios into worthless toys stop i said wearily as manny pulled the antenna up on his handheld radio it wont work youll have to go back to brooklyn bridge alert booth robert two twentyone have them call operations just ask for backup dont make it a tenthirteen a meant officer in trouble and i didnt want to be the sergeant who cried wolf try the radio along the way i went on you never know when it will come to life im not sure where the lead ends watching delgado trudge back along the catwalk i felt lonely helpless and stupid no one knew wed gone to worth street instead of the black hole and that was my fault hey one of the kids called pointing to a pile of old clothes in the corner of the platform what this dude be doin in our crib dude what dude then the old clothes began to rise it was the drunk from the train he was huddled into a fetal ball hoping not to be noticed by the graffiti gang nylon stocking boogied over to the old drunk sticking a finger in his ribs what you be doin here ol man huh answer me a fat kid with a flat top walked over sat down next to the drunk reached into the old mans jacket pocket and pulled out a halfempty pint bottle a lighterskinned thinner boy slapped the drunk around first lifting him by the scruff of the neck then laughing as he flopped back to the floor the old guy tried to rise only to be kicked in the ribs by nylon stocking the old guy was bleeding at the mouth fat boy held the pint of booze aloft teasing the drunk the way you tease a dog with a bone the worst part was that the drunk was reaching for it hands flapping wildly begging hed have barked if theyd asked him to i was shaking my stomach starting to heave god where was manny where was my backup i had to stop the kids before their friends got there but i felt too sick to move if theres one thing i cant stand its a woman drunk it was as though every taunt every kick was aimed at me not just at the old man i reached into my belt for my gun then opened my vests back pouch and pulled out the slapper ready to charge i stopped cold when nylon stocking said yo yall want to do him like we done the others fat boys face lit up yeah he agreed feel like a cold night we needs a little fire you right bro the lightskinned kid chimed in i got the kerosene done took it from my momma heater what he deserve man the fourth member of the gang said his voice a low growl comin into our crib pissin on the art smellin up the place this here our turf dig he prodded the old man in the chest ii didnt mean nothing the old man whimpered i just wanted a place to sleep uncle paul sleeping on our couch when he was too drunk for aunt rose to put up with him he was never too drunk for mom to take him in never too drunk to give me one of his sweet irish smiles and call me his best girl the lightskinned kid opened the bottleironically it looked as if it once contained whiskeyand sprinkled the old man the way my mother sprinkled clothes before ironing them nylon stocking pulled out a book of matches by the time delgado came back with or without backup thered be one more bonfire if i didnt do something fast surprise was my only hope four of them young and strong one of me out of shape and shaky i shot out a light i cracked the bulb on the first shot target shooting was my best asset as a cop and i used it to give the kids the impression they were surrounded the kids jumped away from the drunk moving in all directions shit one said who shootin i shot out the second and last bulb in the dark i had the advantage they wouldnt know at least at first that only one cop was coming after them lets book another cried aint worth stayin here to get shot i ran up the steps onto the platform lit only by the moonlike rays from the other side of the tracks yelling stop police i waded into the kids swinging my illegal slapper thump into the ribs of the kid holding the kerosene bottle he dropped it clutching his chest and howling i felt the breath whoosh out of him heard the snap of rib cracking i wheeled and slapped nylon stocking across the knee earning another satisfying howl my breath came in gasps curses pouring out of me blood pounding in my temples a thumping noise that sounded louder than the express train the advantage of surprise was over the other two kids jumped me one riding my back the other going for my stomach with hard little fists all i could see was a maddened teenage tornado circling me with blows my arm felt light as i thrust my gun deep into the kids stomach he doubled groaning it was like chugging beer at a cop racket every hit every satisfying whack of blackjack against flesh made me hungry for the next i whirled and socked the kids kept coming and i kept knocking them down like bowling pins the adrenaline rush was stupendous filling me with elation i was a real cop again there was life after detox at last they stopped panting i stood among the fallen exhausted my hair had escaped from my knit hat and hung in matted tangles over a face redhot as a griddle i pulled out my cuffs and chained the kids together wrist to wrist wishing i had enough sets to do each individually together even cuffed they could overpower me especially since they were beginning to realize i was alone i felt weak spent as though id just made love i sat down on the platform panting my gun pointed at nylon stocking you have the right to remain silent i began as i finished the last miranda warning on the last kid i heard the cavalry coming over the hill manny delgado with four reinforcements as the new officers took the collars i motioned manny aside taking him to where the drunk lay sprawled in the corner still shaking and whimpering do you smell anything i asked manny wrinkled his nose i looked down at the drunk a trickle of water seeped from underneath him his crotch was soaked uncle paul weaving his way home singing offkey stopping to take a piss under the lamppost nothing unusual in that except that this time julie ann mackinnon my eighthgrade rival watched from across the street my cheeks burned as i recalled how shed told the other kids what shed seen her hand cupped over her giggling mouth not that i said my tone sharp my face reddening the kerosene these kids are the torch killers they were going to roast this guy thats why i had to take them on alone delgados face registered the skepticism id seen lurking in his eyes all night could he trust me hed been suitably impressed at my chain gang of prisoners but now i was talking about solving the crime that had every cop in the city on overtime look just go back to brooklyn bridge and radio i was going to say captain lomax when i thought better no call sal minucci in anticrime hell want to have the guys coat analyzed and make sure somebody takes good care of that bottle i pointed to the nowempty whiskey bottle the lightskinned boy had poured kerosene from isnt that his manny indicated the drunk no his is a short dog i said then turned away as i realized the term was not widely known in nondrunk circles just go kid i prayed get the hell out of here before he turned following the backup officers with their chain gang and send for emergency medical for this guy i added ill stay here till they come i looked down at the drunk his eyes were blue a watery nocolor blue with all the life washed out of them uncle pauls eyes uncle paul blurryfaced and maudlin too blitzed to care that id come home from school with a medal for the best english composition id put my masterpiece by his chair so he could read it after dinner he spilled whiskey on it the blueblack ink ran like tears and blotted out my carefully chosen words uncle paul old sick and dying just like this one living by that time more on the street than at home though there were people who would take him in his eyes more red than blue his big frame wasted i felt a sob rising like death squeezing my lungs i heaved grabbing for air my face was wet with tears i didnt recall shedding hate you uncle paul ill never be like you never i walked over to the drunk still sprawled on the platform i was a sleepwalker my arm lifted itself i jabbed the butt of my gun into old thin ribs feeling it bump against bone it would be a baseballsize bruise first a raw redpurple then blueviolet finally a sickly yellowgray i lifted my foot just high enough to land with a thud near the kidneys the old drunk grunted his mouth falling open a drizzle of saliva fell to the ground he put shaking hands to his face and squeezed his eyes shut i lifted my foot again i wanted to kick and kick and kick uncle paul a frozen lump of meat found by some transit cop on the aboveground platform at st street the yankee stadium stop where he took me when the yanks played home games wed eat at the yankee tavern me wolfing down a corned beef on rye and a cream soda uncle paul putting away draft beer after draft beer before he died uncle paul had taken all the coins out of his pocket stacking them in neat little piles beside him quarters dimes nickels pennies an inventory of his worldly goods i took a deep shuddering breath looked down at the sad old man id brutalized a hot rush of shame washed over me i knelt down gently moving the frail bluewhite hands away from the neartransparent face the fear i saw in the liquid blue eyes sent a piercing ray of selfhatred through me if theres anything i cant stand its a woman drunk me too manny i cant stand women drunks either the old mans lips trembled tears filled his eyes and rolled down his thin cheeks he shook his head from side to side as though trying to wake himself from a bad dream why he asked his voice a ravens croak because i loved you so much the words werent in my head anymore they were slipping out into the silent empty world of the ghost station as though uncle paul werent buried in calvary cemetery but could hear me with the ears of this old man who looked too damn much like him because i wanted to be just like you and i am my voice broke im just like you uncle paul im a drunk i put my head on my knee and sobbed like a child all the shame of my drinking days welled up in my chest the stupid things id said and done the times id had to be taken home and put to bed the times id thrown up in the street outside the bar if theres one thing i cant stand oh god i wish i were dead the bony hand on mine felt like a talon i started then looked into the old mans watery eyes i sat in the ghost station and saw in this stranger the ghost that had been my dying uncle why should you wish a thing like that the old man asked his voice was clear no boozeblurred slurring no groping for words burned out of the brain by alcohol youre a young girl youve got your whole life ahead a you my whole life to be continued one day at a time one night at a time when i got back to the district changed out of my work clothes showered would there be a meeting waiting for me damn right in the city that never sleeps aa never sleeps either i reached over to the old man my fingers brushed his silver stubble im sorry uncle paul i said im sorry where are you monica by maria antonia oliver born in manacor majorca spam maria antonia oliver also maintains a home in barcelona a leading catalan writer she has written more than six novels and is also a noted translator of american and english classics into her native language her mystery novel a study in lilac was very well received in europe and north america her translator kathleen mcnerney is a professor of spanish and catalan at the university of west virginia in morgantown i is mr guiu here he asked im ms guiu i said we looked each other over eyebrows arched by surprise he sure hadnt expected to find a female detective for my part i certainly never expected to find a man like him in my greasy office what a mantall well dressed well built the kind that turns your head on the street the kind you want a hug from when you have them nearby may i help you he took a chair from in front of quims desk and sat down in front of mine his gestures were secure and indifferent as if he hadnt done anything in his whole life except move chairs from one place to another in my office he had gray eyes and his fingernails were manicureclean and polished look i its kind of sensitive you know i mean does it have to do with fucking around by any chance i cut in quickly it was a system that on more than one occasion had spared me having to play the role of psychiatrist or confessor and then lending a shoulder to cry on what your wife has a lover and you want us to catch them in flagrante right good heavens lady then maybe your lover is messing around with someone else and he smiled sadly no it wasnt that either he even seemed offended then i was about to let out another guess but i withheld it if i kept on chasing wild geese like that i could lose my client and guiu investigation agency couldnt afford such a luxury look its that my wife disappeared three days ago so i wasnt so far off base after all shit he didnt need to put on such an act for christs sake just like that i asked has she called you or did she leave a letter or anything no nothing at all did you have a fight i mean do you have any idea why she might have wanted to disappear no not at all are you very wealthy ill pay whatever you charge no i didnt mean that i wasnt worried about my fees i was thinking of the possibility of a kidnapping he turned pale and looked scared i thought he was going to fall off his chair why dont you tell me about it in more detail i said immediately okay maybe but but what before giving you more details i want to know whether youre going to take on the job but our policy is not to accept any job until we know the details have you called the police no her family doesnt want that why not what about what you want have they looked for her themselves he gestured for me to stop he was smiling but barely look her family especially her father doesnt want anyone to know about it because theyre highclass people know what i mean me id do anything to find her just to know shes okay you understand right if she doesnt want to come back what can i do we cant force people to do things they dont want to do after all so both you and her family believe that she ran away from home no no we dont have any idea not at all he didnt say anything for a while i waited i was prepared to be patient after all that mornings work was pretty mechanical and for me it was a lot more fun to contemplate those eyes that mouth half hidden by a moustache cultivated with a studied nonchalance much more fun than typing up reports on people who had purchased televisions or refrigerators and then tried to pay for them in installments we started to call the hospitals he finally said but then we figured there were professionals out there who could do it better more discreetly than we couldyou know what i mean dont you yes of course so will you take it on you said before that we wouldnt have to argue about money or something like that right he smiled it was sort of a suppressed smile as if he didnt want to seem too satisfied he brushed his hand across his forehead and installed himself more comfortably in the chair you can send me the bill miss guiu to discuss money at the moment seems like an insult to my wife but you might be able to find another agency that would do it cheaper perhaps but i feel confident with you i was surprised to find a woman doing this kind of work but for the job i want you to do i think its better to have a woman than a man why well because itll be easier for you to get inside the mentality of another woman and that way youll do better at tracking her down okay now lets start at the beginning i said i reached for a notebook and turned on the tape recorder listen miss guiu why dont we go to a quieter place to discuss this it seemed to me that it would be hard to find a quieter place a more pleasant place that would be easy ii when i got into the car i was assaulted by an overly enthusiastic dog that jumped on me from the backseat and made itself comfortable on my lap youre the first person shes paid any attention to since monicas not around she hasnt eaten a bite for two days poor thing i was moved as i watched victor and the dog leaving when the two had left the bar i began to go over the notes monica pradell thirtytwo years old married for eight years to victor cabanes only child of mateu pradell and angela comessa mr pradell head of a construction company high social standing mr cabanes architect partner of mr pradell in several development projects architecture office together with am and jfr monica and victor live in the pavilion located on mr and mrs pradells land no kids ideal couple both monica and ms comessa housewives monica fond of enamel work serene character sure of herself not a showoff a real homebody reserved not many friends a few girl friends from high school classical dressing style with some extravagant detailsscarves jewelry flowers very high heels always very goodlooking legs almost sculptured loves the sea good health not a spendthrift except for the beauty parlor lots of changes in hairstyle and color she didnt have any reason to run away she was happy she wasnt scatterbrained reject the possibility of a prank of some kind a lover or affair was out of the question so was suicide how about kidnapping then so far no signs afraid that something has happened to her but she always carried a card in her purse in case of accident notify datebook on her desk but no significant notations normal appointments at the beauty parlor and with some girl friends not a member of any club or association last time seen thursday february beige suit with lilac silk blouse and a beige felt hat with a ribbon and fabric flowers there dont seem to be any jewels missing but they arent exactly sure how many she had no large withdrawal from her personal account she usually carried a couple of hundred dollars with her plus credit cards she was supposed to go to the beauty parlor but she didnt show up very curly hair the color of mahogany the photograph victor brought me didnt give any details away it was of a group a blurry snapshot and that silhouette in a bathing suit surrounded by other silhouettes could have been me myself iii mr cabanes please they put me through the sieve the telephone operator the head secretary an overseer who insisted on knowing why and about what i wanted to talk to victor finally the voice of his personal secretary said as soon as i told her my name that mr cabanes was in a meeting but he had ordered that he should be notified right away if i called tell me miss guiu have you found something no not yet listen mr cabanes id like to talk to you to find out more details all right right now if you wish by the way remember i need another photograph id like to have another look at the datebook too and if possible id like to see her clothes her jewelry the atmosphere in a word to get a better idea you know there was a pause finally very well come over for dinner to the pavilion i mean around nine is that okay i warn you im a vegetarian listen miss guiu it doesnt matter to me what you are or arent the only thing im interested in is the job i gave you to do nothing more pedantic shithead all right then your wife isnt in any clinic hospital or hotel in the city nor is she at the morgue thats all i know at the moment im not the holy ghost you know its all right dont get mad tonight come in through the door on modolell street that way you wont have to go through my inlaws yard i was ringing the doorbell of the pavilion at nine on the dot it was a cozy house and very luxurious of course it was a rich peoples nest with all the comforts both necessary and superfluous and those are the most comfortable ones spacious pleasant and mr victor cabanesjesus i could have smothered him with kisses but i kept my grip a job was a job before dinner i scrutinized the belongings of the missing person the quantity was indescribable dresses jackets skirts blouses coats lots of everything incredibly high heels for sure i couldnt tell you whether anything is missing or not victor told me but at least the suitcases are where they belong then the jewelry some real some not i mean costume jewelry but good stuff and lots of it the only things missing are the enamel pendant and ring she made herself she was very proud of them and never took them off we dined by candlelight and started on the photos monica doesnt like to have her picture taken i couldnt find many at all a few from my inlaws some i had and a couple from her desk the champagne was leaving the bottle little by little and the warm atmosphere in the room almost made me forget why we were looking at the pictures let it be said in passing they were all really bad no works of art thats for sure where was this taken i asked the aegean sea didnt i tell you monica was crazy about the sea that must have been from our honeymoon youre wearing the same sweater youre wearing now oh yeah its true he laughed it was a romantic story monica had given him that sweater when they were on their honeymoon and now a few months ago on their anniversary she had given him another one just like it that shed come across by chance in a shop victors eyes watered a little as he told me the story and i couldnt help feeling a touch of jealousy it was hard to have to recognize but thats what it was jealousy is this the pendant you mentioned before the photo we were looking at presented me with a woman with distinct features she wasnt pretty but she had character eyes whose smallness was well disguised by skillful makeup a nose difficult to hide and a rather formless mouth an enamel pendant with matching ring long fingers with exaggerated nails it was the only photo that was of any use to me at all did she always keep them so long i asked what her fingernails oh yes and picked up the habit of drumming her nails on the pendant making a little noise like when you clink glasses together and ill tell you the truth it made me nervous do you have the negative of this picture what do you want it for so i can make a copy for my partner dont worry man hes going to help me find her surely you dont intend to go around showing pictures of my wife all over the place and im going to need the addresses of the people your wife sees the most but are you planning to go see those people and ask them about monica he was really scared oh yes and the datebook perhaps you didnt find any thing unusual but im more experienced and i said in a very professional tone of voice im sure i told you miss guiu that we wanted the utmost discretion in this matter the man was capable of snapping up like an oyster how exasperating what did he expect me to do how could i find a missing person who hadnt left a trace if not by trying to pick up a few traces i said all that in shouts offended and the oyster opened up a little now how come youre sore miss guiu im not sore well could i see your wifes makeup to judge by the picture she must have been an expert at playing cutaneous dressup what do you mean nothing just she was real good at making herself up oh well yeah of course he showed me to the bathroom but i had more lipstick myself than monica had perhaps the only thing she took with her was her makeup among the few that were left there was a gorgeous lipstick of an incredible color with a case that looked like gold i fell in love with it may i take this lipstick with me i asked sure but what good can it do you a question of detail mr cabanes iv yes were good friends but i hadnt seen her for about a month as far as i know she was only seeing patricia whos patricia to be perfectly frank miss i think shes a little on the murky side where does she live somewhere in the eixample area i think but im not sure but i think i do have her telephone number that is if she hasnt moved you never know with her type as i was leaving mrs culell held the door open and said taking on a secretive tone you may find out miss whether monica and victor are really the ideal couple they seem to be what a hypocrite and here i thought that people with bucks werent so gossipy or at least that they had enough dignity to hide it i called from the first booth i could find no answer i had another appointment that morning with another of monicas friends it might be useful to compare the information the culell woman had given me and figure out howmuch of it was bad blood not that that would do me much good but i was curious about it however the very thought of going through yet another session of good manners and hypocrisy had me in hysterics i pulled myself together and rang the doorbell this lady had a maid victor must be beside himself mrs torres said with a glass of whiskey in her hand for me the maid brought in some orange juice the kind you make with real oranges when was the last time you saw mrs monica pradell it must have beenwait a minute she looked at her calendar yes two weeks ago we ate together at the pradells in the big house do you know someone by the name of patricia she knew her all right ive never been able to understand it at all such a close friendship wait now that i think about it i saw monica with that girl lets see about a week ago yeah i saw them from a distance i always tell monica i dont know how you can be such bosom buddies with that blockhead do they get along the couple i mean victor and monica oh yeah they make such a nice couple both so goodlooking and so crazy about each other what do you think could have happened to mrs pradell i mean do you know or suspect whether she had some motive for disappearing just like that ive no idea its all so strange poor victor i recall that they had an argument that night we had dinner well a friendly argument anyway nothing tragic i dont want you to get the wrong idea miss im just telling you so youll see how much they loved each other well what was the argument about that was the first id heard about the development i pretended i wasnt too interested i didnt want to jump the gun before i was pretty sure about it when i left mrs torress place i called quim right away im asking you as a professional favor man but ive never done anything like that lònia he whimpered tell them youre there on my behalf theyre not going to hassle you and do it now okay i need to know by noon today why dont you go yourself sweetie pie because i have other things to do sweetie pie yourself oh come on man you owe me more than erne favor you know that and i hung up i dialed again patricia still wasnt answering i dialed again my friend at the telephone company gave me the address when i got to the office i found a note from quim on my desk kid i can see you really know how to get along with people when i gave your name to those guys at the property registry and at the college of lawyers too they treated me like a king how do you do it honey youll have to clue me in i include under separate cover the results of my research im at your disposal for whatever might be necessary mrs paloni you know that im having dinner at that rabbit restaurant of yours and ill have them put it on your bill i deserve it dont you think oh yeah your beloved client calledwants you to call quims research as he called it confirmed that mr pradell was the owner of some land along the seashore and that there was a project in the name of victor cabanes to develop it already presented and approved but held up sine die so far okay then to patricias place but shed already flown the coop shed left the apartment four days ago without leaving a forwarding address what if she gets mail i asked the doorlady she said she was sure she wouldnt get any at the nearest telephone booth victor cabaness secretary asked me if it would be convenient to come by the office right away i said ten minutes after that right away they were showing me into victors office he was waiting for me looking as though he needed to ask me to do him a favor whats up i asked thats what id like to know he answered with a sticky sweetness why did you want to see me mr cabanes naturally he wanted to know how my investigations were going what his wifes friends had told me if studying monicas datebook had turned anything up etc etc what do you know about patricia i cut him off whos patricia a very good friend of your wife i remember she had a mend who was a little on the flaky side but what does that have to do with monica it turns out youre the only one who doesnt know anything about the friendship your wife had with this woman it also turns out that she left her apartment exactly four days ago the very day after monica pradells disappearance what do you think about that he was taken aback i took advantage by the way hows the development going development what development blue sea its a terrific project mr cabanes too bad its being held up isnt it and im afraid that if your wife doesnt turn up mr pradell wont ever get around to closing the deal on it ive no idea what youre getting at miss guiu do you love monica pradell mr cabanes listen what did those reptiles tell you what are you thinking miss guiu what do you suspect it took gods help and then some to get him to confess and once i had it i realized that the confession wasnt going to do me much good no he didnt love monica anymore he was looking for her because in fact her father wasnt about to let that land be developed if his heir didnt go along with it and you dont know where she is right i said with my very best sarcasm you dont suppose she could have run off precisely so she wouldnt be forced to say yes to something she didnt want do you i was beating him to death and behaving like a spoiled kid too victor was thrown completely out of gear no i dont think that he said nor do i know where she is miss guiu and i must say i dont care one bit for your attitude well its up to you ill drop the case no dont do that could this be revenge on your wifes part revenge for what you told me you didnt love her monica doesnt know that or if she knows she doesnt care she doesnt love me either why do you live together then but that was going beyond the limits of conjugal intimacy propriety appearances and all that he invited me to dinner at his place again this time not on working time he said what a pity to have met him under such circumstances the soiree was delightful and i went home with monicas dog it seems the pradells were heartbroken to see her so sad and thin and victor didnt want to take her to the kennels but he couldnt take care of her either she paid so much attention to me and maybe id like to keep her until monica came back sure glad to when i left he kissed me on the cheek tomorrow ill start investigating patricia i told him i think we might just find something there fine give me a call v hadnt she ever mentioned that she was thinking of moving out of the apartment she wasnt nice at all if i didnt say hello to her she never said a word to me why would she mention anything to me did she live alone yes but she had a lot of company especially men well i dont want to bear false witness sometimes women came over too what did she live on i dont know i suppose the people who came to see her dont you think she didnt have a job anywhere not that i know listen miss has she done something have you ever seen this woman i showed her monicas picture she looked it over from every angle up close far away she examined the details this face looks familiar to me it looks kind of familiar all right could i have a look at the apartment i asked i wouldnt be able to do that miss youd have to go to the agency that rents it out i you have the key dont you yes but i can only show it to people with a card from the agency besides there isnt anything of hers there anymore how about if instead of a card from the agency i give you one of mine i showed her a tendollar bill well okay just because i think youre okay but dont go telling them at the agency that i let you in the elevator stank of trash and it was slow did she live here for long i kept up the questioning about two years more or less did she get any mail a little not much maybe one or two letters the whole time she lived here she opened the apartment door both from here from banks they werent personal letters the fact is that people dont get personal letters anymore do they miss just letters from the bank and junk mail the doorlady went on philosophizing and opening drawers she took her job very seriously meantime i was trying to get an idea of what patricias life must have been like in that apartment so impersonal now there was a dresser scarf on the side table with a rumple in it a clump of starch maybe no it was a piece of paper could you open the blinds please i said to the woman she obligingly hurried to do so i stuck my hand under the cloth and stuffed the paper into my pocket nothing else of significance in the apartment once i was on the street i took a look at the paper it was an empty envelope with the address written by hand so patricia had received a letter but it didnt say from whom or on what street i had to ask quim for help again come on with your detective id card itll be easy you do thesei gave him a listand ill do the rest know what i think sweetie i think i like the easier cases better dont give me that stuff quim commercial reports are a piece of shit and the skirtchasing cases get boring have they brought in the copies of the photo your problem is that that jerk has you wrapped around his little finger he even stuck you with his dog yes they brought the copies the dog wheres the dog i locked her up in the bathroom i dont like having animals around in the office i cant leave her home alone all day long the poor thing is depressed and you you animal you lock her up in the bathroom i wouldnt be surprised if you got into collecting dogs crazy lady collecting lipsticks is more peaceful dont mess with me quim i warned him severely i went to let the dog out it was doing weird things today that animal quim was saying shed taken a big leak in the bathroom she came out with her tail between her legs she took a leap when she recognized me and when i picked her up she licked my face okay quim go ahead and start something what weird things was she doing the dog i mean she was sniffing my shoes and she started to howl and pull away from me shes nuts shes probably hungry poor thing i said then i went on okay thats it ill call you at tons bar at six oclock to see if youve found anything go on clear out off with you hey dont forget the picture i think im going to quit this job im not the right type to take orders from a woman he was still grumbling when he got in the elevator i fed the dog and then grabbed the other envelope of photos to take with me to visit my share of the travel agencies nothing a total failure quim too not at six not at eight maybe patricia bought the ticket mused quim for sure but i gave her name to the agencies too and nothings turned up at all youre so smart miss paloni quim said a lot more than you and dont call me paloni dirty rotten lie i gave her name to the agencies too but she must have bought the tickets under a false name vi it felt as if id just gone to bed when the telephone rang youre still in bed it was quims voice isnt that nice i play the early bird and youre still snoring whats up i have a lead im at the osborn agency on muntaner street between i know where it is im on my way i got dressed in a flash the dog had destroyed the sole of one of my shoes luckily they were already worn out the crepe soles stuck to the floor all i had time to do was yell at her and i left her curled up in a corner trembling quim was waiting for me at the door of the travel agency they recognized monica come in how was she dressed do you recall i asked the man on the other side of the counter a tailored outfit light color lilac blouse curly hair sort of the man recited mahoganycolored i asked mahogany dark red it was thats right youre very observant no not really i noticed her because she was very elegant and especially because she made this constant noise i looked at him surprised yes quim interrupted she was wearing that medal thats in the picture and she kept tapping it with her fingernails it sounded like glass clarified the employee with satisfaction she bought two tickets to paris the day after her disappearance and she left a paris address well make out a ticket for me to paris for today if possible i said have you lost your senses altogether quim yelled appalled dont fail to feed the dog you hear we cant let her starve to death now that shes getting her appetite back okay okay go to paris and dont come back dammit vii it was an apartment building an old house that with some resources and a certain number of new doors had been transformed from a home for welloff bourgeois into a semiluxurious semisnobbish tower of babel patricia opened the door she was an exuberant woman she had on a rather transparent tunic and her hair was wound up in a towel her glasses were covered with rhinestones wheres monica i asked right away the smile froze on her face and her extraordinarily fleshy lips traced with a line darker than the color of her lipstick filled up with little wrinkles her queenly pose tottered and she didnt try to pretend who are you she asked she let me in but she wouldnt tell me where monica was nor what they were doing the two of them but i had that figured out and the more patricia did to hide it the surer i was womens intuition as they say but also because of professional experience the apartment was quite dark but perhaps that would encourage secretsharing do you realize i can turn you in for kidnapping dear why cant they just leave her alone poor kid she said dont change the subject whether they leave her alone or not thats up to her family theyre paying me to find her and thats what im going to do no matter what so youd ruin her life now that shes starting to fix it up with you right she wouldnt go for it though she was just a childhood friend and shed helped her escape she said monica would have ended up in a nuthouse if it hadnt been for her victor hadnt told me that his wife was under the treatment of a psychiatrist right he hadnt told me because he didnt know so that was it the three weekly ps in her datebook at first id been convinced they meant the beauty parlor and so had victor then later i thought it stood for patricia and it turned out it meant psychiatrist now it was clear as a bell all that was left was for patricia to be willing to confess and then monica herself piece of cake i was just sorry about how victor was going to feel why was she under psychiatric care i asked you didnt know about it did you of course i knew naturally i lied victor knew top and i know why but i want you to tell me so dont go making up any absurd stories she was done in by her monotonous life depressed she didnt even buy that one herself of course she was good at keeping things under the rug that poor excuse for a sappho and you of course decided to rescue her out of generosity right what did you get out of this deal what did you gain by deceiving the poor gal shes got a pretty substantial bank account i didnt do it for the money now we were getting somewhere i spurred on no you did it out of the kindness of your heart then come on wheres monica if i dont find her it wont be just a kidnapping itll be murder it took pain and perspiration threats lies promises she wouldnt budge this gal but i finally managed to get her between a rock and a hard place and she began to fall apart altogether her dark voice with a foreign accent i wasnt able to identify broke down first she cried and cried and then sheltered by the darkness she explained it all to me viii patricia made me swear i wouldnt make out my report until youre on your way to australia i said will you stick to that monica asked if youll write a letter for me explaining the whole thing its a matter of professional pride we were in the bar of the carse hotel near westminster patricia had set up the appointment herself the previous day but monica still didnt quite trust me why did you come to london i asked just to say something to get ready to go to australia patricia must have told you that didnt she just out of curiosity personal not professional i said why didnt you take all the money out of your account because i assume your father will disinherit you so i wouldnt leave any leads behind but you can see that didnt do me any good it didnt work either for us to stay apart until everything was ready if my husband had hired a man instead of a woman even if hed found patricia shed have gotten rid of him but you put it all together and now look id established some kind of complicity with monica in spite of myself i didnt like patricia at all but monica was so pleasant so peaceful just the opposite of that gnawing tigress but she did have as victor had told me the habit of drumming her fingernails against that enamel pendant it really was unnerving well whats the deal then about the letter she said you can write it right now if you like i said no i want to really give it some thought tomorrow same time here okay absolutely she got up stretching her arm out to caress me i pulled back instinctively youre still an uptight repressed conservative my friend she said softly i watched her leave balancing on a set of spike heels that made me dizzy she must not have been too comfortable in them because when she went to go up the two steps leading to the vestibule she twisted an ankle and nearly ended up all over the floor she turned around and smiled mischievously the next day at the same time monica had had to go out but shed left the letter for me typewritten shit but i assumed that the signature would make it plenty valid that night i caught a plane for home with the money id get for that job id treat myself to a nice little week off ix victor was waiting for me at his pavilion he was furious hed been calling me every day at the office and quim told him the truth at first that is that i was in paris and then in london checking out some leads and then lies that is that i was still in london id given my word to the two women that id give them a little head start ten days to be exact ten desperate days for victor i was sick to death of sticking around the house and quim was in a rage for having to deal with the details he ushered me in without saying a word but he made up for that with the look on his face his curiosity about what had happened overcame his anger at not being kept informed after all we had agreed to keep him abreast of all the details i gave him monicas letter dear victor by the time you read this letter i wont be monica anymore get used to the idea think of it as a death because thats the truth i havent been your wife for a very long time and ive had to make colossal efforts to keep you from noticing its not just a question of love worn out its a matter of total incompatibility not just with you personally but with you as a man a male i know its going to hurt you but ive been pats lover for a long time my sexual relationship with you wasnt a disaster because i was frigid but because im a lesbian i hope you wont dismiss and scorn mebecause i dont consider my condition shamefulbut if you do and if i disgust you its all the same to me and i wont even be surprised knowing you as i do i hope you wont take all this as a big tragedy just try to understand and try to make a new life as ive done love monica ps tell daddy to let you go ahead with the development my opposition was a silly childish stubbornness totally illogical victor looked at me beside himself do you want to read my report i asked whats the point well it would clear up a few details i said positive that what i was saying was absurd its all as clear as a bell he mumbled a very long silence ensued he stared at the letter without seeing it finally he exploded when the fireplace had consumed all the photographs including the ones id made he seemed to calm down a little listen lonia i dont think im up to giving this letter to my inlaws would you mind you could give them the report too victor read it yourself first then decide whether you really want her parents to read it theres some stuff he wasnt listening to me i left the report on the couch went through the pradells yard with monicas letter in my purse and rang their doorbell x hi sweetie quim greeted me he was munching on a tiredlooking old sandwich and reading the paper as usual every day i let the dog out and looked over the mail all business letters of course bank statements junk mail a crazed guy showed up quim said distractedly seems his wife is fooling around shall i do it or do you want to i broke a toothpick and let him choose without even looking he picked the shorter one guess i get to do it i said let me finish reading the paper and ill tell you all about it i finished looking over the mail there was an impersonal note from victor accompanied by a check that knocked me over hey quim youll have to find the gal thats cheating on her old man after all i just struck it rich quim dropped his sandwich when he saw the figure were partners right sweetie he said sure but ill just help myself to a few bucks first so i can get a permanent this very day im off to the bank and then to the beauty parlor quims mouth fell open he didnt know what to say i dont know whether he grumbled or not since i was already gone at the beauty parlor with all kinds of critters running around in my head i realized that victor didnt want to have any more to do with me my sorrow was somewhat assuaged by the roll of banknotes i had in my purse though a victim of the ups and downs i leafed through one of those worn magazines the kind that tell you all about how such and such a singer has the flu or how mr bullfighter gets terrible headaches then i saw her mrs monica pradell de cabanes at a dinner in honor of who knows whom and victor two spaces away from her except that monica wasnt monica while they were taking my curlers out with the permanent half done my little brain was in sixth gear by the time i walked out the door my strategy was set it was the beginning of a crazy week beauty parlor patricia psychiatrist the three ps i called a dozen counselors before i found the one i was looking for naturally they didnt want to tell me anything not on the phone and not in person professional secrecy adela would help me out i absolutely must have a look at monica pradells file i said to her among colleagues professional secrecy shouldnt be a barrier i told her about the case with all the gory details she called me that afternoon monica wasnt a lesbian or anything like it and so on i took off for london just as i suspected the carse hotel had no record of monica pradells visit then i went to paris i surreptitiously altered patricias apartment and found more than i was counting on they were so confident that theyd forgotten about me altogether and werent even being careful home again now it was absolutely necessary for me to get into the pavilion and into the pradells main house too without the family realizing it or with some kind of believable excuse the dog of course i watched from the car waiting until they would all be gone the first day mrs pradell stayed home the next day she left an hour after her husband left who had gone out an hour after their soninlaw ive lost the dog and i thought maybe shed come back here i said to the maid i havent seen her wouldnt you let me have a look around i begged maybe shes hiding somewhere in the house im so upset we searched every corner of the house no sign of the dog but i did find out that the pradells had put an oil painting of monica up in their attic the maid even let me see a photo album where there were pictures of monica and patricia hugging next to that scandalous photo there was one of monica by herself wearing flat shoes with crepe soles what a perfect setup theyd created those two real pros capable of deceiving a pro like myself or am i such a pro after all maybe im just picking daisies then we went to the pavilion me and the maid the dog wasnt there either of course but it gave me a chance to lift a scarf without her noticing maybe shell come home on her own i said all discouraged listen id rather they didnt know that ive lost the dog you know what i mean yes of course the maid said i wont say a word and if she shows up ill let you know i started the car and two blocks away i let the dog out of the trunk where she was having a nice nap i raced toward blue sea they had already started the construction and it was a bees nest of machines and people shit id have to wait until sunday on sunday it was deserted sleeping machines but theyd already torn up the earth displaced cliffs holes piles and puddles all over the place it was a crime to see such a gorgeous landscape so mistreated a real rape i put the scarf to the dogs nose the animal barked then she looked at me astonished and it even seemed she remembered she went crazy sniffing she ran wild i could hardly follow her the coast went uphill forming cliffs and little sandless beaches you could only get to by sea at least for the moment the dog was on top of a rock quite a few feet below me she was howling and trying to find a way to get down i called her but she didnt hear me or she heard but didnt pay any attention in any case she found a way to keep going down and i lost sight of her i could still hear her whiny yelps i had to rescue her with a boat she was soaked exhausted hoarse we didnt find what the two of us were looking for but at least shed found a piece of crepeheeled shoe it all meshed xi i didnt ask for permission to go into victors office i opened the door softly and said with my very best smile hi i saw again the same surprised look i saw the first day he came to my office then the same charming smile i just came to tell you that monica really was going to a psychiatrist i thought you might be interested i know that its in your report i put it in my report because patricia told me that but it was a story you and she made up a lie that turns out to be true how about that only one thing is different the motive she didnt go to a psychiatrist because she was a lesbian she went because you forced her to make love with you whether she wanted to or not naturally she felt raped so she didnt want you to develop the place she loved most its as if she wanted to save the land from being raped since she wasnt able to save herself from it he was listening to me with a sarcastic smile but i could see a spark of fear in his eyes whats all this about where did you dream up a story like that what are you getting at he spoke with a harsh voice the voice of a secure man too harsh and too secure to be real i put monicas pendant on his desk i saw monica in london she was wearing the pendant but what do you know i just happened to find it in patricias apartment in paris by the way monica doesnt look much like this picture does she he repressed himself perfectly when i showed him the magazine besides you were in such a rush to burn those pictures you made me believe were of monica but in fact were of patricia now youre really getting embroiled honey the professions gone to your head were you aware that monicas dog whined and got scared whenever she came across crepesoled shoes my colleagues for example and she completely chewed up one of mine a real old one then the poor old hound helped me find the crepe sole that drove her crazy in the first place i set the piece of shoe on his desk monicas that is the real monica victor paled theyre the shoes monica was wearing when this picture was taken this picture i found in your inlaws album i found this one too monica and patricia together monica was prettier than pat but i have to admit that pat carried off the part of monica real well and even better when she played herself in that dark paris apartment oh yeah i found this in paris too a very curly mahoganycolored wig he sank into his chair with sagging shoulders he looked so vulnerable i felt sorry for him but i had to be strong now i couldnt allow myself to be deceived again it was an accident lònia i was so enraged and ii loved her i loved monica but sometimes she drove me wild she was so harsh youre a disgusting liar you loved patricia thats why patricia agreed to pass for monica or what thats where youre wrong he was recovering little by little patricia did it for the money she was real palsy with monica but only because of what she could get out of it no they werent lesbians of course but monica did have a weird weakness for pat and after the accident i schemed the whole thing and pat agreed to take on the role so in fact what you wanted was a report from a pro and a letter from monica obtained by that pro so that mr pradell would reject his daughter as a pervert right that way youd be the victim and get your inlaws sympathy plus the permit to begin the development youve done a terrific job lònia seems like i should hire you foll time so youll work just for me the nerve he took out his checkbook and raised his mocking eyes what will your monthly salary be he smiled i guess youll have to ask mr pradell that hes just outside waiting for me to open the door i consider myself well paid with what ive learned now i know for sure that if i want to stay in this profession ill have to get thicker skin and that i cant trust male clients no matter how goodlooking and nice they are when they tell me ill do a better job because im a woman mr pradell was waiting by the door looking pretty grim i waited outdoors with the dog in my arms when victor came out handcuffed between two guys in raincoats i still felt a touch of pity settled score by sara paretsky a v i warshawski story for bob kirschner who helped make it work sara paretskys private eye v i warshawski helped to define the new female sleuth in modern american crime fiction each of the warshawski books published to datebitter medicine killing orders deadlock indemnity only blood shot and burn markshas attracted a larger readership with the lastnamed novel making a number of national and regional bestseller lists ms paretsky and her creation both live and work in chicago i its such a difficult concept to deal with i just dont like to use that word paul servino turned to me his mobile mouth pursed consideringly i put it to you victoria youre a lawyer would you not agree i agree that the law defines responsibility differently than we do when were talking about social or moral relations i said carefully no states attorney is going to try to get mrs hampton arrested but does that you see servino interrupted thats just my point but its not mine lotty said fiercely her thick dark brows forming a forbidding line across her forehead and if you had seen claudia with her guts torn out by lye perhaps you would think a little differently the table was silenced for a moment we were surprised by the violent edge to lottys anger penelope herschel shook her head slightly at servino he caught her eye and nodded sorry lotty i didnt mean to upset you so much lotty forced herself to smile paul you think you develop a veneer after thirty years as a doctor you think you see people in all their pain and that your professionalism protects you from too much feeling but that girl was fifteen she had her life in front of her she didnt want to have a baby and her mother wanted her to not for religious reasons evenshes english with all their contempt for catholicism but because she hoped to continue to control her daughters life claudia felt overwhelmed by her mothers pressure and swallowed a jar of oven cleaner now dont tell me the mother is not responsible i do not give one damn if no court would try her to me she caused her daughters death as surely as if she had poured the poison into her servino ignored another slight headshake from lottys niece it is a tragedy but a tragedy for the mother too you dont think she meant her daughter to kill herself do you lotty lotty gave a tense smile what goes on in the unconscious is surely your department paul but perhaps that was mrs hamptons wish of course if she didnt intend for claudia to die the courts would find her responsibility diminished am i not right vic i moved uneasily in my chair i didnt want to referee this argument it had all the earmarks of the kind of domestic fight where both contestants attack the police besides while the rest of the dinner party was interested in the case and sympathetic to lottys feelings none of them cared about the question of legal versus moral responsibility the dinner was in honor of lotty herschels niece penelope making one of her periodic scouting forays into chicagos fashion scene her fatherlottys only brotherowned a chain of highpriced womens dress shops in montreal quebec and toronto he was thinking of making chicago his us beachhead and penelope was out looking at locations as well as previewing the chicago designers spring ideas lotty usually gave a dinner for penelope when she was in town servino was always invited an analyst friend of lottys he and penelope had met on one of her first buying trips to chicago since then theyd seen as much of each other as two busy professionals half a continent apart could manage although their affair now had five years of history to it penelope continued to stay with lotty when she was in town the rest of the small party included max loewenthal the executive director of beth israel where lotty treated perinatal patients and chaim lemke a clarinetist with the aeolus woodwind quintet a slight melancholy man he had met lotty and max in london where theyd all been refugees chaims wife greta who played harpsichord and piano for an early music group didnt come along lotty said not to invite her because she was seeing paul professionally but anyway since she was currently living with aeolus oboist rudolph strayarn she probably wouldnt have accepted we were eating at my apartment lotty had called earlier in the day rattled by the young girls death and needing help putting the evening together she was so clearly beside herself that id felt compelled to offer my own place with cheese and fruit after dinner lotty had begun discussing the case with the whole group chiefly expressing her outrage with a legal system that let mrs hampton off without so much as a warning for some reason servino continued to argue the point despite penelopes warning frowns perhaps the fact that we were on our third bottle of barolo explained the lapse from pauls usual sensitive courtesy mrs hampton did not point a gun at the girls head and force her to become pregnant he said the daughter was responsible too if you want to use that word and the boythe father whoever that was lotty normally abstemious had drunk her share of the wine her black eyes glittered and her viennese accent became pronounced i know the argument believe you me paul its the old who pulled the triggerthe person who fired the gun the person who manufactured it the person who created the situation the parents who created the shooter to me that is scholastic hairsplittingyou know all that crap they used to teach us a thousand years ago in europe who is the ultimate cause the immediate cause the sufficient cause and on and on its dry theory not life it takes people off the hook for their own actions you can quote heinz kohut and the rest of the selfpsychologists to me all night but you will never convince me that people are unable to make conscious choices for their actions or that parents are not responsible for how they treat their children its the same thing as saying the nazis were not responsible for how they treated europe penelope gave a strained smile she loved both lotty and servino and didnt want either of them to make fools of themselves max on the other hand watched lotty affectionatelyhe liked to sec her passionate chaim was staring into space his lips moving i assumed he was reading a score in his head i would say that servino snapped his own italian accent strong and dont look at me as though i were joseph goebbeb chaim and i are ten years younger than you and max but we share your story in great extent i do not condone or excuse the horrors our families suffered or our own dispossession but i can look at himmler or mussolini or even hitler and say they behaved in such and such a way because of weaknesses accentuated in them by history by their parents by their culture you could as easily say the french were responsible the french because their need forforrappresagliawhat am i trying to say victoria reprisal i supplied now you see lotty now i too am angry i forget my english but if they and the english had not stretched germany with reparations the situation might have been different so how can you claim responsibilityfor one person or one nation you just have to do the best you can with what is going on around you lottys face was set yes paul i know what you are saying yes the french created a situation and the english wished to accommodate hitler and the americans would not take in the jews all these things are true but the germans chose nonetheless they could have acted differently i will not take them off the hook just because other people should have acted differently i took her hand and squeezed it at the risk of being the neville chamberlain in the case could i suggest some appeasement chaim brought his clarinet and max his violin paul if youll play the piano penelope and i will sing chaim smiled relaxing the sadness in his thin face he loved making music whether with friends or professionals gladly vic but only a few songs its late and we go to california for a twoweek tour tomorrow the atmosphere lightened we went into the living room where chaim flipped through my music pulling out wolfs spanisches liederbuck in the end he and max stayed with lotty playing and talking until three in the morning long after servino and penelopes departure ii the detective business is not as much fun in january as at other times of the year i spent the next two days forcing my little chevy through unplowed side streets trying to find a missing witness who was the key to an eighteenmilliondollar fraud case i finally succeeded tuesday evening a little before five by the time id convinced the terrified woman who was hiding with a niece at sixtyseventh and honore that no one would shoot her if she testified gotten her to the states attorney and seen her safely home again it was close to ten oclock i fumbled with the outer locks on the apartment building with my mind fixed on a hot bath lots of whiskey and a toasted cheese sandwich when the groundfloor door opened and mr contreras popped out to meet me i ground my teeth hes a retired machinist with more energy than navratilova i didnt have the stamina to deal with him tonight i mumbled a greeting and headed for the stairs there you are doll the relief in his voice was marked i stopped wearily some crisis with the dog something involving lugging a sixtypound retriever to the vet through snowpacked streets i thought i ought to let her in you know i told her there was no saying when youd be home sometimes youre gone all night on a casea delicate reference to my love lifebut she was all set she had to wait and sheda been sitting on the stairs all this time she wont say what the problem is but youd probably better talk to her you wanna come in here or should i send her up in a few minutes not the dog then uh who is it arent i trying to tell you that beautiful girl you know the docs niece penelope i echoed foolishly she came out into the hall just then ducking under the old mans gesticulating arms vic thank god youre back ive got to talk to you before the police do anything stupid she was huddled in an anklelength silver fur ordinarily elegant with exquisite makeup and jewelry and the most modern of hairstyles she didnt much resemble her aunt but shock had stripped the sophistication from her making her dark eyes the focus of her face she looked so much like lotty that i went to her instinctively come on up with me and tell me whats wrong i put an arm around her mr contreras closed his door in disappointment as we disappeared up the stairs penelope waited until we were inside my place before saying anything else i slung my jacket and down vest on the hooks in the hallway and went into the living room to undo my heavy walking shoes penelope kept her fur wrapped around her her highheeled kid boots were not meant for streetwear they were rimmed with salt stains she shivered slightly despite the coat havehave you heard anything i shook my head rubbing my right foot stiff from driving all day its paul hes dead buthes not that old and i thought he was very healthy because of his sedentary job servino always ran the two miles from his loop office to his apartment in the evening penelope gave a little gulp of hysterical laughter oh he was very fit but not healthy enough to overcome a blow to the head could you tell the story from the beginning instead of letting it out in little dramatic bursts as id hoped my rudeness got her angry enough to overcome her incipient hysteria after flashing me a lottylike look of royal disdain she told me what she knew pauls office was in a building where a number of analysts had their practices a sign posted on his door this morning baldly announced that he had canceled all his days appointments because of a personal emergency when a janitor went in at three to change a light bulb hed found the doctor dead on the floor of his consulting room colleagues agreed theyd seen servino arrive around a quarter of eight as he usually did theyd seen the notice and assumed hed left when everyone else was tied up with appointments no one thought any more about it penelope had learned of her lovers death from the police who picked her up as she was leaving a realtors office where shed been discussing shop leases two of the doctors with offices near servinos had mentioned seeing a darkhaired woman in a long fur coat near his consulting room penelopes dark eyes were drenched with tears its not enough that paul is dead that i learn of it such an unspeakable way they think i killed himbecause i have dark hair and wear a fur coat they dont know what killed himsome dreary blunt instrumentit sounds stupid and banal like an old agatha christie theyve pawed through my luggage looking for it theyd questioned her for three hours while they searched and finally reluctantly let her go with a warning not to leave chicago shed called lotty at the clinic and then come over to find me i went into the dining room for some whiskey she shook her head at the bottle i poured myself an extra slug to make up for missing my bath and and i want you to find who killed him the police arent looking very hard because they think its me do they have a reason for this she blushed unexpectedly they think he was refusing to marry me not much motive in these times one would have thought and you with a successful career to boot was he refusing no it was the other way around actually i feltfelt unsettled about what i wanted to docome to chicago to stay you know i havefriends in montreal too you know and ive always thought marriage meant monogamy i see my focus on the affair between penelope and paul shifted slightly you didnt kill him did youperhaps for some other reason she forced a smile because he didnt agree with lotty about responsibility no and for no other reason are you going to ask lotty if she killed him lotty would have mangled him sunday night with whatever was lying on the dining room tableshe wouldnt wait to sneak into his office with a club i eyed her thoughtfully just out of vulgar curiosity what were you doing around eight this morning her black eyes scorched me i came to you because i thought you would be sympathetic not to get the same damned questions i had all afternoon from the police and what were you doing at eight this morning she swept across the room to the door then thought better of it and affected to study a nell blaine poster on the nearby wall with her back to me she said curtly i was having a second cup of coffee and no there are no witnesses as you know by that time of day lotty is long gone perhaps someone saw me leave the building at eight thirtyi asked the detectives to question the neighbors but they didnt seem much interested in doing so dont sell them short if youre not under arrest theyre still asking questions but you could ask questions to clear me theyre just trying to implicate me i pinched the bridge of my nose trying to ease the dull ache behind my eyes you do realize the likeliest person to have killed him is an angry patient dont you despite your fears the police have probably been questioning them all day nothing i said could convince her that she wasnt in imminent danger of a speedy trial before a kangaroo court with execution probable by the next morning she stayed until past midnight alternating pleas to hide her with commands to join the police in hunting down pauls killer she wouldnt call lotty to tell her she was with me because she was afraid lottys home phone had been tapped look penelope i finally said exasperated i cant hide you if the police really suspect you you were tailed here even if i could figure out a way to smuggle you out and conceal you someplace i wouldnt do itid lose my license on obstruction charges and id deserve to i tried explaining how hard it was to get a court order for a wiretap and finally gave up i was about ready to start screaming with frustration when lotty herself called devastated by servinos death and worried about penelope the police had been by with a search warrant and had taken away an array of household objects including her umbrella such an intrusion would normally have made her spitting mad but she was too upset to give it her full emotional attention i turned the phone over to penelope whatever lotty said to her stained her cheeks red but did make her agree to let me drive her home when i got back to my place exhausted enough to sleep round the clock i found john mcgonnigal waiting for me in a blueandwhite outside my building he came up the walk behind me and opened the door with a flourish i looked at him sourly thanks sergeant its been a long dayim glad to have a doorman at the end of it its kind of cold down here for talking vic how about inviting me up for coffee because i want to go to bed if youve got something you want to say or even ask spit it out down here i was just ventilating and i knew itif a police sergeant wanted to talk to me at one in the morning wed talk mr contrerass coming out in a magenta bathrobe to see what the trouble was merely speeded my decision to cooperate while i assembled cheese sandwiches mcgonnigal asked me what id learned from penelope she didnt throw her arms around me and howl vie i killed him youve got to help me i put the sandwiches in a skillet with a little olive oil whatve you guys got on her the receptionist and two of the other analysts whod been in the hall had seen a small darkhaired woman hovering in the alcove near servinos office around twenty of eight neither of them had paid too much attention to her when they saw penelope they agreed it might have been she but they couldnt be certain if theyd made a positive id shed already have been arrested even though they couldnt find the weapon they had a shouting match at the filigree last night the maître d was quite upset servino was a regular and he didnt want to offend him but a number of diners complained the herschel girlmcgonnigal eyed me warilywoman i mean stormed off on her own and spent the night with her aunt one of the neighbors saw her leave around seven the next morning not at eight thirty as she says i didnt like the sound of that i asked him about the cause of death someone gave him a good crack across the side of the neck close enough to the back to fracture a cervical vertebra and sever one of the main arteries it would have killed him pretty fast and as you know servino wasnt very tallthe herschel woman could easily have done it with what i demanded that was the stumbling block it could have been anything from a baseball bat to a steel pipe the forensic pathologist whod looked at the body favored the latter since the skin had been broken in places theyd taken away anything in lottys apartment and penelopes luggage that might have done the job and were having them examined for traces of blood and skin i snorted if you searched lottys place you must have come away with quite an earful mcgonnigal grimaced she spoke her mind yes any ideas on what the weapon might have been i shook my head too nauseated by the thought of pauls death to muster intellectual curiosity over the choice of weapon when mcgonnigal left around two thirty i lay in bed staring at the dark unable to sleep despite my fatigue i didnt know penelope all that well just because she was lottys niece didnt mean she was incapable of murder to be honest i hadnt been totally convinced by her histrionics tonight who but a lover could get close enough to you to snap your neck i thrashed around for hours finally dropping into an uneasy sleep around six lotty woke me at eight to implore me to look for servinos killer the police had been back at seven thirty to ask penelope why shed forgotten to mention shed been at pauls apartment early yesterday morning why was she there i asked reasonably she says she wanted to patch things up after their quarrel but hed already left for the office when the police started questioning her she was too frightened to tell the truth vic im terrified theyre going to arrest her i mumbled something it looked to me like they had a pretty good case but i valued my life too much to say that to lotty even so the conversation deteriorated rapidly i come out in any wind or weather to patch you up with never a word of complaint that wasnt exactly true but i let it pass now when i beg you for help you turn a deaf ear to me i shall remember this victoria giant black spots formed and reformed in front of my tired eyes great lotty her receiver banged in my ear iii i spent the day doggedly going about my own business turning on wbbm whenever i was in the car to see if any news had come in about penelopes arrest despite all the damaging eyewitness reports the states attorney apparently didnt want to move without a weapon i trudged up the stairs to my apartment a little after six my mind fixed on a bath and a rare steak followed immediately by bed when i got to the top landing i ground my teeth in futile rage a furcoated woman was sitting in front of the door when she got to her feet i realized it wasnt penelope but greta schipauer chaim lemkes wife the dark hallway had swallowed the gold of her hair vic thank god youve come back ive been here since four and i have a concert in two hours i fumbled with the three stiff locks i have an office downtown just so that people wont have to sit cm the floor outside my home i said pointedly you do ohit never occurred to me you didnt just work out of your living room she followed me in and headed over to the piano where she picked out a series of fifths you really should get this tuned vic is that why youve been here for two hours to tell me to tune my piano i slung my coat onto a hook in the entryway and sat on the couch to pull off my boots no no she sat down hastily its because of paul of course i spoke to lotty today and she says youre refusing to stir yourself to look for his murderer why vic we all need you very badly you cant let us down now the police were questioning me for two hours yesterday it utterly destroyed my concentration i couldnt practice at all i know the recital tonight will be a disaster even chaim has been affected and hes out on the west coast i was too tired to be tactful how do you know that i thought youve been living with rudolph strayarn she looked surprised what does that have to do with anything im still interested in chaims music and its been terrible rudolph called this morning to tell me and i bought an la paper downtown she thrust a copy of the la times in front of me it was folded back to the arts section where the headline read aeolus just blowing in the wind theyd used chaims publicity photo as an inset i scanned the story chaim lemke one of the nations most brilliant musicians must have left his own clarinet at home because he played as though hed never handled the instrument before aeolus manager claudia laurents says the group was shattered by the murder of a friend in chicago the rest of the quintet managed to pull a semblance of a concert together but the performance by americas top woodwind group was definitely offkey i handed the paper back to greta chaims reputation is too strongan adverse review like this will be forgotten in two days dont worry about itgo to your concert and concentrate on your own music her slightly protuberant blue eyes stared at me i didnt believe lotty when she told me i dont believe im hearing you now vic we need you if its money name your figure but put aside this coldness and help us out greta the only thing standing between the police and an arrest right now is the fact that they cant find the murder weapon im not going to join them in hunting for it the best we can hope for is that they never find it after a while theyll let penelope go back to montreal and your lives will return to normal no no youre thinking penelope committed this crime never vic never ive known her since she was a small childyou know i grew up in montrealits where i met chaim believe me i know her she never committed this murder she was still arguing stubbornly when she looked at her watch gave a gasp and said she had to run or shed never make the auditorium in time when id locked the door thankfully behind her i saw shed dropped her paper i looked at chaims delicate face again sad as though he knew he would have to portray mourning in it when the picture was taken iv when the police charged penelope late on thursday i finally succumbed to the alternating pleas and commands of her friends to undertake an independent investigation the police had never found a weapon but the states attorney was willing to believe it was in the chicago fiver i got the names of the two analysts and the receptionist whod seen servinos presumed assailant outside his office on tuesday they were too used to seeing nervous people shrinking behind partitions to pay much attention to this woman neither of them was prepared to make a positive id in court that would be a help to freeman carter handling penelopes defense but it couldnt undo the damage caused by penelopes original lies about her tuesday morning activities she was free on bond swinging between depression and a kind of manic rage she didnt tell a very convincing story still i was committed to proving her innocence i did my best with her and trusted that freeman was too savvy to let her take the witness stand herself i got a list of pauls patients both current and former from a contact at the police lotty max and greta were bankrolling both freeman and me to any amount we needed so i hired the streeter brothers to check up on patient alibis i talked to all of them myself trying to ferret out any sense of betrayal or rage urgent enough to drive one of them to murder with a sense of shameful voyeurism i even read pauls notes i was fascinated by his descriptions of greta her total selfabsorption had always rubbed me the wrong way paul while much more empathic seemed to be debating whether she would ever be willing to participate in her own analysis how did paul feel about your affair with rudolph i asked greta one afternoon when she had made one of her frequent stops for a progress report oh you know paul he had a great respect for the artistic temperament and what someone like me needs to survive in my work besides he convinced me that i didnt have to feel responsibleyou know that my own parents cold narcissism makes me crave affection and rudolph is a much more relaxing lover than poor chaim with his endless parade of guilt and selfdoubt i felt my skin crawl slightly i didnt know any psychoanalytic theory but i couldnt believe paul meant his remarks on personal responsibility to be understood in quite this way meanwhile chaims performance had deteriorated so badly that he decided to cancel the rest of the west coast tour the aeolus found a backup the second clarinet in the chicago symphony but their concert series got mediocre reviews in seattle and played to halffull houses in vancouver and denver greta rushed to the airport to meet chaim on his return i knew because shed notified the local stations and i found her staring at me on the ten oclock news escorting chaim from the baggage area with a maternal solicitude she shed the cameras before decamping for rudolphsshe called me from there at ten thirty to make sure id seen her wifely heroics i wasnt convinced by gretas claims that chaim would recover faster on his own than with someone to look after him the next day i went to check on him for myself even though it was past noon he was still in his dressing gown i apologized for waking him but he gave a sweet sad smile and assured me hed been up for some time when i followed him into the living room a light bright room facing lake michigan i was shocked to see how ill he looked his black eyes had become giant holes in his thin face he apparently hadnt slept in some time chaim have you seen a doctor no no he shook his head its just that since pauls death i cant make music i try to play and i sound worse than i did at age five i dont know which is harderlosing paul or having them arrest penelope such a sweet girl ive known her since she was born im sure she didnt kill him lotty says youre investigating yeah but not too successfully the evidence against her is very sketchyits hard for me to believe theyll get a conviction if the weapon turns up i let the sentence trail away if the weapon turned up it might provide the final caisson to shore up the states platform i was trying hard to work for penelope but i kept having disloyal thoughts you yourself are hunting for the weapon do you know what it is i shook my head the states attorney gave me photos of the wound i had enlargements made and i took them to a pathologist i know to see if he could come up with any ideas some kind of pipe or stick with spikes or something on itlike a cavemans clubim so out of ideas i even went to the field museum to see if they could suggest something or were missing some oldfashioned lethal weapon chaim had turned green i felt contritehe had such an active imagination i should have watched my tongue now hed have nightmares for weeks and would wait even longer to get his music back i changed the subject and persuaded him to let me cook some lunch from the meager supplies in the kitchen he didnt eat much but he was looking less feverish when i left v chaims cleaning woman found him close to death the morning penelopes trial started lotty max and i had spent the day in court with lottys brother hugo and his wife we didnt get any of gretas frantic messages until lotty checked in at the clinic before dinner chaim had gone to an aeolus rehearsal the night before his first appearance at the group in some weeks he had bought a new clarinet thinking perhaps the problem lay with the old one wind instruments arent like violinsthey deteriorate over time and an active clarinetist has to buy a new one every ten years or so despite the new instrument a buffet he had flown to toronto to buy the rehearsal had gone badly he left early going home to turn on the gas in the kitchen stove he left a note which simply said i have destroyed my music the cleaning woman knew enough about their life to call greta at rudolphs apartment since greta had been at the rehearsalwaiting for the oboistshe knew how badly chaim had played im not surprised she told lotty over the phone his music was all he had after i left him with both of us gone from his life he must have felt he had no reason to live thank god i learned so much from paul about why we arent responsible for our actions or i would feel terribly guilty now lotty called the attending physician at mitchell hospital and came away with the news that chaim would live but hed ruined his lungshe could hardly talk and would probably never be able to play again she reported her conversation with greta with a blazing rage while we waited for dinner in her brothers suite at the drake the wrong persons career is over she said furiously its the one thing i could never understand about chaimwhy he felt so much passion for that selfcentered whore marcella herschel gave a grimace of distasteshe didnt deal well with lotty at the best of times and could barely tolerate her when she was angry penelope pale and drawn from the days ordeal summoned a smile and patted lottys shoulder soothingly while max tried to persuade her to drink a little wine freeman carter stopped by after dinner to discuss strategy for the next days session the evening broke up soon after all of us too tired and depressed to want even a pretense of conversation the trial lasted four days freeman did a brilliant job with the states sketchy evidence the jury was out for only two hours before returning a not guilty verdict penelope left for montreal with hugo and marcella the next morning lotty much shaken by the winters events found a locum for her clinic and took off with max for two weeks in portugal i went to michigan for a long weekend with the dog but didnt have time or money for more vacation than that monday night when i got home i found hugo wolfs spanisches liederbuch still open on the piano from januarys dinner party with chaim and paul between pauls murder and preparing for penelopes trial i hadnt sung since then i tried picking out indem schatten meiner locken but greta was right the piano needed tuning badly i called mr fortieri the next morning to see if he could come by to look at it he was an old man who repaired instruments for groups like the aeolus quintet and their ilk he also tuned pianos for them he only helped me because hed known my mother and admired her singing he arranged to come the next afternoon i was surprisedusually you had to wait four to six weeks for time on his schedulebut quickly reshuffled my own tuesday appointments to accommodate him when he arrived i realized that he had come so soon because chaims suicide attempt had shaken him i didnt have much stomach for rehashing it but i could see the old man was troubled and needed someone to talk to what bothers me victoria is what i should do with his clarinet ive been able to repair it but they tell me hell never play againsurely it would be too cruel to return it to him even if i didnt submit a bill his clarinet i asked blankly when did he give it to you after that disastrous west coast tour he said he had dropped it in some mudi still dont understand how that happened why he was carrying it outside without the case but he said it was clogged with mud and hed tried cleaning it only hed bent the keys and it didnt play properly it was a wonderful instrument only a few years old and costing perhaps six thousand dollars so i agreed to work on it hed had to use his old one in california and i always thought that was why the tour went so badly that and pauls death weighing on him of course so you repaired it and got it thoroughly clean i said foolishly oh yes of course the sound will never be as good as it was originally but it would still be a fine instrument for informal use onlyi hate having to give him a clarinet he can no longer play leave it with me i said gently ill take care of it mr fortieri seemed relieved to pass the responsibility on to me he went to work on the piano and tuned it back to perfection without any of his usual criticisms on my failure to keep to my mothers high musical standard as soon as hed gone i drove down to the university of chicago hospital chaim was being kept in the psychiatric wing for observation but he was allowed visitors i found him sitting in the lounge staring into space while peoples court blared meaninglessly on the screen overhead he gave his sad sweet smile when he saw me and croaked out my name in the hoarse parody of a voice can we go to your room chaim i want to talk to you privately he flicked a glance at the vacant faces around us but got up obediently and led me down the hall to a spartan room with bars on the window mr fortieri was by this afternoon to tune my piano he told me about your clarinet chaim said nothing but he seemed to relax a little how did you do it chaim i mean you left for california monday morning what did you docome back on the redeye redeye he croaked hoarsely even in the small space i had to lean forward to hear him the night flight oh the redeye yes yes i got to ohare at six came to pauls office on the el and was back at the airport in time for the ten oclock flight no one even knew id left lawe had a rehearsal at two and i was there easily his voice was so strained it made my throat ache to listen to him i thought i hated paul you know all those remarks of his about responsibility i thought hed encouraged greta to leave me he stopped to catch his breath after a few gasping minutes he went on i blamed him for her idea that she didnt have to feel any obligation to our marriage then after i got back i saw lotty had been right greta was just totally involved in herself she should have been named narcissus she used pauls words without understanding them but penelope i said would you really have let penelope go to jail for you he gave a twisted smile i didnt mean them to arrest penelope i just thoughtive always had trouble with cold weather with chicago winters ive worn a long fur for years because im so small people often think im a woman when im wrapped up in it i just thought if anyone saw me they would think it was a woman i never meant them to arrest penelope he sat panting for a few minutes what are you going to do now vic send for the police i shook my head sadly youll never play againyoud have been happier doing life in joliet than you will now that you cant play i want you to write it all down though the name you used on your night flight and everything i have the clarinet even though mr fortieri cleaned it a good lab might still find blood traces the clarinet and your statement will go to the papers after you die penelope deserves that muchto have the cloud of suspicion taken away from her and ill have to tell her and lotty his eyes were shiny you dont know how awful its been vic i was so mad with rage that it was like nothing to break pauls neck but then after that i couldnt play anymore so you are wrong even if i had gone to joliet i would still never have played i couldnt bear the naked anguish in his face i left without saying anything but it was weeks before i slept without seeing his black eyes weeping onto me that summer at quichiquois by dorothy b hughes a recipient of the grand master award of the mystery writers of america dorothy b hughes is also the biographer of erie stanley gardner although she wrote several novels featuring an inspector tobin most of her work is in the suspense rather than the mystery field three of her major works were successfully filmedthe fallen sparrow ride the pink horse and the magnificent in a lonely place hughes lives in ashland oregon time and place do not matter they are happenings simply happenings there are other happenings some you dont or wont remember some you will deliberately it is not that you remember the important and dont remember the unimportant often its the other way around like dancing with voss sometimes i think of voss and i cry tears wet tears i dont cry easily i dont make myself cry its just a happening i didnt actually know him he was just someone i danced with when i was fourteen years old by the accident of him being there and me being there when the music changed does anyone remember the paul jones sort of like a grand march only gentlemen going one way and ladies another touching hands but not clasping touching in passing until the music changes without warning like in going to jerusalem musical chairs and that happening was when the music changed i was right beside voss so i danced with voss close tight chest to chest feeling him surrounding me engulfing me almost as if i were an integral part of his body for those few moments i was nothing to him not a happening to him it was simply the way he danced to him that was the happening to dance as if dancing were created by him for him except elektra when he danced with elektra they were one person not two dancing one transformed two become one tightly together never again one and one two melded like by flame the flame of movement and music my cousin katty was sixteen going on seventeen she and her very best mendsfour or five of themwould have none of voss he wasnt privileged their cant word of the summer he worked in a butcher shopl henschels butcher shop his uncle gus underprivileged as if voss had blood spattered all over his clothes like uncle gus had on his white apron when he waited on my aunt georgie in those days in a small town meat didnt come prepackaged and iced by armour or swift it came from a nearby farm the farmer butchered and brought the haunch to the butcher shop it was hung in an icebox room out back the butcher cut from the haunch what the customer wanted sometimes blood would spatter on his white apron voss worked mostly at the front counter by the cash register by the big front window but the girls shrieked underprivileged when i asked about him the girls accepted only the privileged like kattys choice for the summer roddy rockefeller no not the rich rockefellers with the wizened old golfer who gave a dimeaday tip to his caddy rockefeller is a common name in upstate new york whats claude i asked them deliberately to provoke them claude had to be privileged he was a clark founders of clarksvale back in revolutionary days his father was owner and president of the bank the one where aunt georgie used to work and now owned a big piece of of course they shouted with laughter at my question wheyface i did not ever understand wheyface he had a round doughy face something about curds and whey they added their other names for him toady cipher and one daring friend of kattys who considered herself sophisticated faggotty voss let claude hang around that was about all voss was a loner he didnt have friends didnt want them we went back to the village every other summer wemy mother the childrenmy eightyearold brother and sixyearold sister and me my father wanted us to know his people he didnt come with us he had his business as excuse he had had enough of villages before he walked away from them to make his mark in the city and did all the way to california every other summer we took the trainthere were trains in those daysfrom california to new york upstate new york change at chicago to the ny central disembark at albany but not for the local train met there by aunt georgie and her chauffeur fred he was one of the garage men in a chauffeur cap we stayed with aunt priscilla george was the younger sister by two years she was the businesswoman she owned half the town by now aunt priscilla was the stayathome who took care of her kinfolks children katherinekattyhad always lived with aunt pris her mother died in childbirth and her father was in the air corps a captain or something he wasnt on land very often this summer aunt pris also had the tompkin boys their father a nephew was an archaeology professor at one of the universities and so was his wife they were off to some big dig deep in south america no place to take little boys the boys were around my brothers age i shared kattys room in summer and we didnt see much of the children not if we could help it the village itself was a happening for a girl born and raised in a big city it was like a storybook holiday walking around town no traffic no streetcars no buses a post office with its walls of neat little golden boxes an icecream parlor with tables and chairs and every saturday night there was dancing on the pavilion in the town park which was how a fourteenyearold came to dance with an older young man that summer at quichiquois that summer of elektra an open pavilion up a flight of steps to raise it above the park benches and the paths below the pavilion was also the bandstand the band played there in summer every night except saturday on saturday night there was an orchestra a real orchestra live music it is called today miss estelle had for some twentyfive years taught classical piano to all the children of the village whose parents were music minded but on saturday night in summer she played mean jazz deacon raven of some local church played violin for the service for dancing at the pavilion he played a jazz fiddle the drummer was the owner of the local hayandfeed store he was in the national guard band on special occasions the city fathers would enlist a clarinet player a young farmer up the road a piece who played in his college band musicians who arent professionals have a certain spirit they play for the love of it certainly not for the pittance they are paid everyone danced little children capered with one another or now and again politely waltzed with their mums or dads even the grampaws and gramaws sashayed around the floor and i danced with voss a happening only that once although after that night the older girls taught me how to lag without appearing to lag no one would know you were looking for one specific partner when you saw him you would lag a step here or there until he was almost beside you katty and i would practice it at night in her bedroom but i never had a chance to try it out for real because aunt george decided she made all the decisions in the family aunt priscilla acquiesced or did not if she did not it was the end of that happening aunt pris was a woman of few words quietly spoken aunt georgie was the talker emphatic accurate almost always a businesswoman accustomed to dealing with men with yea and nay no palavering she decided that the children should have three weeks at lake quichiquois there are myriad small lakes all through the berkshires this was nearest to clarksvale about twenty miles no resort just summer cottages friends of aunt george offered theirs as they were going north to visit family for several weeks the cottages were in the woods above the lake each was surrounded by woods land was not costly everyone had privacy just comfortably set far enough apart aunt priscilla acquiesced my mother being company had no yea or nay my mother preferred the busiest city street to the beauties of the woods not to the beauty but to the creatures that came with it flies and spiders and bees and creepy crawlers but my mother was company polite company was expected to acquiesce of course aunt georgie wasnt going shut up for three weeks surrounded by children like my father she had business excuses after her decision aunt georgie said i have a hired girl to go along no sense of you and elizabeth my mother turning your holiday into a wash and iron and cook for six children aunt priscilla was wary who is the hired girl i hired elektra aunt georgie slid the name off her tongue as if she just recalled it a look from one to another of the aunts and returned the other to the one aunt pris decided halfreluctantly well shes as good as we could hope for this late in the summer imperceptible aunt george had been apprehensive priscilla could have said no she hadnt now aunt georgie could resume her position as head of the family in name she paid the bills shes strong aunt george said remember how she took up all your rugs last springbeat them like a man would the air was grimy and laid them all again aunt priscilla mentioned and she would carry the whole laundry in one load up the stairs there were twentythree steps up from the living room to the second floor i had counted them i always count steps another eighteen up to the attic bedrooms where the boys slept and livein help when aunt priscilla tolerated it i dont know how many steps to the basement i didnt go to the basement the furnace was there and the storage years of the saturday evening post and the geographic and old trunks filled with old clothes elektra was strong elektra didnt natter she was scrub clean the aunts ticked off her good points nothing said of the bad of the cause for apprehension one to the other somehow i didnt want to ask katty katty had a way of embroidering words to make a bland story an exciting one if not exactly a true one id seen elektra of course someone must have said theres elektra wriking on main street or going into the post office or sitting at a soda table at the soda fountain theres elektra i could describe her as if id seen a snapshot of her tall man tall lean man lean straight black hair held back by a barrette hanging to her waist not when she was working then piled in braids or in loops high ruddy cheekbones straight nose like on an iroquois id seen her she delivered the ironing that aunt priscilla sent to gammer goodwife gammer lived in that big square yellow rooming house on the terrace you passed walking to town the townsfolk called it the poor house elektra lived there too she was kin to gammer id seen elektra dancing with voss i couldnt but wonder if katty had put the idea of lake quichiquois into aunt georgies head linda her best friend was going up there for the rest of the summer her family owned a summer cottage there there was a boys camp across the lake for little boys but the counselors were privileged and so we went to lake quichiquois aunt georges chauffeur fred in the chauffeurs cap drove us up there in the sevenseater the ladies in the backseat my younger sister squeezed in by my mother katty and i on the jump seats the three little boys in front with fred elektra would be up the next day fred was borrowing a pickup truck from the garage to carry our trunks the aunts always took trunks even for a short stay elektra would ride with fred in the cab of the pickup time goes quickly by the water too quickly we are water people quichiquois was a dream happening elektra would have the breakfast cooked and served before eight oclock every morning shed red up the kitchen while we waited out the dictum do not go in the water until one hour after eating we wouldnt but we would go down to our dock before the hour was up and the children would splash through the shore water elektra would get our rowboat turned over ready to row out for anyone in trouble elektra was a strong swimmer she cleaved the water as beautifully as a dolphin dover camp a long established one was just across the lake the little boys and our boys could and did exchange taunts across the water and of the three counselors two were already in college lordly sophomores the coming year the other was a senior in prep school katty and linda were in rhapsodies new boysor as they called them menand these girls were practiced at making boyfriends the boys were at brown and the girls college was just across the massachusetts line the talk became all about football games and weekend soirees and house parties in the spring across the lake was also mr gruens general store and soda fountain the meeting place for all lakers he had a year ago built on a room for the soda fountain he had oldfashioned tables and chairs in there during the week but they were moved out on saturday and there was dancing to a juke box no paul jones the dover camp boys only had to walk downhill a short way to the soda fountain on our side it was a quartermile walk after we reached the lane from the cottage down to the bend that led to the store it was much shorter to get into the rowboat and row right across to the store dock if you knew how to row we didnt elektra did she tried to teach us it isnt easy to learn to row the boat goes around and around in circles unless you have a very strong arm muscles like elektra the children katty and i were allowed to go with elektra in the boat on saturdays my mother and aunt pris would walk over later to fetch the little children home early katty and i were allowed to stay until the elevenfifteen closing with elektra until our first saturday evening i had not known voss was also working at the camp three afternoons a week instructing the young campers on the fine points of sailing and i couldnt help but wonder which one of them had decided to find a job up at the lake when the other had been already hired the cottagers danced katty and linda and the counselors danced the little boys and girls tried to dance voss and elektra danced together i watched from the sidelines so did wheyface i never did find out why he was called wheyface the girls would simply explode into curds and whey when i asked he was sort of doughlike not fat but a bit puffy he would always be a little off side no matter how fine an education he would have no matter that when he grew up he would take over the presidents chair at the bank and his father would retire to chairman of the board both claude and i just sat on the bench in the corner and watched the dancers sometimes id get him up on his feet and would try to show him how to move to the music but he never understood rhythm or timing or movement two left feet he always came out to the lake on dance nights to drive voss back to town on weeknights voss hopped a ride to clarksvale with workers at the camp oncejust once at quichiquoisi danced again with voss he walked over to where claude and i were sitting to ask claude something or other i think he recognized how my feet were in rhythm even while sitting down there on the bench he would understand because he was a dancer not a professional but bred in the bone roiling in the blood without warning he took my hand and pulled me up from the bench said come on and we danced out onto the floor entirely different from the paul jones a jazz jazzy exhilarating when elektra came back from powdering her nose or whatever voss sat me down he winked at me as they went off but ours had been the best jazzy of the evening it even led to my having some dances with kattys older boys yes i too have dance in my blood and bones it was that same night that i asked claude how voss could know so much about sailing to be able to teach the boys claude looked at me aghast how could i know voss and not know that i tried to explain that i didnt know voss it was our hired girl who knew voss id just happened to dance with him once in the paul jones at the pavilion so claude told me hes going to join the coast guard hes been studying all this year to pass their tests or whatever you have to do to get in he used to sail when he was a boy and lived up the coast his father was a sailor on a cargo boat his father sailed all the way to china it could be so or a sailors yarn to a small heroworshiping boy it didnt matter voss would be a sailor if that was what he wanted i remember so well everything about that last dance night it was getting on to eleven thirty and i didnt see elektra anywhere i excused myself to claude and walked across to where katty was whooping it up with her current favorite boyfriend katty didnt shoo me away maybe i looked that worried wheres elektra i asked her she surveyed the dancers on the floor shes probably down at the boathouse she said whats she doing down there i asked innocence too young for a beat katty and her friends just looked at me and linda started laughing katty joined in the boys were politely inexpressive they were sophisticates after shed stopped laughing linda said as if everyone knew that its where couples go katty added when they want to be alone smooching linda said i caught on i wasnt that innocent necking they called it at my school shell be here after the music stops katty said she wouldnt dare not she explained to her friends she knows aunt priscilla is waiting up truly true aunt priscilla wasnt as sharptongued as aunt george but you could bully aunt george by a temper tantrum katty explained it to me early in the summer aunt priscilla was immovable when mr gruen dimmed the colored lights and set the juke box for the last dance always three oclock in the morning i saw them elektra and voss dancing two become one i watched through the whole record daydreaming why call it day when its at night someday id grow up and have a boyfriend who danced like voss voss and claude said good night and walked off elektra rowed us home aunt pris glanced at her watch it will be midnight before you get to sleep this was a nudge to go to bed not stay up talking and we have to start packing up tomorrow aunt george and fred will be here monday morning katty and i didnt talk much too tired too much each of us to remember from the beginning of summer through this our final night of the boys farewell across the water good night ladies we had to miss sunday morning church when at the lake the nearest was in clarksvale too far to walk aunt priscilla read her bible the children were kept quiet and katty and i usually slept until noon in the afternoon we were allowed to swim and splash by our dock this sunday was different i wokeit wasnt eight oclockto the children gabbling in loud voices loud voices like on a weekday my mother and aunt pris were ahead of me to the kitchen mother with her hair still in kid curlers aunt pris with her gray hair in a plait down her back both in their nightgowns and robes aunt pris was asking whatever is the matter and my mother saying to her two quiet quiet now whats wrong the children all talked at once emerged one question wheres elektra aunt pris was dubious she isnt here no she isnt here all talking again at once almost shouting shes not here theres no breakfast perhaps she overslept aunt pris said she hesitated then made her way to the back of the house past my room sleepyeyed katty just emerging saying whats wrong on to elektras bedroom beyond aunt priscilla proper knocking on the door calling gently careful not to startle a sleeper elektra elektra its miss priscilla no response she tried it again a bit louder again no response aunt priscilla took hold of the doorknob reluctantly it was against all the principles of good manners to open anothers bedroom door even a servants but with no sound within she did open the door one small slant enough to peep inside then wider and she said she isnt here she must be around someplace katty and i had followed into the room katty said she cant have left she hasnt taken her things the hairbrush was on the bureau the box of powder and the puff also there her nightdress still folded neatly over the back of a chair the bed already made up or was it used last night shell be back aunt priscilla decided ill dress and then ill cook breakfast mother said ill give the children some cornflakes and milk to tide them over she had already put the kettle on for aunt priscillas morning tea aunt george came up in the afternoon she said the same as aunt priscilla shell be back her reasoning was different i owe her five dollars for last week she wont leave without her pay but she didnt come back not that day not the next day my small suitcase was packed all else was confusion katty trying to curl her hair before closing her suitcase aunt priscilla had packed all of elektras belongings into her own trunk there wasnt much the skirt and shirt she wore to work in the few cosmetics even her toothbrush and toothpaste had been left behind and her undergarments one to wear one to wash one to dry her bedroom slippers and an old nightrobe that aunt pris had given her of course shed taken her purse with her the one she carried last night wasnt in the room thered be a comb and lipstick and powder compact in it aunt priscilla was trying to get everything shipshape as it had been when we arrived mother was trying to get her children ready to leave aunt george arrival and added to the confusion while insisting of course elektras gone back to clarksvale for reasons of her own she finally took the tompkin boys out to fred let him keep them busy out by the truck i managed to slip out the side door at a propitious moment when all the others were in the house or in front by the cars i skulked rapidly through the trees until i was on the path that led to high peak it wasnt a real path just bumpy earth pebbles and rocks bits of green that wasnt weeds or wild grass just green stuff i zigzagged up the path to the promontory at the top high above the shore elektras special place one afternoon when katty and linda were being exceptionally boycrazies elektra had let me go with her to the peak this was her time off from children and choreswhy would she take me with her maybe because voss danced with me once in the paul jones she didnt talk about him she didnt talk when we were there she just stood on the promontory and looked at the sky or down at the water under the promontory but still high on the slope there was a shelf not far below the peak no way to get to it except by zigzagging down the slope and stooping your way under the protruding upper slope she didnt take me there she didnt go there either just pointed it out to me as we leaned over the tip scary i didnt want to go there now she wasnt there but she had been here last night with voss a farewell in each others arms two into one stop dreaming katty would say or my mother or anyone if i spoke of it but i knew before i saw the bead the red glass bead on the green stuff scattered on the earth she wore those beads to the dance last night she always wore them with her summer dress her white dress with the little roses sprinkled across the pattern the beads almost looked like crystals not really they were pretend cut like crystals but made of glass they were a little handful of beauty to her she must have searched for them when the strand was broken caught on a tree branch or the button on a mans jacket too dark to find all of them i looked there was one out on the tip but i didnt go there i scruffed through the green and found another and another with leaf mold patterning it no more i hadnt time to search for more i ran until the cottage was in sight then i just hurried the beads tight in my left fist fred was loading the last of the suitcases my mother came to me with emmy where have you been and as she looked into my face softly saying goodbye she understood the need to say goodbye to the woods and the water to some of summer memories in some secret place you had marked as your own another week and the end of august of summer my mother and the children off for california and school days again long goodbyes until christmas behind the scenes it had been decided that i would enter mount academy this year the school where the women of my fathers family had all attended to be finished katty had graduated there this spring my mother approved though as a californian she had been finished there i would stay on with aunt priscilla until school started aunt george had assured me that with a diploma from mount academy i could attend any college of my choice such was its academic standing even cambridge yes even cambridge i doubted cambridge wasnt exclusively female and aunt georgie with all her modern ideas and bold businesss maneuvers did not hold with coeducation it was all right for primary students although better for the girls to go to miss mastersons and the boys to albany cadet no hankypanky it was one of those last nights before katty would depart for college aunt pris katty and i had had early supper and cleanup and were relaxing in the living room until aunt georgie came by she was again all het up about elektra shed been at some meeting and none of the women knew anything about the disappearance of elektra no one had seen her since she went to the lake with us they seemed to think aunt priscilla and aunt george were to blame aunt priscilla said stop worrying your head about the five dollars i was going to have to let her go anyway she was beginning to show they exchanged a few of their wise looks and dropped the subject later when katty and i went up to our room i asked her what did aunt pris mean beginning to show katty just looked at me stared finally she said you know i dont know if i knew why would i ask you beginning to show do you know of course i do everybody knows that shes going to have a baby thats what it means shes married i could not believe it but if she and voss were married no shes not married katty stated but if shes not married how can shei didnt ask that question out loud some people did we just didnt know people who did i sighed to katty how do you know all these things emmy she told me you find out a lot living with the aunts you keep quiet and listen and they forget youre there and you learn a lot i figured for myself in a small town you learned things that city girls didnt know about small towns were evolved from farm country where life and death were the beginning and end and in between were all manner of happenings another week of flurry and then we drove with katty to albany to put her on the train for new york three of her friends were also going to the college on the hudson linda of course and willa and maleen the college proctors would meet the train with the school bus when we returned to the house late that afternoon we collapsed into chairs even aunt georgie i would be the next to go but only as far as hudson where id be met by the school bus id stopped listening to the aunts long before they were talked out it became tiresome listening to all the memories of aunt a and uncle b and cousins c d e etc when i didnt know any of them they were reminiscing to each other remembering their own college days finally aunt georgie gathered her gloves and string bag and highstepped to the front door shed sent fred and the car home shed be walking of course she carried her umbrella as always to ward off sun or rain she said to me you be ready in the morning emmy ill come by for you about ten oclock aunt priscilla showed mild surprise youre taking emmy along i certainly am evidently id missed something in their long conversation shes the last to see elektra i saw her aunt pris corrected you werent with her all evening or in the boat i could have told them i knew no more than aunt pris elektra never talked she spoke necessary words but she never talked not even phrases like is my lipstick on straight docs my petticoat show things all females say to each other instead i asked where are we going were going looking for elektra find out where she is find out why she hasnt been around for her five dollars you think of some questions yourself emmy well both ask questions i reacted in my veins in my bones i was to be a miss paul pry i could ask a dozen questions i could ask voss where did she spend the night how did she get back to clarksvale how did she break her strand of red glass beads but i wouldnt it was none of my business just the same i carried the three red glass beads along in my party handkerchief deep in my little purse where i had tucked them away while we were still at the cottage while no one was looking at me before i got into the car and shared a jump seat with katty i was ready for aunt george when she arrived next morning she had walked over no sense in taking the car more trouble than its worth she was thinking out loud we have to prowl we prowled along town street which carried you into main street but we stopped before then we stopped at the big yellow boarding house where elektra had lived a flight of wooden steps led up to the porch aunt george didnt ring or knock on the door she opened it she knew her way around here i followed her she walked past the staircase that mounted to a second floor and strode down the uncarpeted corridor all the way to a door near the back of the house she knocked a ratatat on that door and again stronger from within now came a voice shouting whos that come knocking at my door aunt george shouted back just aunt george gammer thats who everyone in town called her aunt george or georgie came another shout george fanshawe what other george do you know gammer sometime along the years id heard just like an aside from someone in the family that aunt george had been married once on a time not for long thats why she wasnt a davenport like aunt priscilla and my father and his family well dont stand out there yammering georgie come on inside my aunt opened the unlocked door and went in me following behind her gammer she said this is my niece emmy i managed to stammer a how dyou do to the diminutive old woman in the big rocker with varnish peeling from it this was gammer goodwife supposed to be kin of elektra halftoothless a browned corncob pipe clutched by the few remaining teeth a squawky voice like something was caught in her throat the ironing woman hard to believe that those rheumatic cramped fingers could iron ruffles until they rippled could iron linen napkins down to the very edge of the hand hem could iron lace as delicately as if shed spun it she took one look at me out of her spiteful black eyes and dismissed me as without interest she had three different ironing boards set up in her large untidy room one oversize for sheets tablecloths and such a middlesize one for the usual clothes wash and a baby one a sleeve board it was called probably for the ruffles and laces a screen closed off a corner of the room behind it aunt georgie told me later was the bed and washbasin an oldfashioned rooming house with the bathroom down the hall i dont have your laundry done gammer spat i didnt come for my laundry aunt george informed her i didnt bring any this week then what you doing here im looking for elektra well you can see she ant here gammer set the rocker rocking hard again shes up at the lake with your sister she isnt up at the lake weve all left the lake did you bring her back here we couldnt stated aunt george she left before we packed out why did she leave thats what i want to know i want to ask her well she ant here wheres her room she ant in her room how do you know she isnt up in her room gammer cackled a cackle laugh id read of them but i didnt know there was really such a sound she dug her fist into a voluminous pocket in her skirt because i got her key she unreeled a long chain attached inside the pocket on the end of it was a large ring of keys she leaves it with me when shes out of town so nobody gets into her things she beetled suspiciously at aunt george you havent seen her since she came back you havent had any message from her gammer kept humming nnnnoooo and rocking harder like little boys do to make it go faster then where is she aunt george said not exactly to gammer at her own frustration but gammer responded shes a canuck i told you that before a canuck witch she restarted the rocker she flew awayup highway up high on your broomstick aunt george bristled shed had enough of gammers antics she stood up and brushed the dust off her skirt although the chair shed sat on had been brushed by her handkerchief before she sat down on it if you do see her or hear from her aunt george instructed tell her im looking for her to pay her the money i owe her the rocking stopped like that you can pay me ill give it to her ill pay her no one else you think id spend it on myself i pay what i owe to the one i owe with that she stalked out while gammer was still embroidering her role as a caretaker of electras money as well as her room i sidled out beside aunt george i didnt want to be left alone in that room with gammer all the way to main street aunt george kept talking to herself not to me about the perfidious gammer and her grandniece i managed to keep up with her fast walk by saving my breath only three blocks to main street waiting to cross the street i could ask now where do we go well go to gus henschels i understand his nephew voss and that girl were what we used to call an item did everybody know somehow id thought it was a private affair known only to katty and her friends who saw than dancing together its the talk of this town the way she went after him she was opening the door of the butcher shop before i could think of some excuse to keep from going in there i didnt want voss to see me and think id talked about him and elektra voss wasnt up front today his uncle was he was arranging steaks for his display case morning miss georgie he said but it was a glum morning from his expression what can i do for you today you can let me talk to that nephew of yours voss i understand that is the name he peered over the counter at me i was too young to be a friend of voss so he dismissed me from his answer to aunt george he growled id like to talk to him myself that javel never come back from the lake that camp has been calling and calling him he hasnt been around there either aunt george was only temporarily speechless you havent seen elektra that the pawky girl been hanging around him all summer she hasnt been around lately not since she went up to the lake with your sister leastways that was what she told him both of them gone together but she wouldnt go without taking her belongings yes she might if he was in a hurry hed have some money with two jobs hed buy her a new hairbrush and nightgown good riddance to bad rubbish uncle gus was saying but hell

quichiquois ill call george shell want to hear about this aunt george was over to aunt priscillas in a trice she must be well in her sixties now and just as spry and as domineering as ever as that summer of elektra you think its elektra she said after id given her a rundown on the news story i did think so id always thought that she had never left the lake but couldnt let myself say it back then didnt want it to be so aunt george you come uptown with me i invited you know all these local officials in case they try to freeze me out i want the story youll get it she did not doubt she was too accustomed to getting what she wanted from the town fathers as we came out on aunt priscillas porch she asked is that your car nodding to where it stood in the driveway well walk she told me just as she always said ten almost eleven years ago easier than trying to park talk to more people anyhow and there were plenty of people out on main street gossiping gawking and there was claude near the bank his fathers bank also aunt georgies he greeted us claudelike good morning aunt george hello emmy you havent been to clarksvale for a long time he was still a wheyface but he had some assurance now he had been appointed an attorney with the county aunt priscilla had kept me informed of all clarksvale news she wrote me every week claude and i shook hands as visitors do aunt georgie said to us im going on down to the courthouse where she could gather information claude said youre here about the bones i showed him my newspaper card it was on the ap wire this morning we sent the bones to the lab in albany two weeks ago theyre on the way back here now with the report i was reluctant but i asked do you know yes he said almost to himself the director informed me i inquired it took a moment or so before he could continue but he said it without inflection they are male bones the bones of a young man probably in his twenties the skull has been bashed i only half asked they were found under the promontory the one called high peak there is a ledge an open cave the bones were there nothing left of clothing no leather a belt a wallet not after ten years pumas take refuge there if a winter storm interrupts their hunting sometimes there are bears i didnt want to say it but i had to she killed him we dont know that she loved him he was going away she couldnt let him go if she did we will never know claude said she cannot be brought back to trial not without evidence even if she is found she was carrying his child he was leaving her and their child somewhere there is a little girl near ten years old straight as a lance long dark hair hanging down her back or a sandy little boy agile scrawny but muscular strong she loved him i kept repeating it not for claude for myself claude said i dont think she planned it i dont think she intended it i think it was by accident in a rage she struck him there were some sizable rocks on the promontory there would be some in the cave and kept striking him until he was gone before she knew what she was doing he broke the strand of beads trying to get away from her she must have had a rock he was stronger if it had been possible to get away from her he could have stopped her i hope you wont mention her in your story why torment her further shell always live with this an agony of loss he had loved voss the way hed never love anyone else nothing homosexual about it a teenage boys heroworship of his hero i wont there may be gossip but it will come to nothing there arent many who really knew her and i hesitated gammer everyone knows gammer makes up tall tales we were left with a pause of silence each in his own thoughts then claude said shall we go down to the courthouse its time for them to get here with the report you can call your paper from my office together we walked the half block on the way he said im going to be married this spring to willa do you remember willa she was one of kattys very best friends well have a church wedding bridesmaids attendants all the frills willa wants it well send you an invitation i hope youll be able to come kattys coming from maryland kattys husband is in government it occurred to him youre not married not yet im a career woman im younger than katty and her friends thats right he recalled you were just a little girl you sat on the bench with me and we watched voss thats right i echoed i closed my eyes and i could see him he was a wonderful dancer maybe to keep from tears he laughed you tried to teach me to dance i laughed for the same reason you had two left feet so we went into the courthouse to hear the full report on the tones just another happening but i did not tell claude that i would give up the story i wouldnt mention elektra not unless someone else did but i would try to find her im an investigative reporter i have to know the entire story
