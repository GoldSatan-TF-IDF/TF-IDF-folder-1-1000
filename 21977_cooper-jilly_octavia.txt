jilly cooper octavia for emma renton with love authors note the idea for octavia first came to me in i wrote it as a long short story called october brennen and it appeared in serial form in petticoat i then took the story and completely rewrote it and the result is octavia chapter one the moment i set eyes on jeremy west i knew i had to have him i was sitting in arabellas watching a crowd of debs and other phonies undulating round the floor and thinking they were dancing when suddenly the bamboo curtain was pushed aside and a blond man walked in and stood looking around for a waitress even in the gloom with which arabellas conceals its decor i could see that he had class tall and lean with one of those beautiful high cheekboned faces with long dreamy eyes like rudolph nureyev as the waitress came up to him i watched to see if hed leer down her exposed jackedup bosom he didnt she led him to a table next but one to ours he was obviously waiting for someone then a plump girl came through the bamboo curtains and stood blinking round with shortsighted eyes he stood up and waved to her and her face broke into a smile that was faintly familiar then i recognized her it was gussie forbes wed been at school together how on earth had she managed to land a havocmaker like that look i said nudging charlie thats gussie forbes we were at school together charlie peered over his very dark glasses which he only wears to emphasize his mafialike appearance she doesnt seem to have recovered from it as well as you have he said she obviously skips the features on slimming when she reads womens magazines and concentrates on the ones about three dimensional charm i suppose you want to rush over and reminisce about the dorm and the french mistresss beard but i wasnt listening any longer do look i said hes ordering champagne do you suppose theyre celebrating cant be much to celebrate getting lumbered with a bird that looks like that said charlie beckoning the waitress and ordering more whisky charlie is immensely successful newly rich young and like me rootless he is not interested in anyone unless theyre likely to advance his career or improve his image at that time just as i was getting bored with him he was beginning to fall in love with me this irked rather than worried me i was used to men falling in love with me when i gave charlie the push he would nurse his hurt pride for a fortnight change the colour of his ferrari and move on to the next affaire i couldnt take my eyes off the man who was buying champagne for gussie forbes she was raising her glass to him now and he was holding her hand and smiling at her he had a beautiful smile gentle and creasing his face in all the right places now he was running a hand down her cheek it was really most mystifying charlie was rabbiting on about the chic mens clothes shop he owns who had been in how difficult it was to get the right staff gussie and her man were getting up to dance he moved easily with the grace of some jungle cat gussie bounced around wiggling her arms and her large bottom she resembled a baby elephant taking a dip in the pool charlie took out a gold cigarette case lit two cigarettes and handed one to me he is full of these selfconsciously sexy gestures which only work if youre cary grant gussie was now writhing and pushing her hair about in utter abandon they never taught your girlfriend to dance at school charlie said watching her in appalled amusement she was taller than most of us then so she always had to dance man the floor had filled up now and gussie and her man were dancing close together he pressed his cheek against her hair but his eyes wandered lazily around the room her eyes were closed in ecstasy and she had a fatuous smile on her face god she was just as wet as she had been at school charlie put his hand on my thigh and drained his glass shall we go he said in a minute lets have one more drink the music had stopped and they were coming off the floor right past our table i ran my hand through my hair to loosen it and pulled the front piece over one eye hullo gussie i said loudly for gods sake whispered charlie gussie peered through the gloom blinking over here i said suddenly she saw me and gave a shriek of schoolgirl excitement goodness it cant be octavia is it really you yes really me come and have a drink gussie pushed through the tables pink face shining with excitement bosom heaving from her exertions how lovely to see you she kissed my proffered cheek and looking so stunning too she dragged the blond man forward this is jeremy west its a very special evening for us weve just got engaged engaged hence the champagne at least they werent married yet congratulations i said and gave jeremy west one of my long hard smouldering looks how very exciting he smiled back at me yes isnt it jeremy darling said gussie this is octavia brennen we were at school together in the same form but not for very long octavia did something perfectly dreadful like eating one of the harvest festival apples in church so they sent her away life was very dull after that i can imagine it was said jeremy west oh how heartbreaking that smile was this is charles mancini i said charlie nodded enigmatically with his mexican bandits face pink suede suit and dark grey shirt he looked both sinister and glamorous no girl could be ashamed of being seen with charlie why dont we all have a drink i said ignoring a vicious kick on the ankles from charlie gussie looked up at jeremy why not she said he nodded charlie get the waitress to bring some more chairs i said what were you drinking said charlie sulkily champagne i said its a celebration ive had quite enough to drink im already getting giggly said gussie can i have some orange squash i told you she was wet but youll have champagne charlie said to jeremy i much prefer whisky let me buy this round charlie shook his head and summoned the waitress you actually got engaged today i said well yesterday said gussie hauling a bra strap up a fat white shoulder have you got a ring yes isnt it lovely she held out a short stubby hand that had never seen a manicure in its life on the third finger glowed an antique ring rubies and pearls surrounded a plait of hair of course he would choose something as subtly pretty as that all the guys i knew would have given me solitaires or sapphires as big as a gulls egg its gorgeous i said looking through my hair at jeremy you are lucky gussie really beautiful men with exquisite taste into the bargain are at a premium these days charlie busy ordering drinks missed that remark jeremy blushed slightly yes he is beautiful isnt he sighed gussie i have to keep pinching myself to prove its not a dream that he should have chosen an old frump like me when youve both finished discussing me like a prize bull said jeremy but he said it gently and taking a loose strand of gussies hair smoothed it behind her ear the drinks arrived gosh thanks awfully its terribly kind of you said gussie beaming at charlie i remembered of old how ridiculously grateful shed always been about the smallest things and thats a beautiful suit she added wistfully jeremy would look divine in clothes like that but hes such an old square i waited for charlie to wince but he didnt and was soon telling her all about the shop that was another thing about her she always managed to make people talk about themselves and gave the impression she was really interested i gave jeremy a long speculative look he dropped his eyes first and took a gulp of whisky thats better ive never been wild about champagne i only like it for elevenses i said when are you getting married november we thought not before but thats light years away why on earth wait so long ive got a large overdraft already and i dont relish the idea of living off gussie gussie i remembered had a bit of money of her own what do you do im in publishing as an editor i write a bit myself as well what sort of things oh poetry a bit of criticism the odd review nothing likely to make any money he looked like a poet with those dreamy blue eyes and long blond hair yet it wasnt a weak face there was a strength about the mouth and chin i got out a cigarette he lit it for me i held his hand to steady the flame looking up at him from under my lashes surely he could feel the electricity between us he put away his lighter why are you called octavia i was born on october the th my motherd gone off my father by then and was mad about someone else and she couldnt have been less amused by my arrival or be bothered to think of a name for me so she called me after the month its a damn silly name to be saddled with its a beautiful name it suits you did your mother marry the man she was mad about oh no someone quite different and then someone else and then someone else my father was married twice too but hes dead now ive lost count of my stepbrothers and sisters it cant have been very easy for you i come from a broken home myself but not one thats in smithereens do you see your mother occasionally when shes sober or comes to london i hardly ever go down to the country to see her i hate scenes shes rather sad now her looks are going and she gets terrible maudlin fits reminiscing about my father which drive her present husband mad how gentle and compassionate his eyes were now and how ridiculously long his eyelashes im sorry i said putting a husky little break into my voice that id perfected over the years i didnt mean to bore you with family history i never talk about it usually that was a lie it was act i in the octavia brennen seduction routine make them feel i need looking after im flattered you told me he said how did you two meet gussie came and did temporary typing for me while my own secretary was skiing she wasnt wildly efficient every letter had to be typed over again and she kept putting things in the wrong envelopes but she was so sweet that when my own streamlined secretary came back and restored order i realized i was missing gus i telephoned the agency started taking her out and that was that im not surprised shes so lovely i hoped he couldnt detect the whopping ring of insincerity in my voice she always protected me from all the bullies when we were at school yes she grows on you she was evidently growing on charlie once i tried to diet faithfully she was saying day after day week after week not eating a thing but lettuce and steamed fish but all id lost after six weeks was half an inch in height she shrieked with laughter so did charlie and jeremy they were playing the rolling stones latest record i leaned forward pressing my elbows together to deepen my cleavage i saw jeremy glance down at it and quickly glance away im mad for this tune i said what are we waiting for said charlie getting up dancing is the thing i do best in the world it seems to release all the frustrations from my body all the evils from my soul i was wearing a long gold semitransparent tunic exactly the same colour as my hair with a mass of gold chains round my neck i felt like a piece of seaweed streaming with the tide of the music flowing now this way now that i knew everyone in the room was watching me the women with envy the men with lust charlie dances superbly too his body seems to turn to rubber i never fancy him so much as when were on the dance floor through a sheet of gold hair i saw jeremy was watching me he turned and said something to gussie she smiled and looked in my direction the music stopped handinhand charlie and i wandered back to our table were off i said deciding this was the ideal exit note going home said gussie no were going to another place said charlie its just been opened by a mate of mine want to come he had changed his tune jeremy looked at gussie she shook her head weve both got to get up early in the morning but do give me your telephone number octavia we must keep in touch we must i said staring shamelessly at jeremy you must both come to dinner yes wed like to he said emphasizing the we even when we finally got home i was still walking on air unable to keep the cheshire cat grin of exultation off my face as the lift shot up to the penthouse flat i had the feeling it might take me through the roof straight up to the stars my flat was beautiful alexander my brother who is an expert at interior decorating had helped me do it up everyone gasped when they first saw it huge fleshy potted plants banked at each end of the long drawing room gave the effect of a jungle the fourth wall was all window looking out onto the lamplit plane trees of green park kicking off my shoes i felt my feet sink into the thick white carpet almost immediately the telephone rang answer it would you i said to charlie yeah said charlie picking up the receiver its someone called ricardo he added he sounds a long way away crackling with lust i said taking the receiver go and get a bottle out of the fridge darling i said to him loudly so ricardo could hear hi my darling i said to ricardo when i had taken my time over the telephone call i wandered into the bedroom charlie was lying naked on the blond fur counterpane drinking champagne and looking beautiful and sulky on the wall above his head hung my favourite picture a th century italian oil painting of adam and eve in the garden of eden surrounded by hundreds of animals and birds its vital my brother had insisted to have something pretty to look at over ones bed to while away the excruciating boredom of sexual intercourse i knew that picture pretty well ignoring charlie i undressed unhurriedly and sat down at my dressing table admiring my reflection in the triple mirror i liked what i saw my body was as warm as an apricot in the soft light my breasts in contrast with the extreme slenderness of the rest of my body had a heavy golden ripeness voluptuously i began to brush my hair whos ricardo said charlie trying to appear cool a rather persistent bit of my past i said you know i never let a dago by charlie laughed i hope he is past he got up crossed the room and stood behind me his hands caressing my shoulders his body was dark brown from the marbella sun as he bent his head to kiss me i could see the gold streaks growing out of his dark hair we made a stunning picture like a fellini film come on narcissus he said its time for bed afterwards he reached out for the champagne and gave me a glass christ you were sensational tonight he muttered sleepily as i examined my now tousled but not unpleasing reflection in the mirror opposite what got into you you did i said and laughed softly there was no need to tell him the whole time we had been making love i had been practising every trick in the trade imagining he was jeremy west he fell asleep almost immediately with his arms around me it was terribly hot i soon wriggled out of his embrace and lay on my back thinking about jeremy memorizing every angle of his face and every word hed spoken to me the fact that he was engaged to gussie didnt worry me a bit made it more of a challenge eventually i got up went to the bathroom removed every scrap of makeup then luxuriously massaged skin food all over my body then i took a couple of sleeping pills switched off the telephone and fell into a dreamless sleep chapter two when i awoke at two oclock in the afternoon charlie had gone leaving me a note on the pillow saying he loved me and to ring him when i was conscious i switched on the telephone it rang almost immediately ullo this is the moroccan embassy i said octavia you are dreadful its gussie here came the breathless eager voice gussie how lovely i thought id ring straightaway before we lost touch you must come to dinner i said wed love to but actually weve got a plan are you doing anything the weekend after next im supposed to be going to france but its a fluid arrangement well i expect youd find it awfully boring but jeremy shares a boat with another chap and weve got it next weekend we wondered if youd like to come too i might get seasick i said trying to keep the excitement out of my voice oh you couldnt its a barge and all we do is drift up and down the canals going through the locks and tying up where it takes our fancy would you like to bring charlie hell be away i lied its not a big thing charlie and me were just mates you havent got someone special youd like to bring i did have we were going to get married but he was killed in a car crash earlier this year oh poor poor tavy she said unconsciously lapsing into the nickname of schooldays oh god im sorry there was a pause well anyway she floundered on if you didnt want to bring someone jeremy had thought do you know gareth llewellyn no should i the name sounds faintly familiar hes a great friend of jeremys weve been trying to persuade him to come on the boat for ages but he works so hard he can never get away i think youd like him hes awfully attractive i didnt care if he were my mind was already jumping ahead dreaming of a long weekend drifting up and down the canals lounging on the deck in my bikini by day my hair gleaming pale in the moonlight by night how could i not hook jeremy it sounds great i said id love to come why dont you and jeremy come to dinner on monday and we can talk about it i planned mondays dinner like a military operation as im a rotten cook and can be guaranteed to louse up even fake mashed potato i arranged for the food to be sent up from the restaurant around the corner so i could pass it off as my own efforts gussie had obviously given jeremy the impression that i was a frivolous social butterfly and i was determined to dispel it i scoured the shops until i found a dress that made me look both demure and sexy and i bought all jeremys books two slender volumes of poetry and a book of criticism of john donnes poems i found jeremys poems quite incomprehensible the long rather selfadmiring introduction written by jeremy himself made me understand them even less the doorbell rang as i was spraying scent round the flat gussie stood in front of jeremy clutching a huge box of chocolates for you she said giving me a bear hug youre the only friend i have who doesnt need to diet goodness that blue looks stunning i couldnt say the same for her she was wearing a scarlet dress which clashed horribly with her flushed face we went in to the drawingroom and i poured everyone stiff drinks how delicious to have a flat like this all to oneself said gussie collapsing on to the sofa i cant wait to get out of london on friday i said nor can i said gussie shovelling nuts into her face like a starved squirrel my office is like a furnace gareth is coming by the way i lured him by telling him what a knockout you were well then hes doomed to bitter disappointment i said with a sidelong glance at jeremy not in your case he said staring back at me until i demurely dropped my eyes oh goodee i thought its beginning to work i sat on the sofa stretching long brown legs in front of me i saw jeremy looking at them surreptitiously i didnt blame him they were a far prettier sight than gussies tree trunks displayed almost in their entirety by a ruckedup skirt gareth wants us to go round after dinner for a drink she said he says he cant wait until friday do you like him i asked jeremy as though it were only his opinion that mattered yes i do hes one of my oldest friends we were at oxford together his father was a welsh miner and he was a scholarship boy with a chip as big as a plank on his shoulder then he ended up with a first hes got a mind like a steel trap but hes not at all academic added gussie all hes ever wanted to do is make masses of money hes got his own company now with thousands of little men working for him putting up skyscrapers hes the most energetic man ive ever met he sounds exhausting i said filling jeremys drink not really said jeremy you occasionally feel you want to add water but on the whole hes fine wont he get bored on the boat not with you around he loves girls he has time for them oh yes sighed gussie hes awfully attractive he makes you feel all body somehow dinner was a success luigis had surpassed themselves both jeremy and gussie were extremely impressed over coffee i opened gussies chocolates oh we oughtnt to said gussie rootling round for a soft centre we bought them for you it was then that i played my trump card turning to jeremy i said you never let on you were the jeremy west youve been a god of mine ever since i can remember ive got all your books how sweet he looked when he blushed and youve actually read them of course i know most of your poems by heart i like the one about victoria station late at night best i reeled off a few lines after that nothing stopped him the occasional murmur from me was all he needed i didnt listen to what he was saying i was too busy gazing hypnotically into his eyes it was gussie who finally halted him when shed finished the chocolates darling if were going to gareths its gone ten oclock he was all contrition sweetheart i am sorry when i get on my hobby horse its like crossing a motorway in the rushhour trying to stop me he took her hand its so rare meeting someone who actually understands what im trying to say unlike me said gussie without rancour lets quickly do the washingup absolutely not i said firmly i wasnt going to have her finding luigis takeaway carrier bags in the kitchen oh well if you insist can i go to the loo jeremy and i went into the drawingroom there you are i said pointing to his books on one of the bottom shelves id taken the jackets off and dirtied them up a bit he looked at me for a second youre very unexpected you know i am yeah when we met last week i thought you were one of those impossibly beautiful girls incapable of doing anything but look glamorous now i find you know how to make a flat look wonderful you cook like an angel and you seem to know more about books than any woman ive ever met i aim to please i said have you got a cigarette of course he lit one for me gussie seems determined to get me off with this gareth man gussies a romantic she longs for everyone to be as happy as she is im sure youll like him most women do im choosy i said carefully i prefer to do my own hunting for the first time we really looked at each other slowly lingeringly exploring each others faces unable to tear our eyes away stop it he said but quite gently gussiell be back in a minute the hot june night blazed with stars we drove through london with the roof down and the wireless blaring in wild spirits we were all a bit tight as it was only a twoseater i had insisted on sitting in the luggage compartment on the right side so i could catch jeremys eye in the driving mirror when we swung round corners i let my fingers rest lightly on his shoulder suddenly i felt a pang perhaps it was a bit much trying to nick him from gussie then i saw gussie put her hand on his thigh not in a very sexy way just in a friendly gesture of togetherness and i was shot through with jealousy the pang disappeared any girl who let herself get as fat as gussie deserved to lose a man like jeremy anyway i managed to show as much leg as possible as i got out of the car in the row of large white elegant kensington houses gareth llewellyns stood out like a sore thumb it was painted violet with a brilliant scarlet door how ostentatious can you get i thought unexpectedly the door was answered by a girl with long red hair eyes the colour of greengages and endless legs mr west she said giving jeremy a pussycat smile come in mr llewellyn is upstairs perhaps youd follow me on the third floor standing in the doorway stood a tall thickset man smoking a cigar jeremy collapsed into his arms clutching at his shirt and gasping out some story about having become separated from the main party with which he had scaled all but the final peak brandy he croaked and staggering past the man with the cigar collapsed onto a pile of cushions gussie shrieked with laughter i think hes a bit tight hullo gareth darling she said kissing him this is octavia brennen isnt she a knockout how do you do i said putting on my society voice because i was embarrassed very well thank you he mimicked me looking me over very slowly like a judge examining a show hack he turned and smiled at gussie shes beautiful gus for once you havent exaggerated are you sure you two havent met before said gussie i should have thought you would have being jetsetters and all that gareth llewellyn examined me a bit more and shook his head no i never forget a body did she really come up the stairs i thought girls like that only came down the chimney at christmas time his voice was low in both senses of the word with a soft but very discernable welsh accent i had the feeling he was laughing at me gussie shrieked with more giggles she was beginning to get seriously on my nerves we joined jeremy in a room which looked like the sunset people walk handinhand into at the end of technicolor films brilliant pink walls covered in books and paintings scarlet curtains parquet glimmering in pools round flamingocoloured longhaired rugs piles of white fur cushions and a long orange sofa it was vulgar but it worked papers were scattered over the floor and the girl whod let us in started picking them up i love your cushions said gussie collapsing onto a pile beside jeremy i took my hangover to habitat last saturday and bought them at least they keep everyone horizontal said gareth winking at me and moving towards a bookshelf of leatherbound volumes the next moment hed pressed a button and the entire works of walter scott slid back to reveal a vast cocktail cabinet now he said what would anyone like he was absolutely not my type his face was heavy with a powerful butt of a jaw big crooked nose full sensual mouth and wicked black eyes which seemed to be continually laughing at some private joke his skin was swarthy and his thick black hair prematurely streaked with grey grew over his collar and in long sideboards down his cheeks he was wearing light grey corduroy trousers and a dark blue shirt open at the neck to show a mat of black hair his height and massive shoulders didnt entirely draw the eye away from a thickening waistline he handed me a drink there you are baby its a real lo lo leg opener never fails to work blushing angrily i turned away by the time he had fixed us all drinks the beautiful redhead had collected all the papers from the floor you havent met my pa mrs smith have you said gareth now in her case the a stands for aphrodisiac do you want a drink lovely she shook her head and gave him her pussycat smile i ought to be getting home my poor husband will be wondering what the hells happened ill see you out said gareth i wont be a minute he added to us isnt he gorgeous said gussie great i replied unenthusiastically there was a crude power about him i could see why certain women might go for him but not me i detest those big hunky aggressively sexual men they make me feel claustrophobic i like my men gentle reticent subtle gareth llewellyn was about as subtle as a steam roller in overdrive i wandered round the room examining objects and giving jeremy the opportunity to admire my figure i avoided looking into an adjoining room after glimpsing one of the biggest double beds id ever seen i half expected to see a blonde in gold lamé pyjamas revvingup beneath the sheets a slight breeze swayed the curtains bringing a scent of mignonette and tobacco plants from the window box outside i looked out of the window down below gareth llewellyn was talking to mrs smith suddenly he pulled her into his arms and kissed her very thoroughly after a minute he let her go and opened the car door for her she patted his cheek with her hand as he turned to come back into the house he looked up and caught me looking at him and grinned the telephone rang gussie picked up the receiver hullo yes hes downstairs hang on a minute gareth she yelled telephone he grimaced apologetically at us as he came in and took the receiver vinnie baby how are you yeah ive missed you too sweetheart i havent a hope this evening im kneedeep in people and later ive got to work ive got one hell of a day tomorrow listen darling what about wednesday evening god that welsh voice could turn it on trying not to listen i turned to jeremy he smiled at me reassuringly what other writers do you like i said keats of course thomas campion some of a e housman what do you think of robert browning i asked why said gareth coming off the telephone is he marrying anyone we know gussie giggled you mustnt mob them up theyve been having highpowered intellectual conversations all evening dont you think tavy that the colours of gareths curtains would be ideal for my bridesmaids after that i was forced to listen to her rabbiting on about her wedding i lounged on the floor propped against the sofa lacing my fingers behind my head to show off my bust and rucking up my skirt with my other ear i listened to jeremys conversation with gareth is that bird really your secretary mrs smith said gareth quite a doll isnt she doesnt she mind working at this hour mr smith is an inwork actor irregular hours suit her so stop eating your heart out youll never get your spoon into that pudding the telephone rang it was south america on the line gareth claiming it was business took it into the bedroom jeremy and i helped ourselves to more drink does he always carry on like this i said with girls usually not always he isnt trying to prove anything hes just a glutton he cant pass anyone up he ought to get married said gussie he needs the love of a good woman hed need the love of four good mistresses as well to keep him going i said are you installing a telephone on the boat no thats one of the conditions of his coming down no telephones said gussie im going to make some coffee she wandered out of the room i got to my feet and strolled over to the fireplace to examine the pile of invitations parties dinners business functions jeremy came over and stood beside me i looked up at our reflections side by side in the huge mirror above the fireplace how odd i said slowly have you noticed how alike we are both blueeyed and blonde we could be brother and sister ive always felt incest has the edge on all other relationships jeremys breath was coming rapidly and his eyes had gone almost glazed with lust you must know i dont feel remotely brotherly towards you i looked up at him running my tongue slowly along my bottom lip how do you feel i said softly bloody disturbed and im not amused by sleepless nights either oh nor am i nor am i we cant do anything about it you know of course we cant but that doesnt stop me being obsessed with you youre the most beautiful girl ive seen in my life he paused i suppose lots of men have told you that a few not many of them meant it well i do he said angrily do you not want me to come on the boat of course i want you to and well gussie would be so disappointed you realize how difficult its going to be being thrown together all the time we shall probably both go mad but rather that than you staying away because of me i took a step towards him we shall both have to rely on selfcontrol thats all oh i shouldnt do that said a voice from the doorway its not infallible in my experience we spun around appalled to find gareth watching us his eyes werent laughing now there was a calm bland dangerous look about him but all he said was your glass is empty octavia then gussie came bustling in with the coffee how much had he heard i bit my lip with vexation after that we talked about plans for the weekend who should bring what what route we should take i didnt contribute much i was too shattered i couldnt look at jeremy when are you planning to drive down gareth asked lunchtime on friday and you ive got meetings all day i wont be able to make it much before five he turned to me when do you knock off work i dont work i said haughtily no i should have realized that your private life must be a fulltime activity ill give you a lift down no i said much too quickly i want to go down early with jeremy and gussie then i can help them get the boat cleaned up suddenly his swarthy face was a mask of malice dont you think the young lovers should have some time on their own threes a crowd and all that yes you go with gareth tavy said gussie pleased that her matchmaking was working out itll be nice for him to have someone to drive down with its a rough old job getting the boat ready but itll be all beautiful by the time you both arrive im not afraid of hard work i snapped no of course youre not she said soothingly you can do the cooking on board if it makes you any happier it didnt there wouldnt be any luigis restaurant to take food away from on the backwaters of the thames i started to yawn octavias tired said jeremy we must go as we were going down the stairs the telephone rang again gareth took it on the first floor charlotte darling great to hear you hang on love im just seeing some people out he put his hand over the receiver ill see you all on friday he turned to me whats your address eleven mayfair street ill collect you about halfpast five isnt he a scream said gussie as we went out into the street oh blast ive forgotten that list of houses he gave me she charged back into the house jeremy and i looked at each other his eyes showed as two black patches in the pallor of his face do you think gareth caught the gist of what we were saying i said i expect so doesnt matter did you fancy him after all that hes not my type he looks like a lorry driver what is your type you are i said chapter three next day the weather soared into the eighties london wilted but i blossomed i felt absurdly and joyously happy and spent most of the day lying naked on my balcony turning brown and gazing up at a sky so blue that it reminded me of jeremys eyes i refused to go out with anyone that week and made sure of ten hours sleep every night by taking too many sleeping pills i spent a fortune on clothes for the weekend i was only faintly disappointed jeremy didnt ring me but i was exdirectory and he could hardly have got the number from gussie on thursday morning i had my recurrent nightmare more terrifyingly than ever before the dream always started the same way my father was alive still and although i was grownup i was paralysed with childish fears of the dark creeping down the stairs hearing the sound of my parents quarrelling getting louder and louder not daring to turn on the light because i knew my mother would shout at me as i reached the bottom of the stairs i could distinguish what my mother was saying in a voice slurred with drink ive had enough im leaving you and im taking xander with me then my father started shouting back that shed take xander over his dead body then my mother screaming well you can keep octavia then and my father saying i dont want octavia why the bloody hell should anyone want octavia when youve completely ruined her someones got to have her yelled my mother well its not going to be me then i started to scream pushed open the door and there was my mother her beauty all gone because she was drunk and red in the face she and my father were both looking at me in guilt and horror wondering how much of the conversation id heard then suddenly my father turned into jeremy shouting i dont care how much she heard i still dont want her i woke up screaming my head off the sheets were drenched with sweat for a few minutes i lay with my eyes open gulping with relief listening to the diminishing drumbeats of my heart feeling the horror receding then i got up took a couple of valium and lit a cigarette with a shaking hand i had to talk to someone just to prove that someone wanted me if only i could ring jeremy but it was too early in the relationship to show him how vulnerable i was nor could i talk to charlie it would only start the whole thing up again i caught sight of the silver framed photograph on the dressing table and realized with relief that xander must be back from bangkok at that time xander was the only person in the world i really loved and trusted not that i trusted him to behave himself or not do the most disgraceful things but because i knew he loved me and that that love was intensified by guilt because he realized our parents had adored him and never loved me xander four years older than me had always fought my battles in the nursery he had protected me from the succession of nannies that my mother never got on with and later from the succession of potential and actual stepfathers who thundered through the house i looked at my watch it was even xander not famous for getting to the office on time might just be in i dialled seafordbrennens number can i speak to alexander brennen please xanders secretary was a dragon trained to keep the multitudes at bay but she always put me through xander answered octavia darling i was going to ring you today he said in the light flat drawling voice which i always liked to think became gentler and less defensive when he talked to me how was bangkok i asked like a fairy tale literally i stayed in pat pong street which was nothing but gay bars and massage parlours i giggled do you want something said xander or are you just lonely i wanted a chat i said a chap no silly just to talk to you listen i dont want to be unfriendly darling but im a bit tied up at the moment ive just got in and several people are trying to hold a meeting in my office what are you doing for lunch nothing ok ill meet you at freddys at one oclock i lay back feeling better the valium were beginning to work soon i should feel strong enough to get down to the daily pastime of washing my hair because of my grandfather henry brennen i didnt have to work for a living after the first world war he came out of a fashionable regiment and realizing he had no money left to support a wife and three children the eldest of which was my father joined forces with a fellow officer william seaford to form a company seafordbrennen in the unfashionable field of electrical engineering both men were tough astute and ambitious and by dint of hard work and good luck soon had factories turning out transformers switchgear generators and electric motors business prospered and survived the next war after that two rival heirs apparent joined the company my father whod covered himself in glory as a battle of britain pilot and william seafords far less dashing son ricky whod spent most of the war in a routine staff job my father had the additional kudos of having a new and ravishingly beautiful actress wife who promptly gave up work and produced a brennen heir while poor ricky seaford married a plain domineering yorkshire girl who despite her capabilities on local committees and the golf course only provided him with daughters my father however while appearing to hold all the cards found it extremely difficult to settle down to a ninetofive job after the excitement of the war his restlessness increased as the years passed and he discovered that my mother who found him far less glamorous out of uniform had started drinking too much and launched herself on a succession of very indiscreet affairs by the time i was born in the marriage was well into injury time and my father even expressed grave doubts that i was his child which i used to fantasize explained his indifference to me despite such setbacks he and my mother staggered on together for another six years by which time old henry brennen had died of a heart attack and william seaford had retired having made his pile leaving my father as chairman and ricky as managing director ricky meanwhile the tortoise to my fathers hare had put his head down and spent the postwar years building up seaford international a vast empire of which seafordbrennen soon became only a subsidiary in my mother left home with my brother xander and one of her lovers a few months later she had a pang of guilt and sent for me and the nanny to live with her in france my father was disconsolate for a short time then moved in with his secretary whom he married as soon as he could divorce my mother the marriage was extremely happy and enabled my father to concentrate on work and when he died very young of throat cancer in he was able to leave huge blocks of seafordbrennen shares to xander and me which should have guaranteed us private incomes for life alas no income would have been enough for my brother xander sacked from school for smoking grass and seducing too many new boys he was also sent down from cambridge after two terms for riotous living being artistically inclined he would have been happier editing an art magazine or working in a gallery but as the only existing seafordbrennen heir he automatically went into the family firm here he survived after my father was no longer alive to protect him by the skin of his beautifully capped teeth and by his immense personal charm three years ago when ricky seaford was on the brink of sacking him xander redeemed himself by selling an arab a power station worth millions of pounds in a deal carried out across the roulette table eighteen months later when things had again looked really dicey xander had played his trump card by running off with rickys elder daughter pamela to the horror of both her parents even ricky however didnt want to have the reputation in the city as the man whod booted out his soninlaw xander was made export sales manager which gave him access to vast expenses in his new exalted position xander had managed to fiddle the renting and redecorating of my flat on the firm after all he said one must have somewhere nice to take overseas clients the firm also paid my rates telephone electricity and gas and provided me with a car which id just smashed up on the whole xander and i did pretty well out of seafordbrennen while i was waiting for the conditioner to soak into my hair i flipped through my wardrobe deciding what to take on the weekend id bought so many new clothes this week my cheque book had run out but after the nasty letter id got from my bank manager i didnt dare order another one american express and access had also cut off their supplies i still had to get another bikini and a glamorous dress to float around on deck id have to borrow from xander the doorbell rang i peered through the spy hole looking out for creditors or unwelcome suitors but all i could see were flowers they turned out to be a huge bunch of pink roses in a plastic vase filled with green spongy stuff into which was stuck a mauve bow on a hatpin i hoped for a blissful moment they were from jeremy and felt a ridiculous thud of disappointment when the note in loopy florists handwriting said dont cut me out of your life altogether all love charlie charlie i reflected as i rinsed and rerinsed was going to be as hard to get out of my hair as conditioner i wondered how the hell i was going to survive the next odd hours until i saw jeremy again i felt a restlessness like milk coming up to the boil an excitement sometimes pleasurable but far more often painful chapter four the heat wave had set in relentlessly the traffic glittered and flashed in the sunshine as it crawled up piccadilly the park was full of typists in bikinis sliding off the deckchairs as the park attendant approached with his ticket machine i could feel the tarmac burning through the soles of my shoes as i crossed the road to freddys i nipped into the ladies first to tidy my hair and take the shine off my nose i was wearing new pale pink dungarees with nothing underneath i toyed with the idea of wearing them when i travelled down with gareth tomorrow thank you very much i said in a loud voice to the cloakroom attendant as i left just to draw her attention to the fact id put p in the saucer since id met jeremy sheer happiness made me overtip everyone freddys was packed as usual and giving off the same mydearpunctuated roar as a smart wedding along the bar sat advertising executives with brushed forward hair and romantic looking young men wearing opennecked shirts chatting them up were beautiful girls their streaked hair swinging their blusher in exactly the right place their upper lips painted a perfect crimson double circumflex as they sat fingers tapping on their slim thighs eyes flickering over each others shoulders to see who had just come in they constantly checked their appearance in the mirror above the bar freddys was the current favourite haunt of trendies and show business people anyone in fact who was important enough to get in and rich enough to get out freddy a mountain of a man with a face as red as a dutch cheese was serving behind the bar hullo ugly mug he bawled at me how the hell did you get past the doorman nearby drinkers looked at me in admiration only favourites and the famous got insulted freddy leaned over and pumped my hand vigorously where the hell you been anyway octavia sneaking over to arabellas i suppose cant say i blame you i eat there too the prices here are too high for me he bellowed with laughter then added your nogood brothers already at the table upstairs drinking himself stupid i followed the smell of garlic wine and herbs up to the diningroom waited in the doorway until i had everyones undivided attention then sauntered across the room the pink dungarees definitely had the desired effect the front flap only just covered my nipples xander was sitting at a window table flipping through a sothebys catalogue he looked up smiled and kissed me on both cheeks hullo angel you look positively radiant have i forgotten your birthday or something waiters immediately rushed up spreading a napkin across my knees pushing in my chair getting a waiting bottle of poully fuissé out of an ice bucket and filling up my glass xander ordered another large whisky perhaps its because he is my brother that i always think xander is the best looking man in the world he is slim and immensely elegant with very pale patrician features brilliant grey eyes fringed by long dark lashes and light brown hair the colour mine was before i started bleaching it even on the hottest day of the year he gives the impression of a saluki shivering with overbreeding as usual he was exquisitely dressed in a pale grey suit grey and white striped shirt and a pink tie impossibly spoilt with all the restlessness that comes with inherited wealth he moved through life like a prince expecting everyone to do exactly what he wanted and capable of making himself extremely disagreeable if they did not few people realized how insecure he was underneath or that he employed a technique of relentless bitching to cover up his increasing black glooms he was always sweet to me but i was very glad he was my brother and not a boyfriend part of his charm was that he always gave one his undivided attention he didnt need to look over your shoulder because he was always the one person people were looking over other peoples shoulders to see on closer examination that day he looked rather ill his eyes laced with red his hands shaking he had placed himself with his back to the window but still looked much younger than his thirty years how are you i said a bit poorly i ran into a bottle of whisky last night later i landed up at jamie bennetts we smoked a lot of grass im sure it had gone off there was a case of stuffed birds in the corner and jamie started cackling with laughter saying they were flying all over the room then suddenly he was sick in a wastepaper basket what happened to you i started feeling frightful too and decided i must get home so i drove very slowly to paddington but it wasnt there so i came back again i giggled so you never got home he shot me a sideways glance can i tell pamela i spent last night at your place of course i said lightly its only another point shell notch up against me pamela had never forgiven me for slashing my wrists the day she and xander got married taking all the attention from her hows our dear mother i said absolutely awful youve no idea how lucky you are not being the apple of her eye she rings up every day gerald is evidently threatening to walk out if she doesnt stop drinking so she has to resort to having quick swigs in the lavatory does she ever say anything about me i asked even now i cant mention my mothers name without my throat going dry never said xander do you want to order i wasnt hungry but i hadnt eaten since yesterday lunchtime and the wine was beginning to make me feel dizzy ill have a cobb salad and a grilled sole i said you really do look marvellous said xander whats up someone must be whos he married to no one i said grooving four lines on the table cloth with my fork there must be some complication hes engaged i said i didnt know anyone did that any more who to an eager overgrown schoolgirl shes so fat wherever you stand in the room shes beside you unforgiveable said xander with a shudder whats he like tall and blond almost as beautiful as you and so gentle and sympatico rich i dont know i havent asked him not particularly well thats no good then xander broke a roll impatiently with his fingers then left it he watched his figure like a lynx then he sighed youd better tell me about him conversation was then impossibly punctuated by waiters laying tables asking who was having the smoked trout giving us our first courses brandishing great phallic pepper pots over our plates and pouring us more wine a quarter of an hour later i was still picking bits of bacon out of my avocado and chopped spinach am i boring you i said yes said xander gently but it really doesnt matter you have got him bad what about charlie charlie who i said like that is it whos going to be the other guy on the boat a friend of jeremys called gareth llewellyn xander looked up hes supposed to be rather agreeable if you like jumpedup welsh gorillas i said xander laughed hes phenomenally successful and with birds too one hears oh hes convinced hes got the master key to everyones chastity belt i said but ive had the lock changed on mine he doesnt like me very much he caught me swapping extravagant pleasantries with jeremy he knows somethings up well id get him on my side if i were you said xander he sounds pretty formidable opposition now we were into the ratrace of the second course waiters kept butting in asking if i wanted my sole on or off the bone offering vegetables and salads more wine and more phallic pepper and tartare sauce everything all right sir said the head waiter hovering over us a minute later yes perfect if youd go away and leave us alone snapped xander theres only one thing i said pleating the table cloth with my fingers can you possibly lend me what for said xander i need some clothes for the weekend youve got quite enough sighed xander as it is covent garden comes to you every time they want to dress an opera just i pleaded i promise once i hook jeremy i wont ask you for another penny darling you dont seem to realize that things are frightfully tight at the moment theres a little thing called inflation which neither you nor pamela seem to have heard of were all going to have to pull our horns in my dear fatherinlaws been on the warpath all morning bellyaching about my expenses i gather this years accounts are pretty disastrous too for the whole group or just seafordbrennen well seafordbrennen in particular everyones very twitchy at the moment somethings obviously up directors going round after dark piecing together ones tornup memos every time you go down the passage youre subjected to a party political broadcast on behalf of the accounts department both glasgow and coventry look as though theyre going to come out on strike the shop stewards so much enjoyed appearing on television last time thingsll get better i said soothingly bloody well hope so said xander ive borrowed so much money from the company theyll have to give me a rise so i can pay them back thank god for massingham at least hes on my side hugh massingham was managing director of seafordbrennen a handsome harddrinking northerner in his late forties who liked xanders sense of humour they used to go on the tiles together and bitch about ricky seaford hugh massingham liked me too when my father died six years ago he had looked after me and eventually wed ended up in bed the affair had cooled down but wed remained friends and he still spent odd nights with me he sent his love said xander said he was going to come and see you next week i wondered now id fallen for jeremy if id be able to come up with the goods for massingham any more never mind id cross that bridge party when i came to it depression suddenly seemed to encompass the table i could feel one of xanders black glooms coming on probably caused by my tactlessly rabbiting on about jeremy which must only emphasize the stupid mockery of his marriage i took his hand hows pamela i said not awfully sunny at the moment shes spending the weekend at grayston with ricky and joan and ive refused to go i have to put up with my dear fatherinlaw five days a week i need a break at weekends and i can put up with joan even less the great screeching cow no one can accuse me of marrying pamela for her mummy i giggled whats she done now alisons pregnant oh god im sorry alison was pamelas younger sister only married this year and dear joan never stops subtly rubbing pammies nose in it that she isnt said xander what does the gynaecologist say he cant find anything wrong with her joan wants her to have a second opinion nice if she had an opinion at all so the onus falls firmly on me pamela takes her temperature every morning and when it goes up im supposed to pounce on her but i always oversleep or have debilitating hangovers or dont get home like last night but ive a feeling nothings going to happen while i lie on one side of the bed reading dick francis and she lies on the other poring over gardening books he was rattling now his hand shook as he lit a cigarette i could sense his utter despair is it absolute hell i asked he shrugged i suppose prep school was worse but at least one had longer holidays then dont worry i said shell get pregnant soon xander was busy ordering coffee and brandies and i was easing a piece of bacon out of my teeth when i looked up and saw a boy of about twentythree standing in the doorway he had dark shelleylength hair huge languorous dark eyes and a mediterranean suntan he wore navy blue pinstripe trousers and was carrying his jacket slung across his shoulders his pale blue shirt was open at the neck to reveal a jungle of gold medallions nestling in a black hairy chest he looked like a movie star for a second i felt a flicker of unfaithfulness to jeremy look at that i breathed to xander im already looking said xander and suddenly there was a touch of colour in his pale cheeks as the dark boy looked round caught xanders eye waved and wandered lazily towards us see a pinstripe suit and pick him up and all the day youll have good luck murmured xander hi said the dark boy i was worried id missed you the traffic is terrible he had a strong foreign accent and was shooting me an openly hostile look which became distinctly more friendly when xander said this is my sister octavia darling this is guido he comes from florence i must say i learnt more on my first trip to florence than during my whole time at radley guido sat down and said he would have expected xander to have such a beautiful sister xander had completely shed his black gloom now he seemed greatly exhilarated guido works at the wellington gallery he said hes in disgrace at the moment because he put his foot through a sisley yesterday stepping back to avoid the attentions of the gallery owner another large brandy and some more coffee he added to the waiter guido was staring openly at xander his glance had flickered over me and passed on in that dismissive way a man would bypass the womans page in a newspaper knowing it had nothing to offer him how is your dear wife he said dear said xander shes busy putting in a swimming pool you must come down for a weekend suddenly i felt de trop and got to my feet i must go i said must you said xander but without conviction then he suddenly remembered i was going to get you some money wasnt i come on well go and chat up freddy ill be right back he said to guido we found freddy in the bar now said xander making sure he looked freddy straight in the eye can you cash me a small cheque of course how much freddy didnt bat an eyelid he pulled a thick pile of notes in a money clip out of his pockets and laid twenty tenners on the bar ill have to date the cheque sometime after the first of the month is that ok sure said freddy soothingly i can always sue you xander gave me the money and escorted me to the door i thanked him profusely dont give it a thought he said now have a ball with jeremy fisher but keep your options open and your legs shut and dont rule out gareth llewellyn altogether he could keep us both in a style to which were totally unaccustomed dont you think he jerked his head in the direction of the dining room that that is quite the most ravishing thing youve seen in years yes he is i said with a sinking heart but for gods sake be careful xander and the same to you darling give me a ring when you get back and he was gone trying to appear not to be in too much of a hurry to get upstairs i felt curiously flat and decided to wander along to hatchards and buy some highbrow books to impress jeremy on the boat chapter five by friday evening i was golden brown all over and ready for action i decided xander was right my best tack was to charm gareth and get him on my side and at fivethirty i was waiting for him with my three suitcases packed i was wearing a wickedly expensive pink and white striped blazer with nothing underneath white trousers and cherry red boots the blazer and boots were really both too hot to wear but i was only going to be driving in a car i felt entirely satisfied with my appearance the minutes ticked by six came and went halfpast six a quarter to seven i vacillated between seething temper that gareth was late on purpose and worry that he might have lost my address at halfpast seven the telephone went this is annabel smith said a husky voice im ringing for mr llewellyn where the hell is he i snapped im afraid his meeting is going on longer than expected could you possibly jump in a taxi and come over here the address is llewellyn house great seaton street ill meet you on the ground floor and reimburse you for the taxi oh the hateful horrible utterly bloody man why the hell had i piled up my car no taxis were free when i telephoned all the mini cabs were booked for the next hour my makeup was beginning to run in the heat it was no joke having to hump three huge suitcases into the street and wait halfanhour for a taxi my blazer was too hot my new boots killing me by the time i reached llewellyn house i was gibbering with rage mrs smith in green looking as cool as an iced gin and lime was there to meet me come upstairs you must be exhausted someone will put your luggage in mr llewellyns car what a perfect weekend for going on the river she said as we climbed in the lift to the fifteenth floor i had a feeling she was amused i was ushered into an office as modern as the hour there were some good modern paintings on the wall leather armchairs with chrome legs one wall covered in books and facing it a vast window a cinemascopic frame for st pauls and the city how could anyone work with a view like that gareth evidently could he was lounging behind a huge black leathertopped desk on the telephone as usual talking execrable french he grinned and jabbed a paper in the direction of one of the armchairs i ignored him and went over to the window buses like dinky toys were crawling up fleet street mrs smith came in with a tray would you like a drink i didnt want to take anything of gareths but i needed that drink too badly gin and tonic please she mixed me one with ice and lemon and then poured a large whisky for gareth he put down the receiver and smiled at me hullo lovely im sorry ive messed you about there wasnt a trace of contrition in his voice you look stunning its as good as a day in the country just to see you ive been waiting nearly three hours i spat at him shall we go he wandered towards the door taking his whisky with him im going to have a shower first make yourself at home mrs smith brought me some magazines i thumbed through them furiously not taking in a word it was nine oclock by the time he came back looking more like a lorry driver than ever in jeans and a red shirt he kissed mrs smith very tenderly before we left i see you believe in mixing business with pleasure i snapped as we went down in the lift but of course you wouldnt expect me to sit looking at some topheavy frump in basic black all day would you thats a nice blazer youre wearing did you think we were going to henley oh this its as old as the hills i was damned if i was going to admit id bought it that morning he reached out his hand towards the back of my neck and pulled something off my collar dont touch me i hissed he handed me a price tag with a hundred pounds on it if this is a cleaning ticket darling im afraid youve been robbed i was furious to find myself blushing outside the vulgarest car ive ever seen stood waiting for us a vast open cadillac sprayed a brilliant shade of peacock blue i was surprised he hadnt hung nodding doggies from the driving mirror i had to admit he was a good driver threading that huge car through the traffic in no time we were soon out on the m speeding towards oxford the sun had set in the west were great masses of crushedup rosecoloured clouds broad beams of light shone down reminding me of an old biblical picture if god were up there this evening dispensing justice i hoped hed give gareth his comeuppance and he might grant me jeremy at the same time the needle on the speedometer registered a hundred mph let me know if youre frightened and ill go a bit faster said gareth i stared stonily ahead oh pack it in lovely stop sulking weve got to spend the weekend together we might as well call a truce why didnt you let me go earlier with the others because i couldnt resist it i wanted to annoy you never mind ill buy you a nice dinner i dont want any dinner all right then you can watch me eat he pulled in at an hotel beyond henley it was obviously very expensive waiters were flambéeing ducks all over the place and the menus had no prices on them i suddenly realized i hadnt eaten all day and found my mouth was watering gareth grinned at me come on eat you might as well oh all right i said reluctantly i had to admit the food was excellent i always eat well he said so i notice i said looking at his waistline he roared with laughter i suppose you like little mini boys with hip measurements in single figures but as freddie trueman once said it takes a big hammer to drive a big nail dont be disgusting i snapped his table manners were atrocious somehow he managed to eat very fast and talk at the same time now he was draining butter out of his snail shells with a sound like water running out of the bath god it was hot in the restaurant i was pouring with sweat but i could hardly take my blazer off i had lunch with jeremy yesterday he said wiping butter off his chin oh im surprised you found the time i always find time for things that matter i think ive found them a house thats clever of you i said coolly whereabouts kensington round the corner from me how can they afford it jeremy hasnt got that kind of money but gussie has shes going to buy the house jeremyd loathe that not now he doesnt ive managed to persuade him how sensible it is they can let out the bottom floor which will pay off the mortgage and it means they can get married next month instead of waiting until november his face had that dreamy faraway look of a volcano that has just devastated entire villages i wanted to kick his teeth in but i was determined not to betray any emotion they must be thrilled i said yes they are i expect gussiell ask you to be a bridesmaid i couldnt speak for rage i was glad when the pretty waitress came over everything all right sir she smiled at him admiringly marvellous he looked her over in a way that made me even angrier how much further have we got to go i asked as we got back into the car twenty thirty miles not more the stars were of mediterranean splendour now the newly cut hay smelt sweet feathery moths were held prisoner in the beams of the powerful headlights the air cool at fast speeds grew hot again whenever gareth slowed down to take a corner we were driving past the reedminster fly over now look said gareth pointing upwards on a huge floodlit placard was written the word llewellyns you i said in surprise me ill be bigger than taylor woodrow one day quite the boy wonder why do you go on working so hard youve made your packet whys it so important to make more money oh lovely you must be weak in the head for heavens sake if you play a game even if its only scrabble you want to win dont you and it matters so much to you the winning of course it does why not have a lamborghini and a rolls royce and a nice house in london and a villa in france and if you can throw in a few good paintings a string of race horses the odd yacht in the med well bully for you its status symbols that really matter to you dont they and to you too said gareth more than anyone you need a sybaritic existence with different guys to take you to trendy restaurants buy you fur coats fly you to all the smart places it wouldnt amuse you at all to be shackled to a poor man i opened my mouth to protest but he went on jeremys the same hes lucky to be marrying gus whos got some bread jeremyll make money out of writing i said quickly nuts he cant write bum on a wall i bet you dont understand a word of those poems of his you claim to be so fond of and do you know why its because there isnt anything in them to understand i can only assume you must be jealous of his talent i said furiously oh dont be pompous sweetheart theres far more poetry in those blue eyes of his than there is in any of his verse i thought you were supposed to be a friend of his so i am but i believe in doing practical things for him like getting him somewhere to live rather than swooning over his tinpot poetry i didnt trust myself to speak gareth said well be there in ten minutes i started to do my face he flicked on a spotlight to help me then said go easy on the warpaint why i asked painting a more seductive curve on my bottom lip because jeremy belongs to gussie and youve come down with the sole purpose of getting him away from her i dont know what you mean oh yes you do that performance you two were putting on the other night not speaking to each other when anyone else was around rushing together as soon as you were alone i heard you both oh darling we shall have to rely on selfcontrol it was a brilliant imitation of my voice gussie is an old friend i said evenly thats the trouble youre jealous of her jealous me jealous of gussie you must be joking because despite your looks people love her more than they do you thats not true i said through gritted teeth gussie is a friend and i couldnt be less interested in jeremy good said gareth amiably keep it that way then here we are he turned off the road down a long woody tunnel clenching my hands i choked back the torrent of rage and fury that was ready to pour out of me jeremys mad for you i said to myself keep calm gareths just trying to bug you gareth stretched what a marvellous prospect three whole days of sleep sex and sun it isnt very likely i hissed that youll get any sex from me not likely at all unless i ask you for it he said just as i was groping for a really crushing reply we emerged out of the tunnel and found ourselves almost at the waters edge the sky unfurled like a banner cascading with stars black hulks of barges darkened the water behind the murky towers and pinnacles of oxford rose indistinctly jeremy emerged from the nearest boat to meet us id never felt more pleased to see anyone i wanted to throw myself sobbing into his arms hullo he said you made it ok let me help with the cases im desperately sorry were so late i said doesnt matter gareth rang this afternoon and said you wouldnt be here much before midnight in the headlamps of the car i could see the barge was painted scarlet and decorated in brilliant blues yellows and greens like a gypsy caravan the brasswork glinted the red curtains glowed behind the saloon windows in gold letters edged with blue was written her name the lady griselda isnt she lovely i said jeremy helped me across the gangplank but he didnt squeeze my hand nor answer when i whispered that it was heavenly to see him again gussie was in the kitchen she was wearing old jeans and an oilstained shirt i suddenly realized how stupid i must look bringing three suitcases tavy she hugged me how lovely have you been having fun yes marvellous i lied disengaging myself from her i didnt want oil stains all over my new blazer you must be exhausted come and see your cabin and then ill give you a huge drink we went through a cabin with two bunks in it this is jeremy and me she said and then opening another door this is you and gareth oh my god i thought im going to have to spend the whole weekend fighting him off our suitcases were already deposited on one of the bunks on a ledge stood a glass jam jar which gussie had filled with meadow sweet buttercups and already wilting roses the heads and the washbasin are next door im afraid theyre a bit primitive and the saloons beyond that she said come through when youre ready i washed and put on more scent and makeup to give me confidence in the saloon i found them all gathered round a portable television set look at gareths toy said gussie trust him to bring the twentieth century with him i said and looked at jeremy but he looked quickly away have a drink said gussie ill get her one said gareth getting a glass out of a cupboard in the corner and filling it with wine isnt this gorgeous i said looking round at the oil lamps the panelling and the gleaming brass very sexy too added gareth approvingly octavia and i are waking at the crack of dawn to do pt pt said gussie in surprise that doesnt sound octavias line of country some people call it sexual intercourse said gareth he raised his glass to me his wicked lecherous eyes moving over me in amusement gussie went off into peals of laughter you mustnt tease gareth poor tavy wont know if shes coming or going coming hopefully said gareth i hear youve found a house i said to jeremy im so pleased for a moment he looked up and our eyes met then he looked quickly away a muscle was going in his cheek he was obviously in a state yes its great isnt it great said gussie its marvellous most couples cant afford a house for years gareth fixed us a mortgage and found us the ideal place in a few days you must come and help me choose curtains and carpets tavy im so hopeless they started talking about the house and wedding plans until i couldnt stand it any more does anyone mind if i go to bed i said of course not said gussie ill come and see everythings all right youll see me anon said gareth no doubt i said turning to jeremy goodnight its such a treat to be down here just for a moment i was comforted by a flicker of misery in his eyes then the shutters came down goodnight sleep well he said in my cabin gussie was plumping pillows it was a good thing gareth rang jeremy and said you were going to be late or wed have been in an awful shambles jeremy and i spent all afternoon in bed gussie confided with a little giggle then went on i hope you dont mind sharing a cabin with gareth im sure he wont pounce on you unless you want it what on earth do you mean i snapped oh well she stammered i mean i thought you might want it perhaps if you found him attractive i dont i said oh dear her face fell realizing it was a bad move i added i like him very much but not in that way once i was alone i couldnt stop shaking what had that snake gareth been saying to jeremy to change him so much had he just done it out of sheer bloodymindedness or did he want me for himself when i was in my nightie which was apricot silk clinging and ironically bought to inflame jeremy i found to my horror that i had left my sleeping pills behind in the state i was in id never sleep without them i put all my suitcases on the floor and crept into the top bunk and lay there tense and trembling waiting to fend off the inevitable assault when gareth came to bed all i could hear were shouts of laughter from the other room an hour went past they were coming to bed there were shouts of goodnight then silence broken only by the sound of water lapping against the boat the door opened and gareth slid quietly into the cabin hoping he would not hear the terrified thudding of my heart i tried to breathe slowly and evenly only five out of ten came the soft welsh voice people who are really asleep breathe much faster than that then to my amazement i heard him getting into the bottom bunk he must be trying to lull me into a feeling of false security i lay frozen for ten minutes but suddenly my terror turned to fury unmistakably from the bottom bunk came the sound of gentle snoring i lay there spitting with rage until eventually i decided it was no use working myself up into a state gareth might have temporarily chucked a monkey wrench into the romantic works but if he intended to fight dirty he would find that no one could fight dirtier than me when i put my mind to it whatever he had told jeremy that i was a spoilt bitch a parasite an opportunist would make no difference in the end jeremy was mad for me try as he might to fight it time was on my side in this heat cooped up together for three days jeremys selfcontrol was bound to desert him all i had to do was look stunning and wait festina lente but how could i be expected to look stunning if i couldnt sleep i wanted to go up on the moonlit deck and cool off but although gareth was now snoring like a warthog i had a feeling that as soon as i tried to climb out of my bunk his hand would shoot out and grab me by the ankle why oh why had i forgotten to bring my sleeping pills the hours crawled by and only when a misty dawn began to filter through the porthole did i fall asleep chapter six when i woke the boat was moving through the porthole i could see shiny olivegreen water a tangle of rushes and brilliant blue sky i could hear voices and the crash of footsteps above me i pulled the sheets over my head and tried to go back to sleep again then gave up and looked at my watch it was nearly twelve oclock when i pushed open the door of the loo i was confronted by a huge brown back and tousled black hair gareth wearing only a towel around his hips was cleaning his teeth youre up with the lark he said grinning you must have slept well dont you ever wear any pyjamas i snapped never never i always sleep in the raw i like to get really close to people shall i run you a bath or would you prefer a shower ill see if gussies got any badedas knowing there was only a cracked wash basin i ignored this and flattened myself against the wall to let him pass he paused in front of me and once again i was overwhelmed by the claustrophobia i always felt when he was close to me as i bolted past him and locked the door behind me i could hear him laughing hed gone thank goodness when i got back to the cabin i couldnt decide what to wear all my clothes looked so new in the end i settled for a dark green towelling jump suit with a red and green striped leather belt gussie was in the kitchen cooking and pinkfaced hello she said how are you did you sleep all right she was obviously dying to know if id slept with gareth or not and was on the look out for signs of ravage in my face i fell asleep the moment my head touched the pillow i said blithely can i do anything to help no dont bother do you want some breakfast only a cup of coffee you ought to eat something you know she insisted i cant even look a fried egg in the face in the morning she began boringly explaining to me the merits of eating a proper breakfast so i made a cup of coffee and a quick exit up on deck a beautiful burning day had soared out of the mist on either side white cornfields slanted down to the water ahead on the left bank a clump of copper beeches glittered purple in the sun the water ahead was so smooth it was as though we were gliding over an old mirror jeremy wearing only a pair of jeans was at the wheel he looked all tawny and golden haired like a young lion but his dark blue eyes were tired everything all right he said yes thank you everythings wonderful i gave him a smile of pure happiness let him sweat i thought let him have a few nasty moments wondering if i really have been screwed by gareth you look very pleased with yourself said a soft welsh voice gareth sat hunched up on the roof his arms round his knees smoking and reading the financial times how the hell did you get hold of that i asked from the last lockkeeper a man of property like myself anything up asked jeremy my shares are by p said gareth dont you ever let up i said only in the mating season jeremee called gussie from the kitchen yes love you havent kissed me for at least a quarterofanhour jeremy looked at us and blushed get on with it you flesh monger said gareth getting to his feet ill take the wheel well be coming up to ramsdyke lock in halfanhour said jeremy ill come and take over then he went dutifully down into the kitchen in a few years time i said savagely theyll be calling each other mummy and daddy i enjoyed going through the lock the lockkeepers little house was surrounded by a garden of flowers as gaudy as the front of a seed packet a goat looked over the fence a golden retriever sat lolling its tongue out in the heat when jeremy sounded the horn a fat woman in an apron came out and opened the first lot of gates for us then the boat edged its way into the dark green cavern with dank slimy walls and purple toadflax growing in the crevices and the gates clanged behind us suddenly water poured in from the other end gradually raising our boat to the new level of the river very phallic isnt it said gareth who was waiting on the shore to open the gates at the other end i looked up at him with loathing do you keep your mind permanently below your navel we tied up for lunch under a veil of green willows and i changed into my favourite bikini which is that stinging yellow which goes so well with brown skin and blonde hair and very cleverly cut to give me a cleavage like the grand canyon hickory dickory dock the mouse ran up the drink bill said gareth pouring himself a quadruple whisky this weekend is fast degenerating into an orgy he looked up and whistled as i walked into the saloon despite your obvious limitations octavia i must admit that youre very well constructed really its a sin for you to wear any clothes at all dont you agree jeremy jeremy was devouring me as a starved dog might look at a large steak his hand shook as he lit a cigarette that muscle was going in his cheek again oh these engaged men never look at other women i said lightly pour me a drink gareth darling we all got tight at lunch it was far too hot to eat but as gussie had spent all morning making a fish mayonnaise we had to make halfhearted efforts shed even cut the tomatoes into little flowers as usual she ended up by guzzling most of it herself afterwards as jeremy and gareth cast off i curled up in a sunbaked corner on deck a few minutes later gussie joined me not a pretty sight in a black bathing dress her huge white bosom and shoulders spilling over the top she immediately started boring me making lists for her wedding theres so much to do with only a month to go she kept saying how many double sheets did i think shed need and was it absolutely essential to have an egg beater but her fond dreamy gaze rested more often on jeremy than on her lists isnt he beautiful she said then giggled gareths given me this fantastic sex instruction book i can now see why so many people end up with slipped discs the things they expect you to do and its a bit tricky when you have to hold the book in one hand in order to learn how to do it and she went off into shrieks of laughter how are you getting on with gareth she went on i admired my reflection in her sun glasses well im not getting off with him if thats what you mean ah but the weekend is still in its infancy said that hateful welsh voice and gareth lay down on the deck between us cushioning his dark head on his elbow the wicked slit eyes staring up at the burning sky ive just been telling tavy about your fantastic sex book said gussie i wouldnt have thought shed need it said gareth she must have taken her l plates off years ago a large white barge was cruising towards us on the other side of the river a middleaged man in a yachting cap was at the wheel addressing two fat women with corrugated hair up at the front of the boat through a speaking trumpet another man with a white moustache and a red face was gazing at us through binoculars they all looked thoroughly disapproving gareth sat up and waited until they drew level with us have a good look sir he shouted to the man with the binoculars ive got two lovely young girls here whose knickers are bursting into flames at the sight of you only fifty quid each satisfaction guaranteed we even accept barclay cards the man with the binoculars turned purple with rage and nearly fell off the roof its young men like you who ought to be turned off englands waterways bellowed the man with the speaking trumpet we even take luncheon vouchers gareth yelled after them ill ask you along instead of a conjurer next time i give a childrens party i said gussie who was doubled up with laughter got to her feet im going to see how jeremys getting on she said i buried my face in my biography of matthew arnold still on the culture kick said gareth in amusement theres only one poem lovely you should read learn and inwardly digest whats that who ever loves if he do not propose the right true end of love hes one that goes to sea for nothing but to make him sick who wrote that your alleged favourite john donne he must have been having an off day i said crossly another boat passed us with a pretty brunette sunning herself on deck gareth wolfwhistled at her she turned round and smiled at him showing big teeth gareth smiled back dont you ever knock it off i snapped havent you ever heard of the law of diminishing returns a dark green world slid past my halfshut eyes the darkness of the trees overarched the olive shadows and tawny lights of the water on the bank was a large notice danger keep away from the weir its not the weir that some people should keep away from said gareth beyond the weir the surface of the river was smothered in foam a floating rainbow coloured like gossamer oh how pretty it is i cried detergent said gareth i shot him a venomous glance and started fiddling with my wireless id given up listening to pop music since id met jeremy but suddenly i hit upon some grand opera a soprano and a tenor yelling their guts out i was just about to switch over when gareth looked up for christ sake turn that caterwauling off youll wake up all the water rats so i kept it on really loud to annoy him absolutely murdering the peace of the afternoon after an agonizing threequarters of an hour the opera came to an end what was that bellowed gussie from the wheel don carlos i said oh how lovely thats your favourite isnt it gareth how many times have you seen it the rat the snake smiling damned villain i couldnt trust myself to speak i turned over and pretended to go to sleep i was lying half drugged with sun when i heard jeremys voice octavia are you asleep i opened my eyes the sky was shimmering with heat i smiled lazily up at him from the ribald laughter i could hear gareth and gussie were obviously up at the other end of the boat jeremy sat down beside me you must watch the sun with fair skin like yours you could easily burn oil me then i said softly turning over on my front and handing him a bottle of ambre solaire he put a dollop on his hands and began to rub it into my back i squirmed voluptuously oh how blissful i wish i had a tame slave to do it all the time put lots on the tops of my thighs i went on mercilessly i heard him catch his breath when i had made him spin it out as long as possible i added and could you possibly undo my bikini strap i dont want a white line across my back his hands shook so much he had the greatest difficulty with the clasp thank you i said when he had finished turning my head and looking at him he was breathing very fast and his eyes were almost opaque with lust the afternoon was perfect now the water was plumed with alders and willows and in the distance two or three pink farm houses dozed among the apple trees the white spire of a village church appeared behind a hill and a plane sailed silver across the sky how remote everything seems i said i cant believe that this time next week i shall be in marbella jeremy sat up on his elbow chewing a piece of grass you will and sardinia the week after and then i think i shall probably take off for bermuda for the summer bermuda whatever for i was taunting him now oh because a guy with whom im just good friends is mad for me to join him out there he was even generous enough to send me my air ticket doesnt it worry you at all living off men all the time who said im living off men i give as good as i get anyway its only normal if ones father rejects one early in life to go round looking for other daddies preferably sugar daddies and playing them up until theyre forced to reject you too dont you ever want to settle down with one man not any more i paused making my voice quiver slightly not since tod was killed earlier this year gussie told me about that im terribly sorry a yellow butterfly shimmered over us thats me i said pointing to it always on the loose so youre really committed to the fleshpots said jeremy bitterly drifting from one rich playboy to another dropping your knickers so you dont have to drop your standard of living that sounds exactly like gareth i said through my teeth its neither funny nor true maybe not now you can have as many minks and gold bracelets as you like but what happens when your looks go and you cant get men any more do you know how women like you end up unless theyre very careful they start making concessions in order to escape from their loneliness then more and more concessions until they turn into a raddled old harridan that everyone laughs at why do you tell me these things i hissed at him its only natural he said in a low voice that i should try and run down all the things i could never afford to give you gareth could give them to me i said what happened between you two last night he said sharply oh you know gareths reputation and you think mine is totally beyond redemption im surprised you ask what happened he said seizing my wrist stop it youre hurting me did you or did you not sleep with gareth no i didnt but its no thanks to you i stormed ignoring me when we arrived last night avoiding my eyes whenever i looked at you if anything was calculated to throw me into gareths arms that was jeremy put his face in his hands i know i know christ im in such a muddle a month today im getting married and i feel as though im going into hospital for a major operation well thats your problem isnt it i said fastening my bikini strap and getting to my feet im going to get a drink of water i found gussie in the kitchen eating biscuits and talking up at gareth who was steering gussie and i were just saying how much we were looking forward to sampling some of your famous cooking said gareth maliciously theres a chicken in the fridge said gussie i wish youd do that marvellous thing you did when jeremy and i came to dinner its a very complicated recipe i said quickly and needs lots of special things im sure we havent got we can get them said gussie gareth and i have got a yen for pimms tonight so we thought wed stop off at the village shop at the next lock well buy everything you need at the same time i hope my dismay didnt show on my face while gareth and gussie were shopping i had a good wash to get off all the suntan oil and sweat i was just wandering into the kitchen to get another glass of water when i felt something furry run across my feet i gave a scream jeremy came racing down the passage whats the matter look i screamed a huge spider ran across the floor and disappeared under the sink its only a spider he said it wont hurt you they terrify me i sobbed he took a step towards me and then the next moment i was in his arms as his lips touched mine we both began to tremble the warmth the dizziness the taste of that kiss lasted a long long time then he buried his face in my hair oh my god octavia youre driving me mad what am i going to do nothing for the moment except go on kissing me i whispered taking his face in my hands chapter seven the crimson sun was sinking the pink water darkening as we tied up for the night alongside a bank of meadowsweet the air throbbed with the formless chattering of birds and all along the bank water rats and owls began to come out on night duty i managed to postpone cooking by saying the chicken would take too long to make i put on a pale grey semitransparent minidress i didnt need the cracked looking glass to tell me how marvellous i looked gussie was looking hideous in white she was scarlet from the sun she looks like a great red lobster i thought with a giggle all she needs is a dollop of mayonnaise gareth handed me a pimms it was afloat with apple cucumber and oranges is this dinner as well i asked coolly its utterly divine said gussie try it i took a sip and smirked at gareth it tastes exactly like cough mixture i said jeremy sitting at the table shelling broad beans looked fantastic his skin was tanned to the colour of dry sherry he was wearing a white shirt i surreptitiously lowered the zip of my dress a few inches then caught gareth looking at me and pretended i was fanning myself because of the heat jeremy darling cooed gussie fondly youre putting all the pods in the pan and the beans in the muckbucket you are abstracted today his minds on other things said gareth like this bloody review ive got to write for the statesman said jeremy ive got to file copy on tuesday i simply cant get beyond the first chapter well say so then said gareth i cant said jeremy it was written by the editors wife thats a gorgeous dress said gussie looking at me enviously id love something really sexy like that youve got jeremy i said smiling at him yes and dont let any of us forget it said gareth broad beans are disappointing grumbled gussie raking her thumb nail down the furry inside of the last pod they always look as though theyre going to produce far more than they do like someone else i could mention muttered gareth as he filled up my glass a smell of mint drifted in from the kitchen im starving said gussie for dinner gareth fried some huge prawns in garlic and parsley and we ate them with broad beans and new potatoes our new house has a little garden said gussie with her mouth full just think jeremy darling well be able to grow our own vegetables youre a fairy godmother gareth finding us this house im neither a fairy nor a godmother said gareth forking a large new potato out of the dish and putting it straight into his mouth these prawns are fantastic said jeremy have some more octavia no thanks i said im surprised to see gareth cooking at all with your pithead upbringing id have thought youd have been dead against men in the kitchen there was a slightly embarrassed pause my father spent his time in the kitchen when he was home said gareth it was the only room we had downstairs how amazing i said my lips curling did you all sleep in the same bed i liked your father said jeremy hastily so did my mother said gareth if youre a miner youre a real man and women like that gussie sensed that i was about to make some crushing remark whatever happened to your glamorous brother she said i remember him coming down to take you out at school and watching a lacrosse match and no one scoring any goals at all they were far too busy gawping at him he went into the family business i said but he hates it hes export sales manager now and has to spend his time swapping filthy stories with reps who did he get married to said gussie ricky seafords daughter pamela that was a good dynastic match said gareth arent seafordbrennens in a bit of trouble at the moment of course not i said scathingly theyve had a terrific year i always say that oh well you should know said gareth i just heard rumours of strike trouble all firms have to cope with strikes from time to time i dont said gareth grinning my men know theyve got the best boss in the world so why should they strike modesty certainly isnt your strong point i snapped of course it isnt im much better at being immodest god he irritated me i wanted to throw my drink in his face gussie went off to bring in some strawberries and cream so i stretched out my foot towards jeremy and started rubbing it against his leg the pressure was immediately returned and when gareth started quizzing him about publishing he obviously had great difficulty in concentrating these are the first strawberries of the year so you must all make a wish said gussie doling out great platefuls i wriggled down a bit further under the table and ran my leg up and down jeremys thigh the next moment i could feel his hand stroking my foot gently caressing the instep it felt fantastically sexy i wiggled my toes against his hand voluptuously did you know that buggery was legal after days on board said gareth so weve only got days to go boyo oh darling sighed jeremy i never knew you felt that way that warm hand was still stroking my ankle then suddenly i looked across the table and froze with horror as i realized that jeremy was squashing up his strawberries with both hands before i could whip my foot away the hand had closed round my ankle like a vice what big feet youve got grandma said gareth his eyes glinting with laughter i tugged frantically for several seconds before he let me go after dinner he turned on the television it was an old film carmen jones you go for me and im taboo sang dorothy dandridge shaking her hips but if youre hard to get i go for you and if i do ill tell you baby thats the end of you oh turn it off ive seen it twice already said gussie we took our drinks out on deck the trees on the edge of the river were as dark as blackberries a little owl swooped by noisily a slight breeze wafted the strong soapy scent of the meadowsweet towards us in the distance we could hear the sensual throb of pop music and see the dark sky florid like a great bruise its a fair said gussie in excitement oh please lets go the red and yellow helterskelter rose like a fairy tower out of the pale green chestnut trees the lights of the big wheel turned like a giant firework i listened to the beat of the music the roar of the generators and the thwack of balls on the canvas at the back of the coconut shies im always turned on by fairs gareth had just loosened every tooth in my head driving like james hunt round the dodgem car track my only consolation was that jeremy and gussie now clutching a gary glitter poster a china alsatian and a huge mauve teddy bear had been watching our progress next to them had stood a group of youths who had wolfwhistled and whooped in admiration every time we crashed past them as my hair whipped back and my skirt blew up to reveal an expanse of brown thigh this was the kind of corporate approval that wouldnt do jeremy any harm now gareth was wasting a fortune at the shooting range and jeremy and i stood side by side watching gussie riding on a merrygoround horse with red nostrils grasping the brass rod with both hands her handbag flying on her arm her eyes shining she smiled at us every time she came past we smiled dutifully back the sensual beat of the music was eating into my soul it was now or never out of the corner of my eye i saw the big wheel pause to take on more passengers gussies merrygoround would stop in a minute lets go on the big wheel i said to jeremy wont you be scared not with you we must be careful gussiell start suspecting something i want her to i said with almost indecent haste we slid into the bucket seats at that moment gussie clambered off her horse and looked round over here shouted jeremy she looked up and grinned take care she shouted up and up went the wheel at the top we could see for miles the moon had broken free from its moorings and was sailing up in the sky below us lay litup villages dark woods pale hayfields and to the right the distant gleam of the river oh isnt it beautiful i said moving my leg against his beautiful he said not looking at the view then down we plunged with that dreadful stomachstealing heartdropping fall screaming like a peacock i clutched jeremys arm are you all right he said as we swooped upwards again then suddenly fate came to our rescue the wheel stopped to drop off some passengers leaving us at the top miles from everyone for a second we gazed at each other what are you so frightened of i said softly gareths disapproval or hurting gussie both gus doesnt deserve to be hurt and i feel guilty bringing gareth down here laying on a bird for him then trying to lay on her myself youd be insane with rage if id got off with gareth i know i would well then is it fair to gussie to marry her when you feel like this i think im more frightened of you than anything else he muttered like carmen jones on the box tonight id be like that poor sod don josé once you got me away from gussie youd get bored with me then id find myself totally hooked on you and not capable of holding you oh darling i said putting a little sob in my voice dont you realize im only playing the field because im unhappy when i find the right guy im quite capable of sticking to him i was never unfaithful to tod not at all not at all youve got to learn to trust me jeremy looked up at the sky i could reach up and pick you a bunch of stars he said i wish we could stay up here forever and never go back to reality the wheel started moving again weve got to talk i whispered wait till gussies asleep and then creep up on deck its too risky gareths got a nose on elastic hes drunk so much this evening hell go out like a light anyone want a drink said gareth when we got back to the boat im going to hit the hay said jeremy ive got a bloody awful headache from the sun ive got some painkillers in my suitcase said gareth ill get them he went out of the room gussie was rootling around in the kitchen i moved towards jeremy have you really got a headache i said he smiled slightly and shook his head i ache in rather more basic parts of my anatomy painkillers wont cure that i said softly the only remedy is to come up on deck later how long shall i leave it well i certainly cant hold out for more than an hour i said running my tongue over my lips at that moment gareth returned with the pills i really dont like taking things said jeremy you take three said gareth firmly that should do the trick id have given anything to have a long scented bath as it was i stood barefoot on the rushmatting soaping my body and then dried myself with an old towel the consistency of a brillo pad i didnt even dare scent my body with bath oil in case gareth thought i was giving him the come on but luckily when i went back to the cabin he was already in bed snoring away like tommy brock i waited half an hour then very slowly eased myself out of bed groping for the wall and then the doorway i had my alibi ready i was just getting a drink of water but i didnt need it gareth didnt stir i tiptoed out of the cabin and up onto the deck the sullen heat of the torrid afternoon had given way to a blissful cool through the overhanging willows the stars shone like blossom i lay stretched out on the deck listening to the soft gurgling of the river the drowsy piping of birds and the chatter and rustlings as the animals of night plied their trades half an hour passed in blissful expectation then another halfhour when i knew hed be here any minute what was that poem that always made us giggle at school he is coming my dove my dear he is coming my life my fate the red rose cries he is near he is near and the white rose weeps he is late well it seemed the white rose had got the message all right another hour limped by by which time the deck was harder than a board and fire was beginning to come out of my nostrils it was obvious i was going to get no chance to play deck coitus anger gave way to misery and exhaustion and i crept back to bed chapter eight i was woken by the din of church bells the cabin was already like an oven the day far sunnier than my mood i lay for a few seconds sourly wallowing in the bitterness of rejection master jeremy it had to be faced had displayed thighs of clay it was possible gussie had had an attack of insomnia or intense amorousness last night which had prevented him sneaking up on deck to find me but it seemed unlikely i had been convinced i could extract him from her as easily as a kleenex from its box but i had plainly miscalculated he must prefer the security of her prop forward arms to my more subtle embraces they were after all engaged and he more accustomed to behaving like a gentleman than a fullblooded male all the same i wasnt going to give up without a fight it would give old torquemada llewellyn too much satisfaction id just have to find a chisel and prise jeremy away like a barnacle the boat was also beginning to get on my nerves my hair hadnt been washed for two days and was losing its slippery sheen i was desperate to have a bath and fed up with not being able to admire myself in a long mirror gussie was in the kitchen im surprised she didnt put up a camp bed there simultaneously washing up breakfast cooking lunch eating cold new potatoes and making out wedding lists hullo she said beaming did you sleep well brilliantly i said it must be all that fresh air dont the church bells sound lovely she said i adore country churches all that soft brick and sermons about crops and rosycheeked choirboys scuttling in late because the vicars been pinching them in the vestry itd be worth going to church to get cool its like a sauna on board gussie looked a bit shocked i dont believe in god i said lightly or rather ive never had any evidence that he believed in me i didnt think about him that much said gussie until i found jeremy and then i just felt i ought to be saying thank you for my incredible luck all the time she bent over to empty the sink tidy displaying a vast stretch of bluejeaned bottom wranglers must sew up their trousers with underground cables to stand that kind of strain i hoped jeremyd wake up in time to go to matins with me she went on but hes still out like a light mind you its good for him hes been working so hard at the office and i often think the strain of getting married is even worse for men she glanced at her list again absentmindedly breaking off a bit of celery and putting it in her mouth do you think ill need a mac in my trousseau well ive always preferred men with cars i said but i suppose you could wear a black plastic one with nothing underneath for the bedroom do you need any help i added unenthusiastically taking an orange from the fruit bowl oh no she said i want you to enjoy yourself ill go and sunbathe then i took a lilo and my incredibly boring biography of matthew arnold out on deck i had put on a new black bikini composed only of four black triangles held together by bootlaces with not really enough triangle to go round the sun was already high in the sky and boring down on the boat snaky brown tree roots gleamed below the surface of the oily water meadowsweet was spread thick as cream on the lush green banks the birds were still being shouted down by the church bells it was far too hot for clothes i took off my bikini top and lay down within twenty minutes sweat was pouring in rivulets down the ridges of the lilo i was just about to retreat inside for a towel and a drink of water when i heard a wolf whistle i flicked open my eyes straight into the highly unacceptable face of capitalism and quickly flicked them shut again it was gareth already after two days tanned dark brown by the sun carrying the sunday papers a large gin and tonic and a wireless playing mozart morning lovely he said youre overdressed why dont you take off the bottom half as well i ignored him feigning sleep the next moment gussie joined us oh tavy she said do you think you should someone might see you from the bank dont be a spoilsport said gareth heres the news of the world and shut up i wont give you a paper octavia as i know youre finding that biography of matthew arnold quite unputdownable bags i borrow it next i gritted my teeth for a few minutes they read in silence i got hotter and hotter like a chicken on a spit why do they always write about the emphasis being on the hips this year when ones just had a huge breakfast sighed gussie thats nice said gareth showing her the sunday times theyve given us a good writeup recommending their readers to buy our shares which is more than theyre doing for seafordbrennen how many people work at seafordbrennen tavy said gussie about a quarter of them said gareth taking a huge swig at his gin and tonic gussie giggled you dont know anything about them i hissed at him why dont you stick to underpasses which you seem to know all about theres a most interesting thing here about schism in the catholic church said gussie hastily do you think priests should marry gareth only if they love each other gussie shrieked with laughter there was only one single bell tolling now hurrying people to church they always ring out of tune back home in wales said gareth one of the bellringers is a very pretty girl given to wearing mini skirts all the men bellringers are in love with her and every time she lets her bell go up they pull their bells down to have a good look christ its hot it must be in the nineties im going to get a drink do you want one tavy said gussie i do said gareth handing her his glass i hope jeremy wakes up soon itll be much cooler once we get going said gussie i turned over on my side pretending to be asleep through the rails i could see the elm trees full of a blue darkness and a heat haze shimmering above the hay fields i must have dozed off for the next thing i heard was jeremys voice saying what the hell did you give me last night mogodon said gareth mogodon said jeremy in horror three of them christ you bastard thats almost an overdose no wonder they knocked me out like a sledge hammer it was for your own good said gareth kept you out of mischief and miss brennens bed i wish youd bloody well stop playing anticupid snapped jeremy hush said gareth softly youll wake octavia jeremy lowered his voice god she looks fantastic like a ming vase said gareth beautiful but empty why dont you write one of your famous poems about her oh lovely octavia how id like to make a slave of ya oh put a sock in it said jeremy angrily have you got a copy of shakespeare on board asked gareth somewhere in the bookcase in the saloon what do you want to look up the taming of the shrew said gareth i thought i might pick up a few tips on how to handle octavia jeremy lost his temper will you stop jumping on that poor girl why are you jumping on her already i am not why the hell dont you go and start the boat why dont you said gareth ive come here on holiday its the first break ive had in months and im enjoying the view far too much i cant decide if octavias glorious knockers remind me more of the himalayas or the pyramids jeremy called gussie she obviously didnt like jeremy admiring the view either do come and start the boat all right he said reluctantly then more softly to gareth if you dont get off octavias back therell be trouble her back is not the part of her anatomy uppermost in my mind at the moment i was nearly expiring with heat and rage by now i was also worried about my tits burning my hair was ringing with sweat i shook it out of my eyes and glared at gareth do you want me to oil you he said no thank you i hissed why dont we have a ceasefire it is the sabbath after all he said looking down at me with amused and lascivious pleasure youre disgusting i said furiously turning over on my front there was the sound of engines and the boat started even when we were on the move the heat didnt let up as we sailed into a long stretch of open river with no shade gareth got to his feet and stretched im worried youll overcook octavia and the next moment hed dived into the river with a huge splash sending a tidal wave of filthy oily water all over me i leapt up screaming grabbing my bikini top will you stop hounding me i howled as he surfaced laughing shaking his hair out of his eyes i thought you needed cooling down he said and scooping a great handful of water in my direction soaked me again gibbering with rage i rushed into the kitchen that sods just drenched me gussie giggled oh poor tavy here have a towel its soaked my hair i stormed i must wash it at once you cant really said gussie sympathetically there simply isnt enough water im sure itll dry all right i caught sight of my face in the mirror there was a great red mark on my cheek where id lain on matthew arnold it looked as though gareth had socked me one and doubled my ill temper but normally i wash my hair every day i screamed its crawling off my head ive never been on anything as primitive as this bloody boat then i made the most awful scene none of gussies bromides could soothe me no one goes out of their way deliberately to hurt people she said finally i do said gareth coming in dripping river water and seizing the towel from me im like a leopard i kill for the hell of it you shouldnt have soaked her said gussie reproachfully im going back to london i said splendid said gareth theres a fast train on the hour from reading next time you come down well arrange qe facilities whats the matter said jeremy shouting down the stairs weve got a mutiny on our hands mr christian said gareth able sea woman brennen wants to desert shall we keelhaul her or give her lashes gussie god rot her started to laugh jeremy came down the stairs and took in the situation in a swift glance go and steer he said angrily to gareth youve caused enough trouble for one morning i own this boat and what i say goes sorry captain bligh i mistook you for mr christian said gareth grinning and filling up his glass he disappeared up the stairs shouting ahoy ahoy my kingdom for a hoy jeremy poured me a stiff drink and took me into the saloon im sorry about gareth he said gently hes being diabolical i think he must be going through the change of life hes probably irritated i havent succumbed yet i said hell knows no fury like a welshman scorned there was a pause jeremy put some books back on the shelf did you wait very long last night he said in an undertone not very i said i was disappointed thats all oh christ he said gussie was yapping and yapping away about soft furnishings and the next thing i knew it was morning bloody sleeping pills im terribly sorry you must think me such a drip i laughed suddenly i felt much happier you couldnt do much on three mogodons if youre really desperate for a bath he said well stop at the next lock and see what we can do where are we anyway i said about half a mile from grayston thats where ricky seaford lives i said in excitement ill give him a ring at the next lock and we can go and swim in his pool ill come ashore with you said jeremy behave yourself octavia gareth shouted after us as we got off the boat or well get the rape of the lock keeper and jeremyll be forced to write a long poem about it afterwards in heroic couplets scarlet geraniums blazed in pots on the windowledges the whitewashed stone of the lockkeepers cottage assaulted the eye the quay scorched my bare feet inside the cottage it was dark and at least cooler jeremy tactfully stayed outside while i telephoned the butler answered mrs seaford was not back from church but mr seaford was in he said that was a relief ricky was a long time coming to the telephone i watched the flypaper hanging from the ceiling black with desperate writhing insects and examined the coronation mugs and framed photographs of children with white bows in their hair on a nearby dresser hullo octavia said rickys familiar plummy portsoaked voice it sounded more guarded than usual what can i do for you im only a quarter of a mile away i said roughing it on a barge i cant imagine you roughing it anywhere can we come and see you this afternoon there was a pause i could imagine his bullterrier eyes narrowing thoughtfully he probably had business friends staying the weekend it would impress them to invite a sexy bit of crumpet like myself over but would it be worth incurring joans wrath then he said were going out to dinner but come over and have tea or early drinks or whatever whos on the boat with you oh a sweet engaged couple youll absolutely adore them and a ghastly jumpedup welshman whos convinced hes charlie clore i wanted to show him a real captain of industry in the flesh thats why i rang you ricky laughed i could tell he was flattered do put him down if you get the chance i said talking of captains of industry said ricky theres a great fan of yours staying here this weekend oh who wait and see well see you later things were decidedly looking up gareth and jeremy were already at each others throats and this afternoon i would not only have the pleasure of seeing ricky take gareth down a few pegs but also have an old admirer to spur jeremy on to greater endeavour smiling to myself i went out into the sunshine jeremy was leaning over the backdoor gate gazing moodily at the sweltering horizon above a pair of much faded pale blue denim shorts his back was tanned a gleaming butterscotch gold suddenly i thought what ravishing children wed have no one could see us from the boat i put a hand on his shoulder stop allin wrestling with your conscience i said its too hot the next moment i was in his arms after a second i pulled away didnt you know it was dangerous to exceed the stated dose i whispered gazing blatantly at his mouth by the time we got back gareth had taken the boat through the lock you have caught the sun said gussie gazing at me in admiration she was obviously pleased i was in a good mood again whats worrying me said gareth grimly is whose son shes caught chapter nine great fans of overhanging willow trees crashed against the roof as we drew up at ricky seafords newly painted blue and white boathouse hayfields rose pale and silver towards a dark clump of beech trees surrounding a large russet house which was flanked by stables sweeping lawns and well kept fruit and vegetable gardens goodness how glamorous said gussie standing on the shore and tugging a comb through her tangled hair i hope we dont look too scruffy i certainly didnt i was wearing a pale pink shirt over my black bikini and the heat had brought a pink glow to the suntan in my cheeks ricky seafords a frightfully big noise isnt he said gussie well he makes a lot of noise i said admiring my reflection in the boathouse window itll be so useful for gareth to meet him said gussie oh hes right out of gareths league never mind said gareth equably i may pick up a few tips we walked up the slope past hedges dense and creamy with elder flowers and hogweed under huge flatbottomed trees sleek horses switched their tails deep in the buttercups we came to a stile jeremy went over first and helped gussie and then me for a second i let myself rest in his arms we let ourselves in through a wrought iron gate walking across unblemished green lawns past huge herbaceous borders luxuriating in the heat these are joans pride and joy i said shes very good in flower bed is she nice said gussie well lets say i prefer ricky shes a perfectly bloody motherinlaw to poor xander at that moment several assorted gun dogs and terriers poured barking out of the french windows followed at a leisurely pace by ricky seaford he was a tall man who had grown much better looking in middle age when his hair had turned from a muddy brown to a uniform silver grey this suited his rather florid complexion which had been heightened year by year by repeated exposure to equal quantities of golfcourse air and good whisky beneath the bullterrier eyes the nose was straight the mouth firm a dark blue shirt worn outside his trousers concealed a middleaged spread the general effect was proconsular and impressive hullo chaps he said in his booming voice kissing me on the cheek joans down at the pool he was always more friendly to me when she was out of earshot this is gussie forbes and jeremy west i said nice to see you said ricky giving them the big onoff smile that gave him such a reputation for having charm in the city youve certainly picked the right weather suddenly he saw gareth who had lingered behind to talk to the dogs for a minute ricky looked incredulous then his face lit up like a christmas tree why gareth he bellowed you do pop up in the most unexpected places what the hell are you doing here cruising down the river on a sunday afternoon said gareth i must say its a nice place youve got here ricky well well well i didnt realize you were going to see it so soon ricky now seemed terribly pleased with everything fancy you meeting up with this lot now i expect youd like a drink come down to the pool joans been so looking forward to meeting you you know each other said gussie looking delighted what a coincidence you never said so gareth no one asked me he said is this all of you said ricky i thought you mentioned some tiresome little parvenu who needed putting in his place octavia that was probably me said gareth drily if id had a knife handy id certainly have plunged it into him i moved away kicking a defencelesslooking petunia when no one was looking the pool which was of olympic size and always kept at degrees lay in an old walled garden overgrown with clematis ancient pink roses and swathes of honeysuckle at one end in a summerhouse ricky had built a bar joan seaford a stone dogooder most of it muscle lay under a green and white striped umbrella writing letters she glanced up coldly as we approached she always looks at me as though i was a washing machine that had broken down as is often the case the people who married into the seafordbrennen clan were the ones who felt the family rivalry most strongly the violent jealousy joan had always displayed towards my mother was now transferred to me and intensified by the resentment she felt towards xander hullo octavia she said youre looking very fit her voice had that carrying quality developed by years of strenuous exercise bawling out gundogs and terrorizing charity committees drawing close i could see the talcum powder caked between her huge breasts and smell the tweed cologne she always used i introduced gussie and jeremy ricky had dropped behind showing the new diving boards to gareth ive never seen such a beautiful pool raved gussie and your herbaceous borders are out of this world how on earth do you grow flowers like that my fiancé and i have just got a house with a tiny garden were so excited joan looked slightly more amiable her face completely defrosted when ricky came up and said darling isnt this extraordinary guess whos on the boat with them gareth llewellyn oh ive heard so much about you and octavias been telling us lots about you mrs seaford said gareth taking her hand joan shot me a venomous look then turned smiling back to gareth my dear you must call me joan i gather you and ricky have been doing a lot of business together well yes said gareth the lousy sycophant still holding her hand we hope to i must say youve done this pool beautifully well whats everyone going to have to drink said ricky rubbing his hands gussie was putting an awful flowered teacosy on her head id love to have a swim first she said i sat down on the edge of the pool one of the seaford setters sensing my illhumour wandered panting over to me and shoved a cold nose in my hand the dogs had always been the only nice people in the house my temper had not improved half an hour later everyone had swum and gareth having totally captivated joan seaford had been taken off to the house to talk business with ricky ricky having learnt from gareth that jeremy was in publishing had invited him to inspect the library which dripped with priceless first editions that no one had ever read gussie was still gambolling round in the shallow end like a pink hippo rescuing ladybirds from drowning i was left with joan wheres pamela i said shes gone off to lunch with some friends the connollyhockings hes the prospective candidate for grayston xander finds them boring we were rather surprised he couldnt make it this weekend youd think after three weeks in the far he was exhausted by the trip i said its his first weekend home i expect he had a lot of things to catch up on ricky thought it rather odd he used pressure of work as an excuse said joan he must confine all his industry to the weekends what do you mean i said sharply joan wrote the address of some viscountess on the envelope in her controlled schoolgirl hand then she said xander doesnt seem to understand that office hours run more or less from to with one hour for lunch he shouldnt spend quite so long every day pouring drinks down young men who ought to be back in their offices at the stock exchange despite the white heat of the day i suddenly felt as though ice cold water was being dripped down my neck had ricky and joan got wind of xanders proclivities god help him if they had xander does most of his deals over lunchtime drinks i protested at that moment gussie joined us are you talking about xander she said ripping off her petalled tea cosy i always did think he was the most glamorous man ever after jeremy that is joan gave a wintry smile i gather from tavy that pamela is divine too said gareth having gathered no such thing but i cant believe youve got married daughters you look so young joan patted her sculptured blue curls im going to be a grandmother soon how exciting shrieked gussie you didnt tell me xander was having a baby tavy no my other daughter said joan she only got married in march but they dont believe in waiting unlike xander and pammie whove been married two years oh thats not long said gussie soothingly i know shell get pregnant soon she might said joan if xander spent more time at home i flushed and was about to contradict her when gussie said alison was only married in march then you must be an expert on weddings i bet it was lovely it was rather a success poor ricky had to sell a farm to pay for it perhaps you saw the photographs in the tatler i believe i did lied gussie and they were off searcys the general trading company peter jones soft furnishings and duvets and cast iron casseroles and werent lots of little bridesmaids in laura ashley dresses much sweeter than grown up ones gussie really ought to cut a disc alisons husband peter is an absolute charmer joan was saying we like him awfully they spent their honeymoon in the seychelles the bitch god how i wanted to hold her underneath her horrible chlorinated aquamarine water until her great magenta face turned purple i watched the red admirals burying their faces in the buddleia i wished jeremy would tear himself away from the first editions a great wave of loneliness swept over me if youre in a hurry for a wedding dress said joan ive got a little woman who can run up things awfully quickly shall i give her a ring i knew she was only handing out largesse to gussie like nuts at christmas to emphasize her disapproval of me would you mind if i washed my hair joan i said getting to my feet ive brought my own shampoo of course not help yourself use my bedroom there are plenty of towels in the hot cupboard and arsenic in the taps i muttered walking towards the house feeling her hatred boring into my back she was probably glad of an excuse to question gussie about me and gareth as i crossed the lawn i deliberately didnt look into the library to see if i could see jeremy suddenly a voice with a slight foreign accent said hullo octavia i gave a shudder of revulsion as i looked up into the coarse sensual face of andreas katz pornking and multimillionaire what are you doing here i said not bothering to keep the hostility out of my voice staying here so this was the old admirer ricky was talking about let me monopolize you for a minute he said taking my arm i felt his fingers warm and sweaty enveloping it i moved away but his grip tightened come and look at joans rosegarden he said i gather its quite exceptional i could see the line on his forehead where the mantan ended and the gunmetal grey hair began he was a man who seldom ventured out of doors his eyes were so dark the pupils were indistinguishable from the iris and always looked so deeply and knowingly into mine i felt he knew exactly the colour my pants were he was wearing a black shirt and silver paisley scarf which blended perfectly with the gunmetal hair i supposed he was handsome in a brutal selfconscious way but i could never look at him without realizing what a really evil man he was i was surprised joan allowed him into the house inflation makes strange bed fellows as well as owning strip clubs and half the girly magazines in london he also produced a prestigious semipornographic magazine called hedonist which ran features by intellectuals alongside photographs of naked girls with red indian suntans lying on fur counterpanes it was regarded as the english answer to playboy for a number of years now he had been chasing me in a leisurely fashion offering me larger and larger sums to be photographed i always refused him i didnt fancy a staple through my midriff i felt towards him that contempt with which one regards a bath rail in an hotel bathroom convinced one will never be old and frail enough to need it i stopped to admire a purple rose andreas admired my figure which in its sopping wet bikini left nothing to the imagination he pressed a clenched fist gently against my stomach when are you going to come and pose for me he asked im not i dont need the bread you never know he said nothings giltedged any more not even your beautiful hair roots cost money to be touched up its natural i snapped i hear seafordbrennens are in a spot of bother he went on i could feel his hot breath on my shoulder oh for gods sake why does everyone keep telling me this of course theyre all right theyve been all right for over fifty years andreas splayed his fingers out and caressed my rib cage he was the only man i knew who gave me that horrible squirming feeling of excitement i imagined the hundreds of girls and the millions of grubby girly pictures those fingers had flicked through i moved off sharply and buried my face in a dark red rose he lit a cigar with a beautiful manicured hand holding it between finger and thumb like a workman i could feel him watching me why dont you stop staring a katz can look at a queen hed made that joke a hundred times before youre a very beautiful girl octavia but not a very bright one ill pay you fifteen hundred for one photographic session why dont we have dinner next week and discuss it and that wouldnt be the end you know i could give you everything you want well i certainly dont want you i said turning and walking back and if people saw the goods displayed so blatantly across your gatefold they might not be interested in purchasing them any more andreas smiled the knowing smile of a crafty old animal ill get you in the end baby and by then itll be on my terms you wait and see by the way whats gareth llewellyn doing closeted with ricky hes spending the weekend with us on the boat andreas laughed so hes your latest no wonder youre not interested in bread at the moment i looked towards the house the wistaria above the library was nearly over and shedding its petals in an amethyst carpet over the lawn out of the library window i caught sight of jeremy watching us i turned and smiled warmly at andreas theres a beautiful girl down at the pool talking to joan why dont you go and sign her up instead of me i said and patting him on the cheek ran laughing into the house joan seaford must have got the most sexless bedroom in the world with its eau de nil walls sea green carpet and utterly smooth flowered counterpane tucked neatly under the pillows so they lay like a great sausage across the top of the bed on the chest of drawers stood large framed lenare photographs of pamela and alison looking mistily glamorous in pearls there were also a large photograph of peter alisons husband and one of alison and peter on their wedding day knee deep in little bridesmaids in laura ashley dresses but not even a passport snap of xander who was a hundred times more handsome than the whole lot put together i was tempted to take the picture of him out of my wallet and stick it on top of peters smug smiling squarejawed face but it wouldnt have done xander any good i felt better after id had a bath washed my hair and rubbed quantities of joans bottle of joy over my body i hoped she wouldnt recognize the smell on me anyway she deserved to be joyless the old bag combing my wet hair i looked out of the window two girls the kind who open their legs like airport doors whenever a man approaches wearing white bikinis stiletto heels and about a hundredweight each of makeup were teetering across the lawn they must have been brought down by andreas he always carried a spare suddenly jeremy came out of the door leading to the swimming pool and walked past the tarts without even noticing them they on the other hand swivelled round gazing at him in wonder watching him avidly as he loped with lazy animal grace towards the house i cant say i blamed them bring me my beau of burning gold i muttered as wrapped only in a huge fluffy blue towel i curled up on the floor to dry my hair i didnt wait long there was a quick step outside and a knock on the door come in i said huskily he closed the door behind him i let the towel slip slightly why are you here i said im amazed you could tear yourself away from those first editions youre why im here he said who was that repulsive man you were talking to my heart sang it had worked andreas katz ive known him for years how well i went on drying my hair how well persisted jeremy oh for gods sake turn that bloody thing off not as well as he would like i said but i turned off the dryer he put his hands down pulled me to my feet and kissed me passionately his hands moving down to my breasts and over my hips just for once i thought the millpond smoothness of joans flowered counterpane is going to be ruffled then suddenly jeremy pushed me away and went over to the window it took him a few seconds to get himself under control i picked up the dryer no he said for christs sake dont turn it on yet look you must understand how crazy i am about you youve got a funny way of showing it he knelt down beside me took my face in his hands began stroking it very gently as though he wanted to memorize all the contours gus doesnt deserve to be hurt you know that as well as i do not now anyway when gareths around to fuck everything up as well if you and i have got something going for us and i believe we have lets wait until we get back to london for a minute i looked mutinous but i knew it wouldnt further my cause to tell him that part of the charm of hooking him would be to upset gussie and gareth its only tonight and monday to get through he went on on tuesday we go back to london and we can meet on wednesday and decide what the hell to do about it youre so important to me i reckon its worth waiting for i nodded picking up his hand and planting a kiss in the palm all right ill try i said with the tips of his fingers he traced a vein on the inside of my arm down to the scar that ran across my wrist how did you get that with a razor the day xander married pamela i felt the only person in the world who really loved me was being taken away from me he bent his head and kissed the scar you do need looking after dont you be brave and trust me little one it isnt long to wait after he was gone i finished drying my hair and went downstairs experiencing a great and joyous calm the road was clear now there was nothing gareth could do down at the pool the two tarts were swimming holding their madeup faces high out of the water encouraged by gareth who was sitting on the edge talking to ricky and andreas and drinking a bloody mary hed been swimming again and his black hair fell in wet tendrils on his forehead i certainly dont want yesmen around me anymore said ricky i certainly want yes women around me said gareth i suppose wed better go in a minute oh there you are octavia cleansed in mind and body i hope the three men looked at me together they made a nerveracking trio octavia has so far refused to cook a single meal on board said gareth so no doubt ill be slaving over a hot tin opener again tonight i really dont approve of rolereversal the only time any rolereversal takes place in our house said ricky laughing heartily is when joan reverses the rolls into the gateposts whos taking my name in vain said joan coming through the gate followed by gussie and jeremy absolutely weighed down with loot from the vegetable garden look screamed gussie isnt joan angelic we can have asparagus for supper tonight and strawberries at least we wont get scurvy said gareth smiling at joan thank you very much he got up we must go youd better go and change darling said ricky ill walk down to the boathouse with them itll give the dogs a run i wont be long he bustled into the house such a pity were going out to supper joan said kissing gussie do send me a postcard when you know what your telephone numbers going to be and ill get alison and peter to give you a ring i know youll get on goodbye octavia she gave me the usual chilly peck you must bring mrs smith down one evening she said to gareth i hear shes the most gorgeous gel shed only started saying gel since pamela came out ricky returned with the visitors book you must all sign before you go he always does this so he can remember who to claim on expenses i didnt dare look at jeremy when gussie signed them both under their new address we wont be actually living there for a month or two she said beaming round andreas abandoned us at the edge of the hayfields he was not cut out for country walks goodbye octavia he said think about what ive said we cant go on not meeting like this that mans a shit said gareth as soon as we were out of earshot i know said ricky but an extremely clever one chapter ten after the thrill of my recent encounter with jeremy i behaved atrociously for the rest of the day as we were sailing towards evening through low fields of buttercups and overhanging trees i made jeremy teach me how to steer the boat i insisted on driving it towards the bank all the time so he had to keep putting his hands over mine in order to straighten up gussie seemed to see nothing wrong she beamed at us both gareth was making pimms after dinner gussie dragged a very reluctant jeremy across the fields to look at a norman church and gareth and i were left on the boat together drinking brandy the night was very hot and still an owl hooted in a nearby spinney the first star flickered like a white moth in a dark blue sky gareth smoked a cigar to keep off the midges the wireless was playing beethovens third piano concerto if only it was jeremy sitting there i thought nevertheless id made such good progress that day i felt nothing could dim my happiness gareth got up flicked his cigar into the water and strolled over to the other side of the boat to stand looking at the darkening horizon hows your weekend of sun sex and sleep going i asked not quite as eventfully as yours he said he came and stood over me looking down at me huge against the sky suddenly my heart began to thump unpleasantly perhaps at last he was going to try his luck with me after all i want another drink i said getting quickly to my feet and wandering into the saloon gareth followed me arent you beginning to wonder why i havent made a pass at you i turned round since you seem quite incapable of passing anyone up it had crossed my mind he looked at me for a minute and then grinned because i dont like bitches and youre the biggest bitch ive ever met wham i let him have it slap across the cheek he didnt flinch he didnt even put his hand up to his face and that seems to substantiate my theory he said pulling a packet of cigarettes out of his hip pocket and offering me one i shook my head dumbly appalled at what i had done he selected a cigarette carefully and then lit it youre not really my type he went on i like my women gentle and loving soft and tender women so vulnerable i want to protect them just as id look after a kitten or a little girl lost in the street women who dont automatically expect me to love them more than they love me maybe once upon a time before everyone started spoiling you you were like that but not any more youre so hard now lovely they could cut a diamond on you how dare you speak to me like that i said furiously because im probably the first man youve ever met whos been left completely cold by you ive met your sort before youre just a prick teaser or what the french call an allumeuse more anxious to inflame men than gratify them once theyre well and truly hooked you give off so much promise with that marvellous body and that great bright mane of hair falling over your eyes and youve got the most beautiful face ive ever seen but it doesnt add up to a thing because youre so much in love with yourself that there isnt room for anyone else shut up i said in a choked voice i dont want to listen and another thing he went on pouring a couple of fingers of brandy into his glass although youve probably seen more ceilings than michaelangelo i guess youve never got any pleasure out of all those men youve slept with and that troubles you a bit because youve read somewhere that sex is supposed to be rather enjoyable and you cant understand why it doesnt work for you it was like a nightmare stop it stop it i screamed you dont understand anything i was going to get married but he was killed in a car crash only a few months ago i know all about that he said softly tod was never going to marry you i clutched the table for support my legs seemed to give way you knew him i whispered i dont understand then you knew all about you long before i met you said gareth yes of course i did tod was living with an old girl friend of mine cathie summers they were fantastic together until you came along and broke it up i didnt break it up i whispered oh yes you did lovely you waited until cathied gone to the states for a week and then you moved in but it wasnt any good tod was fallible like most men but he saw through you pretty quickly youre wrong youre wrong he loved me far more than he did her he was with me the night he was killed gareth turned to me his eyes suddenly stony with contempt i know he was but as usual miss brennen myth brennen i ought to call you youre bending the facts tod and i had a drink in the antelope that night cathie was due back the next day and tod was in a panic about what shed say if she found out about you he was steeling himself to come round and tell you it was all off i told him not to bother just to let you stew but tod being an ethical sod insisted on going through with it thats right i stammered and the moment he saw me he realized it was me he loved not cathie and he was going to give her up youre a bloody liar said gareth tod left me in the pub at five to eleven he must have been with you by eleven oclock he was killed at ten past eleven driving like the devil to get away from you for a second i couldnt move or tear my eyes away from his then i gave a sob and fled out of the saloon down the passage to my cabin and throwing myself down on my bunk broke into a storm of weeping i couldnt stand it gareth knew tod he knew all about me hed looked into my mind and seen everything the aridity the desert the emptiness and hed brought to light terrible things id never admitted even to myself disproving lies that even i had begun to believe were the truth i cried and cried great tearing sobs until i thought there were no more tears inside me then i just lay there my face buried in my sodden pillow trembling with terror much later i heard jeremy and gussie come back oh god i thought in agony i expect gareths giving them a blowbyblow account of the whole incident they must have stayed up to watch the midnight movie because it was halfpast two before gareth came to bed octavia he said softly i didnt answer i ached for jeremy i wanted him to take me in his arms to caress and console me and reconcile me with myself i didnt sleep all night great waves of anguish kept sweeping over me i toyed with the idea of creeping off the boat before anyone was up and going back to london but how would i get there there wasnt a railway station for miles i suppose i could ring one of my boyfriends and ask them to drive down and collect me but would they id never doubted i could get a man back at the drop of a hat now suddenly i wasnt sure i was feeling so paranoid i could hardly get myself out of bed thank god id brought the biggest pair of dark glasses in the world with me in the kitchen jeremy and gussie were cooking breakfast if youve got a hangover like the rest of us said gussie theres some alka seltzer in the cupboard no i havent actually gussie poured me out a cup of coffee do you take sugar of course she doesnt shes quite sweet enough as it is said jeremy smiling at me he was so used to getting the comeon sign from me he seemed amazed i didnt crack back and when he handed me my cup his fingers closed over mine for a second yesterday i would have been certain he was trying to make contact with me now my selfconfidence had taken such a bashing i felt it must be accidental i took my coffee up on deck three vast pairs of pants and the biggest bra in the western hemisphere were dripping from the railing gussie had obviously been doing some washing a silver haze lay over the countryside pale green trees rose tender as lovers from the opposite bank i couldnt stop shaking amidst all this beauty and sunshine i felt like an empty shell a minute later gussie came and joined me what a beautiful shirt that is she said i do envy you tavy it doesnt matter if youve got a hangover or feel off colour youve got such a lovely figure and such marvellous hair people still think youre a knockout but with me my face is the only thing ive got and that isnt all that great and when that looks awful she squinted at herself in the cabin window like today with this spot ive got nothing to offer she looked down at her left hand and flashed her engagement ring in the sun jeremys wild about you she said wistfully he was teasing me yesterday saying that i was lucky id got his ring on my finger before he met you or heaven knows what would have happened i suddenly wondered what jeremy was playing at hes got no right to say that i said crossly he adores you youve only got to see the way he looks at you when you dont know hes looking she looked at me delighted do you really think so oh that does make me feel so much better you dont think me silly i shook my head and she went on i was convinced jeremyd fallen for you i was really screwed up about it thats why ive been eating so much lately not that i thought for a moment youd lead him on i mean youre one of my best friends at least you were at school i hope you still are but youre so beautiful i didnt see how he could help it and somehow you look so good together thats why when he suggested asking you down for the weekend i persuaded him to ask gareth as well gareths so attractive i thought you were bound to fancy him and that would put jeremy off god how naive she was i concentrated on lighting a cigarette oh why were my hands shaking so much i like jeremy enormously i said slowly hes extremely attractive too but i also think hes perfect for you im not sure hes perfect for me at all said gussie i think hell probably be wildly unfaithful to me but thats because underneath hes not very sure of himself and hell need to make passes at women from time to time just to boost his ego but i hope so long as i make him happy enough hell always come back to me in the end i looked at her round earnest face appalled but you cant marry him gus not thinking that oh yes i can i love him so much it hurts sometimes and i know itll kill me when he is unfaithful but at least i can try and make him more secure by loving him i looked at her in awe this was the sort of girl gareth was talking about last night fridays child loving and giving prepared to give far more than she took jeremy came up on deck his blond hair gleamed almost white from the sun instinctively i turned my head away i wish gareth would step on it he said wheres he gone to ring up some friends of his who live a few miles up the river said jeremy he thought we might take a drink off them he must have run out of ps by now here he comes said gussie gareth walked up the path whistling he grinned when he saw us wicked gypsy eyes narrowed against the sun he bounded up the bank and scorning the gangplank jumped across onto the boat he looked up at gussies underclothes on the line is that a signal he said england expects every man to do octavia did you get through snapped jeremy gareth nodded weve timed it very well theyre giving a party tonight they want us all to go the land at the back of their house slopes straight down to the river they suggested we tie up there about teatime then you two girls can have baths and tart up at your leisure how super said gussie but i havent got anything to wear will it be very smart i dont expect so anyway they can lend you something if it is i turned away my palms were damp with sweat the thought of a party terrified me drinks and noise and people i didnt know they would be gareths friends too probably as tough and flash and sarcastic as gareth himself he must have warned them about me already the tart with the heart of ice wed better get moving said jeremy ill start up the engine ill wash up i said diving into the kitchen no one had washed up last nights plates and as we were running short of water i had to wash everything in the same grey greasy liquid hi said a voice gareth was standing in the doorway i stiffened and concentrated hard on the bubbles of yellow fat floating on top of the washingup water hullo i said with studied lightness i was determined to show him that yesterdays showdown hadnt bothered me in the least he came and put his hand on my shoulder i jumped away as though hed burnt me easy now he said i only wanted to apologize for last night not for what i said because it needed saying but i should have put it more tactfully if you think anything you said last night had any effect on me youre very much mistaken i said in a stifled voice damn were out of quix with a swift movement he took off my dark glasses dont dont you dare i spat at him i didnt want him to see how red and puffed my eyes were with crying all in good time he said he had me cornered now god he was big his very size in that kitchen was stifling overpowering i backed away against the draining board looking down at my hands trembling with humiliation why do you keep bullying me i whispered id done that trick before letting my breasts rise and fall very fast in simulated emotion but now i found i couldnt stop myself gareth put his hand under my chin and forced it upwards for an insane panicky moment i wondered whether to bite him anything to drive him away to destroy this suffocating nearness then he let go of me and handed me back my dark glasses you can actually look ugly he said in surprise i dont know why but i find that very encouraging gareth shouted jeremy can you come and open the lock gates just coming gareth shouted he turned as he went up the steps dont forget its your turn to put on the chefs hat and cook us lunch that was all i needed i opened the door of the fridge and the baleful eye of a huge chicken peered out at me how the hell did one cook the beastly thing gussie popped her head through the door gareth says youre going to cook lunch how lovely ill truss the chicken for you if you like and then you can make that thing you made us the other night theres masses of cream and lemon juice in the fridge shed only just had breakfast and her mouth was watering already thank you i said weakly why oh why had i been so foolish as to pass luigis haute cuisine off as my own last week i go hot and cold every time i remember that lunch i got in such a muddle that we didnt eat until three oclock by which time the others were absolutely starving i shall never forget their hungry flushed faces turning gradually to dismay as they sat down to eat and realized the chicken was burnt to a frazzle the sauce was curdled past redemption and the spinach boiled away to a few gritty stalks but the potatoes were the worst disaster because i hadnt realized you had to roast them longer than twenty minutes they were hard as bullets its a pity we havent got a twelve bore on board said gareth then we could have spent the afternoon shooting pigeons with them its absolutely delicious said gussie chewing valiantly away at a piece of impossibly dry chicken jeremy said nothing gareth laughed himself sick he didnt even make any attempt to eat just lit a cigar blew smoke over everyone and said at last he understood why gussie was always going on about the importance of having a good breakfast i escaped on deck and sat there gazing at the pink rose petals drifting across the khaki water the panic and terror of the morning were fast hardening into hatred against gareth once and for all i was going to get even with him jeremy came and sat down beside me whats the matter he asked gently nothing i said i get these blinding migraines sometimes they make me completely stupid im sorry i loused up lunch hell that doesnt matter we should never have let you do all the cooking why didnt you tell us you were feeling awful i smiled up at him itll go soon do we have to go to this party tonight of course not if you dont want to i rather fancy going just for the sake of going into a room with you and everyone thinking you belong to me you win i said he took my hand do you still dislike gareth that much is it that obvious he nodded a bit he caught at a leaf of an overhanging tree gus gets some funny ideas she thinks youre very mixed up beneath the panache and the sophistication she says you need someone like gareth to sort you out how kind of gussie to be so concerned with my welfare i said trying to keep the tremble of anger out of my voice there was a burst of laughter from the other end of the boat such was my paranoia i was convinced gussie and gareth were talking about me would you make me any different i asked looking deep into jeremys eyes id just like to make you he said lets not bother about irrelevancies its the same old story i thought as i did my face before we went ashore now hes really pursuing me i dont want him so much the intensity and lust in his eyes had me frightened i had a feeling i might have got a tiger by the tail my thoughts turned to gussie and gareth insecure unhappy mixedup frigid hard enough to cut a diamond on they were having a fieldday passing judgements on me how dare that fat slob gussie patronize me how dare gareth take it upon himself to tell me so many home truths the chips were down if they thought i was a bitch all right i was going to behave like one chapter eleven later in the afternoon as we went across water meadows into a large orchard we could see a queen anne house through the trees what are these people called asked gussie hamilton said gareth hesketh and bridget theyve got hordes of children but i dont know if any of them are at home gussie picked a scarlet cherry up from the long grass and theyre nice nice but perfectly crazy said gareth hesketh has madness on one side of the family and a rumanian grandmother on the other so you never know what to expect i bet theyre hell i whispered to jeremy but they werent hell they were a gently unworldly middleaged couple hesketh hamilton was tall and thin with spectacles on the end of his nose he had been gardening and was wearing faded blue dungarees and a kind of mauve and white striped baseball cap on his head to keep off the sun his wife had straggly pepper and salt hair drawn back into a bun and eyes the colour of faded denim she was wearing odd shoes and an old felt skirt covered in dog hairs they were both obviously delighted to see gareth the house was beautiful but terribly untidy with books and papers everywhere it didnt look as though anyone could possibly be giving a party that night the afternoon sun slanting through the drawingroom window showed thick layers of dust on everything assorted dogs lay on the carpet panting from the heat well have tea in the garden said bridget hamilton you can come into the kitchen and help me carry the tray gareth i want you to tell me if heskeths got enough drink for this evening we seem to have asked rather a lot of people out in the garden the lawn sloped down to a magnificent herbaceous border through an iron archway swarming with red roses deckchairs and a table were set out under a walnut tree gussie as usual went berserk gushing like an oil well what a fantastic garden my mother would be green with envy look at those roses and those fabulous blue hollyhocks theyre delphiniums said hesketh hamilton gently oh yes said gussie unabashed and that heavenly catmint i love the smell it always reminds me of oversexed tomcats hesketh said smiling its so kind of you to let us all come to your party said gussie sitting down and putting a very severe strain on a deckchair she ought to be rechristened gushie i thought savagely gareth came across the lawn carrying a tray his eyes slanting away from the smoke of his cigar youve got enough drink in hesketh to float the qe he said bridget hamilton her hands still covered in earth from gardening poured black tea into chipped mugs and handed sandwiches round how many of the children are home asked gareth only lorna and she doesnt know youre all coming shes taken her new horse out absolute madness in this heat shes not such a child now you know gareth shell be eighteen in august gareth grinned i know i hope youve been keeping her on ice for me he helped himself to a cucumber sandwich as big as a doorstep im starving he gave an unpleasant smile in my direction i dont know why but i couldnt eat a thing at lunchtime bridget hamilton turned to me and what do you do in london you look like a model or an actress or something shes quite unemployable said gareth bridget looked reproving i see youre as rude as ever gareth she smiled at me i never worked in my life until i got married anyway i expect you meet lots of interesting people yes i do i said she sighed the one id like to meet is britt ekland so charming looking wouldnt you like to meet britt ekland hesketh whos he said hesketh inevitably there was a good deal of laughter at this and bridget hamilton was just explaining hes a she hesketh hes a she when a door slammed and there was a sound of running foot steps and a girl exploded through the french windows she was as slim as a blade in jodhpurs and a red silk shirt with a mass of curly hair and a freckled laughing face her eyes lighted on gareth and she gave a squeal of delight gareth what are you doing here how lovely to see you gareth levered himself out of the deckchair and took both of her hands and stared at her for a long time but youve grown so beautiful lorna she flushed oh golly have i really turned into a swan at last a fullyfledged paidup member he said bending forward and kissing her smooth brown cheek there was not much more he could do with us all watching him but i had the feeling he wanted to take her into his arms and kiss the life out of her you might acknowledge someone else darling grumbled her mother oh im sorry the girl beamed at the rest of us im lorna its just that im so pleased to see gareth you will stay for the party wont you she added anxiously i suppose we ought to think about washing a few glasses and rolling up the carpet said hesketh hamilton i must wash my hair said bridget its the only way ill get the garden out of my nails arent they complete originals said gussie as she and i changed later she was wandering around in the nude trying to look at her back between her fiery red legs and shoulders her skin was as white as lard im not peeling am i she asked anxiously it itches like mad looks a bit angry i said pleased to see that a few tiny white blisters had formed between her shoulders itd be coming off her in strips tomorrow isnt that girl lorna quite devastating she went on you could see gareth wanted to absolutely gobble her up shes not that marvellous i said starting to pour water over my hair oh but she is quite lovely and so natural think of being seventeen again all the things one was going to do the books one was going to write the places one was going to visit i must say when a girl is beautiful at seventeen she gets a glow about her that old hags like you and i in our twenties can never hope to achieve speak for yourself i muttered into the washbasin i knew when i finally finished doing my face that id never looked better my eyes glittered brilliantly blue in my suntanned face my hair newly washed and straight was almost white from the sun gussie im glad to say looked terrible she was leaning out of the window when there was a crunch of wheels on the gravel outside oh look someones arriving its the vicar were obviously in for a wild evening i said wed better go down shall i wait no ill be ready in a minute you go on i was glad when shed gone i thought she might kick up a fuss at the dress i was going to wear it was a short tunic in silver chain mail the holes as big as halfcrowns highnecked at the front it swooped to positive indecency at the back two very inadequate circles of silver sequins covered my breasts i didnt wear anything underneath except a pair of fleshcoloured pants which gave the impression i wasnt wearing anything at all slowly i put it on thinking all the time of the effect it would have on jeremy when i walked into the sedate country living room i gave a final brush to my hair and turned to look in the mirror it was the first time id worn it with all my party warpaint and the impact made even me catch my breath oh my said i to myself youre going to set them by their country ears tonight i was determined to make an entrance so i fiddled with my hair until i could hear that more people had arrived there was a hush as i walked into the drawingroom everyone gazed at me mens hands fluttered up to straighten their ties and smooth their hair the women stared at me with illconcealed envy and disapproval christ i heard jeremy say in appalled wonder but i was looking at gareth for the first time i saw a blaze of disapproval in his eyes ive got under his guard at last i thought in triumph there seemed to be no common denominator among the guests they consisted of old blimps and tabby cats several dons from the university and their illdressed wives a handful of people of lornas age the girls very debbie the boys very wet and a crowd of tough hunting types with braying voices and brick red faces it was as though the hamiltons had asked everyone they knew and liked with a total disregard as to whether theyd mix i wandered towards jeremy gussie and gareth i see youve thrown yourself open to the public said gareth but he didnt smile i suppose id better go and hand round some drinks you shouldnt have worn that dress octavia said gussie in a shocked voice this isnt london you know thats only too obvious i said looking round bridget hamilton came over and took my arm how enchanting you look octavia do come and devastate our local mfh hes dying to meet you he wasnt the only one once those hunting types had had a few drinks they all closed in on me vying for my attention over and over again i let my glass be filled up never had my wit been more malicious or more sparkling i kept them all in fits of braying laughter like an experienced comedian although i was keeping my audience happy i was very conscious of what was going on in the wings jeremy looking like a thundercloud because i was flirting so outrageously with other men gareth behaving like the hamiltons future soninlaw whether he was coping with drinks or smiling into lornas eyes every so often however his eyes flickered in my direction and his face hardened about ten oclock bridget hamilton wandered in very red in the face and carrying two saucepans and plonked them down on a long polished table beside a pile of plates and forks theres risotto here she said vaguely if anyones hungry people surged forward to eat i stayed put the men around me stayed put as well the din we were making increased until gareth pushed his way through the crowd you ought to eat something octavia he said i shook my head and smiled up at him insolently arent you hungry drawled the mfh who was lounging beside me i turned to him smiling sweetly only for you a nearby group of women stopped filling their faces with risotto and talking about nappies and looked at me in horror the mfhs wife was among them she had a face like a wellbred cod the young gels of today are not the same as they were twenty years ago she said loudly of course theyre not i shouted across at her twenty years ago i was only six you must expect some change in my appearance and behaviour she turned puce with anger at the roar of laughter that greeted this gareth didnt laugh he took hold of my arm i think youd better come and eat he said in even tones ive told you once i snapped i dont want to eat i want to dance why doesnt someone put on the record player the mfh looked down at the circles of silver sequins what happens to those when you dance i giggled now you see me now you dont theyve been known to shift off centre there was another roar of laughter well what are we waiting for said the mfh lets put a record on and dance all right i said looking up at him under my lashes but i must go to the loo first upstairs in the bathroom i hardly recognized myself i looked like some maenad my hair tousled my eyes glittering my cheeks flushed god the dress was so beautiful and youre so beautiful too i added and leaning forward lightly kissed my reflection in the mirror even in my alcoholic state i was slightly abashed when i turned round and saw gareth standing watching me from the doorway dont you know its rude to stare i said he didnt move id like to come past if you dont mind i went on oh no you dont he said grabbing my wrist oh yes i do i screamed trying to tug myself away will you stop behaving like a whore he swore at me and pulling me into the nearest bedroom threw me on the bed and locked the door now i suppose youre going to treat me like a whore i spat at him what will your precious lorna say if she catches us here together suddenly i was frightened there was murder in his eyes its about time someone taught you a lesson he said coming towards me and im afraid its going to be me before i realized it gareth had me across his knee ive never known what living daylights were before but he was certainly beating them out of me now i started to scream and kick shut up he said viciously no one can hear you the record player was still booming downstairs i struggled and tried to bite him but he was far too strong for me it was not the pain so much as the ghastly indignity it seemed to go on for ever and ever finally he tipped me on to the floor i lay there trembling with fear get up he said brusquely and get your things together im taking you back to the boat the moon hung over the river whitening the mist that floated transparent above the sleeping fields stars were crowding the blueblack sky the air was heavy with the scent of meadowsweet aching in every bone biting my lip to stop myself crying i let gareth lead me across the fields every few moments i stumbled held up only by his vicelike grip on my arm i think he felt at any moment i might bolt back to the party once we were on deck i said now you can go back to your darling teenager not until youre safe in bed i lay down on my bunk still in my dress but when i shut my eyes the world was going round and round i quickly opened them gareth stood watching me through cigar smoke i shut my eyes again a great wave of nausea rolled over me oh god i said trying to get out of bed stay where you are he snapped i ought to be allowed to get out of my own bed i said petulantly i agree in your mary whitehouse role youre quite entitled to stop me getting into other peoples beds but a person should be free to get out of her own bed if she wants to stop fooling around said gareth i cant i said in desperation im going to be sick he only just got me to the edge of the boat in time and i was sicker than ive ever been in my life i couldnt stop this terrible retching and then because gareth was holding my head i couldnt stop crying from humiliation leave me alone i sobbed in misery leave me alone to die gussie and jeremyll be back in a minute please go and keep them away for a bit longer they wont be back for hours said gareth looking at his watch can i have a drink of water not yet itll only make you throw up again youll just have to grin and bear it i looked up at the huge white moon and gave a hollow laugh it couldnt be a more romantic night could it in the passage my knees gave way and gareth picked me up carried me into the cabin and put me to bed as deftly as if id been a child he gave me a couple of pills theyll put you to sleep i wasnt actually planning to meet jeremy on deck tonight i was shivering like a puppy im sorry i said rolling my head back and forth on the pillow im so terribly sorry lie still he said the pillsll work soon dont go i whispered as he stood up and went to the door his face was expressionless as he looked at me no scorn no mockery not even a trace of pity im going to get you some more blankets he said i dont want you catching cold that sudden kindness the first hed ever shown me brought tears to my eyes i was beginning to feel drowsy by the time he came back with two rugs they smelt musty and as i watched his hands tucking them in powerful hands with black hairs on the back i suddenly wanted to feel his arms around me and to feel those hands soothing me and petting me as though i were a child again in a flash i saw him as the father strict yet loving and caring that all my life id missed someone to say stop when i went too far someone to mind if i behaved badly to be proud if i behaved well getting sleepy he asked i nodded good girl youll be all right in the morning im sorry i wrecked your party doesnt matter theyre nice though the hamiltons you should mix with more people like them theyve got the right values how did you meet them he began to tell me but i started getting confused and the soft welsh voice became mingled with the water lapping against the boat then i drifted into unconsciousness chapter twelve when i woke next morning i felt overwhelmed with shame in the past when id got drunk id just shrugged it off as part of the octavia brennen image now i curled up at the thought of last nights performance barging in on those people half naked behaving atrociously abusing their hospitality and then the humiliation of gareth putting me across his knee and worst of all throwing up in front of him and having to be put to bed oh god i groaned in misery as i slowly pieced the evening together i cant face him yet at the thought of slipping off the boat unnoticed it suddenly hit me that if i did i might never see him again it was like a skewer jabbed into my heart oh no i whispered in horror it cant have happened i couldnt hate someone so passionately and then find overnight that hatred had turned into something quite different something that looked suspiciously like love i couldnt love him i couldnt he despised me and thought i was the biggest bitch going and the nightmare was that if we had been starting from scratch i could have pulled out the stops knocked him over with my looks even fooled him into thinking i was gentle and sweet id done it often enough before but now it was too late hed seen me unashamedly pursuing jeremy knew so many adverse things about me that i hadnt a hope where he was concerned it was funny really the biter bit at last finally i dragged myself out of bed a shooting star was erupting in my head waves of sickness swept over me my face was ashen when i looked in the mirror i was still wearing last nights makeup streaked with crying my mouth felt like a parrots cage i staggered down to the horrible dank loo which reeked of asparagus pee and wondered whether to be sick again even cleaning my teeth was an ordeal somehow i got dressed and crawled along to the kitchen gussie was cooking kippers of all things hullo she said you disappeared very suddenly last night gareth said you felt faint from the heat so he brought you home youre not pregnant or anything awful i smiled weakly and shook my head that was one problem i was spared what did the rest of you get up to i asked nothing much we stayed up very late dancing on the lawn it was so romantic in the moonlight then lorna came back and had a drink on the boat you were fast asleep by that time later gareth took her home we didnt hear him come in i felt sweat rising on my forehead the thought of gareth and lorna wandering back through the meadowsweet with that great moon pouring light on them drove me insane with jealousy the smell of those kippers was killing me suddenly i saw a pair of long legs coming down the steps im going on deck i said in a panic and bolted back through my cabin and the saloon out into the sunshine at the far end of the boat i sat down clutching my knees and gazing at the opposite bank a water rat came out stared at me with beady eyes and then shot back into its hole lucky thing i thought i wish i had a hole to crawl into the wild roses which had bloomed so beautifully yesterday were now withered by the sun and hung like tawdry party decorations that had been up too long i heard a step behind me and my heart started hammering i was appalled by the savagery of my disappointment when i realized it was only jeremy hullo he said sulkily sitting down beside me are you feeling better yes thank you gareth gets all the luck why dont you feel faint when im around i wouldnt have minded bringing you back here on your own and putting you to bed something in his voice pulled me up sharply i felt faint i snapped and im sure gareth made you feel better his restorative powers are notorious you know it wasnt like that i said angrily if two people absolutely dont fancy each other its gareth and me so you keep telling me he said im wondering if the lady isnt protesting a bit too much breakfasts ready said gareth appearing suddenly in the doorway i dont want any i said blushing scarlet and wondering how much of our conversation hed heard jeremy got to his feet ill come back and talk to you when ive had mine he said following gareth down the steps two minutes later gareth reappeared heres your breakfast he said dropping four alka seltzers into a glass of water he waited until the white discs had completely dissolved then handed me the glass thank you i muttered quite unable to meet his eyes im sorry about last night skip it he said everyone makes a bloody fool of themselves from time to time but you stopped everyone else finding out i thought id go back and tell everyone youd puked your guts out im not that much of a sod i looked at him for the first time he looked very tired there were dark rings under his eyes i wondered what he and lorna had been up to last night it was as though hed read my thought lornas coming over for lunch he said shes dying to meet you again shes still at the age when shes immensely impressed by beautiful women wow that was a backhander ill attempt not to disappoint her i said trying to keep the resentment out of my voice he laughed dont pout it doesnt suit you the alka seltzers eased my headache to a dull throb i wished it could have as easily cured my heart lorna arrived about twelvethirty shed taken a great deal of trouble with her appearance and was wearing a rust coloured tshirt which matched her hair she looked very pretty but somehow i thought shed looked more attractive when shed roared in on us unawares the day before hullo she said sitting down on the deck beside me im sorry we didnt have time to talk yesterday and that you felt horrible mummy always forgets to open any windows everyone was so disappointed you went all the men were wild about you and everyone who rang up to thank us this morning wanted to know who you were her voice was suddenly wistful the country hasnt seen anything as gorgeous as you in a hundred years suddenly i found myself liking her i realized there was no bitchy motive behind her remarks just genuine admiration im afraid my dress was a bit outré for the country i said i hope your parents didnt mind she shook her head violently oh no they thought you were wonderful its typical of gareth to turn up with someone like you i always knew he would in the end ive had a crush on him for years you see id always hoped hed wait for me but now hes got you oh no he hasnt i said quickly theres nothing between us at all wed never met before this weekend im gussies friend we were at school together you were her face brightened then you and gareth arent not at all he just discovered i was feeling bloody and brought me home oh she said happily that does cheer me up i do wish i could do something romantic like fainting when hes around but im far too healthy i laughed wryly she wouldnt have enjoyed what id endured last night mind you she went on confidingly he did kiss me on the way home last night but then i expect he kisses most girls the sun was making me feel sick again i moved into the shade she asked me endless questions about my life in london and the people i knew do you actually know mick jagger she couldnt hear enough about it im coming to london soon ive just finished a typing course and ive got to look for a job come and stay i was amazed to find myself saying my flats huge you can have a bed for as long as you like goodness she went all pink may i really itd be marvellous just for a few days until i find somewhere and i wonder could you tell me the best place to buy clothes i mean my mothers super but shes never been much help in that way a moment later when we were joined by the others she immediately told gareth id asked her to come and stay i expected him to discourage her but he merely said good idea why not why had i done it i wondered as i escaped to help with lunch was i trying to prove that i could be nice occasionally or was i unconsciously trying to impress gareth by getting on with one of his friends or was it merely that i wanted to keep some link with him however tenuous after tonight i had a great deal of difficulty forcing anything down at lunch i couldnt even smoke which is a sign of approaching death with me i was paralysed with shyness by gareths presence every time he looked at me i jerked my eyes away why couldnt i bring any of the old magic into play glancing sideways from under my lashes letting my hair fall over my eyes pulling up my skirt to show more leg leaning forward so he could see down my shirt which would always be buttoned a couple of inches too low overnight id suddenly become as gauche as a teenager i didnt even know what to do with my mouth like the first time one wears lipstick to make matters worse jeremy was watching me like a warder he no longer held any charm for me he was so anxious to please hed lost all the lazy takeitorleaveit manner that id found so irresistible a week ago immediately wed finished eating i leapt up to do the washing up anything to get away from that highly charged atmosphere leave it said jeremy for goodness sake octavia relax what a bore were going back to london tonight grumbled gussie its been such a lovely restful weekend a smile flickered across gareths face you must have so much planning to do for the wedding lorna said i love weddings jeremys leg suddenly pressed against mine i moved it away your hairs gone a fantastic colour in the sun he said is it natural i cant remember said gussie i was about to say yes id never admitted to anyone before that it was dyed when i caught gareths eye and for some strange reason changed my mind well lets say my hairdresser helps it along a bit gussie picked up a daisy chain shed been making the threaded flowers were already wilting on the table lorna looked out of the porthole at the heatsoaked landscape any moment one felt the dark trees might move towards us its like one of those days people remember as the end of something she said the last before the war the day the king died gussie split another daisy stalk open dont frighten me you make me think something frightful will happen tonight a mulberrycoloured cloud had hidden the sun i think its going to thunder said jeremy gussie put the daisy chain over his head it was too small and rested like a coronet on his blond hair he pushed it away irritably oh youve broken it wailed gussie i couldnt stand the tension any longer i got to my feet and stretched where are you off to said gussie im going to wander upstream well come with you said jeremy standing up no i said sharply then tried to make a joke of it i like walking by myself i feel my greta garbo mood coming on were going to lornas parents for tea said gussie i didnt join them as i wandered through the meadows i tried to sort out what i really felt its the heat and the proximity i kept telling myself youve fallen for gareth because hes the first man to pull you up its a challenge because he doesnt fancy you just as jeremy was a challenge until youd hooked him but it was no good wanting jeremy had been but a childs caprice for a forbidden toy nothing compared with the desperate need i felt for gareth i wandered for miles and then sat down under a tree i must have dozed off for the shadows were lengthening when i woke up i couldnt face tea with the hamiltons teacups balanced on our knees having post mortems about the party so i went back to the boat no one was about i packed my suitcases tidied the saloon and washed up lunch i was behaving so well id be qualifying for my girl guide badge at this rate then i heard footsteps and someone jumping on to the deck i gave a shiver of excitement as a tall figure appeared in the doorway but it was only jeremy once more i felt that crippling kick of disappointment why didnt you turn up for tea ive been worried about you there was a predatory look in his eyes that suddenly had me scared and on my guard i fell asleep and when i woke up i realized it was late so i came back here and by telepathy i knew and followed you he said are the others coming not for ages gussies discovered a grand piano so shes happy strumming away gareth and lorna have gone off for a walk together my nails were cutting into the palms of my hands last night gareth had kissed her god knows what else he might get up to on a hot summer afternoon i picked up some glasses where are you going asked jeremy putting these away for a second he barred my way then stood aside and followed me through into the saloon very slowly i stacked the glasses in the cupboard when i turned round he was standing just behind me he put his hands on my arms no i said sharply no what i havent done anything yet then let me go the hell i will his fingers tightened on my arms i want you he said ever since i first saw you ive been burning up with wanting you what about gussie i asked feebly we were going to wait till we got back to london oh come on now you of all people dont give a damn about gussie and at this moment in time neither do i he bent his head and kissed me forcing my mouth open with his tongue no i struggled completely revolted no no no shut up he said dont play the little hypocrite with me we all know your reputation darling you wanted me dont pretend you didnt and now youre going to get me hot and strong desperately i tried to pull away from him let me go i screamed but he only laughed and forced me back on to one of the bench seats shutting my protesting mouth with his tearing at the buttons of my shirt suddenly a door opened knock it off you two said a voice of ice jeremy sprang away from me what the fuck for gods sake pull yourself together gussies just coming said gareth but it was too late gussie came bouncing into the saloon darling love i missed you hullo tavy did you get lost then with agonizing slowness she took in the situation looking at my rumpled hair and torn shirt the buttons of which i was frenziedly trying to do up the smeared lipstick on jeremys face the chair knocked over the papers strewn all over the floor there was a ghastly pause octavia she whispered in horror you of all people how could you you swore you werent interested in jeremy i thought you were a friend of mine and as for you she turned to jeremy dont you think i want to marry you after this she tugged at her engagement ring but it wouldnt come off finally she gave a little sob and fled out of the cabin go after her said gareth say youre sorry that it didnt mean anything at once he rapped out at jeremy i collapsed into a chair my heart pounding my face in my hands oh my god how terrible and you can belt up gareth snarled at me youve done enough damage for one afternoon i tried to stop him really i did dont give me that theres no need to explain yourself you were just running true to form and he walked out of the saloon slamming the door behind him the awful thing was that we still had to pack up the boat and lorna had to drive us to the original mooring twenty miles away where jeremy and gareth had parked their cars gussie insisted on sitting in the back with gareth and sobbing all the way jeremy and i loathing each others guts had to sit in front with lorna when we finally got to where the cars were parked gussie refused to drive back to london with jeremy gareth didnt even say goodbye god how ironic i thought miserably its worked out exactly as i planned it should gussie and jeremy breaking up and jeremy driving me back to london but instead of being in each others arms we were at each others throats jeremy looked grey beneath his suntan all the bravado and panache seemed to be knocked out of him the trees by the roadside fell away and rushed back in clumps youve got to talk to gussie said jeremy tell her it was all your fault all right i admit i tried to pull you this afternoon but my god i had provocation i know you did i said listlessly im sorry i thought i wanted you so much then when it came to the crunch i found i didnt after all yeah well its the same with me i was crazy about you but now i realize im in danger of losing gus it all seems a terrible mistake its the illwind department i suppose takes a jolt like this to make you realize how much you really need someone shes so straight gus id seldom seen a man more shattered tell her it was your doing he pleaded tell her how much you led me on its no skin off your nose all right i said ill talk to her but its no good trying to see her until tomorrow chapter thirteen on the day after we got back to london i tried to ring gussie several times at the office finally they admitted she hadnt come in so i went round to her flat it was a typical girls flat unwashed cups and overflowing ashtrays everywhere and three halfunpacked suitcases in the drawingroom i removed a grubby white bra and a brown apple core from one of the armchairs and sat down what do you want asked gussie she was still in her dressing gown and her face was swollen with crying to explain about jeremy i said i dont want any of your lies she said but youve got to listen it was all my fault you see from the beginning i took one look at jeremy that first night at arabellas and he was so beautiful i decided i must get him away from you at all costs i never wanted anyone so much in all my life so i pulled out all the stops making eyes at him admitting to his face that i fancied him wandering round with only a towel falling off me arranging to meet him on deck after youd gone to sleep he didnt stand a chance she looked at me in horror you actually went out of your way to get him i nodded i made an absolutely dead set that evening at the hamiltons party i went on lying now when i got drunk and behaved so badly it was only because i was furious with jeremy because he wasnt reacting at all but what happened yesterday i was sulking by myself on the boat when jeremy turned up worried id been gone for such a long time and well i sort of tried to seduce him and thats when gareth and i came in thats right i got up and wandered over to the window any man would have been flattered by being pursued so relentlessly it was just the heat and being cooped up on the boat together hell he only kissed me anyway he loves you he does really he was absolutely demented on the way home last night gussie pulled at a wispy bit of hair he was she said dully anyway i went on you said the other day on the boat that you expected him to be unfaithful to you and youd always forgive him i know i did said gussie with a sob but one says such stupid things in theory and theyre so horrible when they happen in practice i went over and put my arm round her please dont cry gussie dont touch me she hissed i was thinking about you all last night youre wicked youve always been wicked ever since we were at school together youve resented my friends and tried to take them away from me and now youve stolen the most precious thing i ever had why do you do it youre so beautiful you can have any man you choose because ive always been jealous of you i said slowly echoing gareths words because in spite of my yellow hair and my long legs people have always liked you more than they liked me there was a pause i suppose it was kind of you to come and tell me all this she said in a set little voice it does make a difference i had a long talk to gareth last night what did he say i tried to keep my voice expressionless that jeremy was basically a lightweight that id do better to cut my losses and pack him in he said you may have encouraged jeremy in the beginning but on reflection he guessed that he was only too ready to be distracted and that it was jeremy who forced the pace yesterday he said marriage to jeremy would be one long string of infidelities and he was only marrying me for security and for my money but thats brutal i gasped isnt it but thats the thing i like about gareth he tells the truth about things that matter did he say anything else i said numbly about me i mean not much he agreed with me that if you really set your cap at someone it would be almost impossible to resist you i bit my lip im sorry its not so easy for me gussie said playing with the tassel of her dressing gown i dont get boyfriends very easily jeremy was the first man who ever said he loved me i cant go to a party tomorrow like you can and pick up a new man just like that i cant walk down the street and be caressed and comforted by the admiration in mens eyes you havent a clue what its like not having any sex appeal with you its only a question of time i may never meet another man who wants to marry me i felt a flash of irritation why the hell didnt she go on a diet then i felt guilty will you ever be able to forgive me i dont know not now perhaps in a few weeks i shall feel differently i went towards the door will you see jeremy if he turns up here she burst into tears oh yes of course i will it was only when i left her that the full desolation of my situation hit me since wed left the boat i had been numb with misery as though id put my heart in deep freeze until i had straightened the account with gussie and jeremy now i had to face up to the future to the agony of loving a man who hated and despised me who would despise me even more once he heard what i had told gussie for the next few days i was on the rack i never believed it was possible to suffer so much pride despair and longing chased each other monotonously around my head i cried all night and at the slightest provocation during the day over and over again i wandered down to the river and wondered whether to jump in a thousand times i started letters to gareth pleading my case but each time i tore them up my case was so hopeless i couldnt even take refuge in daydreams most evenings i borrowed my landlords car drove it across london and lay in wait outside gareths house but there were never any lights on and i used to turn the engine off and cry uncontrollably chapter fourteen the blistering hot weather continued to grip london by the throat outside my flat green park was fast losing its greenness the plane trees were coated in thick grey dust the grass bleached to a lifeless yellow commuters wilted silently at the bus stops two mondays after we got back from the boat i was woken by the doorbell ringing on and on wrapping a towel round me i waded through the post which was scattered over the carpet and consisted entirely of brown envelopes i peered through the spyhole in a blind hope it might be gareth but it was only a thin youth with a moustache and ears like the fa cup wearing a crumpled suit and a battery of fountain pens in his breast pocket he obviously had no intention of getting off that bell i opened the door he looked at me wearily miss brennen no i said i knew the tricks of old but miss brennen lives here sure she does but shes abroad at the moment can i help you its about her income tax returns weve written to her repeatedly the matter is getting rather urgent oh dear i said sympathetically im sure shes not avoiding you deliberately shes just rather vague where income tax is concerned lots of people become very vague when its a matter of paying it he said his weary eyes travelling over my body when are you expecting her back shes gone to the bahamas i said after that i think shes flying on to new york shes got a lot of friends there she didnt say when she was coming back were interested in a sum of money she earned doing a commercial for herbert revson thank god he was looking at my legs or he would have seen how green id gone but that was three years ago i stammered and in america yes but she was paid by their english subsidiary who of course declared it poor octavia i said faintly have you any idea how much she owes well he said confidingly we dont usually disclose figures he was obviously crazy for me to disclose mine but i think it wouldnt be much under five figures she didnt by any chance leave a forwarding address did she no she didnt theres the telephone i must go and answer it i said firmly shutting the door in his face ten thousand pounds where the hell was i going to get that kind of money bleating with terror i ran to answer the telephone crossing my fingers once again that by some miracle it might be gareth but it was xander id only talked to him briefly since i got back hed been busy so i hadnt told him about gareth i was sure i wanted to i couldnt bear for him not to take it seriously oh how lovely to hear you i said you probably wont think so when you hear the news he said hugh massinghams dead what i sat down on the bed heart attack at the weekend hed been playing tennis said xander oh god how awful kind handsome indolent sensual easygoing massingham xanders patron and boss my friend hes always been so generous to both of us and taken care of all my bills it didnt seem possible i cant bear it i whispered the tears beginning to roll down my cheeks terrible isnt it i really loved that guy but darling im afraid that isnt all theres trouble at mill rickys been going through the books with a toothcomb and smelling salts and the skeletons have been absolutely trooping out of the cupboard this years figures are catastrophic shares have hit rock bottom orders are right down unfortunately expenses particularly yours and mine are right up he sounded in a real panic rickys called an emergency department head meeting for tomorrow at three oclock he wants you there as well whatever for well theres a bit of aggro over your flat and all the bills weve run up between us and theres the car too i think wed better have a session tonight and see how many bills we can rustle up he went on trying to sound reassuring all right i said come round after work it seemed hardly the time to tell him about my income tax bill actually xander went on its a good thing poor hugh did kick the bucket when he did rickyd already made plans to replace him did hugh know dont think so but its certainly made rickys task easier hes bringing in this new whizz kid over everyones heads to get us out of the wood do you think hell be able to you should know darling its your friend gareth llewellyn i lay back on my bed holding my burning face in my hands all thoughts of massingham ten grand tax bills and fiddled expenses forgotten why why why had gareth done it hed got far too much on his plate as it was why should he take on another directorship was it for power or financial gain or just to get his fingers into another industrial pie could it just possibly be that he wanted to see me again or much more likely that hed got it in for me and wanted to cut me to ribbons whatever the reason in just over twentyfour hours id see him again in the evening xander and i spent two fruitless hours trying to sort out our expenses then gave up i set my alarm clock for eleven the next day to give me plenty of time to get ready even so i panicked round trying on one dress after another its strange how ones wardrobe tells the story of ones past there was the cornflower blue midi id bought to ensnare jeremy the backless black that had inflamed ricardo the gold pyjama suit that had brought charlie literally to his knees with a proposal and lying on the cupboard floor spurned and never worn again was the grey dress that had failed to detach that french racing driver from his wife at a ball in paris last winter what could i possibly wear to win over gareth hed said he liked his women gentle unspoilt and vulnerable i put on a white dress bought for ascot last year but never worn it was very garden party with a full skirt long sleeves and a ruffled lowcut neckline which showed off my suntan and i hoped made me look innocent and fragile i had to make a hole in the material to do the belt up tight enough my eyelids after a fortnights crying were the only part of me that hadnt lost weight i hid them behind tinted spectacles i arrived at seafordbrennens head office to find everyone in a jittering state of expectancy yesterdays shock over massinghams death had given way to excitement over gareths arrival the secretaries had seen his picture on the financial pages they knew he was rich successful attractive and most important of all single they had all washed their hair and tarted themselves up to the nines the offices as i walked through smelt like harrods scent department not a paper was out of place i encountered some hostile stares why did i have to come swanning in to steal their thunder the seafordbrennen boardroom with its dove grey carpet panelled walls and family portraits was discretion itself xander was the only person in there sitting halfway down the huge polished table directly beneath the portrait of my father their two bored handsome restless faces were so much alike xander was chewing gum and drawing a rugger player on his pad hullo angel he said in a slurred voice as i slipped into the seat beside him the condemned board is still out eating a hearty lunch this place is in an incredible state of twitch even the messenger boys are on tranquillizers rickys already been on to me this morning breathing fire about expenses you must keep bills i said im already keeping a pamela what would i want with a bill oh god i thought hes smashed out of his mind he must be chewing gum to conceal the whisky fumes what happened after you left me i said i went out and dined not wisely but too well with a friend and things escalated from there did you get to bed well not to my own bed certainly he tried to rest an elbow on the table but it slid off the door opened and miss billings the senior secretary came in fussing around moving memo pads straightening pencils a great waft of devon violets nearly asphyxiated us you ought to put a bit more pledge at the top of the table said xander reprovingly and im rather surprised you havent laid on a red carpet and a band playing land of my fathers mr llewellyn is used to the best of everything you know miss billings clicked her tongue disapprovingly and bustled out beads flying next moment she was back with tommy lloyd the sales director do you think we ought to put flowers in the middle of the table she asked a bunch of leeks would be more appropriate said xander tommy lloyd gave him a thin smile he tolerated xander but didnt like him an old wellingtonian with a bristling grey moustache ramrod straight back and clipped military voice he had been in next succession after massingham his redveined nose must be truly out of joint at gareths arrival he was followed by peter hocking who was in charge of production and just about as inspiring as a flat bottle of tonic and old harry somerville his false teeth rattling with nerves whod been with the firm since he was sixteen and was still treated by everyone as though he was a messenger boy gradually the rest of the chairs were taken up by departmental heads flushed by lunch who greeted me with a good deal less enthusiasm than usual a far cry from the fawning sycophancy when my father was alive there was desultory talk of our chances of winning the test match peter hocking was boring harry somerville with a recipe for homemade wine but on the whole everyone was strangely quiet and kept glancing at their watches or the door when all else fails go to wales said xander i feel exactly as though im about to go over niagara falls in a barrel have you got a cigarette i seem to have run out i gave him one and having opened my bag took the opportunity to powder my nose and put on some more scent my hand was shaking so much i put on far too much the smell of miss dior wafting through the room clashed vilely with the devon violets never mind said xander at least it will cover up the smell of congealed blood and rotting corpses he seemed strangely elated hed always liked novelty there were little red patches along his cheekbones the waiting got worse everyones shirt collars were getting too tight miss billings sat on the right of the top of the table flicking the elastic band which held back the pages on which she had already taken shorthand that day we all jumped when the telephone rang tommy lloyd answered downstairs are they good well no doubt rickyll bring them up miss billings will you go and meet them at the lift the enemy are at the gates said xander still drawing rugger players on his memo pad the barbarian hoards are coming i suppose wed better lie back and enjoy it there was a spurt of nervous laughter round the room which died quickly away as the door opened they came in like the magnificent four ricky smirking as though he was carrying a very large bone followed by gareth and a huge massiveshouldered wrestler of a man in a white suit bringing up the rear was annabel smith she was wearing a very simple black suit and her conkercoloured hair was drawn back in a chignon the dead silence that followed was a tribute to her beauty suddenly i felt silly in my white dress like a deb whod been left out in the rain i was so wracked with longing and shyness it was a second before i could bring myself to look at gareth he was wearing a light grey suit dark blue shirt and tie id never seen him so formally dressed his heavy face had lost most of its suntan and looked shadowed and tired he didnt glance in my direction everyone sat down except ricky who stood for a minute looking silently round the table as if counting the house shall i bring in coffee now said miss billings fussily i dont think we need it thank you he said and you neednt bother to stay either miss billings mrs smith is going to take the minutes displaying the same sort of enraged reluctance as a cat shoved out in a rainstorm miss billings was despatched from the room any minute i expected her to appear at the window mewing furiously ricky cleared his throat gentlemen i just want to introduce mr llewellyn whom im sure you all know by repute hes brought with him his right hand man mr morgan the massive wrestler nodded at us unsmilingly and his very charming personal assistant mrs smith who together have been responsible for so much of mr llewellyns success mrs smith gave everyone the benefit of her pussycat smile round the table a few faces brightened mrs smiths legs were a much better reason for staying awake in meetings than miss billings although mr llewellyn has come in at very short notice ricky went on as your new he paused on the word overall director he has as you know many other commitments so we mustnt expect to monopolize too much of his time he has however been examining the structure of seafordbrennens for some weeks and has come up with some very useful suggestions but nothing for anyone to get alarmed about what about hugh massingham said xanders slurred voice everyone looked round in horror as though one of the portraits had spoken there was an embarrassed pause xander went on carefully putting the stripes on a rugger shirt i didnt dare look at gareth i was just coming to that said ricky with a slight edge in his voice i know how upset you must all be over hughs death as a close personal friend and a colleague for many years i know how much im going to miss him and how our sympathy goes out to his widow and family i hope as many of you as possible will go to the memorial service on the th in the meantime he said going into top gear with relief it was vital to restore public confidence immediately and prevent a further fall on the stock market so we invited mr llewellyn to join the board to avoid any further interruption from xander he hastily started introducing gareth round the table tommy lloyd shook hands but was obviously bristling with antagonism nor did any of the other department heads look particularly friendly poor gareth he was obviously in for a rough ride it seemed an eternity before they came to me i was sure the whole room could hear my heart hammering you know octavia said ricky gareths eyes were on me they were hard and flinty without trace of the former laughing gypsy wickedness yes i know octavia he said grimly the flinty glance moved on to xander and this is octavias brother my soninlaw alexander said ricky as though he was daring xander to speak out of turn xander got to his feet heil hitler he said with a polite smile hiccoughed and sat down xander thundered ricky i know that in welcoming mr llewellyn said old harry somerville his adams apple bobbing furiously i speak for everyone in saying how pleased we all are balls said xander xander snapped ricky if you cant keep a civil tongue in your head youd better bugger off all the same i had a chilling feeling that he was delighted xander was playing up so that gareth could see what provocation he normally had to put up with well i think its over to you now gareth he added sitting down gareth got to his feet still unsmiling but completely relaxed for a second he upended a memo pad on the table swinging it reflectively between finger and thumb then he looked round like a conductor waiting until he had everyones attention id like to kick off by examining the structure of the company he said as mr seaford has already indicated ive been studying your outfit for a few weeks and ive come to the conclusion and im going to be brutal that your whole organization needs to be restructured from top to bottom and that some people particularly those at the top are going to have to pull their fingers out he then proceeded to launch a blistering attack on seafordbrennens managerial hierarchy its distribution of assets and its work in progress which left everyone reeling tommy lloyd was looking like an enraged beetroot the rest of the table as though they were posing for a bad photograph there was no doubt that gareth could talk he had all the welsh gift of the gab the eloquence the magnetism the soft cadences you might hate what he said but you had to listen i called this meeting in the afternoon he went on because with your track record i didnt think youd all manage to make it in the morning half of you seem to feel its only worth putting in an hours work before going to lunch one can never get any of you before or after not to mention the three hours you all spend in the middle of the day roughing it at the ritz tommy lloyds lips tightened while we rough it at the ritz as you so politely call it he said coldly most of the company business is done not on the evidence of the order books said gareth youve got to wake up to the fact that the old boy network is dead all that palsy walsy backscratching over triple remy martins doesnt count for anything any more and youve got to stand on your own feet too youve got too used to relying on government subsidies or massive loans from the parent company and when they run out you squeal for more he looked round the table when did any of you last go to the factory he said suddenly changing tack there was an embarrassed shuffling silence were in frequent telephonic communication said peter hocking in his thick voice thats not good enough said gareth banging his hand down on the table so loudly that everyone jumped i know because ive been up to glasgow and coventry and bradford in the last few days and morale is frightful no wonder youre crippled by strikes you should know of course said tommy lloyd thoroughly nettled i was forgetting youre one of the new establishments without roots or responsibility do you think ive got employees gareth snapped without any kind of responsibility sure i did my stint on the factory floor so i happen to know men work not just for a pay packet but because theyre proud of what they produce and because the people they work for care about them you lot think as long as you give the staff a gold watch after fifty years hard grind and a boozeup at christmas and then forget about them its enough in my companies he went on the welsh accent becoming more pronounced we tell everyone whats going on we have a policy of employee participation we even have someone from the shop floor in on board meetings a blueprint of the companys future is regularly circulated to all staff it brings them in makes them feel they belong every worker can ask the management a question and feel sure of getting an answer he was stunning there is nothing more seductive than seeing the person one loves excelling in a completely unexpected field i wanted to throw bouquets and shout bravo tommy lloyds lips however were curling scornfully good of you to give us your advice mr llewellyn he said that kind of utopian concept may work in the building industry but i dont get the impression you know much about engineering weve been running our own show very successfully you know for fifty years thats the trouble seafordbrennens was a firstclass family firm but youve been living on your reputation for the last twenty years weve got the finest most advanced research department in the country said tommy lloyd stung but still smiling thats the trouble again said gareth lots of research and none of it applied two months ago i came back from a world trip the brush group and british electrical were everywhere you were nowhere im sorry but its the truth tommy lloyd picked up a cigar and started paring off the end gareth turned to kenny morgan who handed him a couple of sheets of paper kennys been looking into your books said gareth hes no right to said tommy lloyd turning purple he calculates you wont even make a profit next year certainly not million as you forecast thats a lot of bread i consider that a gross breach of security said tommy lloyd addressing ricky directly ricky ignored him and continued looking at gareth who went on softly and if anything kennys estimate is still too high all im saying is you need help in running your business and i intend to make it what its never been efficient youve got to face up to international competition americans germans japs russians last year i saw some industrial complexes in siberia running at a fraction of our costs if were going to beat the russians at their own game theres no room for companies with a purely domestic market and your domestic figures arent very pretty either he added you all know theyve sagged from per cent of the home market four years ago to per cent today he paused stretching his fingers out on the table and examining them for a minute now what is the solution he said looking round the table xander drew the bar across a pair of rugger posts i think wed all better start practising the goose step he said there was an awful silence all eyes turned once more on xander but this time more with irritation than embarrassment a muscle was going in gareths cheek when i need a funny man he said sharply ill hire morecambe and wise do you personally have the answer to the problem xander leaned back for a minute to admire his artwork well not right here in my pocket he said and hiccoughed gently well shut up then snapped gareth he got out a packet of cigarettes several lighters were raised but he used his own inhaling deeply then said briskly to get you out of the wood ricky and i suggest the following measures to start with seaford international is going to write off their million loan as a loss and give you a further million over the next four years for a new model programme and for modernizing the factories secondly the existing products need more stringent tests practically everything youve produced recently has been blighted by poor reliability thirdly i intend to rejig the production operation its got to be speeded up waiting lists are so long buyers have been forced to go elsewhere id like to have the new engines rolling off the assembly by january at the latest and youre not producing enough either so instead of laying off men at glasgow and bradford were going to initiate a second shift system there are enough men up there who need work then its up to you to sell them thats your baby tommy tommy lloyd turned puce at the casual use of his christian name weve got to completely rethink the export market too gareth went on the appetite in the middle east and in africa for your sort of stuff particularly power stations should produce thumping big orders you talk as though weve been sitting round since the war doing f all said tommy lloyd stiffly anyone can put up proposals exactly said gareth so lets get the ball rolling early tomorrow over the next fortnight kenny and i plan to have talks with all of you individually i wont be here all the time but kennys going to put in a fourday week for the moment kenny he added turning and looking at his managers battered lugubrious face i can assure you is much tougher than he looks a tremor of sycophantic laughter went through the room gareth stood for a minute looking cool almost indifferent but his left hand was squeezing the back of a chair so hard i could see the whiteness of his knuckles im looking forward to working with you he said softly but id like to add that i find it impossible to breathe or conduct business in a taut patchedup regime so youre either for me or against me and except for xander who was gazing blankly into space and tommy lloyd who was still looking livid everyone seemed to be eating out of his hand for a minute he glared at them grimly then suddenly he smiled for the first time the harsh heavy features suddenly illuminated the contrast was extraordinary you could feel the tension going out of the room as though youd loosened your fingers on the neck of a balloon im sorry ive been so blunt but these things had to be said youre in a hell of a mess but frankly i wouldnt have taken you on if i didnt think you could get yourselves out of it when he sat down there was even a murmur of approval ricky rose to his feet oozing satisfaction like an overripe plum thank you gareth im sure you can count on per cent support now gentlemen i believe that will be all today there was a shuffling of feet everyone started to file out looking shellshocked ill leave you then said ricky again many congratulations well talk later today i was dying to tell gareth how great hed been but annabel smith was already doing it speaking in an undertone smiling warmly into his eyes the predatory selfpossessed bitch oh please at least let him say goodbye to me i prayed as i started towards the door gareth turned i want a word with you alexander and you octavia he said shortly oh dear sighed xander i was afraid you might are we going to get a thousand lines or is birching the only answer chapter fifteen as the last person shut the door behind them xander very slowly counted mrs smith me and gareth with a shaking finger then he looked down at the long polished table if we could find a net he said confidingly we could have a pingpong four i giggled gareth and mrs smith didnt xander pinched another of my cigarettes and went over to the window we could hear the clunk of his signet ring as his fingers drummed nervously on the radiator gareth looked wornout i realized now what a strain the meeting had been i wonder whats happening in the test match said xander to mrs smith you dont like cricket perhaps you had to play it at school like i did terrible for breaking ones finger nails thats enough snapped gareth i want to talk about your expenses xander and i sat quite still not looking at each other the temperature dropped to well below zero my stomach gave a rumble like not so distant thunder id only drunk cups of coffee since yesterday gareth took a bit of paper from mrs smith well start with you alexander your uk expenses for the last month alone were well over two grand he said xander removed his chewing gum reflectively and parked it underneath the table arabs are dreadfully expensive to amuse he said what arabs asked gareth not a single order has come from the middle east to justify expenses like this well its in the pipeline said xander these things take time you know i dont said gareth brusquely in most of these cases initial meetings were never followed up some of them never took place at all mrs smith has been doing a bit of detective work you claim to have taken a certain sheik mujab to the clermont three times and to tramps twice over the past two months but he says hes never heard of you hes lying blustered xander they all do and jeanbaptiste giraud of renaults gareth ran his eyes down the page appears to have had nearly spent on him during the last four weeks being wined and dined by you and octavia octavias a great asset with customers said xander i can well believe that said gareth in a voice of such contempt i felt myself go scarlet with humiliation unfortunately for you jeanbaptiste happens to be an old oxford mate of mine it took one telephone call to ascertain he only met you once over lunch at the neal street where he paid and hes never met octavia at all he must have forgotten said xander dont be fatuous said gareth i dont hold much brief for your sister but shes not the sort of girl an old ram like jeanbaptiste would be likely to forget i bit my lip annabel smith was loving every minute of it and so it goes on said gareth god knows how much youve cheated the shareholders out of old ladies whove gambled their last savings married couples with children whove hardly got a penny to rub together and all the time you twove been treating the company like a bran tub helping yourself as you choose xander started to play an imaginary violin gareth lost his temper cant you be fucking serious about anything havent you any idea what an invidious position youve put ricky in he cant give you the boot because youre his soninlaw but at the moment youre about as much good to him as a used tea bag he walked over to the window squinting at the traffic below his huge shoulders hunched his broken nose silhouetted against the blue sky black and silver badgers hair curling thickly over his collar i suddenly felt absolutely hollow with lust we all waited as he turned round his expression hardened i dont suppose ive ever come across a more greedy couple he said speaking with swift curious harshness i guess massingham let you get away with it i gather he was quite a fan of octavias dont you dare say a word against hugh i hissed he was worth a million of you xander slumped in his chair suddenly to my horror i saw the tears pouring down his face i put my arm round his shoulders its all right darling i said once again gareth changed tack and with one of those staggering volte faces said very gently you were fond of him i know im sorry xander pushed back his hair and blinked two or three times he was my friend faithful and just to me he said slowly but ricky says he was incompetent and ricky is an honourable man so they are all honourable men oh christ i should have had breakfast he added in a choked voice groping for a handkerchief cant you leave him alone i screamed turning on gareth cant you see he isnt in any state for one of your bawlings out im sorry said xander when people call me alexander i always know theyre cross with me gareth opened the window and threw out his lighted cigarette seriously endangering the passersby in the street below then he slammed the window shut and said to xander in a businesslike tone as i see it we have two alternatives we could send you to prison for what youve been doing or we can cart you onto the board whichll give you more money and enable you to start paying back some of the bread youve borrowed from the firm itll also mean we can keep a closer watch on your activities youre bloody lucky youve got a rich and loyal wife the soninlaw also rises sighed xander i dont think i can accept your offer dont be wet said gareth brutally i want you in the office by nine oclock tomorrow so we can rejig the export schedule in the meantime youd better take a taxi home and sleep it off all the way to sussex said xander youve got plenty of mates wholl put you up for the afternoon now beat it xander walked very unsteadily towards the door cannoning off the table the wall and two chairs at the doorway he paused looking anxiously at me clearly about to say something in my defence but was baulked by gareth saying again go on get out there was an agonizing pause after he had gone my stomach gave another earthshattering rumble i could feel my early morning cup of coffee sourly churning round inside me i licked my lips now said gareth grimly what about you and he looked me over in a way that made me feel very small and uncomfortable and miserable can i go too i said getting to my feet sit down i sat annabel can i have those other figures he said annabel smith handed him a pink folder at the same time putting a new tape in the machine god she was enjoying this you should go cockfighting next time i said to her youd find that even more exciting at the moment said gareth glancing down at the figures youre living in a flat thats paid for by the firm i also gather that when you moved in three years ago the firm coughed up at least seven grand to have it redecorated since then seafordbrennen has not only been paying your phone bills and rates but also the gas and electricity and recently massingham gave you the porsche on the firm which is costing a fortune to be repaired at the garage theres also worth of unspecified loans to be accounted for there was another dreadful pause all you could hear was the hiss of the taperecorder it wasnt just my flat i protested directors and clients often stayed there and you i suppose provided the service i bloody did not i said furiously what dyou think i am a flaming call girl i was shaking with anger i could feel my whole body drenched with sweat annabel smith gazed out of the window and recrossed her beautiful legs does she have to be here i went on i suppose its customary to have a woman cop present if youre going to beat up the prisoner and cant you turn that bloody taperecorder off i imagined them playing it back to each other in bed drinking charles heidsieck and laughing themselves sick gareth leaned forward and switched it off then he said annabel baby go and get us some coffee and see that xanders safely put into a taxi she smiled and left us quietly closing the door behind her i noticed with loathing that there wasnt a single crease in her black suit for a minute gareths fingers drummed on the table then he said for the last three years youve been conducting your jet set existence entirely on the firm even if we write off your joint junketings with xander you owe nearly i want you out of that flat by the end of the month and i want the keys to your company car tomorrow here are your last quarters bills electricity telephone for all discovered unpaid in massinghams desk i want those settled up theyre all final reminders and the loan to the firm must be paid off as soon as possible i felt icy cold i wasnt going to cry i wasnt i dug my nails into the palms of my hands gareth walked down the table until he was standing over me against my will i looked up his eyes were as hard and as black as the coal his forefathers had hewn from the mines in them i could read only hatred and utter contempt as though he was at last avenging himself for all the wilful havoc id created in the past for breaking up cathie and tod for jeopardizing gussie and jeremy youre nothing but a bloody parasite he said softly im going to make you sweat beauty no more helping yourself to everyones money and their men too the partys over now youre going to get a job and do an honest days work like everyone else i couldnt look away i sat there hypnotized like a rabbit by headlights as your creditor he went on id quite like to know when youre going to pay up ill get it next week i whispered how ill sell shares he looked at me pityingly cant you get it into your thick head that unless i can put a bomb under them seafordbrennen arent worth a bean any more weve also had enquiries from the inland revenue you owe them a bit of bread too the debtors prison loomed i gripped the edge of the table with my fingers then i lost my temper you bloody upstart i howled you smug fat welsh prude walking in here and playing god well gods got a great deal more style than you youre nothing but a bully and a thug theyll all resign here if you go on humiliating them see if they dont and then youll look bloody silly after all your protestations about waving a fairy wand and turning us into a miracle of the eighties god i loathe you loathe you my voice was rising to a scream now marching in here humiliating xander and tommy lloyd with that fat slob ricky lapping it all up i paused my breath coming in great sobs then suddenly something snapped outside me it was my bra strap beastly disloyal thing i felt my right tit plummet gareth looked at me for a second then started to laugh you should go on the stage octavia youre utterly wasted on real life he said why not pop down to billingsgate im sure theyd sign you up as a fishwife dont bug me i screamed and groping behind me gathered up a cut glass ash tray and was just about to smash it in his face when he grabbed my wrist dont be silly he snapped you cant afford to be done for assault as well go on drop it drop it i loosened my fingers the ashtray fell with a thud on the carpet i slumped into a chair trembling violently gareth gave me a cigarette and lit it for me ill pay it all back i muttered through gritted teeth if i do some modelling i can make that kind of bread in six months things have changed beauty you cant just swan back to work and pull in ten grand a year there isnt the work about youre twentysix now not seventeen and it shows anyway you havent the discipline to cope with fulltime modelling and it wont do you any good gazing into the camera hour after hour youd just get more narcissistic than ever for christs sake get a job where you can use your brain my mind was running round like a spider in a fillingup bath trying to think of a crushing enough reply i was saved by the belle the luscious mrs smith walking in with three cups of coffee she put one down beside me i dont want any i said icily oh grow up said gareth if you give annabel a ring shell help you to get a job and find you somewhere to live i got to my feet shes the last person id accept help from i said haughtily preparing to sweep out but it is very difficult to make a dignified exit with only one bra strap particularly if one trips over mrs smiths strategically placed briefcase on the way i expect annabels even got a safety pin in her bag if you ask her nicely said gareth i gave a sob and fled from the room chapter sixteen from that moment i was in a dumb blind fury the only thing that mattered was to pay seafordbrennen back and prove to gareth and that overscented fox mrs smith that i was quite capable of getting a job and fending for myself i went out next day and sold all my jewellery most of it apart from my grandmothers pearls had been given me by boyfriends they had been very generous i got for the lot times were terrible said the jeweller but at least that would quieten the income tax people for a bit and pay off the telephone and the housekeeping bills a woman from a chic secondhandclothes shop came and bought most of my wardrobe for it must have cost ten times that originally as she rummaged through my wardrobe i felt she was flaying me alive and rubbing in salt as well i only kept a handful of dresses i was fond of there were also a few bits of furniture of my own the cotman xander had given me for my st and the picture of the garden of eden over the bed everything else belonged to the firm in the evening xander rang sweetheart are you all right i meant to ring you yesterday but i passed out cold and there hasnt been a minute today how was your session with gareth you could hardly say it was riotous i said no one put on paper hats how did you get on this morning well that wasnt exactly riotous either he certainly knows how to kick a chap when hes down i thought about resigning then i thought why not stick around and see if he can put us on the map again he is quite impressive isnt he oppressive certainly well tell it not in gath or the clermont or anywhere else said xander but i must confess i do rather like him hes so unashamedly butch et tu brute i said look how soon can i put my two decent pictures up for auction at sothebys about a couple of months but you cant sell pictures its blasphemy it took a long time to persuade him i had to i spent the next week in consultation with bank managers accountants tax people until i came to the final realization that there was nothing left i had even buried my pride and written to my mother but got a ginsplashed letter by return saying she had money troubles of her own and couldnt help you cant get your thieving hands on the family money either she had ended with satisfaction its all in trust for xanders children and yours if you have any the only answer seemed to be to get pregnant when everything was added up i still owed the tax people a couple of grand and seafordbrennens both said with great condescension that they would give me time to pay the heat wave moved into its sixth week every news bulletin urged people to save water and warned of the possibilities of a drought cattle were being boxed across the country to less parched areas in the suffocating airless heat i tramped the london streets looking for work and a place to live i never believed how tough it would be just because one doting exlover whod put up with all my tantrums and unpunctuality had directed me through the revson commercial i was convinced i could swan into acting and modelling jobs but i found that equity had clamped down in the past two years so i couldnt get film or television commercial work even if ten million starving outofwork actresses hadnt been after each job anyway modelling was even more disastrous i went to several auditions and was turned down i seemed to have lost my sparkle gareths words about not being seventeen anymore and it showing kept ringing in my ears the first photographer who booked me for a job refused to use me because i arrived an hour late the second kept me sweltering for four hours modelling fur coats expecting me to behave like a perfectly schooled clothes horse then threw me out when i started arguing the third sacked me because i took too long to change my makeup i moved to another agency and botched up two more jobs after that one of the gossip columns printed a bitchy piece about my inability to settle down to anything and as a result no one was prepared to give me work gareth was right anyway it was no cure for a broken heart gazing into the lens of a camera all day i tried a secretarial agency i asked them what they could offer me what could i offer them they answered gradually i realized that i was equipped for absolutely nothing i took a job as a filing clerk in the city another catastrophe within two days id completely fouled up the firms filing system next the agency sent me to a job as a receptionist all you have to do miss brennen is to look pleasant and direct people to the right floor i thought i was doing all right but after three days the personnel woman sent for me receptionists are supposed to be friendly helpful people after all they are the first impression a visitor gets of the company im afraid youre too arrogant miss brennen you cant look down your nose at people in this day and age everyone agrees youve got an unfortunate manner unfortunate manor it sounded like a stately home with dry rot it was a few seconds before i realized she was giving me the boot the third job i went to i smiled and smiled until my jaw ached i lasted till thursday then someone told me i had to man the switchboard no switchboard was ever unmanned faster after id cut off the managing director and his mistress twice and the sales managers dealclinching call to nigeria for the fourth time a senior secretary with blue hair and a bright red face came down and screamed at me my nerves in shreds i screamed back when i got my first pay packet on friday morning it also contained my notice which all in all was great on character building but not too hot for morale one of the bitterest lessons i also learnt was that beauty is largely a matter of time and money in the old days when i could sleep in until lunchtime and spend all afternoon sunbathing or slapping on face cream filing my nails and getting ready to go on the town it was easy to look good but now having to get up at eight oclock to get to an office by ninethirty punched and pummelled to death by commuters on the tube scurrying round all day with not a moment to do ones face not getting home till seven absolutely knackered it was a very different proposition i lost another seven pounds and all my selfconfidence for the first time in my life i walked down the street and no one turned their heads to look at me in a way it was rather a relief after the secretarial agency gave me up i rang up a few old friends who owned boutiques their reactions were all the same they were either laying off staff or told me kindly that their sort of work would bore me to death which really meant they thought i was totally unreliable in the evenings i went and looked for flats which was even more depressing living on my own i couldnt afford anywhere remotely reasonable and in my present mood i couldnt bear to share with other girls all that cooking scrambled eggs knickers dripping over the bath and shrieking with laughter over last nights exploits it wasnt just that i couldnt face new people i was feeling so low i couldnt believe theyd put up with me i was also fast running out of valium only six left not even enough for an overdose i couldnt go to my doctor i owed him too much money at night i didnt sleep tossing and turning eating my heart out for gareth worrying about leaving my darling flat my only refuge at the back of my mind flickering like a snakes tongue was the thought of andreas katz if i took up his modelling offer it would get me off the hook but i knew once andreas had something on me or in this case everything off me id never escape id be sucked down to damnation like a quicksand even xander had deserted me he hadnt called me for days gareth must be working the pants off him i was due to move out on the saturday the thursday before i sat surrounded by suitcases poring over the evening standard trying not to cry and wondering whether bed sitter in muswell hill with lively family a week some baby sitting in return was worth investigation when the telephone rang i pounced on it like a cat i still couldnt cure myself of the blind hope it might be gareth but it was only lorna asking if she could come and stay the night it was the last thing i wanted but i had a masochistic desire to find out what gareth was up to youll have to camp i said im moving out the day after tomorrow well if its not too much bother id so adore to see you again she arrived about six oclock in a flurry of parcels and suitcases ive gone mad buying sexy clothes were her first words gareths taking me out tonight i couldnt stand it sitting in the flat and seeing her get all scented and beautiful for him i showed her to her room and then went into my bedroom and telephoned my exboyfriend charlie and asked him to take me out he was enchanted god its great to hear you baby mountains come to mahomet at last i won a monkey at poker last night so we can go anywhere you want ill pick you up about nine cant you get here any earlier ill try sweetheart i wandered along to lornas bedroom she was trying on a new orange dress shed just bought do you think gareth will like me in this she said craning her neck to see her back in the mirror yes i said truthfully you look ravishing im going out too by the way at about nine oh gareths coming at a quarter to so you should see him while she was in the bath the telephone rang trembling i picked up the receiver somehow i knew it was going to be gareth lornas in the bath i said quickly can i give her a message yeah tell her ill be a bit late around ninethirty all right i said how are you he asked brusquely im fine i stammered and you tired ive been working too hard im off to the middle east with your brother next week which should be enlightening if nothing else have you found somewhere to live yes thanks i said im moving out tomorrow what about a job thats fine too i must go i went on fighting back the tears ive got so much to do goodbye and i put down the receiver i cant stand it i cant stand it i thought in agony lorna walked in wrapped in a towel pink from her bath oh i feel so much better i used your badedas i hope you dont mind that was gareth i said hes going to be late about ninethirty oh goodee thatll give me more time to tart myself up suddenly she looked at me octavia you look awfully pale are you all right tears embarrassingly hot and prickly rose to my eyes i began to laugh gasped hysterically and then burst into tears octavia oh poor love what is it nnothing everything i couldnt stop now whats wrong please tell me oh the usual thing youre mad for someone yes well youre so stunning he must be mad for you he isnt he hardly knows i exist he couldnt know you properly then here take my handkerchief id better go and get ready i said ive got to go out in a minute i put on a black trouser suit with a high mandarin collar and huge floppy trousers it hung off me i tied my hair back with a black bow were those dry lips and red swollen eyes really mine charlie wouldnt recognize me lorna answered the door when he arrived she came rushing into my bedroom hes absolutely gorgeous the campest thing ive ever seen she said excitedly im not surprised youre wild about him it was too much effort to explain to her he wasnt the one can you give him a drink i said ill be out in a minute i hung around fiddling with my makeup trying to summon up enough courage to face him id lost all my confidence finally i realized if i didnt get a move on id go slap into gareth charlie looked exquisite and to me absurd he had already helped himself to a second whisky and was settling down on the sofa to chat up lorna he got to his feet when i came in and pecked me on the cheek hullo baby playing it in the minor key for a change he said taking in the black suit the dark glasses the drawnback hair i like it its great shall we go i said going towards the door already said charlie i havent finished my drink i want to go now i snapped the lady seems to be in a hurry so ill bid you goodnight said charlie theatrically bowing from the waist to lorna i hope youll come into the shop one day now youre in london youve got a key havent you i said to her have a good evening ill see you in the morning hey whats bitten you said charlie as we went down in the lift it was a hideous evening in three short weeks i seemed to have grown a world apart from charlie and his flash trendy friends waiting round in tramps all night for something to happen only interested in being the first ones to latch on to the latest fad suddenly their values seemed completely dislocated we went to annabels and i couldnt stand it then we moved on to the dumbbells then on to somewhere else and somewhere else finally charlie took me back to his flat and we played records i have to hand it to charlie he seemed to realize instinctively that i was at suicide level and didnt attempt to pounce on me in his usual fashion perhaps it had something to do with his having a new girlfriend who was off modelling in stockholm for a couple of days i looked at my watch it was three oclock whats the matter baby he asked have you fallen for some bloke at last ive never seen you so piano youre not even bitching how bored you are by everything this evening you look different too he took off my dark glasses boy you do look different i must say i rather go for the ave maria look it would have helped if i could have cried on his shoulder but id gone beyond that stage now i was just numb with misery take me home please charlie i said next day life picked up about half an inch for an hour i endured the torture of listening to lorna babbling on at breakfast about the marvellous time shed had with gareth after dinner we went up to the top of the hilton for a drink and looked out over the whole of london it was so romantic she said helping herself to a third piece of toast and marmalade her mascara was still smudged under her eyes i hoped it wasnt sex that had given her such an appetite then she started to ask me awkward questions about the new job id lied to gareth that id got its in knightsbridge i said well you must give me the telephone number because youll be moving out of here ill be travelling a lot i said hastily and theyre always a bit dodgy about personal calls to start off with ill write and tell you it sounds marvellous said lorna selecting a banana but if by chance it doesnt work out gareth says theres a marvellous new agency started up in albemarle street called square peg they specialize in placing people who want to branch out in completely new fields ill take the address just in case i said as soon as shed gone pleading with me to come and spend the weekend soon i had a bath painted my face with great care took my last two valium and set out for square peg they turned out to be very friendly and businesslike and despatched me straightaway to a public relations firm in the city the firms offices were scruffy untidy and terribly hot the secretary who welcomed me looked tired out and her hair needed washing but she gave me the sort of smile that all those personnel bitches id worked for were always banging on about its been a hell of a week she said the air conditionings broken and the heats been terrible its crazy hard work here but its fun the boss was a small dark jew called jakey bartholomew who seemed to burn with energy his foxy brown eyes shone with intelligence behind hornrimmed spectacles he had to lift a lot of files a box of pork chops and a huge cutout cardboard of a pig off a chair before i could sit down weve just landed the pig industry account he said grinning im trying to persuade them to produce kosher pork weve been going for nine months now and were taking on new business all the time because we provide the goods on a shoestring do you know anything about public relations no i said just as well you havent had time to pick up any bad habits he ripped open a couple of beer cans and gave me one were a small outfit only ten people in the firm and we cant afford passengers we need a girl friday you can see this place is in shit order to keep it tidy make decent coffee and chat up the clients when they come then youd have to do things like putting press releases into envelopes taking them to the post organizing press parties and probably writing the odd release its very menial work i dont care i said trying to keep the quiver of desperation out of my voice ill do anything if youre good well promote you very fast suddenly he grinned reminding me of gareth all right youre on baby go along to the accounts department in a minute and get your p sorted out well start you on a three months trial on monday i couldnt believe my luck i hardly concentrated as we discussed hours and salaries and he told me a bit more about the firm he was very forceful it was only when i stood up to go that i realized i was about four inches taller than he was the agency was right he said they insisted you were a very classy looking dame i didnt remember the agency saying any such thing when they telephoned through they must have rung again after id left i then took a long bus ride out to putney where the evening standard had advertised a room to let everywhere i could see the ravages of the drought great patches of black burnt grass flowers gasping with thirst in driedup gardens as i got off the bus a fire engine charged past clanging noisily although it was only the end of july a bonfire smell of autumn filled my nostrils the house was large and victorian on the edge of the common the front rooms darkened by a huge chestnut tree a stocky woman answered the door she had a tough face like dried out roast beef and muddy mottled knees she was wearing a flowered sleeveless dress that rucked over her large hips rose petals in her iron grey hair gave her an incongruously festive look at present she was more interested in stopping several dogs escaping than letting me in ive come about the room i said oh she said looking slightly more amiable im mrs lonsdaletaylor come in sorry to look such a mess ive been gardening come here monkey she bellowed to a small brown mongrel who was trying to lick my hand mind the loose rod she said as we climbed the stairs in front of me her sturdy red legs went into her shoes without the intervention of ankles her voice was incredibly put on i was sure shed doublebarrelled the lonsdale and taylor herself the room was at the top of the house the sofa clashed with the wallpaper the brass bed creaked when i sat on it rush matting hardly covered the black scratched floorboards on the wall were framed photographs cut out from magazines and stuck on cardboard the curtains hung a foot above the floor like midi skirts it would be a cold and cheerless room in winter i looked outside in spite of the drought mrs lonsdaletaylor had been taking great care of her garden the mingled scent of stocks clove carnations and a honeysuckle which hung in great honeycoloured ramparts round the window drifted towards me a white cat emerged from a forest of dark blue delphiniums and avoiding the sprinkler that was shooting its rainbow jets over the green lawn walked towards the house at a leisurely pace it was incredibly quiet its beautiful here i said youre lucky to be so countrified living so near london i bent to stroke the little brown mongrel whod followed us upstairs he wagged his tail and put both his paws up on my waist get down monkey said mrs lonsdaletaylor aiming a kick at him he was my late husbands dog ive never really taken to him my husband passed on last year or i wouldnt be taking people in of course not i murmured i prefer a pedigree dog myself she said wiping her nose with her hand and leaving a moustache of earth on her upper lip well if you like the room its a week all in but youve got to pay for your own telephone ive installed a phone box downstairs you can use the kitchen when im not using it as long as you clear up afterwards but no food in the bedroom i dont mind you having friends in if they behave themselves but no gramophones or young gentlemen after nine oclock and id like the first months rent when you arrive i like to get these things straight chapter seventeen looking back i shall never know how i got through the next few weeks i hadnt realized that the journey from putney to the city would take two hours in the rushhour or in this heat the bus would be like a turkish bath my second day working for jakey bartholomew i didnt get in till quarter to ten and received such a bawling out i thought id blown the whole thing but gradually as the days passed i began to pick up the job i learnt to work the switchboard and skim the papers for anything important and stick press cuttings into a scrap book the work was so menial that sometimes i did scream but jakey was a hard taskmaster and came down on any displays of sulks or illtemper like a ton of concrete slabs in the same way he picked me up for any stupid mistakes gradually too i got to know the other girls in the office and learnt to grumble with them about the lateness of the second post and the failure of the roller towel in the lavatory and have long discussions about miss selfridges and eye makeup the days were made bearable by little unimportant victories one of the typists asking me to go to the cinema miss parkside the office crone inviting me to supper at her flat in peckham a client ringing up asking if i could be spared to show some vip germans round london i soon discovered however that id never be able to pay seafordbrennen back on my present salary so i took another job waitressing in putney high street here for six nights a week and at lunchtime on saturdays i worked my guts out earning a week by looking pleasant when drunken customers pinched my bottom or bollocked me because the chef had had a row with his boyfriend and forgotten to put any salt in the chicken marengo at the end of each week i sent my salary in a registered envelope to mrs smith and received a polite acknowledgement gareth was still in the middle east with xander so at least i didnt worry all day about bumping into him every night i fell into bed long after midnight too knackered to allow myself more than a second to dream about him but his face still haunted my dreams and every morning i would wake up crying with the sun beating through the thin curtains and the little mongrel monkey curled up on my bed looking at me with sorrowful dark eyes trying to lick away my tears he was a great comfort i couldnt understand why mrs lonsdaletaylor preferred her fat pekineses i realized now how much my mother had deprived me of never letting me have animals august gave way to september the drought grew worse it hadnt rained for three months the common was like a cinder the leaves on the chestnut tree shrivelled and turned brown people were ordered not to use their hosepipes mrs lt panted back and forth with buckets of water grumbling on the tuesday of my eighth week jakey bartholomew sent for me i went in quaking you cant send this out he said he handed me a photograph of a girl with very elaborate frizzled curls one of the dreadful styles created by our hairdressing client roger of kensington turning it over i saw id captioned it sweet and sour pigs trotters one of the pig industrys equally dreadful recipes oh god im sorry i said jakey started to laugh i thought it was quite funny have a beer get one out of the fridge i helped myself and sat down jakey leaned back our advertising associates want to borrow your legs on friday week they what theyre pitching for a stocking account all the guys reckon youve got the best pair of legs in either office they want you to model the tights for them during the presentation i felt myself blushing scarlet i never realized any of the men in the office had even noticed me theyd certainly kept their distance they want to take some photographs this afternoon said jakey and get them blown up by next week i said that was ok by me if they land the account well probably get the pr side and if the client likes the idea they may use you in ads which could make you quite a lot of bread thank you so much i stammered i felt i had conquered everest are you feeling all right he said as i went out youre looking knackered im fine i said quickly well bring me the roger of kensington file then he was right of course gradually i was coming apart at the seams in the last week or so i had noticed a growing inability in myself to make decisions even small ones the problem of where to find the file suddenly began to swell like a balloon in my head the familiar panic began to surge inside me im going crazy i whimpered i put my hands on my forehead and waited keep calm itll go in a minute dont panic i felt as if i were trying to get out of a dark slimy cavern and my nails kept grating down the inside my mind raced from one fear to the other in search of a grip to secure myself from the blind horror that swirled around me i leant against the wall trying to take deep breaths praying no one would come out into the passage gradually the panic ebbed away i went into the general office it was empty with shaking hands i dialled the number of the psychiatrist whod been recommended to me in the old days i made an appointment for thursday lunchtime the first visit wasnt a conspicuous success the analyst was middleaged handsome welldressed with teeth as white as his shirtcuffs a soothing deliberate manner and a photograph of a beautiful wife and child on the desk i was too uptight to tell him very much but he gave me enough tranquillizers to last a week on condition that i returned again next thursday lunchtime its very kind but i cant afford it i muttered i felt a totally doglike gratitude when he waved my protestations airily away and said dont give it a thought miss brennen in exceptional circumstances i take national health patients and your case interests me very much the tranquillizers got me through another week my legs were photographed in every conceivable type of stocking and the advertising department professed themselves delighted with the result the following thursday morning just as i was setting out for the doctor xander rang just back from the middle east and absolutely raving over his trip he and gareth had pulled off some fantastic deals he said and gareth was a star i simply adore him he went on im thinking of divorcing pammie and asking him to wait for me and darling he can sell absolutely anything even a pregnant rabbit to an australian sheep farmer if he felt so inclined we had a terrible time to begin with i didnt realize the middle east was dry for twentyfour hours we didnt have a drink then the pink elephants started trooping into my bedroom and gareth had a quiet word with the resident sheik from then on we had whisky pouring out of our ears was it terribly hot i said terrible and if i see another belly dancer ill go bananas did gareth have lots of birds out there i said suddenly feeling my voice coming out like a ventriloquists dummy no actually he didnt i think hes got some bird in england hes hooked on any idea who well this ravishing redhead met him at the airport bubbling over with excitement flinging her arms round him mrs smith i said in a frozen whisper no much younger laura i think she was called lorna hamilton yes thats it gareth was supposed to be giving me a lift into london but i left them to it almost sleepwalking i got myself to the analyst on the way i passed a church the gutter outside was choked with confetti gareth and lorna gareth and lorna a voice intoned inside me they sounded like a couple by tennyson the analyst had darkened his waiting room after the searching sunlight it was beautifully cool his receptionist got me a glass of iced water and then i heard him telling her to go to lunch i lay down on the grey velvet sofa this time i found myself able to talk i didnt tell him about gareth but raved on about my childhood i wasnt allowed to be loving as a child i sobbed my mother didnt love me she never kissed me goodnight or tucked me up neither of my parents loved me they fought like cats to have custody of my brother xander but they fought equally hard not to have me go on said the analyst noncommitally i could feel his pale blue eyes watching me smell the lavender tang of his aftershave i know what happens to people who arent loved enough i went on they just close up and love or hate themselves too much theyre incapable of getting it together with anyone else after threequarters of an hour of my ramblings he glanced at his watch i got up to go im sorry i must have bored you to death you cant possibly put me on the national health i thought wed dispensed with all that he said gently youll come again next week oh please if you can spare the time he scribbled out a prescription heres another weeks supply of valium he turned towards me the prescription suddenly trembling in his hand he was trying to smile his blue eyes glazed his face pale he was sweating and there was a tic in his cheek then he walked round the table stood in front of me and put a wet hand on my arm i was wondering he said that tic was going again if i might see you outside consulting hours i am sure i could show you there was no need to be so lonely behind him smiling sunnily was the photograph of his wife and children i had trusted him implicitly i ddont think itd be very wise i said backing away from him ive never found married men very satisfactory i wrenched open the door behind me amazed to find it unlocked i saw fear start in his eyes the medical council passing judgment then he squared his shoulders of course he pressed the bell on the desk magicking up the instant receptionist to show me out i ran down the street prescriptionless and sobbed helplessly in the nearest garden square by some miracle i got back to the office just before miss parkside the office crone she arrived grumbling that she couldnt find a size skirt to fit her anymore and brandishing a large fullers cake to distract everyones attention from her lateness i suppose i ought to have worn my all in one she said plunging a knife into the hard white icing but its too hot in this weather it must be well up in the nineties come on octavia you need feeding up she handed me an enormous piece in order to save money id trained myself to go without lunch and breakfast i usually had something to eat free in the evening at the restaurant while i was waitressing every mouthful of the cake seemed like sand in my throat all the typists looked sympathetically at my reddened eyes but said nothing my task for the afternoon was to ring up the papers and chase them to come to a press preview the next morning i found it distasteful and embarrassing in the middle xander suddenly rang me he sounded drunk i know you dont like personal calls darling but this is a very special one youre going to be an aunt a what an aunt pammies pregnant i gave a scream of delight that must have echoed through the whole building oh xander are you sure quite quite sure shes even being sick poor darling how longs she known well just after i went to the middle east but she wanted to be quite sure before she told anyone id never known him so chipper good old pammie isnt it marvellous he went on ricky rang me up just now and was so nice he even congratulated me about work said the middle east trip had been a great coup look darling i mustnt keep you i know youre busy but come over and celebrate at the weekend i put the telephone down feeling utterly depressed i knew i ought to be delighted but all i could think was xander was getting so far ahead of me in life with a job that was going well and a baby on the way i felt sick with jealousy i wanted a baby of my own listlessly i finished making my telephone calls and started stapling press releases together for the preview tomorrow the afternoon sun was blazing through the window i could feel the sweat running down my back miss parkside and the typists had already started grumbling about the prospects of the journey home the telephone went again miss parkside picked it up for you she said disapprovingly make it snappy it was lorna i could recognize the breathless bubbling schoolgirl voice anywhere this time she was jibbering with excitement and embarrassment octavia i must see you i felt my hands wet on the telephone where are you i said at home memories came flooding back the white house deep in the cherry orchards gareth beating the hell out of me then putting me to bed jeremy trying to rape me but im coming to london tomorrow she went on could we have lunch ive got something i must tell you nice or nasty i asked well heaven for me but im not sure her voice trailed off tell it to me now i cant im in such a muddle she said please lets meet for lunch ill come and pick you up ive got a very heavy day you can slip out just for a drink ill pick you up at one oclock and please octavia dont dont be furious with me the telephone went dead i stood for a second then just made the loo in time and threw up all the fullers cake for a second i crouched wracked by retching and sobbing so it was true about gareth and lorna it must be what she was trying to tell me with agonizing slowness i pulled myself together you must finish those press releases i said over and over again as though it was really me that needed stapling together i splashed water over my face and rinsed out my mouth god i looked terrible my suntan had turned yellow my eyes were red and puffy my hair filthy and dark mouse at the roots because i couldnt afford to have it restreaked was bleached like straw at the ends one of the secretaries poked her head round the door parksides on the warpath she said some vips just arrived can you make him a cup of coffee and take it into jakeys office i couldnt find my dark glasses the wretched vip would have to put up with reddened eyes i knocked on jakeys door and walked into his office the next moment the cup of coffee had crashed to the ground for sitting behind the desk was gareth he leapt to his feet are you ok lovely you havent burnt yourself im fine i muttered but itll ruin the carpet i grabbed a dryingcloth that was lying on top of the fridge and kneeling down started frenziedly mopping up the coffee anything for gareth not to get a glimpse of my face i hadnt seen him for over two months hed have a fit to catch me looking so awful leave it he said itll dry in a minute he put a hand under my elbow and pulled me to my feet ill get you another cup of coffee i said making a bolt for the door but he got there first standing in front of me shutting the door firmly as usual his presence made the room shrink sit down he said tipping a pile of files off a chair i want to talk to you what are you doing here anyway i said i still hadnt looked him in the eyes visiting my old mate jakey bartholomew you know him i said sharply but i didnt i mean you should read your own company notepaper said gareth he handed me a sheet that was lying on jakeys desk sure enough in the middle of the list of directors was printed g llewellyn tthen you fiddled me this job i blurted out i thought i ggot it on my own merits yes of course you did he said gently jakeyd have never employed you if he hadnt liked you he held up one of the blownup photographs of my legs i must say i like these id recognize those pins anywhere everything was moving too fast for me i was trying to work out what influence gareth must have had over my working at bartholomews how are you enjoying it anyway he said its fine how was the middle east trip hell said gareth and bloody hot and exhausting your brother was the only redeeming feature hes nice isnt he he overreached himself one night he charmed one sheik so much that later the sheik insisted that only xander should have the culinary pièce de résistance at dinner what was it i said a sheeps eyeball said gareth i started to giggle hes over the moon about the baby i said trying to keep the trace of wistfulness out of my voice yep its a good thing itll patch up things between him and ricky too there was a pause the room was suffocatingly hot i still hadnt looked at him a schoolgirl embarking on her first love affair couldnt have behaved with more gaucheness i felt hollow with longing and misery its very hot isnt it i said very said gareth this wasnt getting us very far i got to my feet edging towards the door i must get you some coffee i dont want any iive got some work ive got to finish he followed me into the general office passing miss parkside on the way out bearing her floral spongebag off to the ladies its goinghome time he said ive got to finish these i said picking a page off the four separate piles of paper until they shook in my hand as though they were being fluttered by an electric fan gareth looked at me for a minute youre getting them all out of order he said taking them from me and restacking them he shoved them between the stapler and banged it down with one hand nothing happened bloody things run out he said come on you can do them in the morning ill buy you a drink the bar was crowded with commuters who couldnt face the journey home yet gareth found me a bar stool i curled my feet round one of the legs trying to control the hammering in my heart in a minute i knew id wake up from a dream and be crying back in bed in putney he handed me a gin and tonic and shot soda into his whisky i took a slug of my drink at once gripping it with both hands to stop them shaking i glanced up at the smoked mirror behind the bar my eyes met gareths for a second we gazed at each other with a steady fascination as though we were two quite different people in another world for the first time i felt if his sleeve touched mine the whole bar would burst into flames i tugged my eyes away and took another gulp youve lost a lot of weight he said have i too much its the heat he glanced at the beige sausage rolls and curling sandwiches in the glass case dyou want something now i shook my head a fire engine clanged past the door followed by another dyou think itll ever rain again i said i noticed for the first time how tired he looked the black rings under his eyes almost as dark as his eyebrows is seafordbrennen too much of a sweat i said well its not exactly a day trip to llandudno he said jakeys very pleased with you by the way i felt myself blushing he is yep and so am i you havent just turned over a new leaf brennen its a bloody great tree he looked at me reflectively for a minute why have you been crying your eyes out all afternoon i took a hasty swig of my drink the glass was too deep and it ran all over my face im trying to get my head sorted out i said frantically wiping gin away with my sleeve so i started going to a shrink jesus you dont need a shrink hhe thinks i do he pounced on me today i started to tremble again for a moment gareths hand tightened on my arm then he said the bastard report him to the medical council i dont think you can report shrinks but it was a shock i sort of trusted him you give me his name and address and ill get him kicked out said gareth he was really angry god he was being so nice any minute id start crying again i took a bite of my lemon peel lorna rang me this afternoon i said she was in the country suddenly he looked evasive and shifty he got out a packet of cigarettes and when i refused one lit one for himself she said she had something special to tell me i went on but she wouldnt tell me over the telephone in case it upset me gareth shook his ice round in his glass do you want another drink i shook my head the lump was getting bigger and bigger in my throat she sounded over the moon like xander i continued i guess she was trying to tell me she was getting married yep said gareth thats about it soon i said pretty soon lornas one of those girls who wants to keep her virginity for marriage shes worried she cant hold out much longer bully for her i whispered she feels terribly guilty he went on shes worried stiff about upsetting you and she knows hesketh and bridget are going to say shes too young you cant win them all i said in a choked voice look octavia youre a beautiful beautiful girl there are plenty of other guys in the sea and masses on land for that matter sure i said numbly the tears beginning to course down my cheeks he took my hand it was all i could do not to fling myself into his arms im really sorry he went on look ive got nothing to do tonight ill buy you dinner and we can talk about it no you wont its very kind but no thank you i said wiping away the tears with the back of my hand ive already got a date and breaking away i slid off the bar stool and fled out of the bar octavia wait i heard his voice calling after me then i plunged down into the underground chapter eighteen when i got back to putney monkey threw himself on me yelping with ecstasy taking my hand in his mouth and leading me up the path i found mrs lonsdaletaylor grumbling about the heat and the greenfly and pouring boiling water on a plague of ants who were threatening to enter the house the dustmen were on strike and hadnt collected for two weeks the stench of jeyes fluid in the dustbins was almost worse than yesterdays smell of rotting food and vegetation mrs lonsdaletaylor straightened up scarlet in the face theres a young man waiting for you upstairs she said with a sniff he says hes your brother i bounded upstairs i couldnt wait to tell someone how miserable i was xander loved gareth too he would understand how suicidal i felt i found him in my bedroom his face had a luminous sickly tinge as though he was standing under a green umbrella a muscle was going in his cheek the ashtray beside him on the table was piled high with halfsmoked cigarettes thank god youve come he said im in dead trouble his light brown hair almost black from sweat had fallen in a fringe over his forehead emphasizing the brilliant grey eyes he looked absurdly young i ran across the room and put my arms round him whats happened tell me its not the baby he shook his head im sorry i said i havent got anything to drink tell me whats the matter ive got to get by tomorrow god whatever for im being blackmailed then you must go to the police at once i cant he said with a groan he was near to tears i realized i was the one who had to stay as calm and cool as a statue you must go to the police theyll keep your name out of it what on earth have you done it cant be that bad the door suddenly opened making us both jump but it was only monkey he trotted over and curled up at xanders feet i kicked the door shut who is it i asked its guido said xander in a dead voice guido the italian boy the goodlooking one you met that day we had lunch at freddys before you went on the boat with gareth and jeremy oh yes i remember i said that weekend you were away i refused to go and stay with ricky and joan yes i went down to devon with guido to a gay hotel oh god well one of his mates turned up another pretty boy also italian and we all got stoned of course and started taking polaroid photographs in the bedroom some of them went pretty far now guido and his pal want a couple of grand for a start and if i dont cough up tomorrow theyre going to send the photos to pammie and ricky i thought for a minute the scent of tobacco plants was almost sickening outside i could hear the outside tap water plummeting into mrs lts watering can dont you think pammie twigged long ago i said shes not stupid she cant admit it even to herself wouldnt it be better to tell her xanders voice broke not when shes pregnant she was so happy about the baby and suddenly everythings going so well at work and were getting on so much better at the moment there was no point in reminding him hed only been back from the middle east twentyfour hours rickyll throw me out and so will pamela and i know it sounds wet but i really want that baby youve got lots of rich friends what about gareth i said hell help you im getting on so well with him too said xander fretfully if you give in to guido this time hell only be back for more bread in a week or two if i get a breathing space said xander i can think of a way to hammer him i just need time oh for gods sake octavia his voice rose almost womanish ive helped you out enough times in the past it was true all right ill get you the money i said how ive got a friend whos offered me to do some modelling i said i guess i can push him up to as soon as xander had gone i went out to a telephone box and dialled andreass number i imagined him pushing aside a blonde and climbing over a huge pair of tits to answer the telephone hullo said the husky oily foreign voice andreas i said this is octavia there was a pause octavia brennen i know he said softly just let me turn this redhead down i was expecting a call from you you were i said sharply what dyou mean well the grapevine said you were having rather a lean time and youd left the flat pity it was a nice situation that flat anyway what can i do for you i swallowed do you remember what you said about photographing me for hedonist sure do he had difficulty keeping the triumph out of his voice you were talking in terms of i said i must have been crazy could you make it inflations clobbered everyone baby not that much your circulations booming i read it in campaign last week well if you make yourself available for er dinner and other things afterwards i might consider it he waited i could almost feel him writhing like a great snake in anticipation what the hell did it matter gareth was caput as far as i was concerned what did anything matter all right i said that would be nice but can i have the cash tomorrow greedy arent we i hope theres nothing the matter with you octavia ive never known you haggle before take it or leave it thats the sort of duchess you always were i wouldnt like you to be any different itd make me think things had a certain impermanence i need the bread i said all right his voice suddenly businesslike cy markovitz is in london at the moment ive booked him all day tomorrow come along at two in utter misery i realized i would have to cut the presentation but getting the money for xander had to be more important than anything else all right i said he gave me the address and then added softly and dont wear anything tight we dont want crease marks all over you till tomorrow darling you wont regret it i promise you after that i had to go and waitress when i got home i washed my hair and made pathetic attempts to get my body into some sort of shape to be photographed i then spent hours writing and tearing up letters of explanation to jakey even the final result didnt satisfy me i was so much on the blink i could hardly string a word let alone a sentence together and nothing i said could change the fact i was doing the dirty on him monkey lay on the bed dozing unsettled by the change in routine every so often he gave a yawn which turned into a squeaking yelp i refused to go to bed it was too hot to sleep anyway and if i did sleep i would have to wake up and face afresh the truth about gareth and lorna nothing not even the truth prepared me for the horror of the photographic session with andreas i felt as though i was hurtling on a fast train towards dantes ninth circle the one where the treacherous are sealed in ice and eternally ripped apart by satans teeth but id betrayed jakey so i deserved to be ripped apart i sat in a little side room in front of a mirror lined with lit bulbs wearing only an old makeupstained dressing gown the wireless claimed it was the hottest day of the year it was impossibly stuffy in the huge wimbledon studio cy markovitz had hired for the afternoon but i still couldnt stop shivering i knew i looked terrible i had covered my yellowing suntan with darkbrown makeup but it didnt stop my ribs sticking out like a belsen victim i had poured half a bottle of blue drops into my eyes but they were still redveined and totally without sparkle in one corner of the studio an amazing faggot called gabriel with very blue eyes and streaked strawberry blond hair clad only in faded kneelength denim trousers and a snake bracelet was whisking about supervising two sulky sweating minions into building a set for me it consisted of a huge bed with a cane bed head silver satin sheets and a white antique birdcage one minion kept staggering in with huge potted plants the other was pinning dark brown patterned habitat wallpaper to a huge rolleddown screen gabriel was arranging a christopher wray lamp a silver teapot and glass paper weights on a bedside table andreas asked for something really classy to set you off darling ive never known him to take so much interest in another corner of the studio to an accompaniment of popping flashbulbs and ella fitzgerald on the gramophone cy markovitz was photographing a spectacular looking black girl with measurements she was wearing red lace open crotch pants heels with nine inch spikes and was writhing against a huge fur rug which was pinned against the wall its to make her black boobs fall better explained gabriel with a shudder in the pix itll look as though shes lying on a bed i turned back to the mirror sweat already breaking through my newly applied makeup then i heard the noise of men laughing my mouth went dry my shivering became more violent next moment the curtain was pushed aside and andreas came in reeking of brandy and aftershave a big cigar sticking out of his mouth even heat and drink hadnt brought any flush of pink to his mantanned cheeks he was carrying a bottle of charles heidsieck and two glasses which he put on the dressing table i clutched the white dressing gown tighter round me for a long time he stood behind me looking into the mirror his eyes as triumphant as they were predatory then he said in his oily sibilant voice you look a bit rough baby been up against it have you ive been working hard andreas laughed youre not cut out for a career i always warned you and gareth llewellyns ditched you i knew he would you must listen to uncle andreas in future he seemed to revel in my utter desperation never mind he went on soothingly ill see you right a few weeks of cushy living and youll soon get the ripe peachy look you had at grayston he ran his hands over me lingeringly and feelingly like a child trying to gauge the contents of a wrapped christmas present i gritted my teeth trying to suppress the shudder of revulsion he let go of me and started to take the gold paper off the top of the champagne bottle i watched his soft white hands in horror god knows what they wouldnt be doing to me later this evening i took a deep breath can i have the cash now andreas shook his head uhuh you get the cash when you deliver the goods and theyd better be good the top shot off the bottle into the rafters andreas filled a glass and handed it to me that should relax you he said make you feel nice and sexy i took a belt of champagne wondering if i was going to throw up come in boys shouted andreas over the curtain and we were joined by a couple of andreas hood friends flashing jewellery sweating in waisted suits they were the sort of guys whod give even the mafia nightmares meet mannie and vic said andreas he must have brought them along to show me off they were obviously disappointed i wasnt as fantastic as andreas had promised but were too wary of him to show it you wait till shes been with me for a bit purred andreas pinching my cheek you wont recognize her fattening her up for christmas are you said mannie and they all laughed cy markovitz having finished with the black girl wandered over and said he was almost ready he was a tall exhausted and melancholy man in his late forties wearing army trousers sneakers and a khaki shirt drenched with sweat come and meet octavia said andreas refilling my glass shes a bit nervous first time shes done anything like this so treat her with care lovely isnt she he added smoothing my hair back from my forehead cy markovitz nodded he was after all being paid vast sums by andreas and said the camera would go up in smoke when it saw me you neednt worry about the pix he went on well shoot through a softfocus lens with the emphasis on the face and the direct gaze very subdued and elegant oh god what would gareth say if he ever saw the results i imagined him suddenly stumbling across them as he flicked through magazines on some foreign newsstand his face hardening with disapproval then shrugging his shoulders because hed always known i was a bad lot was it really worth going through with it to help xander was blood really thicker than water ready when you are darlings said gabriel popping his golden head round the curtain andreas gave me a big smile come on baby youll enjoy it once we get started i sat on the silver satin sheets gazing in misery on the forest of potted plants the studio seemed to be very full of people all watching me with bored appraising eyes i huddled even deeper into my dressing gown cy markovitz came over to me youre not going to need that he said gently as i took it off even markovitz caught his breath andreas thug friends were trying to preserve their poker faces but their eyes were falling out i told you she was the nearest thing to a vargas girl you were ever likely to see said andreas smugly cy was gazing into the viewfinder his assistant took some polaroid pictures peeling them off like a wet bikini andreas and cy pored over them well need the cold blower to stiffen her nipples said cy andreas was determined to get his lbs of flesh two agonizing hours later i had been photographed in every conceivable position and garment including a white fox fur with a string of pearls hanging over one breast a soaking wet cheesecloth shirt black stockings and a suspender belt and nothing but an ostrich feather gabriel who was fast losing his cool had been sent out to hire a persian cat for me to cuddle but after seconds of popping flash bulbs the poor creature having lacerated my stomach with its claws wriggled out of my clutches and took refuge in the rafters now i was stretched out on the satin sheets wearing a sort of rucked up camisole top cy markovitz clicked away keeping up a running commentary lovely darling just pull it down over your right shoulder look straight into the camera a bit more wind machine gabriel please come on octavia baby relax and let me have it shut your eyes lick your lips and caress yourself no i whispered i wont do that markovitz sighed extracted the roll of film from the camera licked the flap sealed it up and taking another roll from the assistant replaced it turn over he said bury your face in the sheets stick your ass in the air and freeze in that position i cant freeze when im absolutely baking i snapped hold it said markovitz hold it thats fanbloodytastic come over and have a look andreas andreas joined him they conferred in low voices then andreas came and sat down on the bed beside me filling up my glass youre too uptight baby he said youre not coming across how can i when youre all here gawping at me it was like the times when i was a child and my mother insisted on being present when the doctor examined me youll have to try and once again i realized how much he was enjoying my utter humiliation paying me back for all the times id put him down in the past i lay back on the bed open your legs a bit further open wide thats lovely said cy clicking away any moment hed ask me to say ah after this was all over i supposed i could go out and throw myself over westminster bridge gabriel was still whisking about adjusting plants his bronzed hairless pectorals gleaming in the lights why dont we dress her up as a nun and let angelica seduce her he said then it wouldnt matter her looking so uptight thats an interesting thought said andreas there was a knock on the door one of the assistants unlocked it and let in a girl in a red dress with long black hair and a pale witchy heavily madeup face she looked furious and vaguely familiar perhaps miraculously she was going to take over from me hi angelica said markovitz go and get your clothes off well take a break for ten minutes she was on the gatefold of penetration this month said one of gabriels minions the blurb said daddy was a regular soldier and that angelica was reading philosophy at university and spent the vacation pottering round ruins you could hardly call andreas a ruin said gabriel andreas opened another bottle of champagne ive booked a table at skindles tonight he said caressing my shoulder with a moist hand i thought in this heat itd be nice to get out of london he took a powder puff from one of cys assistants and carefully took the shine off my nose tears of utter despair stung my eyelids if you could find a horse said the other of gabriels minions shed make a stunning godiva shut up hissed gabriel theres a riding school round the corner ive had enough hassle getting that bloody cat a few minutes later angelica emerged from behind the curtain wearing only a red feather boa and a corn plaster she walked sulkily up to the bed looking at andreas with the mixture of terror and loathing such as a lion might regard a sadistic ringmaster youve already met angelica burtonbrown havent you octavia said andreas he seemed to be laughing at some private joke i dont think so i began then realized that she was one of the tarts andreas had brought down to grayston she was now glaring in my direction clytemnestra could hardly have looked more blackly on agamemnon come and lie down angelica said andreas patting the bed she stretched out beside me her blacklined eyes not quite closed underneath each false eyelash was a millimetre of dark venomous light raying straight in my direction trust andreas to set up a scene that tortured both past and intended mistress hows that he said to cy they make a good contrast dont they profane and notsosacred love i got to my feet and reached under the bed for the dressing gown youve finished with me then andreas put a heavy hand on my shoulder pressing me down again on the contrary he said were only just beginning put the nuns headdress on angelica he said to gabriel she looked so utterly ridiculous talk about sour angelica that i was hard put not to giggle with hysterical laughter but not for long the next moment andreas had hung a cross round my neck kneel beside her angelica he went on thats right as close as you can i felt as though great toads were crawling all over me i gazed down at the cross hanging between my breasts perhaps if i held it up to andreas he would suddenly age hundreds of years and shrivel into dust like count dracula now put your hand on octavias shoulder he said i jumped away as i felt her fingers no i screamed no i wont do it i wont cut it out said andreas do you want two grand or not i looked at him mutinously then i remembered xander and nodded angelica looked about as cheerful as a cat with toothache shed obviously never had bread like that from him andreas ruffled the sheets round us and gazed into the viewfinder very nice he said softly a bit more amiable both of you cy took over again put your hand on octavias throat angelica he said i steeled myself feeling the tense hatred in her fingers the sweat was glistening on her black moustache lovely said cy now slide your hand down a bit angelica and down a bit further i couldnt bear it even for xander i couldnt take any more i shot a despairing supplicating glance at andreas and was appalled by the expression of suppressed excitement on his face i felt the tears coursing down my cheeks then suddenly there was a tremendous crash outside everyone jumped as someone started pummelling on the door its the fuzz squeaked gabriel in excitement patting his curls you cant go in there screamed a female voice the studios booked oh yes i bloody can shouted a voice there was another tremendous crash the door seemed to tremble then suddenly caved in i gave a gasp half of relief and half of horror for in the doorway fierce as ten furies terrible as hell stood gareth slowly he looked round the room taking in first cy then andreas and his hood cronies then finally me on the bed with angelica with a whimper i pulled one of the satin sheets round me what the bloody hells going on he howled walking across the studio towards me you whore you bloody cheap whore i might have known youd end up like this get your clothes on andreas moved towards him take it easy big boy he said softly dont get so excited gareth turned on him you lousy creep he hissed i know how long youve been scheming to get your dirty hands on her ill get you for this go on he added out of the corner of his mouth to me for christs sake get dressed i stood up still too frightened to move how on earth did you know she was here asked gabriel looking at him with admiration andreas shouldnt go round boasting in restaurants said gareth these things get overheard look wise guy andreas was talking slowly and patiently now as though he was dictating to an inexperienced secretary youre gatecrashing a very important party cys booked for the day and sos octavia and neither of them for peanuts she needs the money dont you octavia gareth glanced in my direction i nodded miserably so you cant come barging in here making a nuisance of yourself said andreas oh cant i said gareth with ominous quiet there was a long pause then suddenly he went berserk turning he kicked cys camera across the room then he smashed his fist into cys face sending him flying after the camera the next moment hed laid out cys assistant with a punishing upper cut then vic the hood picked up a rubber plant and hurled it at gareth who ducked just in time and gathering up another plant hurled it back screaming like a stuck pig still in the nuns headdress angelica dived under the bed followed immediately by the two minions and gabriel oh dear sighed gabriel as two more plants sailed through the air burnham wood came to dunsinane now its going back again ducking to avoid more flying vegetation i shook off the silk sheets ran across the room dived behind the curtain and started to pull on my clothes by the sound of it gareth was still laying about him like a maddened bull as i looked out he was having a punchup with mannie who wrongfooted him and sent him crashing to the ground the next moment gareth had got to his feet and thrown mannie into the middle of the remaining potted plants oh my poor jardinière wailed gabriels voice from under the bed what will the plant shop say as i crept out from behind the curtain a silver teapot and two glass paperweights flew across the room none of them fortunately hitting their target gareth paused he was breathing heavily cy was still nursing his jaw in the corner mannie was peering out of the plants like a spy in lattaque vic was shaking his head and picking himself up cys assistant got to his feet as he started edging nervously towards the door gareth grabbed him by the collar no you dont he said where are those rolls of film come on or ill beat you to a pulp his fingers closed round the boys neck over there on the trolley choked the boy in terror gareth pocketed the rolls as i sidled round the wall towards him he glanced in my direction and jerked his head towards the door he was just backing towards it himself when vic moved in catching him off guard with a blow to the right eye gareth slugged him back sending him hurtling across the room then trying to right himself tripped over one of the light wires and cannoned heavily into a pile of tripods it was getting more like tom and jerry every minute next minute andreas whod been watching the whole proceedings without lifting a finger picked up the champagne bottle and cracking it on the underneath of the bed moved with incredible speed across the room towards gareth cornered gareth scrambled out of the tripods shaking his head his right eye was beginning to close up his forehead just above his eyebrow was bleeding where vics gold ring had gashed it he backed away from andreas until he reached the wall now then big boy murmured andreas his voice almost a caress ill teach you to get tough with me he brandished the jagged edge of the bottle in gareths face give me back that film gareth stared at him not a muscle moving in his face you lousy cheap punk he said then i froze with horror as i saw that mannie had extracted himself from the potted plants and armed with a flick knife was moving relentlessly in from the right without thinking i picked up the christopher wray lamp and hurled it at him slap on target just for a second andreas concentration flickered giving gareth the chance to leap on him knocking him to the floor over and over they rolled like tommy brook and mr tod yelling abuse at each other then finally gareth was on top smashing his fists into andreas head for a minute i thought he was going to kill him then he got up picked andreas up and threw him through the habitat wallpaper like a clown through a hoop there was another long pause gareth looked slowly round the room everyone flattened themselves against the wall or the floor then suddenly there was the sound of clapping and angelica emerged from under the bed her nuns headdress askew ive been waiting three years for someone to do that she said blood was pouring from gareths arm he must have jagged it on andreas bottle youll bleed to death i moaned gathering up a peach silk petticoat that was lying on the floor well bags i give him the kiss of life said a little voice from under the bed gareth grabbed my wrist come on lets get out of here chapter nineteen i hoped gareth had worked off his rage breaking up cys studio but as we stormed up parkside towards london with wimbledon common on our right the full storm of his fury broke over me i tried to help you he yelled we all did jakeys nursed you like a baby through the last eight weeks and then you have to pick this afternoon to blow the whole thing just when jakey needed you i dont understand you octavia have you got some sort of death wish dont you care about anyone he overtook another car you could have got fag paper between them thank god we were going against the traffic homegoing commuters crawling in the other direction stared at us in amazement some of them were stopping to put their hoods up the stifling heat hadnt let up but an ominous bilberry dark sky had replaced the serene unclouded blue of the morning why did you do it said gareth overtaking yet again go on i want to know i cant tell you sure you cant well ill tell you youre so bloody idle you cant resist making a quick buck from andreas but my god youd have paid for it hed have broken you in a couple of months we were passing wimbledon windmill now i gazed stonily at the driedup pond and the great sweeps of platinumbleached grass blackened everywhere by fires gareth warmed to his subject i guess youre turned on at the thought of all those men on newsstands slobbering over your photograph misting up windows in soho to get a second glance at your tits not to mention the ones in bedsitters wearing raincoats theyd hardly keep their macs on in the bedroom i protested dont be flippant he howled we had reached the roundabout at tibbets corner now but he was so incensed he kept missing the turning off to putney and had to go round three times which didnt improve his temper dont you give a fuck about your reputation i dont care i snapped i needed the bread in a hurry that was all but youre so wellheeled you wouldnt understand things like that gareth turned on me enraged havent you any idea how poor we were when i was a child i dont want to hear i said putting my hands over my ears ive read d h lawrence i know quite enough already about poverty at the pithead im just fed up with you going round censoring my behaviour who the hell do you think you are mary whitehouse you great welsh prude youve called me that already he said what i shouted my hands still over my ears dont bug me he shouted back and seizing my arm yanked my hand away from my ear i sat very still watching the white marks left by his fingers slowly turning red then out of the corner of my eye i noticed the peach silk petticoat id tied round his arm completely drenched in blood and a red stain creeping down his blue check shirt hed gone very white suddenly the fight went out of me for gods sake lets call a truce and go to roehampton hospital you need stitches in that arm i said i dont want any stitches he said screeching to a halt at the top of my road leaning across he opened the door now get out or ill throw you out and dont come grovelling back to jakey either youre on your own from now on and swinging the car round he drove off in a cloud of dust as soon as hed gone i began to shake again how the hell was i going to tell xander i hadnt got the money i hadnt got the rent either mrs lonsdaletaylor was sure to sling me out the trauma of the afternoon had left me in a state of total shock numbly i walked towards the river kicking my shoes off when i came to the common not even noticing the sharp dry grass cutting into my feet a large drop of rain fell on the path in front of me perhaps at last the drought was at an end the poplar trees by the bowling green clattered their leaves in a sudden gust of wind the light was curious as though one was swimming under water picnickers and dogwalkers hurried home looking anxiously up at the sky even the rooks were silent the river bank was covered with coke tins bottles and old icecream cartons two dogs were splashing about in the water cooling off i wished i had monkey for company a large drop of warm rain splashed on my face then on my hand the discoloured sky was suddenly veined by lightning followed three seconds later by an earthshattering clap of thunder the whole valley seemed to be boiling the rain was coming down faster now pattering on the leaves above me pitting the river with rings bouncing off the ironhard ground another flash of lightning unzipped the sky followed by another far more brilliant which seemed to snake down the centre of a huge elm tree only fifty yards away and rip it apart then the whole sky exploded with rain i didnt care i wanted to be struck down i put back my head feeling the drops dripping down my neck cascading on my face washing away all the horrible stage makeup in two minutes i was drenched the lightning was coming at the same time as the thunderclaps now it sounded like gareth up in heaven breaking up another studio i dont know how many hours i wandered round half crazy with grief i felt like lear poor naked wretches wheresoer you are that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm then suddenly it was getting dark and the storm was moving away grumbling like a drunk turned out of the pub the rain was letting up night was falling in the distance i could see the orange lights on the roads around the common it must be nearly ten oclock xander mrs lonsdaletaylor and the music had to be faced listlessly i started to walk home i was frozen and drenched the temperature had probably dropped to the seventies but after weeks up in the nineties it felt like midwinter my pink smock worn on andreas instructions had instructions of its own on the label about being only drycleaned wetcleaned it had shrunk drastically risen to miniskirt level and was now clinging to every inch of my body my hair was hanging in dripping tendrils people giving their dogs last runs before bedtime looked at me strangely as i wandered barefoot past them the whole common was steaming now like a crocodile swamp i walked listlessly up the street the drenched gardens bowed down under their great weight of water the gutters ran like millstreams the street lamps reflected in the wet pavement i paused outside my digs trying to screw up enough courage to go in rubbing the rain from my eyelashes the iron gate was icecold beneath my touch the next minute monkey hurtled out of the front door and threw himself on me yelping hysterically licking my hands scrabbling at my bare legs with his claws i tried to creep up the stairs past mrs lonsdaletaylor but she shot out of the kitchen her tough roast beef face rigid with disapproval damn storms snapped off half the delphiniums she said oh im sorry what a shame after the way youve nursed them through the drought i said sidling up the stairs but she was not to be deflected where on earth have you been your office has been ringing all day people have been calling in youre not in any trouble are you i hope youve remembered the rent ill get it by tomorrow i had reached the bend in the stairs now the agreement was every fourth friday in the month she called after me so id like it now and theres someone waiting for you upstairs i told you i wont have men in after nine oclock he must go at once with a heavy heart i climbed the next flight it must be xander waiting for the cash i opened the door the room was in darkness then my heart gave a lurch a man was standing against the window no one could mistake the width of those shoulders it was gareth what are you doing here i whispered looking for you he said i dont understand i love you he said simply and i cant go on anymore i ran towards him oh please hold me he put his arms round me and as he kissed me i felt the strength and warmth and love flowing out of him oh darling he muttered into my hair christ im sorry i was so angry this afternoon but i was so jealous and i didnt understand what was going on i couldnt help it i said starting to sob hysterically it was the only way i could get the cash i know it was hush sweetheart hush ive been with xander since i left you i was so miserable i had to talk to someone he told me everything oh god whats he going to do he told pamela then he went to the police it was the only hope i took him to the station and held his hand for the first half hour hell be all right but what did pamela say and ricky darling i really couldnt care less i couldnt let xander down i muttered hes always looked after me i know i know youre a bloody star i just wish youd come to me instead of andreas now for gods sake get out of those wet clothes he let go of me and switched on the light my legs wouldnt hold me up any longer so i sat down on the bed gazing dumbly at him his right eye had closed up completely now he was still wearing the same bloodstained shirt but at least someone had bandaged up his arm the next moment hed pulled my suitcase down from the top of the wardrobe and taking my dresses off the hangers started throwing them in what are you doing packing youre getting out of here i havent got anywhere else to go i whispered youre coming home with me but i cant lorna wouldnt like it whats she got to do with it he picked up my cornflower blue dress you were wearing that the first time i met you put it on now he put it on the bed but you and lorna i was gagging on the words arent you going to get married he stopped for a second his hands full of my underwear what on earth gave you that idea she did she said you and she not me charlie charlie i said stupidly charlie but how on earth they met at your place said gareth the night she stayed with you he asked her to come along to the shop started taking her out and bingo she said you said you were crazy about someone that night she assumed it was charlie thats why she felt so awful about telling you oh god i said it was you all the time i never stopped loving you for a moment since that evening i was sick on the boat god what a stupid muddle and i started to laugh but it went wrong in the middle and i started to cry again gareth chucked the rest of my underclothes into the suitcase and put his arms round me holding me so tight i thought my ribs would crack now for heavens sake get that dress off or ill strip it off you myself i started to blush i cant while youre looking he grinned after that matinée earlier i cant see much point in false modesty then he must have seen something in my face because he turned his back and started talking to monkey who was sitting shivering in the suitcase id just peeled off my wet smock when there was a loud knocking on the door i grabbed a towel as mrs lonsdaletaylor walked in miss brennen she spluttered ive told you i wont have men in my house you must leave at once she added to gareth shell be out of here in five minutes said gareth curtly so beat it dont you dare address me like that young man said mrs lonsdaletaylor what about my rent she owes me gareth put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a wad of notes he counted out six tenners and gave them to her then he looked at poor little monkey still shuddering in the suitcase how much dyou want for the dog hes not for sale he belonged to my late husband ten quid said gareth well it doesnt seem right twenty said gareth thrusting the notes into her hand now get out you fat bitch and bully someone your own size three quarters of an hour later gareth and his two waifs had reached home and were sitting in the drawingroom although i was wearing one of his sweaters and nursing a large glass of brandy i was assailed once again by a terrible fit of shaking the tension was unbearable the only sound was monkey gnawing ecstatically on the remains of a leg of mutton which gareth had found him in the fridge hes happy said gareth now its my turn come here i cant i said in a stifled voice all right ill come to you he sat down on the sofa about a foot away from me i gazed desperately at my brandy im now going to give you a short lecture he said if you had any idea what ive been through since we got back from the boat wanting you so fucking badly i thought id go up in smoke i know i showed it in a funny way fighting it because i didnt want to betray myself because i couldnt see any way that you could possibly feel the same way about me the reason i finally agreed to take over seafordbrennen was because it gave me a chance to keep in touch with you and that wasnt the only length i went to sucking up to your degenerate brother xander in the hope he might put in a good word for me ringing jakey every evening to see you were ok why do you suppose none of the guys there ever laid a finger on you because id have fired them if they had i dont bbelieve you i said incredulously dont interrupt he said youre also right about my being a welsh prude i couldnt stand anyone coming near you i nearly went spare over jeremy and charlie this afternoon as you saw i flipped my lid you were wonderful i breathed putting a hand up to touch his poor bruised eye he grinned imprisoning my hand against his cheek theres something to be said for being brought up in the valley then i talked to xander he told me about your childhood and your parents and what a lousy deal you had all along but thats all over now and kneeling beside me he took me in his arms i started to cry whats the matter he whispered its no good i sobbed i love you more than anything else in the world im crucified with longing for you but thats just in my heart you were right from the beginning i am frigid ive been to bed with so many men i can hardly remember but i hated it with all of them i can put on a good act but inside i just freeze up hush lovie hush he was stroking me in that soothing way you might gentle a horse im telling you this because i love you im no good to you im the best judge of that he said youve never been properly loved in your life just spoilt and told to push off and play somewhere else and produced to show off when grownups came to tea because youre so beautiful come on he went on pulling me to my feet and leading me towards the bedroom lets not muck about any more no i shrank away from him youd be disappointed i couldnt fake it with you i wont because i dont expect anything weve got to get used to each other in the bedroom he switched on a sidelight illuminating the vast double bed and drew back the fur counterpane as he undressed me with undeniable deftness i thought of all the women he must have laid on that bed before me i felt like a novice horse entering the horse of the year show for the first time with the jumps up to six feet and all the previous competitors having had clear rounds once we were in bed he just held me very gently until the horrors of the day began to recede then he said im not going to lay a finger on you tonight youre too tired i felt a stab of disappointment at least i dont think i am he went on putting a warm hand on my tits spanning both nipples with finger and thumb look he whispered i can stretch an octavia i giggled thats better come on lovely remember from now on ive got custody care and control of you and im not going to leave you like your bloody mother did ever again and with infinite tenderness he kissed me until i felt the waves of lust begin to ripple through me its friday he said as his hand edged downwards weve got the whole weekend ahead we neednt get up at all then later he said relax sweetheart dont try so hard theres no hurry i actually like doing these things for you then later more harshly stop fighting me were on the same side then suddenly it happened like a great glorious whooshing washing machine its the only way i can describe it leaving me shuddering and shuddering with pleasure at the end like the last gasps of the spindryer and afterwards i cried some more because i was so happy and he held me in his arms telling me how much he loved me until i fell asleep a few hours later the dawn woke me wed forgotten to draw the curtains all i could see were huge windows framing the plane trees of holland park i blinked turned and found gareth looking at me i must be dreaming i put my hand out to touch his cheek are you real i said incredulously he smiled i am if you are his eye had turned black his chest was covered in bruises i think im in bed with henry cooper i said i never dreamt hed make such a sensational lover do you think we could possibly do it again and we did and it was even better than the last time and i screamed with delight and joy because id been so clever when i woke again he wasnt there i looked round in panic then i found a note pinned to the pillow gone shopping with monkey back about eleven i love you g still overwhelmed with wonder at what was happening to me i got up wrapped myself in a towel and wandering into the kitchen found a pile of unopened mail i flipped through it three envelopes were written in distinctively female hands i turned them over one was from someone called michelle in france another from a sally in the middle east another hadnt put her name on the back but it was postmarked taunton and shed written private and confidential on the bottom i stood overwhelmed with terror gareth had had millions of women before me what was to stop him having millions in the future last nights protestations might have been just a ruse to get me into bed i couldnt bear it i went back into the bedroom and sat shaking on the bed feeling myself pulled down into the familiar black slimy cavern of horror keep calm i kept saying to myself its all right suddenly i jumped out of my skin as the telephone rang it was mrs smith hes not here i said i could feel myself bristling well thats all right just give him a message that everythings ok ill tell him i said stiffly mrs smith laughed im so glad you two have finally got it together she said hes been absolutely insufferable since he came back from that boat trip itll be nice working for a human being again oh i stammered feeling myself blushing all over do you mean to say was it that obvious yes she said hes a very dear man i think youre very lucky and if you look behind the drawingroom door you might find something else to convince you she dropped the receiver i ran to the drawingroom behind the door were two canvases stacked against the wall i turned them over and gave a gasp of delight one was my adam and eve picture the other the cotman i looked at them incredulously tears filling my eyes then i heard a key in the door and a scampering of feet monkey rushing up the stairs reached me first but the next moment i was in gareths arms with monkey frolicking and frisking round our feet i was worried some of andreas hoods might have got you annabel smith says youve been like a bear with a sore head since the boat trip i gabbled incoherently and you bought back my pictures its the nicest thing anyones ever done for me i cant believe it when did you do it i added as we went upstairs last week sometime i didnt hang them i thought you could decide where you want to put them but im not having adam and eve over the bed to distract you whenever we have sex i went scarlet i suppose bloody xander told you that he stopped in the doorway of the kitchen and kissed me on my bare shoulder christ youre beautiful octavia do you feel you can really put up with a jumpedup welsh gorilla for the rest of your life then he kissed me on the mouth xander ought to be shot i said when i could speak blushing even more furiously he laughed im only teasing you the telephone rang if thats mrs smith again she said you werent to worry about anything i said it was xander gareth listened for a minute then he said thats great talk to octavia hullo darling said xander he sounded very cheerful are you all right i said well things have been pretty heavy ricky made the most awful scene and i hoped very much joan was going to have a coronary but pammie was staunchness personified she told them both to get stuffed and the police have pulled in that little snake guido so all in all things havent turned out too badly and i must tell you he lowered his voice i do fall on my feet there is the most enchanting constable in the cid here whos been too marvellous to me xander you are awful well since youve taken gareth away i had to find some compensation look im terribly sorry id no idea youd have to take your clothes off to get me that money gareth was frying bacon and eggs when i came off the telephone stroking monkey i told him about the police constable hes quite incorrigible said gareth all the same hell be nice as a brotherinlaw my hand stopped in midstroke gareth turned the bacon thoughtfully then he shot a sideways glance in my direction what did you say i whispered i said i was looking forward to having him as a brotherinlaw you shouldnt tease i stammered im not teasing i told you id been shopping this morning he extracted a dark blue leather box from his pocket his hand shook slightly as he handed it to me so did mine as i opened it i had terrible trouble with the clasp inside was the biggest sapphire id ever seen oh i breathed is it really for me no one else he switched off the bacon and slid it onto my finger wwhat about your harem of girls annabel smith and co ill give them up if you will you dont have to marry me i said oh yes i do he said im not a welsh prude for nothing i want to regularize things particularly for monkey make him feel more secure i giggled im going to put my mark on you so no one else can get near you he went on his eyes suddenly serious but i warn you baby even if we have to fight like cats im going to wear the trousers youre going to do what i tell you and if you start upstaging me ill put you down the boys in the valley are like that we keep our women in the background and we beat them if they give us any trouble but we know how to love them suddenly i felt my knees giving way with lust could we possibly do it again just very quickly before breakfast i asked we never made it to the bedroom but the kitchen floor proved perfectly satisfactory the end
