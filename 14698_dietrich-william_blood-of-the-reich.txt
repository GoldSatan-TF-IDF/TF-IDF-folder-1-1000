william dietrich blood of the reich the chief task of the tibet expedition was political and military not scientific details may not be revealed reich propaganda minister joseph goebbels in a memo to german newspapers my ambition is to see all of physics reduced to a formula so elegant and simple that it will easily fit on the front of a tshirt physicist leon lederman berlin germany march f irst day of spring and pregnant with the same expectancy that gripped kurt raeder at his unexpected summons from reichsfuhrerss heinrich himmler the prussian sky was cold ragged sunlight dappling the german capital with that glitter atop iron that promised an end to winter so might himmler be the pagan sun to part the clouds of raeders stalled career so might raeder win his own expedition we have read with interest your books on tibet the summons stated with that simple missive the explorer had been yanked out of the ennui of his university teaching and the gloom of his wifes death the opportunity like the twin lightning bolts of the ss rune as raeder walked from the ubahn into the heart of nazi power berlin seemed to share his anticipation the city was its habitual gray buds swollen but little green on the trees yet the paving was bright from a nights rain however and the capital seemed poised purposeful like one of the new steel tanks that had waited on the border for the anschluss with austria just nine days before now the two nations were united in a single german reich and once more public apprehension about a nazi gamble had turned to excitement bright as the red swastika banners vivid as a wound all the world was waiting to see what germany would do next all germany was waiting to see what hitler would do next his new order was improbably succeeding and on wilhelmstrasse marble blocks and columns were stacked to the sky where the fuhrer s imposing chancellery was rising speer had promised completion in less than a year and workers scrambled across the pile like frenzied ants people watched with pride raeder secretly liked the theatricality of his black ss uniform and the medieval ritual of ss indoctrination it meant brotherhood the satisfaction of being one of the chosen entry into the new german knighthood in suggested by a politician friend had been a way to establish aryan ancestry and win a measure of grudging deference in a university system glacial in its advancements but while appointments had come quicker with the exodus of the jews raeders brief fame had not solidified into promotion university intellectuals were snobbish toward the nazis at school raeder had mostly avoided the costume preferring to blend in with high starched collar and restricting tie through years of brief celebrity dull instruction and finally private tragedy but now the reichsfuhrer ss had somehow taken notice here was the hinge of raeders life so the young professor had put on the schutzstaffel uniform with its runic insignia both proud and selfconscious when his faculty colleague gosling spied him from a cafe and joked about it the zoologist managed the good humor to shrug even scholars have to eat life the nazis preached was struggle raeder knew he cut a fine ss figure brown hair a shade too dark to be ideal perhaps but handsome and fit from his explorations erect wiry what a german youth might wish to be the new man the aryan prototype crack shot alpinist university scholar hunter author and scientist for the third reich lottes death had not been publicized out of deference to his achievements his selfdoubt he kept to himself almost unconsciously berliners swerved around his uniform on the crowded wilhelmstrasse a caution he accepted as normal the ss was not to be loved himmler had preached but untersturmfuhrer kurt raeder adventurer his resolute gaze had been in magazines women swept by him and peeked pedestrians thinned as he walked past the sterile massive headquarters of gorings new air ministry the power of the luftwaffe implied by its modernist bulk and then thinned still more as he turned left onto prinzalbrechtstrasse and arrived at number the most notorious address in nazi germany here was the home of the reich security ministry which included the ss and gestapo next door was number the prinzalbrechtpalais hotel also subsumed by the growing security bureaucracy to raeders eye the home of the police was a more inviting structure than the plain severity of gorings headquarters with classical arched entry and renaissance styling the ss buildings harkened back to the more refined nineteenth century only the blackclad sentries who flanked the door hinted at its new purpose there were rumors of gestapo cells in the basement there were always rumors everywhere of the very worst things this was good raeder believed menace promised security to those who followed the rules none could deny the nazis had brought order out of chaos while the democracies were flailing the totalitarian modelsgermany italy spain japanwere on the rise this building was the fist of the future raeders future there was a hush inside like a church a grand stairway with thick balustrade steps carpeted in red plush like a movie palace led up a flight to a vaulted entry hall the only decorations were three hanging swastika flags and busts of hitler and goring public depictions of himmler were rare his power was his air of mystery bare wooden benches as uncomfortable as pews lined one side of the waiting area glacial light filtering in from arched frosted windows at the far end three steps led to another entry like an altar raeder thought continuing the church analogy with blackclad guards presiding instead of blackrobed priests himmler had modeled his elite on the jesuits and ss zeal on the discipline of the inquisition raeders credentials were checked and he was admitted to a more private reception area the offices beyond barricaded by a massive counter of darkstained oak stout as a dam now a more thorough check this time by a blondheaded nordic guard of the type the ss put on its posters the officer scrutinized his insignia skeptically an untersturmfuhrer to see the reichsfuhrer raeder showed the letter that had summoned the ss lieutenant from his residence in the respectable wilmersdorf district the apartment haunted now since lottes death the reichsfuhrer expects all ranks to serve the comment drew no reaction from a man with the expressiveness of a robot wait the explorer stood stiffly as the orderly spoke into a telephone and then returned it to its cradle the guard didnt bother to look at raeder again long minutes passed raeder could hear the faint clack of heels on tile the cricketmurmur of typewriter keys and code machines the rumble of wooden file drawers sliding out and slamming home each muffled ring of distant phone was answered before it could jangle a second time all was whispered as if the ministry building had been selected to absorb sound was noise from the basement muted too the colors were institutional green and cream the lights a somber yellow this way professor raeder another ss officer a sturmbanfuhrer thicker and pinker briskly led him into the maze of corridors beyond they wound one way and another climbed a flight of stairs and wound again raeder was perhaps deliberately lost the office doors they passed were shut shapes moving behind obscured glass the few people in the hallways were male hurried boots drumming conversation a murmur the walls were blank floors gleamed the calm efficiency the monkish concentration the paperandglue smell of a library it was admirable and disquieting then more ss guards as strapping as vikings snapped to attention a double door swung open and they came to a highceilinged anteroom paneled in beech sentries checked raeder for weapons and scrutinized his identification once again no one smiled or spoke more than the minimum it was a wordless play the anteroom dim windowless he was in the middle of a vast hive a knock on a side door an answering buzz and he was ushered through raeder expected another corridor but instead found himself in a modest painted office with a lower ceiling than in the anteroom outside a single window looked out on a courtyard the wall it faced blank stone no one from outside could look in there was a large but plain desk left over from some prussian ministry and three leather chairs in front of it behind sat the second most powerful man in germany himmler looked up from a manila file and gave raeder an owlish blink with round spectacles receding chin and narrow shoulders the reichsfuhrer ss was nothing like his praetorians outside in fact he resembled a bank clerk or schoolmaster he had a thin mustache pale skin and white fastidious womanly hands his hair was shaved close to the skull above his ears in the dull helmet shape of prussian fashion a much fiercer portrait of the fuhrer looked down on them with burning zeal that shock of black hair that punctuating mustache the office was otherwise absent of decoration there were no personal pictures or mementos just a wall of books many of them old leatherbound and cracked raeder couldnt read the faded titles the reichsfuhrer s desk was as neat as that of an accountant stacks of files with colored tabs precisely squared and ranked either this was not himmlers regular office or the reichsfuhrer had no need of the baronial opulence of a hermann goring the abstention was eerie himmler closed the folder and turned it so raeder could discern his own name and picture sit the zoologist did so sinking into a chair its legs had been trimmed so that he almost squatted looking up at himmler the reichsfuhrer smiled thinly as if to relax his guest but the chilliness simply reinforced the mans power there was something oddly vacant about the personality he projected as if raeder were meeting with a facade then himmler abruptly leaned forward in a disconcertingly intense way with a predatory glare like an insect eyes obscured behind the reflection of the glasses purpose ignited as if with a match untersturmfuhrer the security minister began without preamble folding his hands on raeders folder do you believe in the importance of blood seattle united states september present day h e was cute he was checking her out and he was a frozen foods guy rominy pickett believed a mans character could be divined by his location in the supermarket a method at least as reliable as the signs of the zodiac she usually dismissed males spotted in the beerandchips aisle on the theory they might represent the manchildslob archetype in need of too much reform those in stock foods she suspected to be conservative and dull only a republican would buy canned peas the wine section was more promising she supposed that marked her a bit of a snob favoring wine over beer and fruits and vegetables were also possible she didnt need a vegetarian but a man who thought about his greens and took time to cook them might be thoughtful and slow about other things as well the bread aisle was a place to find solid wholewheat types but too many already wore wedding rings picnic supplies suggested an outdoorsman while intellect could be gauged by where a guy planted himself on the magazine aisle was he browsing the economist or truck trend but spices condiments and wine were best rominy believed suggesting a fellow open to detail experimentation and taste admittedly this screening was far from perfect given the tendency of grocery hunks to move from one aisle to another but then the zodiac was open to interpretation too her criterion was at least as reliable she maintained to her friends as the arch fiction encountered on internet dating sites frozen food was a problem the likelihood of meeting bachelors rose here given the stacks of entrees aimed at singles but the freezer cases also implied haste microwaving even could you read this much into a grocery cart a certain lack of ambition defrosting was too easy true she was in the frozen foods aisle too with lean cuisine cheddar potatoes and broccoli and a pint of haagendazs but this was about prospective life partners not rominys own singleton existence as software publicist shed achieved a bachelors in communication a gray fortysquarefoot cubicle with industrial carpet and underpowered pc two longish relationships broken off well short of real commitment and personal resolve not to settle for competent mediocrity yet nothing ever happened grim global news limping economy girlfriends who only quipped men who only wanted to hang out and shopping at safeway for one she was almost thirty not that old she reminded herself not nowadays she was due for promotion soon she was due for things to happen and yes cute frozen foods guy was glancing again rominy caught herself instinctively and embarrassingly flipping her brunette hair as she imagined a thousand things about him that his lingering by the pizza case made him interested in italian food and renaissance art that the way his left foot with trail shoes rested on the shopping cart gave him the athletic stance of a mountain biker or rugby player that the pen in his shirt pocket announced not nerdwithgrocerylist but poet prepared for spontaneous inspiration unruly surfer blond hair icy blue eyes an intriguing scar on the chin how delicious if it had been from reckless danger probably a juvenile skateboard accident and there was a hint of a muscular physique under the denim shirt yes rominy was a regular sherlock in the way she could scope out the human male at a glance too bad if the scrutiny took them abackand damn them if they did too much of the same to her what she wanted was to undress their souls he wasnt approaching however just looking too much looking in fact evaluating her with a curious hesitant stare that was anything but coy flirtatious or even leering he simply regarded her like a curious specimen creepy mr frozen foods guy or boring get a life on to the condiments rominy pushed her cart two aisles down and pondered the advance in civilization represented by squeeze bottles of ketchup her ambition was to invent something simple and practical like the paper clip retire to the beach and try proust or pynchon again master sudoku train for the iron man open an animal shelter build a kayak figure out her camera but then frosty the snowman idled into view leaning on his own cart like a handsome cowboy over a saddle horn oblivious to whatever might be melting on his metal mesh still looking but not doing shy or stalker not worth it to find out maybe she read too much chick lit but she wanted a man who showed confident initiative who came up and said something funny so she wheeled around and took a quick dash to the feminine products aisle territory guaranteed to ward off unwanted males the way garlic and crucifix could deter vampires rominy should never have returned his glance in the first place but how could you know shed camp here until the lurker had time to move away but no hed peeked down the aisles from the broad corridor at the back of the store and tracked her to this new refuge now he turned his cart into terra incognita and looking questioningly at her mouth opening like a fish hopelessly uncertain what his first line should be next to the tampons did she know this dude no why was he trailing her why hadnt he said anything he wasnt just checking her out he was watching so she pivoted and squeezed behind a middleaged shopper who had her cart nearly athwart the aisle in that worstofsafeway rudeness now mrs dumbo could unintentionally run interference while rominy headed for the cash register the fastcheckout lane eightitem limit be damned escape but no mr frosty appeared again the front of his cart cutting in her direction like the prow of a battleship his look anxious and his pace quicker would he make a scene where was pepper spray or selfdefense kickboxing training when she needed it or was this klutz just socially inept like so many men calm rominy just another of your countless admirers as if but then his jacket opened slightly and she gave a start there was something black on his hip let the ice cream melt she abandoned her cart squeezed by the rump of another overfed matron tapping password numbers into a debit card reader and headed for the door sorry safeway no sale rominys experience which included more than a few deadend dates as excruciating as an irs audit was that intriguingly eccentric men turned out to be weird politeness only encouraged them avoidance was a mercy nor could she call for help please a man with a grocery cart is looking at me but instinct screamed that something was wrong rominy had dropped some overdue bills in the mailbox at the lots outer limits so her car was parked a good fifty yards away the vehicle was her pride and joy a silver mini cooper scrubbed bright as a new quarter suddenly as distant as a football goalpost it had taken the trade of her ancient nissan a diversion of funds that should have gone into her k and the commitment to four years of monthly payments to buy the runabout but my how she loved its cuteness and handling now it represented refuge she knew she was probably hyperventilating about abominable snowman but shed never had a grocery guy track her relentlessly as a cruise missile without first attempting a friendly hi miss hed come out of the store after her rominy quickened her pace toward her car this clumsy comeon would make a snarky text message for her girlfriends wait footsteps he was starting to run fast okay get in the car lock the doors start the engine engage the transmission crack the window and then see who this lunatic was if harmless it would be a story to tell the grandchildren so she ran too purse banging on her hip low heels hobbling her speed hey his footsteps were accelerating like a sprinter wasnt there anyone in the lot who would interfere run rominy run her mini cooper beckoned like a castle keep and then without warning the creep hit her from behind sending her sprawling pavement scraped on hands and knees pain lanced and she opened her mouth to scream then his weight crashed fully on top of her a body slam that knocked out her wind and the bastard clamped his hand over her mouth this is it she thought she was going to be raped suffocated and murdered in the broad daylight of a safeway parking lot frozen food guys it seemed were psychopaths but then there was a boom the ground heaved and a pulse of heat rolled over them her eardrums felt punched she lay pinned in shock a cloud of smoke puffed out shrouding them in fog and then there was the faint rattle of metal pieces clanging down all around them her beloved mini cooper had blown up she still had thirtynine months of payments and its shredded remains were bonging down around her like the debris of some overextended wall street bank her assailant put his mouth to her ringing ear and she winced at what he might do but he only whispered i just saved your life berlin germany march n ational socialism is based herr raeder on the inevitable conclusion one must take from modern biological science we are locked in darwinian evolutionary struggle himmler took the tone of pedantic lecturer adopted by men who have risen so high that none dare disagree just as species vie with one another in nature and individuals struggle within those species so are the human races locked in eternal conflict this is the lesson of all history is it not raeder knew this interview could be a path to promotion so the fuhrer teaches reichsfuhrer he felt like he was squatting looking up at the big desk the aryan race has continually been in competition with the slavic the asiatic and the negroid himmler said rome was invincible until it allowed itself to be polluted by the inferiors it conquered and then was defeated by our ancestor arminius in ancient germany and the germanic tribes were invincible as long as they kept to themselves behind the rhine and vulnerable once they became mongrelized ultimately there can only be one evolutionary winner and the aryan can win only through purity of blood it is about breeding untersturmfuhrer breeding take it from a chicken farmer the dogma was nothing raeder hadnt heard in the tedious ss classes that half the membership skippedthe men wanted action not eccentric pedantrybut the reference to chicken farming startled the explorer there were jokes about himmlers brief unhappy experiments with animal husbandry but hed never dreamed the reichsfuhrer would bring up this past your scholarship is reflected in the teachings of the schutzstaffel he managed himmlers smile was thin as a razor you think i dont know the disparagement of my agricultural background i know everything about everyone he tapped the files for a horrible moment raeder thought the reference was directly to him and he furiously wracked his brain for when he might have mocked the head of the ss was this meeting a prelude to a concentration camp i hear all the jokes himmler went on about our fuhrer about me about goring about the lot do you think this makes me angry raeder was beginning to sweat i swear ive never listen to me untersturmfuhrer the powerful act and the powerless make jokes about them better to be the superior who is the butt of a joke than its minion teller trust me this is how society functions this is how life functions struggle he held raeders gaze yes i raised chickens and learned life is breed against breed and the holy mission of the ss is to purify our race and raise mankind to a new level our mission is scientific it is mystical it is evolutionary and when were done the planet will be a utopia unknown since the ancient days of ultima thule when our ancestors came down from the stars he nodded as if affirming the point often enough would ensure its truth raeder finally managed a shaky breath why are you telling me this reichsfuhrer because youve been called to duty by god as i have himmler said calmly i to purify you to apply your expertise in tibet toward the national socialist cause youve been there twice have you not yes he exhaled realizing he was here for his experience not some indiscreet remark two exploratory zoological and anthropological missions hunting with a rifle to collect specimens a mauser m magnum on expeditions with american funding and led by dr benjamin hood of the american museum of natural history in new york himmler was reading from the folder four months from nepal to the himalayas in and six from china to eastern tibet in you wrote a book high himalaya and used classification and preparation of the bird and animal skins to win your doctorate from the berlin academy adventure combined with science and notoriety before you were twentyfive an alpinist as well with some notable first ascents an exemplar one might say of the new germany i had some good fortune and the swastika is an ancient symbol of good fortune in tibet is it not yes reichsfuhrer you see it everywhere have you ever wondered why an eastern invention i suppose or an aryan invention and a connection between our aryan ancestors and the inhabitants of tibet it is a symbol of the god thor fifty years ago guido von list made it a symbol of the thule societys neopagan movement a key to our racial past in the high himalayas we could speculate you think the tibetans are aryans their royalty perhaps are our cousins there are theories himmler bent to the folder and summarized its contents invited to hunt with air minister goring lectures in london and heidelberg a lovely young wifethe reichsfuhrer paused looking at raeder over the rim of his glasseswho you killed now the sweat again accidentally he felt continually offbalance in this interview was that purposeful bitter tragedy hunting was it not i was swinging a shotgun on a flight of ducks and stumbled on another loaded weapon on the bottom of our boat it went off lotte died instantly that was the official story his tone was hollow remembering the horror guilt and relief her blood had pooled to the floorboards her brains had spattered the water hed felt trapped by lottes family which had grown suspicious of his needs and now it was inexcusably clumsy no it wasnt did the kripo the criminal police suspect the kind of cruel memory that can only be expunged by new experience himmler said briskly flipping a page by returning perhaps to tibet but this time without the americans returning with men from my organizations ancestral heritage research and teaching society the ahnenerbe which studies our aryan past are you hard enough committed enough to lead an ss team there raeder the zoologist swallowed here was what hed hoped for dreamed of now offered despiteor was it because ofthe bitter memory of lottes death if called on by the fatherland reichsfuhrer himmler snapped the folder shut you have ample reason to desire a change of pace to forget the past to put all your energies into a mission for the reich germany has a bright future raeder if you succeed it will make any lingering questions about the end of your marriage irrelevant if you fail he swallowed i understand his heart was pounding which annoyed him control did you have apprehension about todays visit untersturmfuhrer any man would be nervous at meeting so august a personality any man would be frightened himmler waved his hand to acknowledge the obvious he enjoyed the fear raeder realized he drew strength from it he reveled in the black uniforms himmler had longed to serve in world war i missing by a year and yet tell me raeder am i really that intimidating i a man who only wants to secure the future of the german reich i appreciate i am direct because i have to be i mentioned the unfortunate death of your wife because i dont like things unsaid sticking to the corners of normal conversation i do unpleasant things for our fuhrer blunt things direct things so that he can fulfill his destiny without their burden he sees what ordinary men cannot he leads our purification the fuhrer is a remarkable man he felt like hitlers picture was looking down on them why tibet you wonder does the chicken farmer himmler want more bird skins from asia he gave that thin smile no more than that much more raeder more than youve ever dreamed in your life so i want you to visit me in my ss headquarters near padenborn the new center of the world center of the world im inviting you to be my guest at wewelsburg castle i want you to understand the full meaning of your mission in the place im making the true heart of our organization bring your maps of tibet raeder and my goal reichsfuhrer to help conquer the world bring your maps in one weeks time seattle united states september present day f rozen foods guy rolled off rominy and hauled her upward with arms around her rib cage breasts lifted delicacy ignored i tried to warn you but you kept moving away he said i feared theyd try this what happened you almost died a contact had popped out people were beginning to shout and run in the distance she could hear sirens christ it was downtown baghdad her head hands and knees hurt and the bastard had just about crushed her torso her purse had spilled who are you rominys voice was thick at the moment the only friend you have he pulled on her arm come on she shook loose let go of me he grabbed her again persistent and impatient his fingers hurt as they clamped come on if you dont want us both to die my purse holding her by one arm with an iron grip he stooped to scoop things into her handbag and brought it up tucking it under his arm good catch we dont want to give them more information than they already have then dragged by his pull she began to stagger away from the wreckage of her car people hung back bewildered someones cart had spilled and bright oranges spotted the pavement the air didnt just have a smoky smell it had a chemical taste and she realized her teeth ached from clenching her assailant or savior was pushing her toward a bangedup ford pickup that was nothing like her late lamented dream mobile she clutched her arms to her aching torso all her energy had been sapped by the shock of the explosion are you abducting me she asked dully i told you im rescuing you he shoved her into the cab pushing on her butt without apology and the door slammed shut she looked at it foggily trying to decide if she should flee her body felt sluggish rescuing me from what she asked as he climbed in the drivers side he threw her purse into her lap dont you mean from whom he started the engine the pickup was a stick shift like her mini cooper everything was a dream wait she looked outside blue lights were coming fast police he pulled away from the curb they cant help he sounded grim the pickup swerved to let a fire truck pass and then accelerated it was old enough to have locking knobs on the door by the window but hers was missing had he locked her in she tried the door handle and her heart sank the lever jiggled uselessly this was her worst nightmare she was an idiot a victim listen i know youre freaked out frozen foods said i am too i didnt know theyd go this far this whole thing is a royal mess i just want to give us a little space in case the skinheads are hanging look behind are we being followed rominy looked out the dirty rear cab window there was a gun rack behind classic rural washington was her rescuer or kidnapper from some gawdawful backwoods deliverance den like twisp or mossyrock there was a chrome toolbox that spanned the width of the pickup bed and surely thered be a chain saw inside or maybe leatherface here kept it back home in his creepy cabin how would i know she had a headache any toughlooking guys with shaved heads she looked following windshields seemed opaque no there was a driver but with big hair as puffed as a tv anchoress doing a storm report no her head was beginning to clear and she was in the one place shed vowed never to be locked in a vehicle with a stranger hurtling toward godknewwhere she had no weapon no clue no wait she did have her purse again frozen foods guy had made a mistake hallelujah cell phone car keysnow useless she realized with sorrowtictacs a tissue packet lipstick she rarely used chapstick she did compact with mirror business cards of her own business cards of boring software clients shed immediately forgotten and had failed to file a packaged condom with an embarrassingly old shelf date a wallet with thirtytwo dollars she had been going to get twenty more on her debit card at safeway forgotten souvenir wristband from a dave matthews concert glasses she popped out her other contact and put on the spectacles her sight hadnt been lost after all somewhere in there was a comb with a wicked pointed handle nail clippers loose earrings with a tip she had inserted studs for shopping and brought along the others in case erica texted about happy hour a veritable arsenal frozen foods glanced at her you wear glasses duh they look nice she regarded him with disbelief youve got to be kidding me no i mean he looked impatient but also somewhat intriguingly frustrated was he frightened too look were going to be friends okay the pickup door wont open its an old truck stop and let me out its not safe i cant even roll down the window give me a chance rominy it was a plea not a threat she took a breath tell it to the cops she pulled out her cell phone how did he know her name if you dial that theyll track us who will track us the guys who blew up your car and who are they her finger was poised men who are looking into your past like i have i dont have a past worth looking into im afraid you do im an investigator is that why you have a gun what i dont have a gun wish i did right now i saw it on your waist in the grocery store this he pulled his jacket aside its my cell phone what you think im a dick a private eye more along the lines of a serial killer and wheres the twelvegauge to fit into the gun rack here im a reporter for the seattle times investigative journalist with low pay stingy budget and an eye for a ford pickup deal when he sees one shes a beast when i punch the gas though i pay for her eight cylinders at the pump the environmental writer gives me hell he held out his hand jake barrow harmless when im not behind a typewriter or well terminal she didnt shake his hand but set her phone in her lap still gripping it you tackled me like a linebacker youre not the first girl to complain about my lack of finesse look im new at this too new at what hiding from the bad guys what bad guys and why are you looking into my past her fist curled around her comb how could she get out stab and climb over him at a stoplight maybe make a scene holler anything but wait like a nitwit did she have the courage did he deserve her doubt he glanced as if to seek alliance but then he accelerated up an onramp merging into crowded interstate heading north and took a breath hesitating she glanced back the space needle was receding like some signpost to reality lake union shimmering like a mirage because youre not really rominy pickett wewelsburg castle germany march t wo hundred miles west of berlin in the westphalian countryside not far from where arminius had destroyed varuss roman legions in ad a triangular sixteenthcentury castle crowned a rocky outcrop above the village of wewelsburg the triangles apex pointed with less deviation than a compass needle to true north the reichsfuhrer s camelot said the ss pilot whod flown raeder from berlin bruno halder banked the light civilian messerschmitt and circled to give the zoologist a view its reconstruction is far from complete but there are plans the castle will be the tip of a spearshaped complex of modern buildings a ceremonial avenue will provide the lances shaft the spear of destiny inspired by the legendary lance that pierced christ the village will have to be relocated of course id not heard of this the reichsfuhrer is not a showoff like goring halder made the disparagement casually secure in his own ss rank and aimed for a nearby airfield as they dropped steeply himmlers mission is veiled no air shows no medals but hes far more visionary a romantic actually below you raeder is the place that will someday be known as the birthplace of modern man what does that mean its aryan future and a crypt for its leaders camelot as i said beautiful raeder said politely confused but still flattered to be flyinga firstand enjoying the vista over the greening countryside almost too beautiful for the schutzstaffel it has its own austerity as youll see the castle even has a hexenkeller a witches cellar they burned more than fifty witches down there in the seventeenth century not so long ago really he cut the power and the plane bounced as it landed it was dusk when a staff car delivered them to the castle gate the village of wewelsburg was subdued its streets empty house lights veiled behind lace curtains raeder sensed people peeking at them as they drove past when they got out of the auto at the ramp across a dry moat the only sound was of jackdaws crowing then german shepherd guard dogs on chains sent up cacophonous barking their teeth phosphorescent in the gloom the gate wood was blond varnished and obviously new carved with swastikas and the twin lightningbolt runes of the ss sentries stood like statues and torches burned like a medieval dream it was a renaissance castle meaning broad glass windows instead of narrow arrow slits but most were dark there were towers at the three corners the southern ones domed with roofs like a homburg hat after scrutiny by the guards raeder and halder were ushered inside the courtyard was curiously claustrophobic a narrow triangle with walls as sheer inside as out at the northern apex a fat round tower with flat roof was surrounded by scaffolding there were lumber planks piles of stones and bags of mortar modernized raeder asked reimagined the reichsfuhrer has selected it as a spiritual home for our order a labor camp is being constructed to implement his visionary plan slaves have been screened to find the best craftsmen wewelsburg will be a capital a vatican for the ss this will be a center of scholarship for inquiries into the origins of the germanic people and the aryan race there will be a planetarium at the crown of the north tower and a crypt for reich leadership in its cellar reichsfuhrer himmler sees across centuries raeder hes a prophet it is our fuhrer adolf hitler who is the prophet the correction was mild professorial but spoken with authority they snapped to attention and wheeled there was himmler studying his own creation dressed in military greatcoat jodhpurs and boots he stood very straight since the interview in berlin raeder had read about his superior at hitlers failed putsch himmler had carried the staff of the imperial eagle as proudly as a schoolboy and i am the mystic scholar the merlin of my brotherhood of knights himmler went on our fuhrer does not share all my intellectual interests he is a politician a man who must wrestle with the practical and immediate but he allows me the indulgence the luxury of exploring the distant past and possible future im fortunate to have such a patron am i not professor raeder as are we all reichsfuhrer himmler nodded we live in the presence of a great man a very great man the spectacles caught the dim light so that raeder once again couldnt see the reichsfuhrer s eyes but only hear his tone of worship the fervor of one powerful man for another surprised him hed expect more jealousy more doubt but no the zoologist was silent not knowing what to say well himmler finally went on thank you for visiting me in my castle the honor is of course mine i do not invite everyonethis is a quiet place a secret place until i finish itbut im intrigued by tibet untersturmfuhrer intrigued by what such a mysterious country might tell us will you join me in my study reichsfuhrer i am bewildered by your hospitality himmler smiled at the confession i look for men who can serve men who have a need to serve once more his gaze was intense and raeder felt it probing the recesses of his soul the zoologist hoped his life was about to be given meaning and with it salvation halder thank you for bringing my guest they are expecting you in the dining room the dismissal of the pilot was plain halder betrayed a flicker of disappointment clicked his heels and left then the reichsfuhrer became a temporary tour guide as he led the way explaining how a wreck of a castle was being transformed into a showcase of german craftsmanship theres been a fort on this outcrop for eons but the present castle was built between and it was bombarded in the thirty years war and witches in the cellar ah your pilot shared the folklore dont worry they dont haunt the place no more than any other vermin that is eradicated there was an exquisite spiral staircase a reference library dining rooms and canteens and carvings that included runes and swastikacentered sun wheels all of it a display of teutonic carpentry the north tower will have a shamanic sun wheel inlaid into its floor and a roundtable for the twelve primary leaders of our order the reichsfuhrer said my architects joke with me about king arthur but i am not joking i think the modern world would benefit from some of the ceremonies of the past in the east they believe in reincarnation do they not raeder most certainly reichsfuhrer life in tibet revolves around the next life i believe it too i believe im the reincarnation of king henry the fowler who fought the invading magyars from the east a thousand years ago does that strike you as odd it would not surprise a buddhist himmler gave a glance to show hed not missed that raeder had swerved from the question but i believe in focusing on this life were reincarnated to fulfill a purpose come to my study where we can speak alone that room was in the west tower and thus circular and had a stone fireplace bearskin rug and wooden furniture the walls were mostly bare showing the same austerity that had been present in himmlers office in berlin despite his rehearsed warmth and nostalgic architecture there was a vacuum to the mans surroundings lending the only color was a bowl of fruit the reichsfuhrer invited his guest to sit and took a chair opposite both seats were highbacked straight and rather uncomfortable ss lightning bolts had been stamped into the leather now raeder youre familiar with the ahnenerbe the ss research division im sending missions all over the globe to investigate intriguing theories about the origins of our race iceland peru national socialism believes in drawing logical conclusions from modern science as i told youeven if the conclusions are uncomfortable we do not fear the truth but we believe the german people are descended from a root master race and that these aryansus raederrepresent the best hope of the future evolution of humankind do you agree so teaches the ss so teaches common sense do you know where mankind went wrong untersturmfuhrer raeder was laboring again not to say the wrong thing well the bible suggests eves apple he meant it as a joke but himmler remained deadly serious he took from his belt an ss dagger gleaming in the candlelight the edge was feathered from repeated sharpening and it glinted in the light the reichsfuhrer took an apple from the bowl of fruit and sliced it neatly in two but instead of cutting from top to bottom he cut horizontally when the apple was opened each face had a pattern around the core that made a star yes the apple do you know what it represents raeder was silent baffled by what he was supposed to see its the fivepointed aryan star the pentagram lucifers star that traces the path of venus not the sixpointed star of jewish corruption and so the apple represents knowledge the secret powers that unify the universe here we see the celestial in lowly fruit all is one his head bobbed to confirm his own statement the jews dont want us to know thats why they wrote that fairy story about eden know what it wasnt eve who led us astray raeder it was and is the jew they invented a monstrous idea that goes against all natural law and reason do you know how they confused the world and distorted civilization raeder tried to remember if ss lectures had covered this by usury they invented meekness himmlers voice crackled with scorn here is moses coming down from the mountain and what does he proclaim thou shalt not kill raeder killing is the most fundamental truth of our planet everything kills everything to survive as the strong get stronger struggle ceaseless struggle thou shalt not steal nonsense so the weak can hold on to resources they make no use of thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife bah so the strong are limited in how they breed the jew invented a coda to weaken our species and then the worst jew jesus took it a step further and preached that the meek shall inherit the earth what a perversion of everyday experience why is this raeder why would the jew tell such lies to preserve order no himmlers palm slammed down on the fruit table the apple halves jumping to weaken everyone who believed them to weaken us the aryan so that jewry can control the world lies to blind and bind us raeder lies to make us forget the power that our aryan ancestors once had but now we are awakening from our long sleep now we are shaking off the jewish hypnosis we are remembering that strength by right should triumph and that our ancestors had powers we can scarcely dream what if such powers could be discovered what if they have been buried in the most secret place in the world you mean tibet when a race becomes diluted when it becomes polluted with miscegenation with the jew or the negro or the asiatic or the feebleminded or the crippled it weakens and devolves it begins to slip into primitivism but when the aryan becomes purified when the very best of the best breed with each other well evolution goes in the other direction led by what nietzsche called the superman that is what nazism is all about raeder this will be our gift to our descendants it is this not war and monuments that will make us immortal to history but how reichsfuhrer by expelling the jew of course by sterilizing the feeble by annihilating the deviants by segregating the races by encouraging the best stock to bear children by seizing what the strong deserve be it land or women its no different from weeding and breeding on the farm the work of centuries perhaps the work can be accelerated himmlers expression was opaque raeder decided not to know too much but what has this to do with tibet our ancient ancestors wandered widely the high tibetans have some of our noble bone structure and there are theories that they are direct descendantsour natural cousins if you will yet how to establish this they forbid visits to their capital the selfish british have a small mission forced on tibet by invasion in but otherwise that country is the most secret place in the world its a theocracy ruled by a godking lama and his temporary regent with authority more absolute than any pope there men live for their next life not this one and yet not all men perhaps there are legends of earlier aryans who discovered powers since entirely forgottenpowers that could decide the fate of the world in any coming war powers in tibet its wilderness seemed a backward place reichsfuhrer they hardly use the wheel only the monks are literate himmler stood and restlessly moved to the fireplace it was old carved with christian allegories including one that looked like cain smiting abel powers that could make us gods in our own time herr raeder have you ever heard of vril no reichsfuhrer im going to tell you a secret story and then youre going to tell your men my men im sending knightserrant with you he ran his hand over the carvings on the mantel you know of frederick barbarossa unifier of germany holy roman emperor hero of the crusades every german schoolboy admires barbarossa and his wife beatrix he was charismatic brave visionary and scholarly a tragedy that he drowned during the third crusade when he was at the height of his powers his army crumbled at his death in he was buried in the middle east was he not someone was buried there legends surround barbarossa that he sought the legendary kingdom of prester john somewhere in the east that he sleeps undead in a mountain in germany and will emerge to restore the fatherland to its former greatness some have even whispered our fuhrer is his reincarnation history records that the body of a man of fredericks age was found in his armor after being swept away in a river but what if barbarossa did not die but escaped i dont understand what if he set out alone to seek prester john and what if the legend of that mythical christian kingdom was confused and combined with one about the ancient tibetan kingdom of shambhala what if raeder barbarossa found tibet surely thats impossible tibet is difficult enough to reach today in the twelfth century all of islam barred the way deserts mountains wild animals savage tribes since our fuhrer became chancellor of germany the nazi party has gained access to historical records and artifacts weve sought since our beginning weve become students of legend were privy to medieval secrets kept by the catholic church ive become a scholar of possibility you really believe frederick barbarossa reached tibet i do not believe anything but one thing i know in the cathedral of aachen ancient seat of german emperors was stored a curious relic church records show it came into the cathedrals possession some years after fredericks death himmler reached inside his tunic and drew out a sealed silver tube about the size of a rifle shell it hung from a silver chain this is reputed to be the blood of barbarossa one of the most priceless relics of german history hold it raeder i hardly dare reichsfuhrer he said taking the vial gingerly this is a great honor do religious relics have any foundation in fact he looked at it sealed since medieval times himmler was watching him gravely yes id not heard of this blood vial no its been a closely guarded secret raeder held it out please take it back before i drop it on the contrary untersturmfuhrer youre about to wear it across the most difficult terrain on earth its a very sturdy container and youll wear it on that chain next to your heart raeder stared at the vial why because the name of that artifact for more than seven hundred years has been the shambhala key by legend it is the vital blood needed to open the gates of the secret city of shambhala it is the blood of the worthy to inherit the terrible powers that lie within and it is that power that would mark the real return of the spirit of frederick barbarossa north of seattle united states september present day you dont think im rominy pickett im sorry i dont want to shock you but i know youre not then either youve kidnapped the wrong woman or youre even loonier than i thought jake barrow looked straight ahead both hands on the wheel at ten and two like a driving student the pickup a careful six mph above the speed limit just enough not to risk a ticket he seemed to have a clear idea where he was going the freeway north of seattle was an artery its cars corpuscles the vessel walls dark evergreens broken overcast kept everything the habitual northwest gray look i realize i should have broached this subject a little less dramatically he said car bombings are not the way i usually meet my sources im not your source mister investigative reporter if thats what you really are im your victim and youve probably committed about eighteen felonies to get me to this point do your editors approve your tactics his lips were tight my editors advised me to drop the whole thing touche but theyre wrong the lunatic creed youre the biggest story of my life and i never dreamed it would play out this way a skinhead wannabe spilled something about a car bomb i realized i couldnt just research any longer and had to check you out in person then i saw their explorer across the parking lot near your vehicle and didnt know what else to do it was tackle or watch you blow up he sounded more embarrassed than triumphant and less like a serial killer than shed have expected was there a chance however slight that this guy wasnt totally full of bullshit and homicidal intention if he was behind the bomb why tackle her but why would anyonewhat skinheadswant to kill me because theyre nazi knotheads who think you know a lot more than you do about what a seventyyearold secret a fairy story about strange powers and a lost city jakeif thats really what your name is i have a press card whoopee im sorry but youre not proving your sanity here i mean youre getting goofier by the minute i cant open my truck door your own editors dont believe you and were almost to everett she held up her cell phone sounds like its time for wait his look was pleading if the cops come and my editors get wind of this fiasco im probably finished i know it no story im trying to give answers i dont have and you still dont know who you really are i will look like a criminal or a nut job but if you give me a daytwo days at most on your turfyou might get something that will turn your life around i get the big scoop and maybe the good guys even win maybe but i need you to give me a chance to explain without holding that cell phone like its another bomb and im serious the skinheads can track us with that thing why do you keep saying i dont know who i really am have you ever heard of a man named benjamin hood no well youre his heir im what rominy glanced at her cell phone and noticed there were no bars in fact there was no display at all of all the times to have it off she pushed the power button she needed a backup plan instead of trusting mr jake barrow and it involved the washington state patrol she pushed and pushed nothing happened my cell wont work barrow looked relieved a sign from god dont you think he glanced in the rearview mirror shit he slammed the accelerator and the pickup rocketed and swerved throwing her against the door that wouldnt open shit shit shit they lurched across two lanes and back cars honking and then hung on the rear quarter of a tanker truck its warnings of explosive cargo spattered with mud what what get down its them another burst of speed and they shot ahead pulling narrowly in front of the truck its horn blaring barrows hand wide and powerful grabbed rominys head and shoved it down on the bench seat so hard that her cheek bounced against the old vinyl her only view his bluejean thigh and the dirty floor of the pickup stay down they might shoot she didnt dare look imagining bullets puncturing the old truck as if it were aluminum foil they were weaving like road warrior lunatics and all rominys attentions were focused on trying to recall halfforgotten hail marys for what she was convinced were the last seconds of her life the nuns were right she should have gone to confession theyre coming she squeezed her eyes shut she could hear the fullthroated roar of a heavy suv or truck and the answering whine of the old pickup then a pop and a whistle of wind damn he seemed resigned theyre shooting please please stop this thing cops he sounded exultant and their speed abruptly slackened they tried to keep up and the patrol nailed them they swerved a final time and steadily decelerated hallelujah yes the cops are stopping them oh boy theyd better get rid of that gun are the police following us too she asked with hope no thank god theyre busy with skinheads the trucks sound changed and she sensed theyd taken an offramp she was shaking in fear and confusion humiliated at having her head almost in this bastards lap then they coasted to a stop he put his hand on her head again stay down for a light or two of course maybe hed saved her life once more or he was a complete schizoid hail mary what in heaven is going on where are we everett well go through town to make sure weve shaken them before getting back on the freeway please go to the authorities she felt defeated exhausted hopeless i told you the police cant help us not yet though i gotta say three cheers for the washington state patrol they nailed those bastards thats a big ticket driving like we were theyll have to breathalyze the whole nine yards i think were safe rominy at least for the next five minutes i dont feel safe i thought we were going to crash im a better driver than that it felt like mister toads wild ride in disneyland ive done some amateur stock car he gently touched her shoulder you can sit up now they were on an avenue that ran by puget sound still heading north a bluff with houses to their right rominy felt sick and lightheaded from fear her cheeks were wet from tears and she was ashamed of them shouldnt she be braver i just want it to end sorry its just beginning he gave her a sympathetic look his features strong but not unkind but well make it youll see its important or i never would have involved you she groaned and noticed a draft of cool air by her neck and a thin whistling she turned there was a bullet hole in the pickups rear window and a web of radiating cracks new york united states september t he american museum of natural history was a castle of curiosities bordering new yorks central park a national junk drawer of the sensational and the educational depression crowds still paid their quarter to see bone hunter barnum browns tyrannosaur in the jurassic hall the reconstructed pueblo indian village in the anthropological wing or the speculative trip to the moon at hayden planetarium there was a diorama of mountain gorillas against the volcanoes of the belgian congo painted to recreate the spot where the museums carl akeley had succumbed to tropical disease in adjacent halls were carters mounted animals from the upper zambezi inca relics from bennetts explorations of peruvian ruins and stuffed birds from burmas irawadi river and there was the magnificent bharal or blue sheep brought back and mounted by the benjamin hood expedition of the horned male looked eternally over a high rolling plateau toward the distant snowy crests of the painted himalayas school children viewing the roof of the world through glass hoods office was in the prestigious southeast tower overlooking central park just one floor below the museums mercurial director famed gobi desert explorer roy chapman andrews hoods family had the money to finance his explorations and contribute to museum coffers meaning that hed been given a higher ceiling and better view less favored or less rich curators sweated in tighter darker rooms the favoritism made hood feel guilty but not enough to give the office up the flamboyantly selfpromoting andrews perched above them all the museum director had led the first dodge trucks into mongolia and protected his dinosaur bones in shootouts with bandits since those cowboy days hed proven to be as bad an administrator as he was good at finding bones and attracting publicity he was erratic demanding and forgetful it was no surprise then that hood reacted with distrust when his boss telephoned to say he was sending down some government functionary to confer the director had wasted hoods time before with political errands and donor meetings that came to nothing cant see him hood lied ive got a meeting with a rockefeller foundation man on that hudson bay expedition i proposed forget hudson bay chapman said in his brusque manner hudson bay isnt happening even if you can afford it the rest of us cant the depression wont let up and our budget is bleeding we need to gear up for next years worlds fair here in new york you know that roy im not a worlds fair type of guy which is why you need to speak with mr duncan hale dont close doors just when theyre opening for you ben this one will get your blood up i promise hood remained suspicious then whyd you send him to me because its agent hale and youre the expert he wants on loan oh and by the way we dont have a choice andrews hung up the director asserted his authority over hood because in truth he had little leverage the millionaire had no need for a curators job hoods family was rich from lumber paper and real estate ben could have been like a thousand wealthy sons rampaging his way through private schools and plowing nubile debutantes before marrying the proper pedigree and managing an empire hed not created but hood was different he stayed outside even in foul weather while growing up at palisade the family estate in the hudson valley he was fascinated by the natural world his father taught him to hunt and fishtheyd hiked the rockies and gone on safari in africaand he climbed and hiked on his own rich people were boring he decided knowing nothing but money while scientists who worked for pennies were pursuing the secrets of the universe the least rewarded had the most fascinating jobs theres snobbery in the sciences as in all professions and it was a reverse snobbery that would have discriminated against a rich man like ben but hood bludgeoned his way into their fraternity by contributing to others causes and financing his own expeditions to unknown tibet he took along british german and swiss companions and bore hunger thirst and insects without complaint like andrews he was featured in national geographic and it was quietly let known that the hood family might make a donation to the hardpressed new york museum if a permanent position could be made on its staff the fact that dr hood had published in the best peerreviewed journals made such an appointment defensible to the museum employees he vaulted ahead of so hed been given the secondbest office a starving wage and periodic reminders from andrews that he must answer to the museum hierarchy the subordination grated but it also gave him something in common with the other curators hed become through routine slights from his boss and quiet contributions to his rivals projectshe was buying friendship hood knewone of them too bad it didnt satisfy hood led a double life he was handsome single and circuited the new york clubs to bring home to park avenue the carefully coiffed women who were curious about his eccentricity everyone was betting on when hed tire of the museum charade and buckle down to the family business women gambled on when hed settle into domesticity sleeping with him in hopes of timing his change of heart but he didnt buckle down hoods scientific travels were the one place he could escape his birthright and reinvent himself as scientist scholar and explorer so he met whomever chapman told him to agent hale reminded hood of a dark lamp pole a narrow inkhaired man with a bulbpale face who was dressed in that kind of cheap somber suit that was the uniform of civil servants everywhere the visitor let hood study his credentialsarmy corps of intelligence policewhile the agent examined the animal heads and asian maps that decorated hoods office there were chinese flintlock firearms afghan scimitars polished fossils of ancient ammonite shells persian pikes and victorianera paintings of wilderness panoramas and women bathing naked in a stream there were photographs of hood with shahs lamas and movie stars you got more stuff than woolworths hale said his flat tone making it unclear if he meant it as a criticism or a compliment its a curators office were collectors hale took in the view across central park manhattans towers rising like oz i dont even have a window yes your agency hood said holding hales identification card im afraid ive never heard of it thats the way we like it the agent replied active in the great war and then down to as few as twenty officers this decade however with the japanese at war in china italy in abyssinia and hitler into austria and hot for the sudetenland were back in fashion now we need your help with the germans youre spies and hale is that really your name like nathan hale i have but one life to give for my country its my name to you this was just the kind of cowboy intrigue that thrilled the flamboyant andrews theyd probably been comparing decoder rings upstairs and youre here to see a museum employee a curator of stuffed animals because of hitler hale plopped into a fat leather chair without being invited im here to see an employee who has the means to get himself what he wants including a trip back to asia he took out a cigarette and lit it without offering one to hood the museum director agreed that youre the one to help us im an expert on tibet not germany youre about to become an expert on both hale took a drag and let out a long plume of silver smoke we understand you know a german explorer named kurt raeder hood started he thought hed put that mess behind him best to be careful here knowing raeder might be an overstatement he keeps his own counsel and hes an odd duck but yes we journeyed together to tibet four years ago as im sure youre aware difficult man to deal with but a great hunter he brought down a magnificent ibex for the berlin collection at four hundred yards crack shot do you know hes returning to tibet no we dont correspond we had a fallingout over a woman hood frowned how do you know that you saved her the zoologist looked uncomfortable its complicated ill bet hale took a puff again a new ss expedition left genoa in midapril passed through suez colombo and on to calcutta the british tried to hold them up in india but they couldnt come up with a good enough reason and now the nazis have pushed ahead for the himalayas trying to reach the tibetan capital at lhasa from all reports why do you think the ss is sending men to tibet i have no idea did you know raeder was a nazi he wasnt overtly politics rarely came up hale puffed again considering just the pair of happy hunters were you it was a scientific expedition sponsored by this museum raeder had been to the himalayas once before and was recommended we didnt always get along but thats normal among scientists why this interest in a german zoologist nazi or not hes hardly a prominent figure of hitlers regime hale nodded as if this was an entirely reasonable assessment not yet what does that mean hood we have information that raeder is being sent back to tibet by none other than heinrich himmler himself director of the german secret police exactly why is unclear hunting for shangrila for all we know the mythical utopia invented by the british author james hilton had become a popular hollywood movie the year beforea nice antidote to the depression which is fantasy hiltons never even been to asia so were el dorado and the fountain of youth but the spanish still looked for them the krauts are up to something and my office thinks war is on the horizon if it comes we think the united states will be dragged into it and not on hitlers side we cant allow the nazis any advantages tibet is not a strategic power agent hale the hell it isnt it squats between india china and the soviet union its more inscrutable than fu manchu its the high ground of any asian contest and himmler is sending raeder there for a purpose what purpose thats what we want you to find out and how am i to do that roy chapman andrews tells me you like the outdoors as much as he does and youre about as content in this curio closet as a ferret in a bag said he had to give you this grand chamber here to keep you from wandering off to the smithsonian or philly how had andrews known that hood had talked with rival museums but thought hed kept it a secret the united states government mr hood is offering to give you the necessary paperwork and introductions for your next trip to tibet including a reserved flight on the china clipper a genuine governmentissue colt automatic and letters of introduction to the chinese government such as it is were giving you diplomatic status to go to lhasa and if possible see this buddhist pope i understand is cooped up there lama they call him i thought that was some goat in south america the current lama is just a child theres a regent the reting rinpoche or the regent from the rinpoche monastery so well help you see this reting if i track down raeder and find out what hes up to hale nodded and stubbed out his cigarette on a side table there was no ashtray hood didnt smoke exactly find him learn what hes after and get it first for uncle sam you get an excuse to get out of this mausoleum and serve your country at uncle sams expense actually we need you to help out with that given your personal resources and presumed patriotism americas wallet is tight youve heard of the great depression why i think thats the thing that cost my family millions you want me to spy for you and pay my own way ive looked at your tax return hood you can afford it if vanity fair was still on the newsstand youd be on the cover the magazine had suspended publication in the depth of the downturn but hood got the point his london coat and tie cost several times that of hales suit his shoes were italian and the dark hair and strong chin gave him women said the dash of a matinee idol he enjoyed looking good he enjoyed spending money on travel and research he enjoyed sleeping on the ground while knowing he didnt have to youve got nerve mr hale i just got a hunch that youll jump at a chance to go back to tibet because its there and all that mountaineering crap hood was annoyed this obnoxious bureaucrat knew anything about him but such was the modern world privacy eroded the income tax a plague gangsters glorified what if raeders purpose is innocent scientific and cultural put it in your report but if it isnt what then hunt him down its imperative that germany not win any advantage over there kill him if necessary kill him hale stood and brushed ashes from his lap we understand that might not be as difficult for you as it sounds on board the trieste mediterranean sea june m ore than two months before hoods meeting with hale the italian liner trieste had cut across a mediterranean placid as a pond an avenue of silver leading away from the starboard side to a fat full moon the air was as warm as a mothers breath now that they were safely away from land raeder had invited the men whom himmler had recruited to share some schnapps by the anchor capstans the german quintet was deliberately out of earshot of the other passengers or any chance a steward might overhear the ship was steaming for suez and then beyond to the red sea indian ocean and calcutta british india unfortunately was the quickest doorway to the forbidden palaces of tibet theyd have to bluff and bargain their way through it raeders knights were professionals like himself ss officers who were newly named members of himmlers ahnenerbe the reichsfuhre rs research bureau they were veterans of expeditions like this one and experienced mountaineers while they had packed their black uniforms away until ceremony demanded in lhasa they were soldiers too the expeditions crates in the hold included rifles pistols and even a new submachine gun called the erma mp much smaller and lighter than the thompsons that gangsters used in american movies there were daggers explosives fuses detonators and telescopic sights there were pitons climbing ropes and crampons there were field stoves scientific instruments and film cameras the germans were ready for partnership or for war julius muller was their geophysicist whose job was measuring magnetic variations in the earth the work might be scientifically useful in understanding the earths interior because it would be the first time such readings would be taken on the worlds highest plateau muller had also used explosives in his research and could be counted on to use his expertise in demolition the rhinelander had a skeptics instincts howeverhe was the kind who reflexively questions authorityso his ss superiors had been happy to let him go raeder was determined to keep an eye on the maverick when the time came muller must exhibit complete fealty and obedience wilhelm kranz was their anthropologist one way to tell aryan from jew was to measure face and head giving authorities an objective way of segregating the races kranz planned to use his calipers and plastic casts on the tibetan aristocracy to establish whether they were indeed ancestral cousins of the german race kranz was nazi by creed and need a devoted reader of race theory maybe i will find an aryan princess to seduce eh he added with his sense of humor he was also an expert with the garrote and knife hans diels was their archaeologist and historian the man whod absorbed what was known about the past of tibet and who could be called upon to interpret the remains of any lost civilizations they might find he had a crate of books from tibetan explorers like sven hedin nicholas roerich and alexandra davidneel diels had served in the great war and knew what it was like to fight and kill its not like the movies its murder you try to murder them before they can murder you pow from two hundred yards away and if the artillery can do it for you so much the better hed been gassed like hitler and at fortythree he was the old man of the group franz eckells was their cameraman hed worked with the celebrated woman director leni riefenstahl and photographed for the ss magazine germanische leithefte he was the expeditions political officer present to ensure there was no deviation from ss orthodoxy his superb eyesight had helped win awards for marksmanship in the winter olympics in bavaria two years before eckells had narrowly missed winning a medal in military patrol a skiing and shooting event he carried himself with catlike grace and confidence and raeder looked forward to shooting against him the zoologist liked his comrades combination of brains and brawn curiosity and courage they were prototypes of the new germany the men had signed on for adventure without being exactly certain where they were going or what they were to risk trusting himmler now raeder would tell them the germans were all a little drunk and mellow because of it it was a perfect night the air silken music playing from the salon the ship throbbing purposely their wake ran back toward the fatherland so far the expedition was like a holiday raeder had taken a whore in genoa to feed his cravings and by the time she could report his savagery they were far at sea he felt satiated and anticipatory gentlemen he began raising his glass we are carrying the swastika to lhasa the capital of tibet they nodded having guessed as much the british may try to impede us but well not be deterred theres ample reason to believe that the goals of the tibetan government should coincide with our own which goals diels asked ill get to that while none of what im about to relate is secret nonetheless germany is alone in acting on it accordingly what youre about to hear is for your ears only it must not be repeated to anyone on this ship or anyone we meet until we are deep in tibet our success depends on our ability to surprise the world if we succeed all of you will be heroes to a greater extent than you can possibly imagine is it dangerous asked kranz the possibility did not necessarily displease him our goal is not to provoke danger wilhelm but yes enjoy this leisurely night be prepared for hard times once we reach the himalayas they nodded again raeder took a breath as you know except for the polar regions central asia is the most remote and mysterious place on earth its also one of the most strategic the birthplace of empires for the mongols tatars and turks its the high ground between soviets chinese and the british raj it has the highest mountains the driest deserts and is the source of great rivers like the indus mekong yellow and ganges its inhabitants are trapped in religious superstition ruled by monks and yet tibet is rumored to be a land of astonishing magical powers tibets technology is primitive its history is poorly understood but its religious and mental magic is intriguing were going to make names for ourselves as scholars diels predicted were going to learn what they know over the centuries few europeans have penetrated this region i myself have been on its edges with two expeditions one financed by an american millionaire named benjamin hood the russian monk agvan dorjiev studied in lhasa germanys baron von ungernsternberg fought the communists for the white russians in mongolia and heard tales there the pole ferdinand ossendowski served with the baron and wrote of wonders hed seen nicholas roerich led an expedition through tibet a decade ago bearing a wishgranting gem entrusted to him by the league of nations he hoped to return it to a secret underground kingdom called shambhala but never found it all these explorers brought back curious legends of fabulous ancient kingdoms that were repositories of wisdom and power ruled by a king of the world or dark lord tibetan tradition holds that the armies of secret shambhala shall someday ride forth to redeem the world some westerners believe that the shambhalans were refugees from atlantis and built a hidden city to preserve ancient knowledge does your old friend hood know all this asked eckells do we have to worry about the american hes not my friend hes a playboy looking for things to occupy his time in new york dont worry about hood there was an edge to raeders voice but the others had already taken note of his moodiness and temper they knew better than to ask more davidneel saw monks levitate and move from place to place at supernatural speeds hans diels volunteered instead roerich saw a mysterious oval spheroid speeding across the asian skies in it was immense and instantly changed direction but had no discernible power source superior to any aircraft now in existence raeder agreed were not traveling ten thousand miles for yak dung my friends they laughed some of the philosophers behind national socialism have interpreted these legends and reports raeder went on the american madame blavatsky the austrian rudolf steiner the british medium alice bailey germanys thule societyall have contributed if youve paid attention in ss seminars you know their theories of atlantis hyperborea and thule theosophy ariosophy and other new scientific disciplines have established the history of race conflict and the origins of us aryans this is the new german science they nodded blavatsky herself posited three principles that gods instrument is an electrospiritual force that embodies the laws of nature that creation is a cycle of destruction and rebirth and that all is unifiedthe soul and the material the tiny and the great manipulating this unity she preached is the secret of supernatural power our fuhrer adolf hitler himself studied her philosophy and incorporated its teachings into national socialism we sail with a rich philosophic tradition heil hitler eckells breathed quietly like a prayer our ancestors from the north may have branched to tibet one of our tasks is to determine if this is true wilhelm here will search for racial evidence with his calipers just so he doesnt measure me muller growled he thought the head measuring was anthropologic nonsense julius had little use for the social sciences yes dont let him practice one of his plaster masks on you said diels whod tried it its like being suffocated such a discovery in itself would be enough to garner us all global fame raeder went on it would reunify the aryan and prove to skeptics that germanys racial theories are true julius will add to our understanding of the physics of the earth and hans its human history franz will bring back movie footage of ceremonies never witnessed by western man if all goes well eckells amended but theres more at stake here than that weve all heard of the strange theories of einstein heisenberg and bohr a universe of the vast and the small ruled by laws very different from what we perceive in everyday life some physicists think these ideas hint at strange and wicked new powers at the level of the atom but thats jewish science kranz objected even a jew might stumble on a truth and we must never let the jew have a monopoly on a new kind of power we true germans are far ahead of them i think haushofer founded the vril society two decades ago to search for the power source that stories attribute to shambhala whats vril muller asked i dont remember this from my physics texts a convenient name taken from an old novel of what the reichsfuhrer thinks may be a very real power source these ancients understood the natural world in ways weve forgotten and found a way to tap fundamental energies far more powerful than gunpowder or gasoline this power can be directed by the mind to build or destroy it is power that may still exist in fabulous cities that many writers and thinkers believe lay hidden under the surface of the earthcities that are the origin of the idea of hell perhaps diels took a swig of schnapps youre taking us to hell kurt or heaven somewhere may be hidden the most fabulous city since the aztec capital of tenochtitlan a new el dorado not because of gold but because of power the ignorant would call what travelers have sought magic but its in fact simply a spiritually higher mastery of science and the cosmos it restores man from a plaything of physics a victim to its central mover we become not pawns but kings not mortals but gods we become not the product of creation but its manipulator has not our fuhrer demonstrated this kind of magic already hitler is destined to be the true king of the world and our mission is to help him this is both a religious expedition gentlemen and a scientific one were being sent to find essentially supernatural powerspowers that our aryan ancestors once possessed and ruled with but which have been lost for millennia but how were they lost we dont know perhaps they were deliberately hidden to await reemergence of a fit people like us of the third reich the first reich was the heroic prehistoric world of aryan godmen the germans knew the second has been the chaos of history caused by the cursed philosophies of jew and christian now they were at the dawn of the third the reich of national socialism we gentlemen are the apostles the knights the angels who may bring the greatest secret in history back to the fatherland if we do germany conquers all easily and completely and then our species evolutionary destiny can truly begin unpolluted by human vermin were going to steal this vril from the monks of tibet muller tried to clarify not steal refind tibetans are sunk in ignorance and poverty theyve forgotten their own genius were going to plumb their legends to find if the legends of our ancestors are true and learn where vril is hidden tibet will be our new ally on the flank of russia china and british india alike he took his own swig never has so small a group of men been given the possibility of achieving so much but how will we find what no one else has reichsfuhrer himmler has been researching these legends hes found maps that date from the middle ages and the time of frederick barbarossa well combine those clues with what the tibetans know barbarossa theres evidence barbarossa was interested in these mysteries himself and belief that he may have left us a key what key ill reveal that to you when the time comes and if we fail asked diels what if theres no shambhala and no vril raeder looked at them seriously in that case we might have to consider never returning to germany that is not a message the reichsfuhrer cares to hear the skagit river valley united states september present day north of starbird road interstate dips toward the skagit river valley and paradise opens up the peaks of islands in washingtons inland sea hump on the northwest horizon fidalgo lummi cypress and orcas as green and precipitous as a childs crayon drawings to the northeast is the snowy volcanic cone of mount baker and the cutover foothills of the cascade range between is a plump platter of farmland a onetime bay filled with sediment at the end of the last ice age the result is some of the richest soil in the world a hundred crops are grown there tulips in spring berries in early summer and potatoes corn and grapes approaching harvest on this day the timelessness should have reassured rominy the gleam of glaciers the meringue of clouds and the orderly phalanx of ripened crops were reassuring the overcast was breaking and the surface of the skagit sparkled like sequins while the valleys overall palette was toned sepia by septembers golden glaze she often came here on weekends bicycling and kayaking to escape the tedium of her cubicle in seattle but now the beauty had a sense of menace was she really being pursued where was jake barrow taking her the old pickup whined as the journalist kept it at seventyfive mph rominy had managed to regain some composure after their escape her cheeks were rubbed dry annoyingly red her posture as prim as a princess with time to think shed decided to wait and observe since jake didnt seem immediately threatening and she didnt want to be abandoned somewhere waiting for skinheads to drive by since the insanity on the freeway hed been quieter watchful brooding checking his mirrors like a fugitive on the lam occasionally hed glance her way and give a half smile as if reassuring a child or a dog but he radiated tension the way a stove does heat the unease made him seem more human believable persuadable maybe she could talk her way out of this whatever this really was she thought hed take side roads but he seemed more interested in making distance half an hour had passed where are you taking me she finally tried do you live up here you do what no im taking you to property you dont know you own she groaned it might relax me a little more if you began making sense he adjusted the rearview mirror for the thousandth time the little bullet hole in back sighing like a leaking tire im about to but i get rattled by car bombs and bullets i just wanted to get some distance from the skinheads so i have time to explain what im going to tell you is more than a little surprising he tried the half smile again we could do this at a starbucks the name conveyed a spark of reassurance steamed milk in public she had a starbucks card in her wallet but im going to suggest something more refined dont go to any trouble she didnt try to keep sarcasm from her voice therere a couple of wineries up the valley your humble rescuer wants to share a bottle of pinot noir while we sort this out skagits an excellent terroir for that varietal jesus h insanity kidnapped by a wine snob well serves you right rominy should have gone for a republican in the canned foods aisle you know if youd come on to me in wine or spices this might have gone better now it was jakes turn to be confused what never mind she winced my knees hurt oh yeah sorry i should have said this before theres a first aid kit in back of the seat with some antiseptic pads at least the moron looked chagrined the space behind the seats was piled with a mildewed tent sleeping bags pads and other gear i like to camp jake said as she rummaged youre not taking us into the woods are you not exactly its a red plastic box she found the first aid packet bandaged her own knees and sat annoyed at her disarray rominy was no supermodel but men had been known to give her a second glance she took pride in looking good and shed worn a skirt to the store now she was dirty scraped and tearstained and she didnt like jake seeing her that way her eyes were an intriguing hazel hair dark with an auburn tint skin just slightly olive which helped her avoid that seattle winterworm look and she wasnt afraid to be seen in a swimsuit but now she drew confidence from her appearance and this weird flight from the safeway parking lot had drained it was that part of barrows plan here ill take that he held his hand out for the antiseptic pad shed cleaned herself with and glanced at the stain blood heck yes its blood she could still feel the sting i know youre mad but it will be worth it youll see he dropped the pad into a plastic bag he had hanging from the dash the truck had oldfashioned knobs instead of buttons if this was what jake could afford on his investigative reporters salary how good could he be judging rominy right now she was a step or two behind this guy she had to get a step or two ahead they passed mount vernon and burlington and took the cook road exit off the freeway heading east up the valley barrow seemed to relax a little the mountains began squeezing in toward the skagit river like a funnel piling up toward the rocky crests of north cascades national park the foothills were snowless in late summer the land somnolent and satisfied as the harvest came in before the autumn storms pasture hemmed by dark forest the way she imagined a place like germany might look shed never been to europe the skagit river ran green to match the forest thick and deep elk were grazing in one meadow they passed through sedro woolley lyman and hamilton each town smaller and each mile taking her deeper into the mountains and farther from the likelihood of any help her cell phone remained a useless paperweight and he hadnt even asked if she needed to pee at some point hed have to stop for gas here we are they lurched off the highway onto a road called challenger and coasted up past trim modest frame homes set on a hillside above the river their lawns were brave bright badges against the darker forest he braked at a small vineyard with a sign that said challenger ridge neat rows of grape vines led uphill to a wall of maple and fir old farm buildings barn boards weathered and mossy formed a cluster on either side of the road jake parked and got out stretched and walked around to jerk open rominys door it creaked and barrow took her hand to help her out his own hand was large hard and callused for a newspaperman he had an athletes easy poise you can run if you want but youll get a glass of wine if you hear me out she stepped down stiffly a sleepy collie came over to nose them the tasting room was a cedarroofed singlegable house with wooden porch it had twin american flags and flower planters made from wine barrels picnic tables tilted slightly on grass dotted with clover wheres norman rockwell the house dates from jake said hobby farm turned medalwinning business we did a story on them once in our weekend section and i like their pinot they do some nice blends with yakima grapes as well yep shed gotten her wine guy theres no one else here kind of the point its quiet on a monday and we need space to talk it helps you had today off to go grocery shopping thats me lucky girl i know this is hard rominy comp time we were working up a presentation until eight pm saturday so the boss could give a presentation in the bay area while we stayed home canceled a date that night to clear my calendar for this she shook her head i guess skinheads work mondays her ability to joke surprised her was it a serious date she glanced he was genuinely curious not yet her frown was wry not after standing him up not now he swallowed hope you like the wine he gestured to the buildings with his hand challenger is on the way we need to go rominy felt like a rabbit uncertain when the trapdoor is raised the air was clean insects hummed birds tweeted the world remained surprisingly normal wheres the bathroom this way it was a portapottynot exactly napabut then they went into the tasting room with its overstuffed couches gas fire and dark paneling cozy as a sleep sack the young woman who sold them a bottle introduced herself as cora and jake chatted her up almost flirting which unexpectedly annoyed rominy then the woman pointed them up the hill nice view do you need a corkscrew if you please barrow smiled as if this whole thing was a lark cora gave them plastic drinking cups as well rominy and jake ascended to a wooden table resting beneath the canopy of a threetrunked cedar tree the painted planking littered with needles the view was soothing purposely so she assumed vines marched in soldierly columns down to the main highway trees and the green skagit beyond across the river rank upon rank of forested hills receded early autumn gave everything that honey glow rominy was sore tired frustrated and curious she could run she could scream she could beg to use the winery phone and she did none of these things watching barrow work the corkscrew the river and highway a distant murmur the shade cool but not unpleasant she felt oddly relaxed was this the stockholm syndrome where victims identify with their captor or had barrow really saved her in order to tell her something important certainly nothing remotely this interesting occurred in her cubicle at work rominy spent most days staring at either pixels on a glass screen or the gray fabric of her office enclosure and more evenings than she cared to admit staring at another glass screen at home her abode was an apartment on seattles queen anne hill she couldnt really afford she kept the heat at to justify premium cable she went to a gym three mornings a week belonged to a book club purposely limited her gossip magazine time to the monthly stint at the hairdresser clubhopped with girlfriends and dated with more wariness than excitement she shopped at ikea but waited for the nordstrom sale on a package to mexico shed used her high school spanish wore a swimsuit it took two weeks to select and applied sunblock with religious zeal she wrote press releases for software engineers who alternately treated her with disdain or flirted from boredom her ambitions were to buy a bungalow own a significant piece of art or visit africa but her dreams were hazy after that if anyone had askedand they didntshe would have said she was happy yes something had at last happened a toast he poured the wine and hoisted his to your illustrious ancestor my what she took a sip eyeing jake over the rim of her glass not bad both him and the wine her moment of contentment confused her to your greatgrandfather rominy to the famous and infamous adventurer explorer curator and secret agent benjamin hood whatever apparently disgraced however stripped of his prerogatives and effectively exiled to the murk of skagit county at a time world war two when his country might have needed him most if you think this is rural now it was the end of the earth then a man lost to history and even to his own family meaning you i have a greatgrandfather everyone does trust me he smiled you were adopted correct yes how do you know that i told you ive been investigating its my job my parents died in a car accident when i was a baby and no other family that you knew about there wasnt any but there had to be at one time right ones parents have parents didnt you ever wonder mom and dadmy adopted parentssaid they didnt know i havent dwelled on it really they never made me feel adoptedi was an only child their child we didnt obsess on the accident its not what you want to talk about you know of course icy road mountain plunge and you mysteriously found abandoned but bundled in a cradle in a forest service campground not abandoned she flushed all her old dread at the rumors and her frustration at her adoptive parents evasions was coming back no not a suicide something terrible must have been going on and they left me for a moment to go get help and the ice she felt the threat of tears again and willed them back it didnt make sense it had never made sense it annoyed her that hed obviously looked at the old clippings it seemed an invasion of her privacy of a tragedy buried by time it wasnt a suicide rominy of course not he took a quick swallow so you know your name isnt really pickett it is this is what this is about you bring this up now here its your adoptive parents name its my name the one ive had as long as i can remember and my poor dead parents were not named hood but your mothers mothers father was im going to show you the genealogy and your descent from him is on the female side but thats not my point it wasnt a suicide i agree but it was murder what by the same crazy fanatics who just tried to murder you she shook her head in bewilderment skinheads killed my real parents not skinheads rominy nazis neonazis he took out his own cell phone which reminds me ive got to make a call about your inheritance kangra la sikkim july k urt raeder looked back from the himalayas to a flat world gauzed with haze the steel of indias great rivers faint threads of orientation the germans had escaped the hot damp hell of the british raj and were climbing toward their goal the heaven promised by old tibetan texts that himmler had sent along in a steel box shambhala the lost kingdom that would violently redeem the world on raeders neck kept warm by his own body was the vial that reputedly held the antique blood of frederick barbarossa the explorer found himself lightening as they climbed for more than a month he and his four companions had felt trapped in british india as news from europe grew more ominous traveling through calcutta and the himalayan province of sikkim was the quickest way to tibet but it was getting harder for both sides to pretend englands relations with germany werent fraying meanwhile the monsoon came in full force rain pouring down the humidity on the bengal plain became suffocating snakes slithered from drowned burrows mosquitoes rose in clouds his companions chafed and quarreled the heat the bugs and the sheer bureaucratic sloth of a dying empire all weighed on them england was in decline and calcutta was crowded and chaotic as hitler tried to reunite a germany brutally disenfranchised after the great war the old enemies grew jealous again seeking to hem in the teutons so had the german tibetan expedition been corralled by the arrogant frightened english for that raeder held them in contempt where the officials in calcutta had demanded of him are your permits to travel to the forbidden kingdom of tibet of course there could be no permits since there was no permitted travel and there could be no permission until the germans met personally with the threeyearold godkings regent in lhasa but they could not meet because none but the british consul was permitted to travel there the germans stewed under the circular and selfserving reasoning of whitehall and calcutta what the british didnt take into account was german will coupled with advice from the kind of englishman whod first built the empire before sailing from genoa in allied italy raeder had received a peculiar letter from sir thomas pickford the octogenarian himalaya explorer and hero of the siege of gyantse where thousands of tibetans who believed themselves invulnerable to bullets had been slaughtered by british firepower pickford had served on francis younghusbands military expedition to tibet in that forced it into reluctant relations with the british now thirtyfour years later pickford had corresponded with the young german hed heard lecture in london rumor of raeders impending ss expedition had circulated in academic circles and pickford had advice a few englishmen understood what the reich was trying to do he explained the racial spirit germany was trying to revive a few sympathized with the power of hitlers vision in this new corrupt decadent age called the twentieth century dont wait out the bureaucratic intrigues the crusty englishman wrote my country is giving up its civilizing mission but yours is seizing it germany is alone in displaying the character of our race we are cousins after all and tibet must not be allowed to exist in seclusion and hide its secrets take any opportunity and simply go borders be damned if a german had written this to an englishman the gestapo would have called it high treason but the english like the americans felt free to say anything to anyone curious idea i have seen the sun set on the potala palace with a radiance that speaks of god the old englishman wrote i know there are things to seek in that land we can scarcely dream if you want to see them make your own way across the border as younghusband did in now raeder had in calcutta the germans had first falsely announced their intention given the diplomatic delay of returning home then in the dead of night monsoon thundering and streets awash theyd loaded their theodolites chronometers earth inductors shortwave radios anthropological calipers cameras movie film guns cases of schnapps and boxes of cigarettes into the specially designed rubbersealed cargo cases crafted in hamburg theyd hired trucks to taxi them to the station and bribed their way onto the express train north arriving at its terminus a night and day ahead of any pursuit mountains rose as enticing as a mirage paying in reich gold the germans swiftly bought two freight cars on the next conveyance a popularly dubbed toy train with tracks just two feet apart that puffed its way at twelve miles per hour to the british hill station of darjeeling and its warehouses of tea this would elevate them to feet the nazis were moving on this second leg of their escape by the time bemused authorities in calcutta realized they were gone at all its jew gold we use raeder told his companions confiscated from the rats fleeing berlin so does providence assist our mission up and up the locomotive crept past banana plantations at first and then through jungle so high that it arched over the tracks the canopy shuddering in the downpours the journey reeked of rotting orchids foliage steaming indian laborers rode an open freight car pushed by the bow of the train when monsoon landslides blocked the track they dutifully clambered out to clear them raeder impatient and restless while the coolies dug took his rifle into the jungle to look for tigers he saw not a living animal the bamboo was still as death tea plantations hove into view as they neared darjeeling there between nepal and bhutan they could see the beckoning crest of the himalaya through breaks in the rushing clouds the peaks were topped by snowy mount kanchenjunga which at feet was almost as lofty as everest diplomatic telegrams awaited raeder protesting their progress and demanding a return to calcutta but the german foreign office was putting pressure on the english to leave the germans alone and it sent its own telegrams seeking to bog the debate down in an exchange of diplomatic notes while consuls argued raeder bluffed his way past the british constabulary hired a train of oxen and pushed on toward the sikkim capital of gangtok he knew how asia worked you butted your way arrogant and impatient or got nowhere now he marched up the hairpin turns of the riotously green tista valley with their animals each ox plodding from four cases of equipment strapped to its back still the monsoon sluiced down from every slope sprung a hundred white waterfalls and in the gorges the rivers roared with chocolate fury the germans cut upward first through birch and dark fir and then through whole forests of rhododendron clouds of bright butterflies hovering over every puddle and wet leaf the air was so thick with moisture that climbing was like rising from the bottom of a pool they struggled through mud crossed precarious log and vinecable bridges and drove their oxen along cliff ledges the men were smeared with goo lard of the earth at the end of the day theyd stand under cataracts to sluice it off roaring out beer hall anthems the rain cooled as they climbed a promising sign of progress the british were fools to let them get this far raeder thought the oxen powerful but ungainly were exchanged at gangtok for nimbler mules better adapted to the narrower trail ahead it took twice as many animals to carry the cases mounted with brilliantly colored saddles and blankets and tethered by yakhair ropes the cantankerous animals brayed in chorus to the ominous throbbing of the drums and long dungchen trumpets of the gangtok monastery hooves clacked on the muddy routes rocks german boots splashed through brimming puddles higher and higher they climbed whole hillsides seeming to peel away in the deluge sometimes they had to halt to build a new trail across a slide at dikchu the devils water the old rope bridge had fallen away they winched a new one across its thundering chute then hauled and whipped the balking animals across and up it toward the snowy crests above the trail seemed evermore narrow evermore wet evermore slippery when the rains paused it was foggy at each stop they spent several minutes peeling leeches from each other the odious creatures bloated with blood most clustered on calves and ankles sucking greedily but a few fell from overhanging limbs or ledges to feast on shoulder and neck only rarely did the germans meet the occasional pilgrim or merchant these stood aside on the precarious downslope while the europeans pushed brusquely past hugging the cliff a wool caravan descending with wide thickhaired yaks finally blocked their way the horned animals filled the trail where it ran on the side of a precipitous gorge leaving no room to pass the wool drovers with their powerful beasts refused to yield to the reichs train and yet trying to back the recalcitrant mules down to a wide spot even if possible risked losing the animals and their cargo into the precipice raeder pushed forward he was wearing a pith helmet marked with the lightning runes of the ss and carried a birch switch in his left hand like a riding crop as mule nosed with yak the german confronted the uygur leader this man a turkicspeaking muslim with a battered british enfield likely stolen from a murder victim raeder thoughtbellowed in defiance and shook his weapon he kept pointing down the mountain path clearly insisting with his flinging arms that it was the germans who must turn around his men behind were squat dark and sullen neither spoke the others language raeder considered a moment reached in his field jacket and pulled out a luger before anyone could react he pointed the muzzle at the forehead of the leading uygur yak and fired the animal jerked grunted and then slowly leaned out from the edge of the cliff with a long sigh its nostrils bubbling red its eyes rolled then it heavily and majestically toppled off the yak fell free for a hundred feet and then bounced and skidded down a scree slope skeins of wool exploding from its ruptured packs as rock flew like shrapnel the beast churned up a tail of spray and mud the uygur chieftain stared at raeder openmouthed forgetting the rifle he held in his hand raeder smiled he liked shooting things the german calmly stepped past the tribesman to the next animal and fired again and even as that yak fell on its forelocks pushed past its heaving flank to fire at a bellowing third this time the shot went slightly wide into the neck but the shock was enough to send this animal into the gorge as well as if following a lead the second yak plunged the way of its fellows the animals plummeted and slammed cargo flying as the uygurs shouted and panicked theyd encountered a madman the other germans hurriedly broke out their guns readying for what they expected would be battle on a precipitous ledge but the added firepower proved unnecessary raeder had a crazed glint to his eyes his luger smoking and as he considered the next animal in line the chieftain ran past him and hastily ordered his own caravan to wheel and retreat now after them the german snapped the mules were kicked and lashed forward chasing the rumps of the lumbering yaks until the latter came to a wider shelf and huddled next to a cliff the europeans pushed arrogantly past jostling the asians the uygurs looking at them with hatred their chieftain howled at raeders back as the nazi ascended gesturing with his rifle but he didnt aim it raeder ignored him and then the nazis and their porters were around a bend and had the cliff to themselves panting in the thin air my god raeder are you insane muller asked all we had ready was your pistol what if the uygurs had fought strike with surprise and you crush their will raeder said reloading the luger were outnumbered a million to one julius and have to act like were the superior that much ive learned from the british are we going to fight our way into tibet we wont have to the zoologist said looking back they could hear bells on the yaks as the surviving animals hurried down the trail word of this will spread and theyll give us the respect we deserve hans diels stepped forward and clapped the untersturmfuhrer on the shoulder now i know why himmler picked you to lead us he said you understand how things are and how they should be life is struggle kranz agreed we need ruthlessness then be prepared to follow my friends they surmounted the canyon and came out into alpine meadows full of purple gentians blue poppies and wild strawberries raeder ordered a rest while the others changed their caps for the more imposing ss pith helmets then they lashed red pennants with the nazi swastika to the pommel of each mule the men were nearing tibet and he wanted the diplomatic nature of their mission made clear ahead clearing skies were dark as a lake peaks dazzled in the blinding clarity of pure air mountain snow was flawless buttresses of rock glittered in the sun behind them the great plain of bengal was lost in cotton clouds heat gave way to nighttime cold and the progress slowed still more as muller used his magnetometer to measure the magnetic field of the earth anomalies he said might show the caverns of underground cities anomalies might reveal shambhala kranz made measurements of the tibetans and bhutanese theyd hired he pinched their heads with calipers and cast plaster masks of their faces tubes jutting from nostrils to prevent suffocation no jews here he announced since eyes were closed for the casting the result made their masks look like those of dead men word of this torture spread too and soon tibetans kept warily away from the anthropologist are they aryans muller asked his colleague skeptically maybe eckells did double duty by both documenting their progress on film and deploying the expeditions aneroids to record atmospheric pressure raeder insisted on the scientific measurements saying it would legitimize the expedition by contributing to german science well win fame from the government and respect from the academies it was july when a british lieutenant named lionel sopwithhastings riding a lathered mule finally caught up with the ss expedition and presented orders from the consulate in gangtok to return to india immediately the germans were not the orders read to risk a diplomatic uproar by violating the border of tibet sopwithhastings waited stiffly for response he tried to muster the authority of a british imperial but at age twentytwo with just a blond wisp on his upper lip and a frame so thin that hed traded his military cap for that of a khampa a fur herder to stay warm he was not a very intimidating presence his pale blue eyes betrayed unhappiness at his mission and he kept glancing at the nazis one by one as if counting the odds over and over again the germans were brown dirty and bearded with the lean athleticism that comes from years of exercise theyd watched the englishman approach from miles away and arrayed on the rocks of their little encampment were three rifles the submachine gun boxes of cartridges and raeders luger pistol but we do have permission raeder said mildly not according to the british consul the lieutenant said he licked his lips im to escort you to gangtok and from there to darjeeling and calcutta to present your case to the authorities ah to present our case well get a fair hearing then he colored this is the british empire well the german stood youve displayed remarkable energy to catch up with us youre fast i had to leave my police attachment and push ahead he gave a peek at the guns i can assure you they are still coming yes but right now you are entirely alone i met some uygurs who were quite upset they didnt understand the rules of the road sopwithhastings stood as tall as he could are you going to obey the directive his eyes strayed to the guns again british pluck can only inspire germany raeder said weve extra mules now that weve gone through some food and two are lame it will be efficient if you take them down for us he sat on a boulder and picked up the luger working the mechanism there was a click as a bullet slid into the chamber then it will be faster to follow diels sat too picked up a mauser opened the bolt and examined the weapon as if for dirt perhaps you can also mark the way where the trail is badly eroded hans said ive no doubt those uygur yaks have worsened it sopwithhastings stood at attention looking from one to the other then he gave a short nod very well on your honor well be on your heels unless the trail collapses raeder assured theres nothing up here as you can see its pointless to go on the little swastika pennants snapped in the wind i will await you in gangtok the brit saluted wheeled and went to fetch the lame mules as soon as the lieutenant disappeared from view raeder ordered camp broken and a quick last push to the pass at kangra la as the others started this final climb the german retrieved five pounds of high explosive from one of the trunks come on muller im tired of the english following us are you going to start a war im going to make it impossible to have one they went downslope to a precipitous pitch above the winding trail and climbed a hundred yards above setting the charge on a hump of fractured rock kurt i dont know if this is wise muller said this is a trade route a lifeline do we have to destroy it if word gets out the natives could turn against us i thought you liked to make things go boom julius for science and research not vandalism reichsfuhrer himmler will be interested to hear you describe the necessary advancement of this expedition as vandalism that british boy is no threat to us that boy could bring men he began walking back unreeling the fuse cord when cortes reached mexico he burned his ships thats not reassuring we cant go home this way anyway it will be through persia or china or russia muller resignedly helped splice the wires to the detonator now twist the plunger raeder ordered you do it no i want you to take a hand im not the only national socialist here muller scowled but twisted with a roar a gout of rock flew outward and down hammering the path and dislodging it a rock avalanche thundered into the ravine stone and noise bounced in the fog whoo raeder hollered his shout echoed away down the canyon a hundredyard section of the trail was gone it would take weeks to carve a replacement alas raeder said its become impossible to follow the lieutenant muller looked down at their destruction i had no idea kurt that university zoologists were so singleminded i learned some things in with hood in tibet raeder replied demolition no not to give your enemies any chance at all let the british try to follow them now they traded the mules for yaks at a border village reloaded their luggage on fewer animals and trudged on the trails surroundings were treeless now brown where barren rock prevailed and green in watered swales the kangra la itself was a barren saddle marked with a cairn of stone and fluttering prayer flags each flap of the flag sends a prayer to their gods raeder told his companions whats our prayer kurt asked eckells power they were at seventeen thousand feet around them peaks shot ten thousand feet higher draped with glaciers blue as fine diamonds the sky was cobalt the sun burned heatless wind whipped over the pass snapping their clothes and pennants tibet the german announced pointing at a horizon of endless mountains this is what cortes felt when he gazed on tenochtitlan or moses at the promised land cortes had gold to entice him kranz said tibet has gold too tons of it in buddhist temples they are rich and oddly weak ah so thats your secret motive kurt we plunder ive been wondering as weve panted of course not mere treasure hunting is a relic of history in modern times the gold comes from the real prize scientific discovery he smiled but if we come away with gold as well it will be just compensation no power in this oxygenstarved arid medieval backwater muller said skeptically gazing at the emptiness the worlds greatest secret raeders eyes shone as if he might pry a revelation from the slopes of the mountains ahead we are looking for the force my ss brethren that animates the world hong kong china september b enjamin grayson hood traveled more miles in nine days than raeders expedition had sailed and marched in nine weeks hoods first three thousand miles were by train from new york to san francisco by way of chicago aboard the gleaming california zephyr then by seaplane more than eight thousand miles across the pacific the martin china clipper flown by pan american averaged an astonishing mph hopping to pearl harbor midway wake island guam manila and hong kong each was an oasis of calm and safety far removed from the aggression of the japanese empire in china hoods ticket for this race against the germans had cost a staggering or as much as two new cars but then hed had a private cabin with bunk washstand and the finest cuisine the airline could conjure he relished the shrimp and steak while he could and didnt turn down the company of one edith warnecke either she was a pretty and bored thirtyfiveyearold double divorcee traveling to meet her newest husband in singapore edith smelled hoods money and pedigree hood opportunity she liked red wine chocolate and sex and rode the american adventurer ragged three miles above the pacific moaning like another propeller he was willing to oblige since the days ahead would be privation enough and yet the amusement was oddly unsatisfying edith was an unhappy woman looking for distraction ben realized somewhat to his own surprise that he was increasingly dissatisfied with distraction life should mean something and not just society outings specimen expeditions and museum tolerance of his stooping to be a scientist sex should mean something someday after the clipper skidded down on its pontoons into hong kong harbor he stepped out on the dock annoyed with his own conduct since the tibet scandal hed been embroiled in four years before hed been marking time now he thought his time had come mrs warnecke sensing his mood stalked off without a goodbye to drink by herself until the next flight to singapore what am i doing here hood said to himself as he watched the minuet of the junks traversing the harbor it certainly wasnt to fulfill some secret mission for duncan hale as errand boy for uncle sam it was to complete what hed long suspected was unfinished his business with kurt raeder and keyuri lin astonishing that raeder had dared return somewhere in central asia was what hed backed away from before the test of being a man hood had arrived at the edge of chaos one couldnt tell that in hong kong itself with its stately british warships regal banks and ministries and bustling streets where coolies pulled rickshaws at a steady trot and chinese women of high fashion minced in narrow silk dresses slit just high enough to the knee to make maneuverability possible sampans choked the quay and liners gleamed like mammoth wedding cakes their stacks pumping out energetic streams of smoke all this played out against a beautiful backdrop of steep green hills as extravagant and improbable as an opera set beyond however was the mainland shanghai and nanking had fallen to the japanese the year before nipponese warplanes had sunk the american gunboat panay in the yangtze river in december creating a diplomatic uproar while the beleaguered chinese army had won an impressive victory at shantung this spring now the imperial army was counterattacking toward hankow their warplanes rising sun on the wing ranged like raptors munitions destined for chiang kaishek were safely stacked on hong kong wharves under british protection but once they were on railroads to the mainland they ran a gauntlet of air raids the british trader sir arthur readings explained all this when hood called on him in the imperial oasis of hong kong called happy valley site of the colonys racetrack since british intelligence had been alerted of hoods mission and agreed to help hood had been instructed by duncan hale to go to readings for advice sir arthur knew finance good liquor and china ordinarily old chap youd pull up here and call the journey done readings said when the two met for whiskey and dinner at his club apparently sir arthur did secret work for his empire beyond his shipping and sweatshops and that work included liaison with mysterious agencies from the united states its not like when you were here before sir arthur went on i know china was a bit of a scrimmage then but its fullscale war now millions killed and the japs are bombing the kowlooncanton railway im not sure whoever sent you entirely realizes what the situation is cant blame washington tucked as it is on the other side of the world i can hood thought to himself you said ordinarily quite the truth is we live in perilous times and im told your mission could have real importance youre in for a bit of a romp accordingly i have an idea just enough to get you killed i suspect im not sure that will rattle my employers though i am cheap labor paid my own way mostly a patriotic cog to counter the deficits of the new deal by god you wont see a british lord doing that thats bloody marvelous or bloody insane so youre english in one way a bit balmy are you my country is counting on it so ive got to get to tibet and crossing china is the quickest way thats like saying crossing the battlefield of waterloo is the quickest way to brussels its sheer havoc out there man chiangs generals are at each others throats the nips have seized most of the coast and industry and the communists have created a bandit state of some sort up in the northwest this mao character wont stand and fight but he yaps and snaps like a little terrier the only way chiang has slowed the japanese is to break the dikes on the yellow and yangtze rivers flooding a thousand towns might as well go to the moon arthur if it was up to me id take your ordinarily advice and board the clipper back to hawaii finding another highclass tart to while away the monotony another you had one on the way here more interesting than looking at the ocean the englishman shook his head you yanks always manage to make things a lark dont you but then i wish i still looked like you arthur was bald sixty pounds overweight and red as an apple and youve got a hankering to see the roof of the world again something like that it appears the nazis are trying to beat us to it nazis good lord they seem to be everywhere dont they and which nazis this time the german military mission has abandoned the chinese their new japanese friends made them do it everyones choosing up sides trading this dance partner for that one this nazi is different old partner of mine named raeder an explorer and scientist on his way to tibet capable but perhaps too capable im to catch up to him and find out what hes up to dominating the world i imagine that seems to be the german obsession these days sir arthur sniffed glancing at his own empires clubs and racetrack it was hard to imagine such established opulence ever being threatened well if you want to chase after jerry more power to you just take gold coin for bribes ammunition to shoot your way through and a good quart of scotch because youre not going to find any in tibet worst cuisine in the world i hear and some of the most glorious country their valleys are higher than the crest of our rockies all the more reason not to go there if you ask me dreadful climb but say heres my idea have an eye for the ladies do you just the normal male appreciation have you heard of beth calloway a looker a flier though i hear she doesnt look bad either a regular amelia earhart this girl a tomboy what you yanks might call an oddball she showed up to shoot down japanese and while the chinese wont let a woman do that madame chiang put her to work doing other things for the chinese air force what things the male mercenaries monopolize the fighter and bomber planes so they put beth to work as an instructor she also scouts airways and airfields to india and burma now that the japanese are clamping off the chinese coast shes flown over more of asia than any woman and more than any man probably really hood sat straighter tibet no idea but you can spend three months walking there and being waylaid by bandits and warlords or three days flying im thinking you might be able to hire this girl away for a week or two if madame chiang thought you were on the generalissimos side i could write a persuasive letter jolly romp to go with a comely aviatrix no you can drop in on these nazis while theyre still sweating uphill you think shell take me there the truth is shes done some timely jobs for the crown here and there and weve had some contact sir arthur said shes earned a penny or two doing it ive also had some correspondence from your mr er hale and he too suggested her the merchant sipped his drink everybody wants to speed you on your way it seems reassuring hood slugged his whiskey calloway has certain flair if you can get to the new chinese capital of hankow alive you cant miss her as often as not shes got cowboy boots and a colt bowie knife too i imagine lovely girl he smiled resourceful you make it so enticing better than the rogue genghis khans youll otherwise meet i assure you just keep your head low when the nips strafe and never trust the jerries summit bank concrete united states september present day y our descent from benjamin hood is on your mothers side barrow said as they continued driving up the skagit valley rominy purposefully numbed after emptying more than half the wine bottle she was an occasiononly drinker but had decided this qualified as an occasion even if shed been slightly embarrassed at having a third glass in front of jake if the records are correct your grandmother hoods daughter was an only child when she married she lost her maiden name and the chain of descent continues through your mother who also took her husbands name its no surprise given the circumstances that you havent heard of benjamin hood so how have you heard of him it started as a historical feature story on a local figure everyone has forgotten tibet explorer moves to rural washington and dies in unappreciated obscurity that kind of thing but then i began digging up these enigmatic documents suggesting that ben hood hadnt just gone to tibet hed found or seen something there that other people wanted federal government people but access to his old place is barred by some nutty dotty crockett type upriver and the only person with right of entry is an heir which i eventually figured out is you what did hood find or see thats unclear but the nazis were after it too so i think wow this is the kind of yarn i could sell to american heritage or smithsonian or maybe get a book contract once it ran in the paper nice depressionera mystery but then there were odd clicks on my phone and i found a bug on my desk bug listening device he waved his hand as if this was an everyday irritation i realized some other folks were looking into this story too but not just to make a freelance fee out of it either they want what hood found or they want to make sure no one else ever gets it it turns out there were nazis in tibet too and suddenly im being shadowed by skinhead goons i realized id better find you and figure out just what exactly is going on i have no idea whats going on but you have the genealogy to find out i didnt ask to be dragged into this of course not but youre key which is why youre in danger and it was dumb luck i learned enough to warn you and there is an inheritance apparently you can thank me later after my knees heal she felt truculent about being caught up in something without being asked first it wasnt fair that wasnt planned before we could be properly introduced boom and well here we are here we are where concrete once more he turned the pickup off the main highway driving them past some gigantic dullgray concrete silos that in faded red letters indeed announced concrete guess what they made in this place it built some big dams upriver benjamin hood lived in concrete nah hes up on the cascade river which is where we have to go but he did his banking here and thats where you come in rominy looked out at a rainstained pocketsized town punched into more of the valleys lush forest shed heard of it but never been here barrow turned onto main street this burg is actually modestly famous because de niro and dicaprio made this boys life here the tobias wolff memoir wolff lived up in the seattle city light company towns newhalem and diablo but he came down here for high school hollywood baby they parked downtown was a blocklong clump of architecturally uninspired buildings about as charming as a gas station and as typically american as baseball and barbie tavern hardware store laundromat food bankunsurprising since there was no sign of moneyand more heartening a surviving movie theater many of the timewarp buildings were built as she should have guessed of painted concrete there were old lodge halls for the american legion and eagles and an eightfoot carved wooden bear incongruously rearing under a gazebo built to keep the rain off summit bank had a reader board displaying the temperature degrees and a sign since inside was utilitarian as a post office paneling painted white forest green carpet and the kind of fluorescent lighting that gives off the warmth of greenlands ice cap the clerks however smiled a vault door gave a peek toward safety deposit boxes when hood lived up here this was the state bank of concrete barrow explained he left a will and a safety deposit box for his heirs but guess what no heirs until you and a mystery seventyplus years unsolved until now he grinned and went up to a teller mr dunnigan please ill see if hes available tell him mr barrow and ms picketthood are here to see him hes expecting us jake stood tall like it was his birthday glancing around impatiently rominy studied him again her companion she admitted was intriguing smart and a bit of a stud he was built like a fitness freak and his eyes seemed lit with blue fire certainly more interesting than another evening home with netflix and haagendazs instead of savior or kidnapper jake was making himself she realized a partner curiosity kept her with him and it was reassuring hed taken her somewhere dull like a bank i still dont get what im supposed to do here she whispered inherit remember he whispered back mr dunnigan was a balding portly bank vice president in a white noiron synthetic shirt and jcpenney sport coat who reigned behind a formica desk of faux oak he picked up a stack of manila folders and took them into an adjacent small conference room with wooden table and hard chairs looking at rominy as if she were a ghost which she supposed she was in a way if what barrow claimed was true the missing heir of benjamin hood who congratulations mr barrow the banker began dropping the folders with a thump as you know i was skeptical of your research you sound like my editors the dna test however convinced me dna rominy asked yes miss its been so long since mr hoods death and his family history is so truncatedgoodness such tragedythat a mere genealogical table wasnt going to convince me an heir still existed thats when mr barrow suggested the use of dna evidence which is surprisingly quick and affordable we had a rather gruesome relic he paused looking at barrow a finger the reporter shrugged it must have meant something because hood kept it in his safety deposit box after he lost it from his hand he was attached to it dunnigan said smiling apparently bankers in concrete possessed quite the wit wait a minute rominy said you matched my dna to his yes dear an impossibility for earlier generations but science marches on but how did you get my dna dunnigan looked surprised at the question and turned to jake he in turn looked uncomfortable how did you get my dna barrow rominy asked again he cleared his throat saliva saliva when i got it off a starbucks cup i fished it out after you left a store are you joking when was this a week ago youve been following me to get my saliva to let you inherit rominy he said patiently as if she was a little dense thats illegal isnt it my bank cannot condone anything improper dunnigan added of course its legal barrow said blandly he turned to the banker my newspapers lawyers checked this out as long as youre not taking samples from a persons body without permissionlike clipping their hairit passes the test weve done this before its fine so long as its from discarded organic material dunnigan frowned then shrugged discarded like a starbucks cup rominy said yes thats sick do you think you would have let me run a swab inside your mouth maybe if youd ever explained yourself in a normal way i had to be sure or you would have run like a rabbit hi there you might be due a missing inheritance so do you mind if a run a qtip it sounds like molestation you would have dumped espresso down my pants and been furious if it wasnt a match so i did something that didnt disturb you one iota and we compared hoods finger to the saliva you left on the cup thats disgusting maybe so but because of it youre sitting in a bank about to get a look into benjamin hoods safety deposit box how many times do i have to tell you im trying to help you youre trying to help yourself she closed her eyes momentarily wishing she could will this day away but when she opened them they were both still looking at her with troubled and not unkind expressions there was sympathy there and jake did have that compelling little scar she sighed the dna shows this hood character and i are related yes dunnigan said visibly relieved she wasnt going to throw a fit what happened to all the other descendants after three generations there should be a zillion of them by now only children after mysterious accidents to their mothers jake said a drowning a car crash nobody ever put it all together because of the changes of names and growing fear of even discussing the hood relationship im guessing nobody put it together until i did and i realized there was one final survivor a survivor because she was left in a campground adopted by strangers a girl who knew nothing of her own past had her real parents been protecting her had they known they were about to die were they being chased and you think this was somehow the work of nazi fanatics leftovers from world war ii who didnt want whatever my greatgrandpa found ever getting out possibly jake glanced at the banker and then shrugged or the american government the americans but greatgrandpa was american he left a hero a government agent and came home a dropout why we dont know thats the mystery im trying to unravel i thought we had more time until that bomb went off what bomb dunnigan looked alarmed watch the news tonight mr dunnigan but dont worry were well past them dont call the press and they wont call you but lets not linger shall we what if reporters find the same paper trail i did and trace rominy up here or cops do or nazis exactly now the banker was brisk lets get the pretty lady on her way he took the folders and began spreading papers out on the table as if dealing cards suddenly in a hurry to have them gone here are the genealogical tables mr barrow assembled birth certificates address reports news clippings and the dna testing documentation its been quite an exercise in investigation because benjamin hood was apparently quite the recluse we never saw him he was a complete hermit he was represented by a woman possibly your greatgrandmother but we have the will the bank records and information on the cascade river property he glanced at rominy are you a fan of compound interest ms hood of what the way savings can accumulate over time mr hood left a relatively modest savings account here when he died in and it by rights now belongs to you it was a little over which has become with compounding interesthe searched a table of figuresa healthy after deductions for the safety deposit box taxes on the cascade river property and our administrative fees would you like a cashiers check wed like to clear out the account she was stunned first her car gone now this was she on drugs she looked at barrow now do you understand why this is important he asked and this is just the tip of the iceberg he turned to dunnigan we may need travel money i suggest thirty thousand dollars in cash and a check for the rest thats quite a lot of cash to carry around the banker cautioned not for long shell be careful im afraid the young lady is going to have to speak for herself rominy was dazed thirty thousand her annual salary wasnt much more just for a day or two until we figure out if we need to go to tibet jake said tibet hang with me just a little longer rominy it will make sense right she threw up her hands in twenties please wasnt that how they did it in the movies it didnt seem like real money and you can transfer the balance to my account in seattle her voice sounded small even to her but she wasnt taking a check barrow or neonazis could run off with i think we may have difficulty accumulating that many twenties in this branch now if you could give us a day or two whatever bills you have mr dunnigan jake said as much as you can spare were a little pressed for time remember he gestured toward the door dont want anyone following us here yes yes of course sign these forms and ill start the arrangements hand shaking at the thought of so much money rominy signed everything put before her then the bank vice president gave her a small brass key this is yours for the safety deposit box should you decide to keep it i trust you want to look inside she still had a headache but what answer could she give yes lets see what all this fuss is about the lhasa road tibet september t he tibetan plateau averages three miles in height and sprawls across an area four times the size of france but it is not the simple tableland the name implies the german descent from kangra la la was the tibetan name for pass was in fact a journey into an unending sea of treeless arid undulating mountains swell after corrugated swell that ran on without obscuring haze until limited by the curve of the earth it was magnificent desolation only the highest peaks capped with snow at the end of summer tibet was grassandrock emptiness completely different from humid sikkim its brown folds meandering and stark rock cliffs broke through its grassy felt with vivid bands of ocher yellow and white rivers braided their way across gravel bottoms in deep valleys like the silver strands of a necklace the sky was a deep violet blueprussian blue raeder told the others though his companions thought it purpler than thatand sunrise and sunset were yellowgreen in the icy sky dawn and dusk more electric and urgent than at home clouds and cliffs cast deep shadows that made a pinto contrast to the sunny ridges and everything had a sharpness that confused any sense of distance the germans could pick out snowy peaksmuller said one of them was everestthat on the map were nearly a hundred miles away the air was thin but more precious because of it and breathing reminded raeder of drinking champagne lungs sucked greedily throats raw and chilled from the draft and there was a curious feeling of giddiness the druglike euphoria countered the ache of muscles from the ceaseless climbs and descents at first this side of tibetdifferent from the chinese border areas a thousand miles to the east that raeder had explored with hood four years beforeseemed utterly empty but then the explorers realized the dark humps they might mistake for distant boulders were in fact grazing yak and that the black smudges were not patches of heather or thorn but nomadic felt tents southern tibet was essentially steep pasture as the germans marched dirty snotnosed nomad children would sometimes run out to the dirt trail to fruitlessly beg or herdsmen would gallop on their ponies to pull up and stare at the german caravan as it passed their faces dark and angular and their bodies wrapped in their chuba a cloaklike fleece coat the germans kept their guns in view diels wearing the submachine gun and raeder slinging his hunting rifle with scope across his back on three occasions the dugchen offered them tea and raeder and eckells would then amuse the herdsmen by competing at shooting at rocks up to four hundred yards away the men shouted approval at each puff of dust but once when raeder aimed at a distant antelope a chieftain gently shoved the muzzle aside the buddhists would not abide unnecessary killing when raeder and eckells were alone however they amused themselves by picking off animals that showed white against precipitous cliffs they left the carcasses to the vultures the few tibetan soldiers they encountered still practiced archery since they had no spare bullets to expend on practice the western show of arms was balanced by the little red swastika pennants that jutted up from the german pack animals like sturdy stalks the wind snapping what raeder hoped the natives would take as a familiar goodwill sign certainly they spotted similar swastikas inscribed or painted on doorways monastery porticos and farm carts in some the swastika arms were extended into the intricate circular geometry himmler had called a sun wheel it was an encouraging suggestion that the aryans were indeed finding ancient cousins the villages made of mud brick with flat clay roofs blended with the duncolored hills and were hazed by yakdung fires with the only trees growing in remote river bottoms the dung was a substitute for wood it was slapped into bricks by young girls and stacked at each residence for winter fuel proudly lining the top of every courtyard wall and reaching to the sill of every window the village roads were dirt each plod of the yaks raising a plume of dung dust illfed dogs would bark and snarl as the nazis passed lunging against feltrope tethers the germans shared the winding lumpy lanes with scarletrobed monks who hiked down from monasteries perched like forts on nearby hills there were also barley farmers herdsmen shopkeepers and migratory traders the women were pretty the germans noticed highcheeked darkeyed with hair like black silk but they were modestly wrapped against the wind in colorful dress and striped apron called a pangden that discouraged much discernment of their form the ss men were restless for women but had no idea how to obtain any in this strange contemplative culture raeder wanted one to dominate to hear her cries but he dared not risk it the mission required discipline the craving made him moody and when diels tried to joke with him about the dung and the dust he snapped in reply submission was what hed wanted from lotte until she hinted to her family about his tastes the marriage became too complicated and had to end and the accident was nearly that an accidenthed not planned it at allbut when the muzzle swung to follow a flight of rising ducks and traversed her body his finger had acted on its own hed pretended that shotgun had been at the bottom of the boat accidentally set off and had just enough celebrity to discourage too many close questions so lotte died in surprise sprawled in the bottom of the boat the top of her head gone and the rest gushing blood her mouth gaping with questions he himself couldnt answer shed been beautiful innocent naive and uncooperative he needed to find something great here something truly colossal to cement his place in history so that hed finally be able to sleep what are you brooding about kurt victory raeder wondered if titans like himmler had their own demons religion was everywhere prayer flags were strung at every sacred hill prayer wheels spun on the walls at each holy site pointed white chortens reliquaries for souls and saints poked up at town entrances like upsidedown turnips or gigantic goldentopped spark plugs every second male seemed to be a monk and the monasteries seemed the only real industry people shuffled while working mala s buddhist rosaries of beads but raeders quintet was drawn more to the old abandoned military forts called dzong s these medieval strongholds were empty and haunted replaced by the monastic strongholds of an overpowering religion the ss men felt more at home in these fortress ruins than in the dark smoky monasteries with their ominous chants raeders men scrambled through their labyrinth of rooms like boys at a german castle here they speculated their aryan ancestors would have ruled it was a more heroic military age said kranz their archaeologist now all they do is pray the valleys were planted in mustard and barley because wheat would not grow at this altitude chang the odd beer was made from barley incised into cliffs above the farms were reddaubed buddha statues or painted black and white ladders symbolic of the long prayerful climb toward nirvana tibetan technology was primitivethere were virtually no wheeled cartsbut the germans did occasionally encounter a waterwheel one near gyantse was used to mill barley another used the waterpower only to turn prayer wheels outside of a monastery each revolution a radio beam aimed at god lakes were turquoise or cobalt vivid against the treeless hills and birds hung over them like kites rotating in the wind the germans porter akeh one of several tibetans theyd hired pointed out sites for sky burials where the dead were dismembered and left for vultures to hasten the cycle of returning to the earth the carrion birds were holy poverty superstition ignorance prayer and barbarism raeder summed up one night as they camped by lake yamdok tso enjoying the luxury of a wood campfire fed by a nearby copse of stunted trees reichsfuhrer himmler might begin to doubt that these tibetans are or ever were aryans or that they could have left anything worth rediscovering we certainly havent found ruins of a nobler race said muller just crude forts or any food beyond yak meat and barley cakes moaned cameraman eckells the tsampa cakes were as tasteless as they were commonplace and yet were closer to heaven said raeder the stars tight as a ceiling the air sharp as a shard of ice i think i know why theyre obsessed with religion its the only occupation that makes sense here a way to make use of this weird clarity in such a case might a civilization not make discoveries obscured to empires in lower murkier places could the legends of vril be true i dont know kurt said muller my god they labor like peasants but they may have lost our secret wisdom said kranz we need the help of the tibetans and for that we have to convince them that germany and national socialism are their natural allies with our runes and our swastikas said diels our machines and our modernism said eckells our guns and our magnetometers yes and with our mysticism and belief in the past said raeder tibetans are a people lost in the past and we seek it too they believe in lives beyond this one and so does our reichsfuhrer were the new druids my companions the black knights who will lead the world to the purity of ice come lets build up our fire and sing for our porters their fire blazed higher light reflected on the lake and red sparks climbed to mingle with cold stars overhead the germans began singing a reich military anthem voices carrying across the water flame upraise rise in blazing light from the mountains along the rhine rise shining see we are standing faithful in a blessed circle to see you flame and so praise the fatherland holy fire call the young together so that next to your blazing flames courage grows they seized burning brands and began marching circling their camp as the mules shifted nervously then they paraded down to the dark lakeshore and at raeders command hurled the brands high over the water the torches fell like meteors hissing into the frigid water fire and ice world ice theory everything a struggle between light and dark white and black hot and cold the immaculate and the corrupt then they toasted one another with schnapps howling at the moon like german werewolves the tibetan porters watched silently from the shadows hankow china september t he shadow of the nakajima fighter flickered across the train just before the bullets did the soldiers aboard as startled as squirrels beneath a hawk hood was riding atop a boxcar to escape the crowding and the heat and watched the havoc stitch toward him as men yelled and instinctively ducked the carnage was transfixing there was only time for a shout of warning at the rising snarl of the engine and then the fighters machine guns chewed down the length of the lumbering cars wood flying and the wounded yelping newly recruited chinese infantrymen were blown from rooftop perches like chaff the painted twin meatballs of the rising sun were clearly visible on the wings as the fighter banked overhead and then it was coming for them again hundreds of excited soldiers shooting a fusillade into the sky as the train engines whistle screamed warning it felt like they were crawling hood pulled out the that duncan hale had issued him and balanced on his knees as the plane came toward them again the gun was slick and heavy he wanted to hide but inside was no better protection each strafing bullet was the size of a forefinger and could punch all the way to the roadbed their tormentor seemed to swell in size until it filled the whole sky hoods pistol bucked as he fired jarring his wrist and making it hard to aim he vowed to take more practice his rifle and shotgun were stored in his duffel below and he suddenly incongruously worried that his belongings might take a bullet the tops of the freight cars ahead seemed to heave upward as the machinegun fire struck men jerking and tumbling a catastrophic rupture that tore from car to car hood braced himself for the explosion of his own flesh but then the machine guns stopped flashing the nakajima roared by and the excited chinese were left to fire their rifles at an empty sky hood actually felt the suck of the propeller then as abruptly as it came the plane was gone their train whistle kept shrilly blowing at nothing maybe they wounded the pilot maybe the fighter ran out of bullets maybe it was low on fuel but hood knew that the only thing that saved his life during his harrowing journey to the chaotic new chinese capital was that the plane aborted its second strafing run just moments before the stuttering spray reached him splinters rose in a fountain a mesmerizing eruption and then the fountain abruptly ceased one car ahead born with a silver spoon in your mouth and dumb luck to cover your ass hood thought must have done something right in a previous life or youre supposed to do something in this one to earn it the attack left chaos in its wake cars were splashed with blood men moaned from the impact of the slugs and whole boards had been knocked askew but the train its engine unmarked didnt slow they chugged doggedly on while the dead were rolled off to make more room for the shaken living hood reloaded his and tucked it back in its holster the big pistol was less accurate than hurling rocks but if it ever hit a target it tended to stop it this was his first combat and he was relieved hed had the presence of mind to shoot back they reached hankow that night the rail yard light a combination of kerosene lamps paper lanterns and bonfires steaming in light rain soldiers coolies nurses nuns and generals milled in the chaos of the depot blood was still dripping from the floorboards of hoods troop train when he stepped down the leakage diluted by the wet fog and smoke mixed with the hissing steam of locomotives a distant rumble was not thunder but japanese and chinese artillery their reflected flashes were like sheet lightning the remaining dead were stacked like cordwood soldiers kept beggar children away from looting the bodies so they swarmed hood instead until he swatted them off old women pressed close to sell tea and steamed buns he ate one to reassure himself he was still alive you always knew it wasnt over with raeder he thought a rickshaw took hood toward chiangs headquarters weaving through the crowded streets was like pushing through syrup everywhere were guns munitions heavily guarded pallets of rice tins of fuel and refugees thats what the japanese were attacking hood decided syrup china was an endless sea of viscous honey that would ultimately swallow any invader in the meantime millions would die sir arthur readings had given him a letter of introduction to madame chiang kaishek the shanghaiborn americanraised wellesley college graduate who had become the fluent link between china and the united states because of her interest in aviation she was also secretarygeneral of the chinese commission on aeronautical affairs in other words the generalissimos wife ran the chinese air force hood would need her permission to borrow beth calloway madame chiang was a petite chinese woman with a large head who was not especially pretty anymorepower had hardened herbut who carried the commanding presence that comes from the blessing of a strongboned face and incandescent eyes she had a disconcerting southern accent from georgia where she was raised and a smile and animation that beamed with the energy of a lighthouse china was fighting for survival and this dynamo who bridged two worlds would do anything it took to save it tibet she exclaimed after examining the documents of introduction hed been given by the americans and british even for us chinese thats the edge of the world a place of mystery and misunderstanding and you say himmler is sending an expedition there so ive been told the missions leader kurt raeder is a man who accompanied one of my expeditions several years ago moody but highly competent and a nazi so ive been asked to learn what hes up to but he has a long head start which is why i need to borrow an airplane sir arthur suggested an aviatrix named beth calloway sir arthur would as would any man i suppose she looked at him slyly shes one of our best pilots you know thats what i need to fly to the highest country on earth im actually interested that you prove the feasibility of such flights mr hood aviation is chinas future its the one technology that can stitch a very big very crowded very complex nation together my husband agrees and because we have no aircraft industry of our own we must cobble together soviet german american and british planes to fight the japanese in doing so the invaders are learning were not just a nation of ignorant coolies the whole world admires your courage the whole world knows were in retreat which is why we cant risk leaving our backs unguarded were the germans to somehow gain influence in tibet and turn it against us for their new allies the japanese wed have enemies on two sides this cant be tolerated so yes im going to order ms calloway to fly you to lhasa we need to know what herr raeder is up to dont we have you flown in a biplane before i was hoping for something more modern anything more modern is fighting the japanese have you met beth calloway no sir arthur described her in flamboyant terms flamboyant is an interesting choice of word youre in for an experience there as well ill write an order giving you transport in one of our corsairs it can just barely clear the tibetan passes but its durable repairable and old enough to be expendable youre so reassuring miss calloway has ingenuity i assure you shell get you as close as she can as fast as she can dress warmly and take a gun i have several and fired one at a japanese fighter splendid did you hit him i dont know at least he went away she smiled i wish i could say the same for the entire japanese army thank you for your help and advice madame air secretary thank you for your service dr hood i understand youre a wealthy man and a respected curator i know you dont have to do this actually ive thought about it and i do he turned to go when he got to the door she called after him oh and dr hood yes you might want to return through british india were doing our best but hankow may have fallen to the japanese by the time you want to go home if youve survived b eth calloway didnt have a bowie knife but she did have cowboy boots western jeans a denim work shirt dirty from engine grease and a brooklyn dodgers baseball cap with its bill turned backward a was holstered on one undeniably fetching hip and her blond hair was cut in a practical bob she was twisting a wrench with masculine determination on the engine of a mustardcolored twoseater biplane scout a thatched roof served as a hangar flies buzzing on black pieces of machinery as if they were carrion a santa claus calendar from advertised cocacola the planes patched wings nicked propeller and two bullet holes through its thin metal fuselage didnt inspire confidence to hood the corsair looked barely capable of clearing the runway let alone the tibetan plateau so the wright brothers had a garage sale she glanced up squinting across a dust of freckles her eyes were sky blue afraid of flying mr hood he strummed a strut afraid of falling dr hood actually ph d she straightened you must be the egghead the chinese warned was coming museum curator and expert on aviation calloway let her arm fall with the heavy wrench and hood stood for inspection he was taut and tanned in that country club way with the confidence that comes of breeding money and schools with crests on their jackets he carried a duffel bag on a sling that was nearly as long as he was and had taken care to be washed combed and cocky beths knuckles were scraped her nails short and her lips bare and pursed with skepticism pretty enough in a wary way but not as impressed with him as he was used to in fact she looked as if she were surprised hed made it this far im just cautious of machines with holes in them he said this vought corsair is only ten years old easy to fly and it can be fixed with chewing gum if you have to perhaps i should buy stock in wrigley he rapped on the plane and when she didnt respond to his wit decided to be less sarcastic beats walking so charmed to meet you her tone made it clear she wasnt and you beth calloway so madame chiang did send orders to introduce us youll take me to tibet dear me in this with a woman are you sure you want to unfortunately madame chiang says this crate and you are all that can be spared expendable is the word they all keep using he looked in one of the cockpits is it any bigger than it looks much smaller after the first ten hours dont like to fly dr hood call me ben i flew to hong kong on the clipper we dined with silver cutlery and had a choice of wines i dine with a tip cup and boil water before i drink it she put down the wrench and ran a wrist on her forehead even a grease smudge looked good on her he decided but she didnt flirt maybe she didnt like boys i guess this will have to do he gave her his best smile christ you look like you were sent by pepsodent he reddened i do brush my teeth iron the ascot wax the limousine starch the collar yes ill take you to tibet great white hunter you flatter me i only collect scientific specimens madame chiang is the one who flatters you professor she finally held out a greasy hand palm up he wasnt sure if it was a greeting demand for payment or a gesture of warning she reports youre a fine shot of rare and defenseless animals which you stuff and cart back to the states and you have a reputation as the best american woman pilot in china also the only american woman pilot in china he took her hand and squeezed it their fingers slid not unpleasantly from the oil he thought she hesitated just a moment before pulling away but it was one of those signals best to receive two or three times to confirm a pleasure to meet you miss calloway its not lucky for a passenger to disparage his aircraft is it not lucky to do what dis to criticize my my they did send our best didnt they a real college boy im a zoologist with the american museum of natural history in new york and ive walked to tibet before im simply in more of a hurry this time i wouldnt care except that madame chiang does i need to confer with authorities in lhasa no one gets to confer with the authorities in lhasa its forbidden i have to unforbid it for your museum my present employers require discretion your what requires what my new bosses told me to keep my mouth shut well she regarded him a long minute gazing up and down how much do you weigh zooowlogist without meaning to he drew himself up about one eightyfive maybe one ninety after those clipper meals why big words vague mission fussy flier i got a feeling that whatever extra fuel i can squeeze aboard is going to be a lot more useful than you this one was going to require some charm he thought or taming cascade river road united states september present day t he mountains rose higher and drew tighter as rominy and jake drove up the skagit the twists in the highway giving an occasional glimpse of ramparts of snow at marblemount the valley broadened briefly into pasture modest homes perched above the steep riverbank the skagit muscular as a snake then they turned to cross the river on a steel twolane bridge and headed up the side valley of the cascade river this tributary poured from a forested canyon onto a pan of gravel bars ahead were hills steep as sugarloaves rocky crags somewhere above the new river was translucent as a jewel the rocks of its bed bright coins their banker had found an old christmas cookie tin in the branch lunchroom tapped out dry crumbs and put hoods safety deposit box curiosities in it for rominy to take with her there was an old army colt that barrow suggested she take for home protection the fact that the journalist was willing to arm her even with a presumably unloaded pistol reassured her the weapon was as heavy as a brick however and shed never fired a gun in her life more intriguingly there were three gold coins with some kind of curious asian design embossed in the metal a white silk scarf a dented compass black with a silver arrow a brass key apparently to a padlock left by authorities to secure hoods cabin dunnigan had told her and dramatically the mummified finger of her greatgrandfather shrunken and slightly bent was it a last defiant digit upraised against the unfairness of the world we dont know if any of these has meaning dunnigan had said as rominy laid the articles out on the counter in the safety deposit room the bank of stainless steel drawers glowing green in the weird light beyond meaning to your greatgrandfather the gold could fetch a couple of thousand dollars at todays prices and the gun may have antique value i dont know the real money is the interest from the old savings account mr hood left a hefty deposit to rent the safety deposit box before he died the cash theyd requested was hypnotizing rominy settled for since dunnigan said the bank couldnt come up with more on such short notice it was in twenties fifties and hundreds the thousanddollar packets wrapped with white paper bands shed never seen so much cash in her life jake fetched a daypack from his pickup stuffed the money inside and handed it to her yours how did he die rominy asked the banker of her greatgrandfather given the suspicious demise of her other relatives at least according to jake barrow she half expected something truly exotic like snakebite or ninja throwing star natural causes the papers said a coroners guess someone found the body up at his cabin in the spring and hed passed some months before wouldnt have liked to have walked in on that there wasnt much left i suppose anyway most important was his will in the box here leaving any possessions to unspecified heirs which apparently means you since youre the last one so i get this key to his cabin you get his cabin dont expect much taxes have been minimal due to the low assessment and theres been little maintenance i didnt expect anything at all a few hours ago its astonishing how fortune can turn isnt it and all thanks to mr barrow dunnigan had beamed at him and hed done his best to look modest s o now they were deeper in the woods than ever the vine maple already turning scarlet and the fir that leaned over the road as high as a skyscraper creeks cut down from the mountain above turning white when they flashed from the underbrush and tumbled over boulders into culverts jake eventually turned left onto a dirt driveway a tunnel in the brush a piece of weatheredgray plywood with crudely painted house numbers was the only thing marking their exit they traversed up the flank of a mountain above cascade river road the pickup bouncing in the ruts you can bet i had a hard time finding this one jake said and then ma barker greeted me with the muzzle of her shotgun thats called an upriver hello im a long way from the cops arent i he glanced at her but not from friends they drove a hundred yards up the dirt lane a strip of grass in the middle and salmonberry scratching the pickups sides then they came to a clearing there was a lichenspotted singlewide mobile home the color of its paint having turned indeterminate at least a decade before the flat roof had a crew cut of moss smoke drifted from a pipe chimney elbowing out of the trailer and all the curtains were drawn then there were the requisite junk cars being subsumed by blackberries an old chicken coop a weathered barn leaning like a drunk and a scattering of rusted and plastic junk in unmown weeds two hounds came racing out from under a rotting deck barking as if the place were stalag they put their muzzles up to the pickup door windows and bayed rominy instinctively shrank against jake who viewed the animals as calmly as if theyd stumbled on a petting zoo after a minute or two the hounds seemed to realize nothing was happening or they ran out of breath they quieted pacing up and down the side of the pickup snorting and slavering then an old woman appeared on the sagging porch and the dogs started up again thunder damnation shut up she waved a stick for emphasis no it wasnt a stick it was a gun good lord rominy turned to jake dogpatch is where my greatgrandfather lived up the road farther but we have to tell mrs crocketter clarksonwhat were up to or shes likely to have half the neighborhood using us for target practice mostly tar heels up here out from the carolinas to log the woods delphina clarkson fit every stereotype wild gray hair carhartt overalls rubber gardening boots a doublebarrel that dated to cowboy days and a smile that hadnt seen a dental hygienist for just as long the dogs raced around howling as she strode up doing their best to earn their supper by being obnoxious down you two thunder quiet dammit damnation she rapped on jakes window with the barrel of her gun and barrow cranked it a hands width down hello mrs clarkson remember me i told you to git and i told you i was trying to find the rightful owner of the old hood place to which this road is legal access you know as well as i do that the deeds grant a rightofway the heiress is going up to view her property heiress she squinted at rominy her thats a city girl it surely is hed summoned a cornpone accent the dogs started barking again and mrs clarkson started whacking them with the butt of her gun swearing like a sailor damnation you stupid the name of your dog is damnation rominy asked surprised she could find her voice hell yes named for damnation crick and for what i said when this pup ran loose up that rat hole of a waterway i had to chase him through devils club and deadfall hes lived up to his name ever since she seemed slightly less hostile talking about her dogs mrs clarkson this is rominy hood barlow said the greatgranddaughter of benjamin hood i tracked her down like i said i would and she is now your new neighbor weve got a key to the cabin and well be up there for tonight at least you two together the idea startled rominy she realized it was almost evening but she hadnt thought ahead to where she might be sleeping and it certainly wasnt going to be with mr jake barrow no matter how cute he was and yet here she was in a pickup cab she couldnt get out of without his help her mini cooper reduced to shredded aluminum foil her apartment two hundred miles away nor did she want to curl up with calamity jane here along with thunder and damnation and the river road was not the easiest place to hitch a ride they hadnt passed another car in ten miles were business partners only barrow said briskly you can rest assured that ms hood has displayed every capability of resisting my charm girl has some sense then but well both be in the cabin since weve nowhere else to go id appreciate if you kept the hounds on your own property and dont call the sheriff when you see lights in the old cabin call the sheriff i could raise eight children in the time it would take a deputy to get up here she squinted at the journalist but you treat this young lady with respect or i will set the dogs on you mr business partner you hear he smiled yes maam she looked at rominy watch yourself around men thats my advice yes maam she frowned considering you comin up here all the time now thats up to rominy but i dont think so barrow said were just trying to learn about the past hmph whats past is past and thats the best place for it is what ive learned she looked at rominy you want to sell the place you let me know first yes maam you aint gonna want to keep it she stepped away cradling her shotgun in one arm i already see lights up there sometimes this place of yours young lady is haunted potala palace lhasa tibet september t he winter palace that would soon house tibets toddler godking mimicked the majesty of the surrounding mountains it stacked toward the clouds tier upon tier of white and red its walls sloping inward in the tibetan fashion to give the edifice the firmness of natural cliffs it was a royal crown the color of snow and dried blood roofed with gold and set high atop a hill above the capital of lhasa when dawn sun hit the potala palace and made it glow the shrine seemed to be absorbing energy enough to lift free of its escarpment entirely and ascend into heaven like a stone balloon birds soared beneath the uppermost windows and purple and yellow banners marked the royal apartments scarletrobed monks kept watch from terraces and a thousand windows looked out to green mountains and kyichu the lhasa river to raeder and his germans the fourcenturiesold palace was a fever dream the fantasy of ten thousand long miles turned real a storehouse of asian mystery and reports went incalculable amounts of religious gold now the regent of the kingdom who ruled until the recent reincarnation of the young dalai lama could come of agea regent named thupten jampel yishey gyantsen the reting from the rinpoche monasteryhad agreed to see the nazis he did so over heated british objections the reting wanted to hear what these foreigners might offer or threaten raeder had already wooed thupten by sending presents the reting had torn wrappings off a telescope radio set and music box stamped with the nazi swastika raeder also sent copies of several of himmlers favorite booksin germanalong with a letter translated into tibetan by a hired monk it proposed that the german and tibetan races might share aryan ancestry the gifts must have provoked curiosity because now the quintet of ss men were ascending the steep switchbacking staircases that led to the palaces primary gate wearing their hastily pressed black schutzstaffel uniforms trimmed with silver despite their conditioning from crossing the himalayas the germans still panted there were steps in the palace a physical reminder of mans difficult rise to nirvana the edifice itself was a dizzying five hundred feet high a stone skyscraper broad as a dam from the redandgold gate topped by the heads of seven white lions lhasa below looked like a scattering of brown cubes on a cultivated valley floor of yellow barley an arena encircled by green grassy mountains the river curled like a khata scarf silver where hit by the sun monasteries clung to the foothills and the golden roof of the jokhang temple in central lhasa was an answering wink to the gleam of the potala the view was one of the most breathtaking raeder had ever seen earning his respect perhaps the people who had built this did have secrets that could help the reich triumph if so they must be learned and stolen the germans were greeted by the dinosaur bellow of the tibetan long trumpets the dungchen a mournful underworld serenade that echoed against the sloping walls they passed through gate and passageway and a steward led them into a labyrinth of dark rooms steep ladders and dim passageways of the red palace their porter lokesh translating as they penetrated deeper into a shadowy maze gloomy chambers were built around gigantic images of buddha each serene and buttery smooth from a fabulous overlay of gold ventilation chimneys plunged down story after story like empty elevator shafts butter lamp flames dancing in the resulting currents of air there were metal mandalas the size of waterwheels the sculptures representing exquisite miniature temples that symbolized the universe each of them gilded with gold and studded with jewels adjacent to this artisan glory the painted wood of the handtrimmed posts and beams gave a curious mountain lodge feel to the place the floors were beaten earth and pebbles tamped into a dry concrete on ancient joists theres wealth enough here to buy a dozen panzer divisions raeder murmured guarded by medieval sentries who could be overcome by a platoon of storm troopers armed with machine pistols we are conquistadors comrades able to view treasures equivalent to the inca atahualpa and yet now we must bow and scrape in order to achieve a greater goal if himmler is right this treasure is mere dross dross compared to what muller whispered sliteyed buddhas golden lamas and gilded saints looked sternly ahead the palace was a museum of frozen gold hundreds of statues thousands in a bewildering pantheon shambhala raeder replied the real shangrila that might be himmlers fantasy this is real for us whats real is what the reichsfuhrer says is real sufficiently awed and subdued by the splendor the germans were taken across the eastern courtyard to the white palace its icy color a symbol of peace more than a hundred people waited in the plaza guards monks emissaries and petitioners it was hot in the sun cold in the shade after a wait of fortytwo minutesraeder timed it on his junghans military watchthe europeans were led up a short pyramid of stone steps to wooden ones so steep they were almost ladders banners with a purple symbol of infinity flanked the door inside was dimness that kept only tentative rein on a riot of color a kaleidoscope of painted reds golds blues greens and purples on every pillar and beam the designs could take a year to fully examine and decipher it was the very opposite of the cold intimidating austerity of the third reich white obeliskshaped posts rose to a mustardyellow ceiling in the throne room cushions were vatican red while bowls of ceremonial water were viking silver the inside was as baroque as the mountains were bare various functionaries monks and hangerson sat on padded benches in the smoky shadows murmuring and humming prayers light was cast by wicks flaming in tubs of yellow yak butter the air pungent with incense the place smelled like every one of its four hundred years never use a thousand colors when a million will do murmured kranz its like the explosion of a childs paintbox set look whispered hans diels swastikas the symbol was sewn onto tapestries as foreign as this seems we have i suspect in some sense come home reader told his men tibets regent sat crosslegged on a padded throne draped in robes and crowned with a peaked saffroncolored hat that descended over his ears and back of the neck like bird wings the reting was a seriouslooking smoothcheeked largeeared young man who didnt look entirely happy about his weight of responsibility he ruled while the new dalai lama whom hed helped discover the year before was coming of age in kumbum monastery the majesty of the transition was unsettling reting had had a dream of where the reincarnation of the deceased thirteenth dalai lama might be found and a retinue of holy men had made a pilgrimage to a remote rural home eerily the peasant toddler had picked out the belongings of the dead holy man shouting mine mine while ignoring other choices even to a believer actually finding a reincarnated presence had been shaking soon his holiness would be brought to lhasa but for now reting was the monarch of the potala and responsible with his council of deciding what to do with these germans the europeans were stocky sunburned hardlooking men who seemed to want to suck experience in with their mouths instead of feeling it with their souls the tibetan thought their eyes darted like those of rodents their limbs trembled with restlessness and their black uniforms were forbidding they wore deaths heads at their collar pale anxious unhappy men the world was squeezing tibet the regent knew there was war to the east between china and japan the british had bludgeoned their way into lhasa more than thirty years before the soviet union was a secretive dark dictatorship hulking beyond the kunlun mountains airplanes and radio waves were violating the sanctity of distance that had always protected the sacred kingdom reting himself had been alerted of raeders approach by british radio and now these germans had come claiming some kind of ancestral kinship everyone was suddenly tibets friend because everyone wanted to turn it against their enemies which nation should be trusted and which kept out how could these giants with their steel machines that groaned and spat fire be played off against each other and then the german spokesman a man named raeder gave a solution the handsome visitor began by presenting an album of pictures of nazi germany and its leaders pointing to the national socialist symbols that seemed inspired by ancient tibetan iconography the fuhrer like reting and the future dalai lama was not just the political leader of germany raeder explained he was the spiritual leader as well a new kind of god for a new kind of man some of the pictures depicted huge rallies for him all the people standing curiously in line as rigid as posts they wore helmets and looked like lines of beetles reting wanted to laugh at their rigid stiffness but knew that was impolite he passed the album back this fuhrer s lieutenant himmler was intensely interested in the origins of mankind and the history of the aryan race raeder explained tibetan nobility had the fine bone structure of the aryan and it was in this beautiful country that ancestral proof of their relationship might be hidden the germans had come to tibet to learn if their peoples were related there are even western theories of ancient powers that might have been found and lost in tibet raeder said my friend kranz here has been casting masks of facial characteristics and finding remarkable correlations between your citizens and ours my friend muller has been making scientific measurements of magnetism and gravity to hunt for hiding places where such powers might reside my friend diels wants to study your history and my friend eckells to record your ceremonies reichsfuhrer ss heinrich himmler has sent us here to offer our help we hide nothing reting said in another chamber i can show you a buddha made of a thousand pounds of gold no crypt is needed to secrete it our faith is our life and this life is but a step toward the next one there is much we can learn from such wisdom raeder replied even though he believed no such thing and much we could share some germans like reichsfuhrer ss himmler believe in reincarnation too then why did you hunt when you came before with the americans clearly reting knew more about raeder than was expected why have you shot animals this time when you thought we werent watching you killed what may have been your leaders ancestors reincarnated in animal form raeder shifted uncomfortably that was for science you left them to rot you must not kill while you are in our kingdom the german gave a curt nod we apologize for our custom we accede to your wisdom the sanctity of life is a path toward nirvana we germans appreciate your beliefs reting shook his head ive seen your books and movies we believe in an escape from passions and you believe in heightening them we believe in losing our desires and you believe in feeding them we believe ambition leads to dissatisfaction and you believe ambition is lifes purpose we believe in exploring what is within and you believe in exploring what is without the germans looked at each other murmuring then raeder tried again its true there are differences but there are similarities as well you believe in perfecting your soul through many incarnations and we believe in perfecting all mankind through natural selection and the discipline of national socialism we both believe in past ages better than the present and a future of promise we are both your monks and we nazis idealists in our own way he took a breath but we also believe in the importance of this life and use science and engineering to improve it the world is shrinking regent and youll want powerful friends if your giant neighbors press too close friendship is why we didnt arrest you as you approached lhasa and friendship is why more germans should come here to protect you we can teach your soldiers more germans with your american friends the americans are not our friends i was here on an academic partnership on that earlier expedition but their leader a man named benjamin hood was jealous of my achievements and tried to thwart them you must never allow americans here they are a greedy shallow people they care only for money and you do not we germans are scholars and idealists we could help search for lost secrets that could help us both ah secrets what everyone seeks there are reports of a lost kingdom of shambhala are there not theres a mural of it here in the potala reting said it is our olympus our atlantis our utopia it is a kingdom ringed by impenetrable mountains accessible only to the most holy there poverty hunger sickness and crime are unknown people live for a hundred years at the center is a glittering palace where the sacred kalachakra teachings are kept and someday when wickedness is rampant and the world is engulfed in catastrophic warfare the mists that hide shambhala will lift and its king will ride forth with his host to destroy the forces of evil and establish a new golden age that will last a thousand years not entirely different from the prophecies of the christian bible which were inspired perhaps by shambhala if your theories of ancient connections are correct or shambhala by the west who knows once in the distant past all was one just as in the universe yes the northern legends of the germanic people have similar echoes so perhaps we were indeed our people and yours once one and now we share symbolism raeder pointed to a swastika but not necessarily alliance tibet doesnt want the worlds quarrels and yet the world is quarreling and what do you want for your friendship what if shambhala is true in some way and could be found and learned from that is what the reichsfuhrer believes its secrets could ensure the security of your country and mine for a long time if any tibetan has found shambhala he has not returned but my men are willing to look for you with your guidance we believe it exists but we need your help to find it shambhala exists as much as anything exists in the dream we call life the regent said but i believe the journey to it is within ones heart as much as upon ones legs and to understand ones heart is perilous indeed raeder smiled this was the kind of eastern nonsense that would keep these societies in the middle ages while the master race took control then let us germans take the risk for you you have the right consciousness we have the right will we condition our hearts to probe the wilderness i respect your inner journey but shambhala is a physical place as well do you know where the kingdom is supposed to lie the traditional belief is a lost valley deep in the kunlun mountains at the head of a disappearing river far from every trade route and habitation there the voices of the dead inhabit the wind difficult to find and by reputation dangerous to penetrate there are impossible gorges and impossible mountains impossible until it is done the young regent considered his visitors hed heard a hundred stories tibets past was a fog of history and myth a fog one could get lost inbut a fog rising from a lake of truth these europeans had no idea of the hazards ahead or the terrible things they might discover you think you can do this when we have not only with your help and permission as you said we explore the world when perhaps we should be exploring our souls but we are very good at exploring the world and if you found what you are looking for we would share what we found the germans nodded reting looked into the shadows of the room there on shelves were stacked thousands of holy books peche unbound leaves wrapped in cloth and tied with wooden end pieces dating back centuries beyond counting the books were enigmatic but had many clues one remarkable young nun had been compiling those clues shed met westerners before and had prophesized this moment shed warned that modern tibet must rediscover shambhala before foreigners did or ensure that it could never be found her perspective had been poisoned reting knew there were rumors upon rumors about keyuri lin still he and she had made their plans the retings visitors were tough restless men obsessed with the longings the buddha taught should be escaped but here they were in the potala which theyd been forbidden to approach where else might they reach what if they could give tibet real power in a dangerous world perhaps we can make a partnership he said watching the germans the westerners eyes lit with ambition and greed the worlds crisis is growing darker raeder said time is of the essence do you have any trucks or cars that would speed part of the journey to the kunlun the regent smiled the british do ask them let the europeans quarrel among themselves he wasnt going to risk his own motorcar shipped in pieces on animal backs and reassembled in lhasa so he could drive on the palace parade ground so hed heed keyuri and work with these interlopers to either retrieve rumored secrets or get rid of the germans entirely the woman had counseled that perhaps they could do boththis odd woman who studied things that were rightly the province of men the germans shifted the english will not help us raeder said we fought a war with them a generation ago reting shrugged we have a scholar a most unusual nun of most unusual curiosity who has studied the shambhala legend more than any monk does your culture allow you to work with a woman as a guide of course raeder said not admitting that he agreed with the nazis that a womans best duty was raising children european nations have been ruled by queens as well as kings the germans glanced at each other this seeming cooperation was more than theyd hoped and they were both elated and wary reting clapped his hands once and monks bowed and disappeared in the shadows a short time later they led a young woman into the reception area her head was cropped as short as a boot camp recruit in the fashion of both monks and nuns but she was quite pretty her features fine her lashes long she advanced with eyes low a sheaf of papers and maps in her hand keyuri lin will give you what guidance we can the reting said raeder started his companions looked at him curiously but he had eyes only for this female scholar his face suddenly pale she lifted her head it was the woman benjamin hood had taken from him each waited for the other to shout warning but neither did the air over western china september t he corsair biplane had two cockpits hood would sit in front of beth calloway as she piloted in a basket about as comfortable as a barrel a metal seat hard ribs and welded flange to hang on to behind a snarling engine it was miles to lhasa and each one was going to be bumpy cold and noisy well fly close to the ground at first and put down if we spot any japanese she said then well follow the yangtze to chongqing and break due west for chengdu after that its mountains mountains mountains how high can this crate fly its mustard yellow was spattered with mud from rough landings more than eighteen thousand feet if we stay light thats high enough to clear any passes beyond that you have to hike just get me to lhasa at twelve thousand if i can reach the authorities fast enough i can do what im supposed to do i hope she looked him over jaunty filson bush hat that would blow off if he didnt put it away oil cloth packer coat a automatic that would identify him as an american a bandolier of rifle and shotgun shells like some mexican bandit and highlace mountaineering boots shiny with waterproof wax all he lacked was a merit badge in the humid heat he was sweating she pointed skeptically whats that he was shouldering his sling canvas duffel fat as a sailors and long enough to stuff a body he swung it off for presentation my gear where does it go it doesnt not with us im going to need this in tibet calloway swung open the door of a compartment behind her own seat youre not getting to tibet unless we carry these three petrol canisters took up most of the space the corsairs maximum range is less than seven hundred miles weve got two refueling spots but well have to put down and top off with these on the leg to lhasa then we need a bigger plane we dont have a bigger plane unless you packed one in that duffel he frowned i miss the clipper i miss flying by myself whats in there anyway reluctantly he handed her the bag which bent her over with its weight youre kidding right she dropped it on the hangar dirt and began pulling the contents out no no no shirts underwear trousers and jackets were tossed to one side so were extra boots binoculars compass canteen and sleeping bag what are you doing curbing weight and space here she picked out a sweater and threw it to him it will get cold past chengdu the rest is too bulky whats this she held up a bottle of singlemalt scotch glenfiddich which sir arthur had recommended replenishment weight she tossed and it shattered thats twentyyearold scotch she was a madwoman the monks dont need it and neither do we and whats this she pulled out two guns by the stock a gauge shotgun and a winchester model hunting rifle with scope jesus lord going hunting again in a manner of speaking those we do bring no room college boy ive already been strafed on this trip no room you carry a pistol and so do you weve no room for long guns they go in the cockpit with me well leave you behind if we have to she put her hands on her hips youre going to fly this plane by yourself he looked her up and down how hard can it be the insult won a smirk her first concession of respect she nodded reluctantly you bring a zero down with one of these and ill be impressed so lets do a trade for these guns something else has to go she stepped up on the wing reached into his cockpit and hauled out a pack and harness this will give you more room and incentive to aim true whats that your parachute well leave it here great what are you bringing the clothes im wearing a box of tools and chewing gum and my parachute since i travel light you got money chinese gold dont show it use a money belt but you can buy robes and boots in tibet for pennies on the dollar guns too i imagine i like my own she gave him a leather flying hood goggles and white silk scarf bugs and grit can hit like bullets when you fly the scarf is to prevent chafing when you crane your neck i want you looking for japs the first hundred miles when you get to the potala palace you can give it to the regent trading scarves is custom in tibet they call the scarf a khata now be useful you can turn the prop we are in the dark ages dont do it until you get my signal and step backward once it spins i dont want hamburger all over my plane the engine roared to life spitting a plume of black smoke the propeller turned into a blur he walked around the biplane wings to look at what the aviatrix was doing inside her cockpit was a stick a pair of foot pedals and a throttle he would fly if he had to here use this she shouted over the roar of the engine it was a jar of vaseline she was smearing on her checks fights windburn tibetan herders use red cream made from whey but it stinks like hell and makes them look like demons he smeared his face climbed up on the lower wing and swung himself into his cockpit even with the parachute gone it was a tight fit with his firearms their barrels pointed up rattling with the vibration beth pushed the silver throttle and the biplane shuddered and began to move then she used the rudder pedals to turn and soon they were bouncing down the dirt runway the engine roared climbing toward a whine and they raced skipping now then a pull of the joystick and they lumbered into the air a posse of chinese children running after them and waving could have carried another fifty pounds hood thought sourly but his spirits lifted with the plane maybe he could still catch raeder houses turned to toys below people became insects he settled back for the ride it was too noisy to talk the view was panoramic the wind bracing and the experience entirely different from the clipper he felt as farsighted as a bird china became a green quilt buttoned with tile and thatch roofs they skimmed just a few hundred feet above peasants pausing to peer up at them behind on the horizon plumes of smoke rose from the sinojapanese front hood did spot the wink of sun on a plane back toward the war so as precaution he took up his rifle opened the bolt and slid in a shell he turned half around resting the barrel on the rim of the cockpit calloway pushed it aside idiot she shouted youll take my head off before you hit something going three hundred miles an hour i was joking about downing a zero put it away he saluted but rested the butt of his winchester on the floor of his cockpit again safety set one hand on its stock if a fighter came near him again he was going down shooting the yangtze was a broad silt road thirdlongest river in the world as they flew east the land grew hillier china a hazed rolling ocean everything from steamships to sampans crawled below peasants stooping and oxen plodding in a tableau that hadnt changed in a thousand years then the land rose still more and they began flying through a succession of magnificent ravines green mountains rising higher than their wings the wu gorge calloway shouted forested mountainsides reared like the skyscraper canyons of new york the sedimentladen river twisted like an orange intestine villages clung to narrow shelves still in shadow somewhere ahead was raeder t hey spent their first night in chongqing hood dazed and stiff from the long hours of engine noise fumes wind and cramping he paid the pittance it cost to buy them two rooms at a makeshift inn near the grass runway it was dim insideelectricity hadnt reached this farand smoky from the charcoal brazier calloway looked weary from the days flight and was about as flirtatious as eleanor roosevelt she bolted her rice and vegetables like a dog hood tried to make conversation youre a smartmouth like my sister i enjoy that she snorted your sister howd you learn to fly she looked at him tiredly watched some barnstormers and saved up for flying lessons her reddened eyes wandered around the room as if sociability was almost too much to endure that just made it interesting shows initiative its called gumption in nebraska and youre a girl quite the observation deadeye its unusual thats all were half the population and unusual isnt impossible i wanted to do more than peel spuds and have babies he waited for her to ask more about him but she didnt so he plunged on its a long way from nebraska to the chinese air force beth looked at him directly this time over the rim of her teacup you are educated so okay im a tomboy a runaway and a mercenary and the weathers better everywheres better than nebraska and the moneys good yes your wealth is apparent she chewed you havent seen my closet full of shoes he smiled at the joke progress i also get to work for a woman madame chiang remarkable isnt she forceful and so are you miss calloway youve flown me five hundred miles and havent strayed off course once how would you know besides i was following the yangtze that shows wisdom right there you dont need to flatter me mr hood im not impressed by your museum your money your conversation or your skill at killing helpless animals im far too tired to want to sleep with you and too well read to expect anything you say to be particularly enlightening youre an assignment you flatter me i thought i was a mere chore yes progress shed volunteered more than one sentence in a row the leg to chengdu is two hundred miles shorter but youll excuse me for going to bed im guessing youd rather have me alert tomorrow and im sure you can fascinate yourself she stood hood remained seated do something by myself anyway he threw her a few gold coins for the first leg of the trip she didnt pick them up we leave at dawn t hey went on at six am the plane bouncing as they slowly climbed west it was another long cramped day and after landing at chengdu and refueling hood wearily sat with his back against the tail of the plane watching the sun go down in a haze of fire behind the mountains to the west hed stuffed cotton in his ears beneath his helmet for the flight but they still rang from the long hours in the air calloway had been her usual laconic self upon landing wordlessly directing coolies to gas up the plane and checking an engine that ticked as it cooled most people got to hoods family and money sooner rather than later but shed shown no interest in either she was professional guarded and working hard to be unimpressed hood considered that a sign of character but still beth finally wiped her hands with a rag and stood in front of him are you just going to lean on my plane or find us a place to sleep im postponing the inevitable there are more fleas inside than out i think youre sulking because i broke your scotch he looked up at her squinting against the late glare of the sun and i think you were showing off by breaking it she bit her lip so were you by bringing it i knew what it cost he looked back down across the airfield pretty women had the luxury of being annoying and she was managing to annoy him pepsodent my ass sorry to have offended you beth suddenly looked hesitant and abruptly walked around the plane again thrumming the wire wing supports for tension then she plopped next to him on the grass look it was stupid he studied her the girl too tough to ever risk being hurt you dont allow yourself to enjoy much do you i dont allow myself to be disappointed its a fault she shook out her curls to loosen them from the packing of the helmet of course she didnt go so far as to actually look at him or offer a pleasantry that would be too polite but she didnt move away either they both had goggle rings around their eyes like raccoons she stared at the sky too i never knew riding could be so tiring hood finally tried again silence im still vibrating from the engine it doesnt go away more quiet then ready to walk college boy why do you call me that im a specimen collector not an intellectual you already claimed youre a reader as well though damned if ive noticed any evidence of it i was reciting thucydides all day you just couldnt hear over the engine baloney ill bet the only thing youve ever read is ladies home journal and engine manuals ladies home journal she barked a laugh then she finally looked at him to recite proud as a schoolgirl the secret of happiness is freedom the secret of freedom is courage thucydides said that e pluribus unum a nickel says that see were both eggheads she finally laughed out of many one but youre the lonely aviatrix i just rely on myself and youre free to a point and courageous to a point and contemptuous of any man who isnt you she seemed warily interested in his assessment women too ive never sat home counting stock coupons which i could afford to do he knew he sounded defensive im paying my own way on a mission for my government im in the middle of nowhere going to find a man id just as soon forget it takes courage to fly in a plane like yours with a pilot like you in a place like this but i dont feel free at all or happy the best ive managed is to be amused so what the devil are you doing here dr hood she was crosslegged and leaned forward a little curious now its secret of course he could think of no better way to irritate her to save the world she guessed its got to be something important to fly to the end of the earth why do you care youve taken me with you it only seems im taking you he plucked at the grass recognizing the truth of that he considered how to answer her all anyone ever manages is to save themselvesi know that but give me credit for doing what i can the fact is the luck of my birth embarrasses me i envy ordinary people then youre a fool people are happier being ordinary nonsense youre the kind of man who does everything he can to keep from being ordinary ive seen your type in china a hundred times terrified of being bored deliberately eccentric to fit the adventure stereotype achievement as penance penance for what you tell me for being envied by people like you he looked square at her as he said it that stopped her for a moment then she nodded so tell me dr benjamin grayson hood what are you really doing here why go to lhasa now nobody goes to lhasa the nazis have sent an expedition to tibet nazis ss officers im to find out what theyre up to she looked more puzzled than ever why you ive been to the edge of tibet twice before on museum expeditions so the american british and chinese governments send a curator it clearly made no sense to her when we came before we had an international group one of the scientists was a german named kurt raeder an able mountain climber crack shot and trained zoologist like me it was a natural partnership you mean you know german yes but i mean i know raeder hes the leader of this new nazi group coming back to a nation we visited before ah so you can approach him as a friend to learn what hes up to hood gave a humorless smile actually hes an enemy this intrigued her really you had a fallingout tugofwar over a carcass argument over the right scientific latin name she was teasing but he decided to be honest the truth was she was risking her life just taking him there and she was obviously intelligent argument over a woman ah her name was keyuri lin her husband hired on as a porter and guide and she came with him to cook and clean raeder had his eye on her from the beginning shes very pretty he and the husband were out one day and mondro fell off a cliff or so raeder said what do you mean perhaps he was pushed it was the first thing i thought anyway thats quite the accusation maybe but i didnt like the guy too driven look whos talking raeder turned his consolation of keyuri into something else pretty quick hes as striking as she is and perhaps shed encouraged him either knowingly or unwittingly you know how people are lusty clumsy stupid now she stretched out her legs she had a fine set of them and knew it they no doubt hoped they could be discreet about the whole thing but nothing is secret in an expedition camp there was no evidence of murder and ordinarily none of it would be my business but then she began to look frightened of what raeder i think theres some germanic dark spot on the mans soul he didnt just want to possess her he wanted to consume her or hurt her to make her a kind of slave i warned him to be careful and he exploded at me warning me off is that so surprising no but the change in his personality the switch from dignity to rage was so complete that i began carrying a loaded pistol even in camp theres something dark in him beyond the usual nazi bravado i was afraid hed try something violent finally keyuri crept to me at night and pleaded for rescue she showed me her body there were cuts and burns and she feared for her life calloway gave him a sideways glance i decided to fire him but he was stirring the others against me complaining i was trying to steal his woman this fragile widow and people began choosing sides i feared it would rip the camp apart and possibly result in violence i was wary of raeder chicken you mean and its been eating you ever since hood frowned at the assessment but didnt dispute it so one night i simply took her and fled with some of the animals leaving a note that my financial support of the expedition was over some blamed me for their failure to complete their scientific objectives raeder felt humiliated and it was worse than that beth was enjoying the tale now absorbed without pretending sympathy two men one woman old story worse how i fell in love with keyuri myself and eventually we made love but we were all mixed up the expedition had been derailed she felt guilty about whether she might have played a role in the death of her husband she was angry at raeder but embarrassed at having embarrassed him as well the victim began to feel like the culprit so one night she left me too it took quite a while to get over it and you are over it this has nothing to do with why were flying to tibet the last i heard shed entered a buddhist nunnery so youre going back to salt the wound it was a judgment good move college boy id just like to set things right you cant set things right thats the whole point of history well this history is what youre flying to which is what you wanted to know and maybe i can write the future what does that mean keyuri is still there as far as i know im going back so kurt raeder doesnt hurt anyone else ever again hoods cabin cascade mountains united states september present day t he last home of benjamin hood was a swaybacked cabin of weathered gray logs its chinking as gapped as the teeth of a punchdrunk prizefighter and its mossy roof shaggy as a bear the place listed like the titanic and rominy thought its intention was to sink back into the earth her new property was not shelter it was a trauma victim in need of emergency infusions from home depot jake once more opened the pickup door from the outsidethe need to do so made it seem like they were on some kind of ludicrous dateand then dug a lantern out of the toolbox in the bed of the pickup while he did that rominy burrowed behind the seats to get the first aid kit again to redress her knees a wink of brass caught her eye it was almost entirely hidden under his camping gear tucked at the edge of a floor mat she instinctively reached it was a small shell casing for a bullet she saw empty of powder jake said he didnt have a gun a leftover from an earlier owner or outing she considered asking but he was preoccupied in the toolbox the casing tickled her memory but she wasnt sure why she pocketed it for later come on heiress he swung the lantern to help beat a path through high weeds and blackberries to the cabins sagging porch when rominy stepped up a piece of deck broke through something furtive skittered away great another piece of my fabulous inheritance she said pulling her heeled shoe free of the rot i should have worn waders another piece of the puzzle i hope and ive got some spare boots in the truck i can loan you you have my size maybe old girlfriend left em when she dumped me now why would a woman do that thats what i asked he stepped over some animal droppings and went to the plank door you never get an answer but now youre prince charming and i get a handmedown glass slipper im on the trail of a story and you might need to walk in the woods gosh she was wrong you are romantic shed joke with him now the key from the safety deposit box was to a padlock on a rusty hasp and jake had to twist and jerk to force it open the door swung with the proverbial creak or more precisely a squall of protest and let out an exhalation of must the cabin was dim inside lit by greasy multipane windows that hadnt seen a wash in decades the thought that hood had decomposed here until his discovery months later gave her the creeps the place was also a time capsule there was a depressionera iron bed frame but no mattress an old dropleaf table with three painted wooden chairs a counter with porcelain basin and hand pump and a riverrock stone fireplace the fur rug was so decayed as to make the species unidentifiable the joists and rafters were bare the underside of the shingles stained where rain had leaked through there was even a bookshelf and rominy inspected the volumes faded tomes on tibet buddhism zoology and flying time having glued their pages to a pulpy mass that mice had chewed droppings dotted shelves and floor hanging on a peg on the wall was a calendar with a faded scenic of mount baker turned to september it was as faint as a ghost negative is that when he died jake nodded apparently remember he wasnt found right away that calendar page is right after the end of world war ii and they found him the next spring he sat out the war up here yep and this is the edge of the edge to the east of us is a hundred miles of mountain wilderness she turned reluctant to touch anything all right woodward and bernstein what are we supposed to find the story lois lane what happened to greatgrandpa he goes to tibet on the eve of the war comes back to play the hermit here and dies forgotten except his descendants meet untimely deaths and a greatgranddaughter who doesnt even know he exists is almost blown up in her mini cooper so finally we have access to his cabin and to his safety deposit box and suddenly youve got enough moola to buy several new cars thanks to me all you have to do is give me the scoop of the century and ill be on my way slam bam thank you maam i wouldnt put it so crudely were partners now rominy if im woodward then youre bernstein i want to be woodward you be bernstein he smiled youre on she glanced around the place is a sty lets call it a dusty attic of nostalgia he glanced up there were cobwebs enough to festoon a crypt mice and spiders and flies oh my but someones been here rominy was looking at scuff marks in the dust on the floor if this place is haunted the ghosts leave tracks barrow frowned kids maybe through a window or drifters looking for food or your skinheads shining lights around and acting spooky i dont think theyd know enough to look way up here rominy dragged her finger in some dust yeah for their sake i think my neighbor would answer the hitler salute with buckshot and theyd probably contract a disease in this dustbin no selfrespecting ghost would take up residence jake smiled were safe then he sat on the old bed frame springs groaning welcome home i hope you dont think thats seductive rominy walked to the kitchen window looking over the enameled sink basin outside there were claustrophobic walls of fir in every direction it was like being at the bottom of a green well it is odd that he came here and died here but just because im his descendant doesnt mean i have any clues you now have the contents of the safety deposit box geez a fossilized finger thank you grandpa was it the middle one in that case i think he would have left the entire hand she sighed okay lets think about it she sat at the painted table using her forearm to shove off some dust and emptied the cookie tin of what theyd found at the bank a scarf its a memento id guess she held it up to the light part of it ripped away and dirty from someones neck nice what else the chinese gold pieces are cool and this is quite a heavy pistol she lifted the so it fell back with a thud you could use it to drive nails army issue from back then a compass to find our way if we had a direction to follow if its not just memorabilia that suggests a destination and even a map dont you think but no map maybe the finger means pointing like sacajawea with lewis and clark barrow hazarded but no sacajawea to go with it and this cabin he dies at the end of the war why he leaves what she glanced around no pictures no maps shelves and cupboards held rusty cans and utensils the books were ruined hidden passageway secret compartment she fingered the rock on the fireplace and then had to dust off her hands she paced around the tiny cabin barrow watching her think or maybe just watching her guys did that she knew just not quite the right guy yet so who was jake barrow savior abductor stalker or partner so what else do you report on when youre not rescuing damsels she suddenly asked he shrugged all kinds of stuff reporters are generalists i like science actually talk about spooky what do you mean just that the world is a lot weirder than it looks to us when we peer up at galaxies or down to subatomic particles he slapped the bed frame do you know this is all an illusion i wish it were but okay ill bite an illusion how that things arent solid in the way that we think atoms are mostly empty space you make a nucleus the size of a tennis ball and its electrons are like bbs buzzing around a mile or two away what keeps us from falling through the floor isnt matter exactly but physical forces that keep atoms together and then repel other atoms our eyes give us this illusion of solids but if we could really see at that level wed see this oscillating fuzz of force fields all the little bits jumping like popcorn in a popper a lot of it is chance particles bouncing like dice but it adds up to normalcy its very very strange down there at the smallest level except you still cant walk through a door but what if you could i mean if we really understood how matter and energy works you know the bible says let there be light and the universe really started as light some energy later became matter and yet this frozen energy can unthaw again in an atomic bomball interchangeable physicists talk about extra dimensions multiple universes and all kinds of bizarro ideas but its no stranger than electricity would have seemed to galileo this is what you think about he laid back the old web of iron squeaking when im not thinking about other guy stuff beer breasts and baseball men are pathetic but occasionally we lift our minds above the ooze you know very occasionally from my experience what do women think about nuclear fusion it surprised her that she was comfortable teasing him but a lot had happened in a very short time see partners i like mysteries and your greatgrandfather is a crackerjack conundrum what the heck happened isnt it fun to try to figure it out it was fun but exhausting and frightening too shed been grabbed by the most intriguing guy shed ever met concentrate rominy youre here to solve a puzzle not moon over the mysterious jake barrow she went to the calendar studying it it was hung on a narrow wood peg maybe whittled by a lonely hearts benjamin hood out here in exile except dunnigan said there was a woman who represented hood at the old bank and was that greatgrandma the odd thing was that the view of the mountain looked like it was taken from across baker lake which gave her a chill thats where her parentsher adoptive parentstold her shed been found in a forest service campground had her biologic parents taken her to that spot deliberately she lifted the calendar clear and turned a leaf over so she was looking at august there are two dates circled she said his birthday jake came to look august was the end of the war ah interesting august sixth and ninth kind of chilling really why those are the dates hiroshima and nagasaki were bombed ick hood didnt have anything to do with that did he i dont think so maybe it wrapped things up for him you know the japanese surrender she flipped the pages they held other faded scenics hardly a clue to world war mysteries or even her greatgrandpas personality not even a vargas girl pinup youre not going to get your scoop mr reporter because theres no scoop to be had maybe benjamin hood was just a cranky old hermit who simply hadnt accomplished whatever he was supposed to accomplish in tibet try fall short retire die that about summed it up for most people and then she noticed the stamp it was blue with what looked to be some kind of animal in the center a cat or deer the creature was surrounded by graceful writing like a cross between arabic and chinese or the elvish of middle earth at the bottom in english lettering it read tibet her heart began hammering the stamp was folded over the edge of an old calendar page except it was two pages she now realized they were stuck together if she hadnt thumbed the calendar she wouldnt have noticed it she used a fingernail to slit the stamp and then gently pry the aged paper apart what had been stuck together were two blank back pages of the calendar except they werent blank they opened to reveal a curious design carefully inked lines ran sinuously like elongated ripples in a pond filling the pages with an abstract pattern it looked familiar but how barrow had come up behind her now he grasped her upper arms and leaned over her shoulder his breath hot by her cheek you found something doodles she wasnt sure whether she had or not she was very conscious of his holding her and not sure what she thought about it no its too convenient to be in the only calendar the only hanging in the place but hidden its a map i think if so its a map of a maze she turned to release her shoulders from his grasp but when she did so she was between the wall and jake looking up at his annoyingly handsome face her hands trembling slightly yes shed found something and he was standing very close he hesitated considering for a moment i think its a contour map he finally said he stepped back she exhaled whats that he took her elbow he did seem to like to touch her come to the table and ill show you they spread the old calendar out a contour map uses lines to show elevations these swirls here actually mark ridges and mountains i think see heres a mark for what might be the cabin a square this is a map of the surrounding hills im guessing but why to direct hood or us to someplace near dont you think wait ive got a geological survey map in my truck jakes map was green and much more finely drawn here ive marked where we are so we just need to orient hoods map to our own they studied the two theyre nothing alike rominy finally said yours shows the river but hoods is just lines barrow frowned youre right i dont get it maybe his map is of tibet but where in tibet damn there was ferocity in his frustration he wanted this story very badly maybe his career depended on it or maybe its some other clue entirely he glanced at her what i dont know jake im so tired she slumped into a kitchen chair im hungry and ive had a headache all day all ive had is wine he glanced from the map to her fingers drumming clearly impatient but then he nodded sharply yes yes im an idiot look ive got food in my toolbox too stove sleeping bags in the cab the whole nine yards what are you a boy scout eagle be prepared im going to cook up something on my camp stove and well think about it sleep on it even were close rominy closer than ive ever been but we need to eat and think im missing something so they did eat the can of spaghetti with carrot sticks as salad and m ampms for dessert apparently stretched jake barrows cooking skills to the limit no wonder hed been in frozen foods while he heated she changed into some oldboy jeans he loaned her cinching them in with a belt her heeled shoes were set aside for the boots which did fit she wondered about the girl whod worn them but didnt ask then she swept the place out with a fir bough throwing away the ratty fur rug it got cold as the sky darkened jake had gathered some wood and now he lit a fire in the old fireplace the flames pushing aside the musty feel the crackle and scent of smoke was reassuring rominy was more comfortable in the new clothes and warming cabin but it also felt like she was losing her identity shed fallen down a rabbit hole jake heated water on the camp stove and used powder packets to make hot apple cider the warmth relaxed her rominy still felt trapped at having to sleep here but it was too late and she was too tired to think of any alternative she unzipped one of the sleeping bags and draped it on herself like a quilt as she sat in the chair considering it a shield against the chill of dusk and anything barrow might try not that he tried anything and not that she wouldnt have been curious if he had tried something he seemed to be leaving any move to her which was good except for the ways in which it wasnt she realized shed phoned no one since she had no phone the radio had never been switched on had the mini cooper been identified with her was somebody searching her adoptive parents were gone and there was no real boyfriend at hand but what were her friends thinking she would miss work tomorrow it seemed on another planet theres obviously no mattress but i brought pads he said well sleep on the floor and figure out what to do in the morning we you can sack out as near or far as you want no drama she wished there was drama just a little so she could have the satisfaction of telling him to stick to his own side of the cabin but he seemed as weary as she so they bedded down on either side of the fireplace a puritan six feet between them rominy begged for sleep to come but her mind kept nagging at where shed seen hoods pattern before some art museum maybe or a childs book of mazes why couldnt she think of it she needed sleep she sneezed from all the dust and then it came to her with a bang like the explosion of her beloved car she sat abruptly upright in her bag it was utterly dark in the cabin inky and spooky jake ive got it she hissed no reaction so she crawled out still in jeans and her mornings knit topshe wasnt about to give him a peek at her panties although she had considered itand shook him jake what hed already fallen asleep men i think ive got it hoods mapits not contours its a fingerprint huh light the lantern when he did so both of them shivering in the cold of the cabin now that the fire was only dull coals she reached inside the cookie tin from the bank and took out hoods mummified finger carefully she rolled it in the dust of a kitchen shelf and lifted the hissing camp lantern to study the dust it had left the faint impression of a fingerprint then she looked at the inked calendar page this one jake bent close see this ridge has the same pattern as his finger he sucked in his breath what does that mean ive no idea its midnight in the middle of nowhere he grinned looking up at her i rescued a genius he whispered in triumph and then before she had a chance to think about it he kissed her lhasa tibet september t he close cropping of her hair had the effect of emphasizing the beauty of keyuri lins face the dark eyes the fine ears the sculpture of cheek and chin and brow as she and raeder stood in the glow of butter lamps off the main audience hall the serene gaze of a gigantic buddha filling the chamber like a cloud she had the regal bone structure of a nefertiti there was also a calmness that raeder didnt remember from before that crazed religion he guessed serenity made him uneasy her presence in the potala palace was the worst luck and yet he still felt the old desire she was exquisite once more he ached to possess her especially since as a nun she was more unobtainable than ever yes the germans were tormented by longing as reting had said but wasnt that what made them succeed at the same time his weakness irritated him a fabled power at stake and he wasted feeling for this woman any woman discipline she studied him with an objectivity that surprised him why wasnt she more afraid maybe she thought she was untouchable because of the protection of the reting and the nunnery that was nonsense everyone was vulnerable in the end you had to rely on yourself youve come a long way from washing camp dishes raeder began and you from hunting specimens for a museum herr raeder now youre a diplomat for himmler and hitler i represent my country its humbling i very much doubt that again that disquieting selfconfidence does your regent know about our past together he knows im a scholar of shambhala its purity intrigues me if she was trying to insult him by referring to his impure tastes he wouldnt acknowledge it why do you think reting is willing to help us she thought the reting is curious if you could actually find shambhala but isnt unhappy at the thought of your failure either if you search for what you seek theres a good chance youll never return and the problem you represent is solved if you do return hell take the secret from you i suspect he finds humor in putting us together a woman and the uniformed nazis and my research has alarmed him alarmed what if myth is true dangerous opportunities delicious dilemmas which was why he was here why did you become a nun you know that better than anyone now she betrayed some coolness a flash of bitterness that actually reassured him as long as he understood her he could control her he was already sifting possibilities why do you study you europeans talked of these tales during hoods expedition and after experiencing what i did it was time to retreat and think as the buddha pondered why is there suffering she held his eyes with her own her hands splayed at her sides so tell me kurt raeder what i still wonder in the dark of every night did i cause my husbands death by being friends with you of course not he lied his fall was an accident i told you that i wish i could believe you you should believe your friends i wanted to be a friend keyuri that lie hung like incense smoke above the lamps raeder had told it deliberately to provoke her to maneuver her to doing what he hoped she tried to mask her own calculations as to the legends i wanted to learn the truth myself before anyone else did what if shambhala does exist your western curiosity incited my own what is tibets responsibility then your regent says your responsibility is to work with us germans to help us what are you going to do im hearing you out do you think its in the kunlun mountains thats the most likely place is it possible to get there it would take months winter is coming on he nodded the british held us too long in india what if we had trucks or motor cars youve seen lhasa there are none except the retings ceremonial car and those of the british a wheeled vehicle could go only partway anyway but cut months to days no she glanced at the buddha massive serene a golden genie yes he took a breath if she really knew something useful he had to try i loved you keyuri in my own way ive reformed help me hire the british cars youll be our guide a nun above reproach in return well share what we find with your kingdom germany is on the rise it will be a partnership to save you from everyonethe british the chinese the russians national socialism will protect you maybe tibet can save itself has it so far have tibetans found and harnessed shambhala she was silent can the tibetan army fight a modern invasion she looked up at the buddha its stare was to infinity time is short he pressed the world is about to go to war how will your country survive it she shook her head the british wont rent to you then you must get the cars for us the reting must buy the trucks steal them she looked at him with her great dark eyes or rather looked above him as if studying some aura above his head let me make inquiries she was going to do it she was going to betray him as he hoped keyuri thought she was misleading him but he could read the calculation in her eyes as easily as the text of a newspaper her hatred would prove to be the swiftest way he bowed even if we cant be friends we can be partners he smiled the effort feeling like a crack in stretched parchment his mind aghast at the irony the karma of having to deal again with this woman at all but the germans couldnt afford to sit in frustration in lhasa as they had sat in calcutta by next spring there might be world war he would not play the tibetan and british game he would not let anyone else have shambhala w ere facing treachery my friends raeder told his ss companions when they reassembled in their hostel in the city below the palace outside donkeys and yaks jostled vendors cried monks chanted a medieval backwater treachery replied kranz with surprise i thought we just won tibetan help in finding what we seek my god did you see the gold in that edifice i do feel like pizarro what else might be awaiting us in these mountains that young woman is beautiful too said diels what i wouldnt give for a taste of that i wonder if she has sisters i recognize that nun from my previous travels raeder said we cant trust her we cant rely on her to guide us until we ensure were in control a nun asked muller id think shed be the one person we could trust a nun or a monk whats wrong with that she wasnt a nun when i knew her raeder said what was she then a widow she worked on the benjamin hood expedition her husband died and i consoled her eventually we had a fallingout what the hell does that mean whats going on here kurt raeder hesitated im afraid she fell in love with me of course i had to leave her behind the gap between our cultures was too great my god and this is who reting chooses to guide us does the regent know im not sure what that oriental bastard knows or doesnt know or exactly what kind of help or interference hes offering you cant tell what asians are thinking but why this woman she became a student of the same mysteries i was curious about i suppose i inspired her perhaps becoming a nun gave her access to secret records who knows reting rinpoche is probably a simple man and simply thinks her knowledgeableand expendableif things go wrong he had to be careful his companions didnt learn the full truth did she recognize you of course you saw us talk do you think shes still in love with you ive no idea well yes probably she may be hurt or jealous which is why we must tread carefully here the question of love was irrelevant he believed raeder had bound her to have fun out of earshot of the other scientists shed protested which he ignored and then begged which hed enjoyed then shed surprised him by daring to crawl to hood to complain and the american had interfered the expedition had broken up raeder hastily claiming he was the loser in a love triangle hood had agreed not to tell the truth barely in return for the german letting her go without a violent showdown that would have destroyed their reputations i should have killed them all but no everyones scientific status was salvaged and now was there to be surprising reward from his mercy would keyuri lin be useful after all raeder still remembered how ripe shed looked women could pretend they didnt enjoy his appetites but he knew better that hatred when she suspected hed killed her husband was also a form of respect he believed obeisance to the victor it was foolish to feel shame for being human why did he have to be embarrassed by what was natural himmler was right religious commandments were a plot to emasculate the strong hed assumed the bitch keyuri would disappear into some tibetan marriage and yet here she was in potala palace a nun a scholar of shambhala was god laughing no this was luck that could be turned to his advantage ive paid one of our guides to follow where she goes he said shell try to betray me like judas betrayed jesus so we have to move first what if he could not just use her but have her back what if he could gain not just shambhala but her submission he was flushed feverish at the possibilities muller looked at him warily and raeder decided he didnt like the geophysicist anymore julius was too judgmental he wasnt loyal he wasnt trustworthy their tibetan guide lokesh was loyal at dusk he brought back word that keyuri lin had visited the british legation reader had expected that now they must get a move ahead of their opponents lokesh how would you like my black ss uniform the mans eyes brightened the costume was very stirring t hat night a column of tibetan soldiers silently surrounded the hostel of the german visitors after listening to keyuri lin the british consul had warned the reting rinpoche that the nazis represented not aid but subversion hed obtained from the potala a writ for the germans arrest and interrogation in joint action with tibetan police ever since getting wireless warnings from calcutta british authorities had wondered what raeders approaching party was up to now lin had told them a search for ancient powers when the nazis had no business being in southern asia at all absurd the sheer cheek of himmler and his fellow bandits was breathtaking it was time to teach the hun a lesson a full company of one hundred and fifty tibetan soldiers under the advisement of captain derrick hoyle readied to charge an old artillery piece from younghusbands expedition was positioned opposite the hostels front door one of the armys two heavy machine guns was set up at the rear the germans could be seen moving through the small dim windows finally a shrill whistle was blown and the british led the charge doors were smashed entry forced hoyle shouted in german that raeder was under arrest no shots had to be fired their quarry meekly raised their hands the soldiers took into custody five tibetan porters attired in the fulldress uniform of himmlers ss raeders own men equipment and weapons were gone captain hoyle snapped his swagger stick in frustration s everal miles away a british motorcar and heavy truck with a squad of english soldiers were racing north from lhasa winding up a dirt road to a pass that led to the broader plateau far to the north the remote and mysterious kunlun mountains waited a young tibetan woman was guiding from the front seat of the lead car having assured the english that they represented a more logical alliance in the hunt for ancient secrets than the restless germans the british legation thought this choice made perfect sense if war was coming the british empire and nearby india would surely prevail england was tibets natural ally the british truck towed a trailer loaded with extra fuel food explosives and climbing gear the vehicles wouldnt get over the final worst terrain but caravan trails would get the hastily organized expedition close enough to make a forced march feasible before winter descended with luck the nazis whod escaped india were already interned in lhasa and in return for keyuris help the english had sworn to turn over whatever they found to the potala reting had nodded gravely at their offer not believing it for a moment the moon was up the mountains silver and the plume of dust from the hurrying vehicles was pewter in the gloom then a dark blockage loomed the british driver of the lead car slammed on the brakes a shaggy yak stood tethered in the roadway boulders prevented the vehicles from going around either side what the devil said major howard southampton he bounded out to investigate four men dressed in the yakhair robes of tibetan herdsmen materialized from the gloom bandits before the english could reach for their own weapons the muzzles of german weapons were pressed to their ears careful said eckells in english im an olympic shot hello keyuri the lead herdsman greeted holding a luger so convenient that youve gotten us an early start to shambhala it was kurt raeder his yakwool cloak giving him the look of a shaggy bear its them she cried its him but the british were already disarmed thanks for delivery of the motorcars raeder said fortunately for you its a downhill walk back to lhasa this is not just theft southampton sputtered its an act of war its an act of expediency forced by your own malfeasance in trying to interfere with reich research and to benefit from reich discoveries its your attempt to arrest us that is an act of war jabber jabber the currency of diplomacy hitler was right guns made the point more strongly the germans began loading their own expeditions equipment into the car truck and trailer youll have to come back this way the major warned the whole tibetan army will be waiting for you and us them with whatever we find your shoes quickly shoes that is beyond bounds sir be happy im only slowing you not shooting you then the vehicles commandeered the germans sped on toward the mysterious mountains of the north eight british soldiers and their three accompanying porters were left standing barefoot and disarmed a humiliating hike from lhasa except for the retings limousine there were no other cars in all of tibet in the backseat of the lead motorcar raeder regarded his new captive shed betrayed him exactly as hed expected and led the british away from the protection of the tibetans fortune was smiling on the ahnenerbe how sweet to complete our reunion he told her she turned away beware what you desire he laughed buddhist rubbish then he pounded diels on the shoulder drive faster flying to lhasa tibet september o n the third day of hoods flight from hankow china began to rise like a lumpy loaf of bread hills became a universe of forested mountains cut by deep shadowy valleys that were seamed by rivers he and calloway crossed the upper reaches of the yangtze and the mekong the little biplane jounced as it cleared each ridge crest land falling dizzyingly away and carrying hoods stomach with it if ben couldnt catch raeder in lhasa it was going to be hard to track him in the vastness that was asia the trees thinned and then largely disappeared clouds scattered and the sky became a vast bowl of blue snowy ranges occupied the horizon in all directions like distant whitecaps their plane was an insect buzzing across eternity ben was jostled from a doze when beth pounded him on the shoulder check the gas the fuel tank was in the upper wing and fed the engine by a tube strapped to a strut next to it was a glass gauge that gave a simple eyesight reading of how much gasoline was left were almost empty see why we needed those cans she glanced around theres pasture in that valley maybe flat enough to land the biplane began to descend it was like entering a room the mountains rising around them as they sank narrowing the sky hood could see a few tents at the upper end of the valley and was uneasy about landing where there were people farther on animals grazed calloway swept down over the herdsmen and sped down the length of the valley dropping until the plane was skimming only twenty feet off the ground she leaned out studying rocks and bushes flashed by to hood it looked like the kind of place where once you landed you didnt leave looks risky he shouted she pulled on the stick climbed and banked empty mountainside flashed by the wingtips theyd stirred the herdsmens camp and people were running pointing and fetching horses a final tight turn at the valleys head and beth was aimed down the valley again her touchdown picked i saw a red flag back there she warned so those arent just herdsmen theyre communist mercenaries so drafted bandits hang on they drifted down the last few feet as the plane felt for safe purchase hood could hear grass whickering at the spinning wheels they touched bounced touched and bounced again and then they were roughly down a boulder loomed ahead but the plane slewed to miss it coming around to point back toward the tents at the head of the valley the engine coughed and stopped the propeller jerking to a halt well take off into the wind she said the breeze blew exhaust smoke back into their faces get out and pass up those petrol canisters yes maam ben opened the compartment behind the pilot and boosted the fivegallon cans up to where calloway balanced by the upper wing she used a funnel to pour the precious fuel its color a whiskey peat periodically she glanced upvalley like a wary bird company she finally said pointing a party of men on tough little ponies was galloping toward them what do you think they want hood asked whatever they can take i imagine or to arrest us and steal the plane if a commissar is looking over their shoulder then lets get the hell out not until were refueled she sounded grim youd better figure out a way to slow them down hood took his rifle out of the cockpit hed shot at animals a thousand times but china was his first war his gun had a german zeiss scope he rested it on the fuselage and sighted the horsemen were carrying their own rifles should i try scaring them if you just want to make them angry maybe we can negotiate with what me they were bandits impressed as guerrilla soldiers she explained and their idea of mission and discipline devolved from the mongol hordes big target to start he muttered hood aimed at the breast of the lead horse held his breath and squeezed the rifle bucked the horse jerked out of his scopes view and he looked up the animal had fallen its rider tumbling the others reined up in momentary confusion dust swirled he could hear surprised angry shouts are you done he called impatiently still pouring we dont want to have to do this again christ now there was the sizzle of bullets whipping by the bandit rifles thankfully inaccurate at five hundred yards then pops as the sound of the shots reached them puffs of smoke hazed their attackers the communist cavalry was fanning out into a semicircle i told you youd just make them mad theyll rape me and bugger you before they kill us the killing part will take a day or more great airport you picked he aimed again they were riding hard now an arc converging on their plane i was told you were a great shot her voice was cool but there was just a tremble he fired worked the bolt to feed another cartridge swung his muzzle and fired again and again and again one two went flying from their mounts just three hundred yards now he could hear the whap of bandit bullets hitting their airplane and he unconsciously tensed waiting for one to strike his own flesh beth pulled a pistol and rattled off several shots from her wing perch while a funnel finished draining not really trying to hit anything then she leaped down ramming the empty cans back into the fuselage she vaulted into the cockpit and set the ignition now now crank the prop hood shot and a pony went tumbling he threw the winchester into his own cockpit and ran to the propeller giving it a heave the engine roared the plane was already moving when he sprang onto a lower wing and hauled himself aboard they bounced over the lumpy field aiming at their assailants yips heightened still at least a dozen of them he climbed into his own seat i cant aim with all this bouncing neither can they i hope but then a bullet shattered part of the windshield above her instruments fragments bright as they flew dammit that stung throw off their aim ben hood scooped up his shotgun an overandunder with two barrels the plane was slowly gaining speed as it skipped across the ground but each second brought them closer to their wildly firing assailants one horseman set his course directly for their propeller as if determined to drive his horse directly into it maybe he would leaping off his steed at the last minute hood stood hauled himself onto the top biplane wing where calloway had been and aimed the shotgun above the arc of the spinning propeller he dare not fire through it lest he chew off their propulsion the gunman spotted him and aimed his rifle they were just yards apart the rifle fired and the shotgun bucked and the pony tumbled the riders rifle flying lead sizzled past the curators head the aircraft vaulted the undercarriage bouncing as they clawed over the careening horse wheels given a quick spin they were past bounced and jumped up in the air again engine howling another horseman came galloping alongside taking aim at beth hood pivoted fired and the bandit threw up his hands and pitched backward yeehah calloway shouted her cheek was bleeding hood allowed the wind to push him down into his cockpit again the horseman had tumbled into the dust to his immense satisfaction this was more exciting than museum meetings in new york the others hadnt given up they were riding hard behind bullets peppering the wings hood stood bracing with his knees and broke the shotgun open to reload when it snapped shut he aimed backward over calloways head and fired bam bam buckshot sprayed three more swerved leaning like drunken men and then the ground was falling away as the curtis strained reaching for the sky they swept over the tents men still shooting red flag snapping in the wind a cliff loomed bank they cleared it by inches finally they had enough altitude to pivot back toward the west far below horsemen milled in frustration hood could see the specks of bodies hed dropped he didnt feel guilt he felt relief nice shooting she pounded him on the back he turned she was grinning beneath her goggles couldnt you have picked a quieter place to land im not that lucky but you are maybe are you hit scratched but they didnt get our gas or our engine either were going to make it to lhasa ben he put a finger to her cheek wiping blood away the wound had coagulated i wish we had that bottle of scotch she laughed me too it could stretch our fuel t hat dusk they came down on little more than fumes into the valley of the kyichu the sun had sunk behind the encircling mountains the golden glow of the roofs of the potala winking out a few lamps burned but lhasa was still unelectrified dark and remote there was an airstrip however and the curtis touched and taxied to rest next to two other derelict biplanes a british aluminum transport with no wings or engines and a stone corral of yaks was raeder still here and what would hood do if he was how many men had he killed today hood and beth dropped to the ground shaken exultant exhausted there were bullet holes all over calloways biplane and shell casings littered his cockpit floor thwarting death makes you feel alive besting men makes you feel strong and her wireandchewinggum crate was a tough little bastard after all he smiled it was primitive elemental beth watched him as he walked around the airplane her hair was a ragged mess after being crushed by the flying helmet her face smudged with soot and blood and her fingers still smelled of fuel but her eyes were very very bright he came to stand close the barrels of his guns still jutted from the cockpit no one had come out to the grass strip to greet them they could hear the river running in the distance now youll see this tibetan woman you left she asked maybe im dreading it actually what am i going to say i think ill ask the british what they know and decide how to approach raeder he stared toward the river now that im here im not exactly certain what im supposed to do save the world right yes or didnt we agree you can only save yourself he put his finger in one of the bullet holes it was a miracle they hadnt been disabled and you miss calloway have gotten me this far youre a good pilot youre a good shot and then because shed finally tired of waiting for him to initiate things she kissed him it took him by surprise but then women were sometimes inexplicable so he kissed back enjoying the taste of her and suddenly restless for release after the trauma of the last few days she broke with a little gasp her eyes wide as if surprised by herself and he leaned in to kiss her neck you smell like gasoline he whispered you smell like gunpowder he laughed kissing her ear her nape the hollow under her neck in front he opened a button on her shirt and nuzzled part of her shoulder her hands were pulling on him and he let his own roam over her rough clothes she was the opposite of the society princesses and glamour models he grazed through and a hundred times more desirable because of it she was real he lifted his face and she kissed him fiercely cupping his head with her hands eyes moist and urgent then the two of them were down on the grass as the moon rose over the mountains fighting out of their clothes he tarried while peeling hers off enjoying how she allowed his hands and mouth to explore she made little sounds not the tough aviatrix but only a woman hungry for connection and then they fused this one meant something they kissed more tenderly still locked together in fact he was so busy kissing that he didnt notice the dozen tibetan soldiers who materialized out of the dusk and surrounded them and their plane peering down at their pale bodies in the moonlight benjamin hood one finally interrupted in britishaccented english ben started and jerked around beth shouted and snatched at clothes to cover herself what the hell apologies doctor but you are under palace arrest hoods cabin cascade mountains united states september present day a kiss is just a kiss the old song went and rominy had been perfectly prepared to tell mr jake barrow not to take any liberties thank you very much but he kissed her at midnight at the end of the most traumatic day of her life after explosion chase wine inheritance and nancy drew mystery madness at the hour she felt most vulnerable and puzzled he smelled smoky with a masculine scratchiness on his firm jaw she kissed backwhere was her disciplineand somehow it advanced to the inevitably awkward comedy of unzipping the sleeping bags and dragging the pads and struggling out of clothes so they did it poor benjamin hoods creepy disconnected finger left forgotten and alone on the shelf above too weary to make it explosive too tentative and clumsy to make it sublime but a release nonetheless it left her warm and worried that shed made a mistake stay away from men thats my advice so why did it feel so right they fell asleep his arm across her until he rolled over and she didnt wake again until the approaching dawn had turned the windows milkgray she blinked sleepily looking at unfamiliar shadows stretching stiffly on the sleeping pad jakes breathing was heavy but so far he didnt snore point for barrow there were also the sounds of field mice or worse skittering around yet the cabin was also small and snug and cozy and birds were starting up in the trees outside as the light strengthened and someone was at the window her eyes opened wide and her head jerked up a face seemed to float in the glass like a pale moon young cruel with thick snarly lips and a mohawk stripe on an otherwise shaved head a silver ornament dangled from one ear the face stared back with deep dark eyes as soulless and unblinking as a sharks then it disappeared rominy sat up heart hammering had she really seen it jake she hissed he grunted and moved closer jake wake up i saw someone who he mumbled some bald guy like a skinhead he was at the window but then he wasnt she was whispering without knowing why barrow opened his eyes and looked over her shoulder where there above the sink are you sure he stood naked and went to the window up here in the sticks he looked out other windows then cautiously opened the door he glanced around and shut it theres no car you were dreaming i dont think so she was trembling what if theyve come it took me forever to track this place down i dont think those guys have done it or theyd have been waiting for us thats not reassuring he just looks and leaves and delphinas dogs dont go crazy no i think you had the edge of a nightmare he came back to the sleeping pads sat and pulled her down or maybe you saw a raccoon jake we dont even have a gun and were in the middle of nowhere we have greatgranddads gun which looks menacing enough and were in the middle of nowhere so we dont need a gun this is the safest place to be right now trust me and i have a hunch were going to find what were looking for today they were spooned together his arm across her shoulder and against her breasts with all the rest of him against her back and butt and legs in a quite delicious way she could feel that part coming to life again but what if somebodys out there nobodys out there i looked anyone coming up that road wed hear from a mile away maybe you saw old lady clarksons ghosts it was so real it was a dream settle down its too early to get up she wiggled against him glad of his warmth and nearness youre up im just glad to see you as mae west said you know i didnt mean for us do that last night she whispered i did i like you and i still dont know anything about you jake not really you will this is a good start im usually more reserved i dont doubt it unusual circumstances extraordinary circumstances spec tac ular circumstances and he began to laugh so she had to turn to kiss him to get him to stop and well another half hour went by finally he told her to rest in the warmth of the bed while he got up to build a fire and put water on the camp stove she watched him as he pulled on his jeans yep he was as fit as shed surmised in the safeway store eye candy in dogpatch he seemed in awfully taut shape for a keyboard jockey so he must really be trying to get his moneys worth from a health club membership was he too vain stop being so judgmental one minute rominy is buying lean cuisine and the next shes in a wilderness cabin with stud muffin reporter was any of this real she lazily viewed him as he pulled on his shirt youve got a tattoo it was on his right shoulder yeah almost a cliche these days whats it of a circle something a sun wheel old traditional art tibetan among others i liked the design chosen after three beers too many oh no i thought about it quite carefully i like it she decided its supposed to be good luck she had a vague memory of having seen something similar somewhere before but couldnt remember where weve still got a mystery to solve you know she said were not supposed to indulge our appetites until we do he agreed but now im hungry so well eat and then well figure this out the camp stove kettle whistled and he poured hot water into a mug with instant coffee ive got a kellogg variety pack you do know how to impress a girl will you turn your back while i dress he sipped looking at her no i dont think so which was not entirely bad since he did seem appreciative the sun eventually came up lighting the trees and cabin and they turned again to hoods odd map with its fingerprint contour lines it still looked more like a rorschach blot than a treasure map but there had to be some meaning to hoods weirdness had he cut off his finger just for this like van gogh sawing off his ear there was a directional arrow on the map with an n presumably marking north jake oriented it with his survey map but there was no obvious correlation between the two its like half a clue said rominy i hope he was sane when he did this she went back to the cookie tin with its contents he left us a compass too to use that you have to know which way youre trying to go its amazing it still works she turned to watch the needle spin nothing happened except it doesnt she turned again its broken frozen what do you mean the needle always points the same way on the dial sort of northeast jake took it from her and tapped the instrument the needle didnt budge youre right what if thats a clue why would a broken compass be a clue what if he fixed the compass so it wouldnt turn and then put it in the safety deposit box with his finger you mean its a bearing a heading yes but from where i think we have to assume this cabin find where we are on your survey map use the compass bearing and draw a line jake did so the line crossed several mountains but it still wasnt clear which if any was supposed to match hoods fingerprint were still missing something what next woodward she pondered elementary my dear bernstein the other stuff in the tin has to mean something too the only question is what he shook his head oh boy this is not like jotting notes at a press conference my brain does not work like this a pistol and a scarf it makes no sense this calendar has no guidepost no wait a minute is that gun loaded god i hope not i waved it around in the bank with seventyyearold ammunition he picked it up aimed it away and worked the mechanism with an efficiency that surprised her did jake know about guns too a shell green with age was ejected it fell on the floor oh my what if it had gone off well it didnt he picked the round up studying it curiously look he moved the bullet to the calendar its diameter matched the hole that had been made through the pages to hold the calendar up the hole is ragged i think ben hood shot through this baby before he drew his map or finger or whatever the heck he was doing why he pointed at the open pages to give a reference point either where were going or where we are yes she liked this collaboration where we are im guessing our starting point so your compass bearing can be drawn from the bullet hole using the n to orient the broken compass jake drew a line from the hole the bullet had made across the calendar map to the northeast it crossed hoods fingerprint which means he asked i dont know the scarf whats that for your greatgrandfather was a lunatic wasnt he or completely paranoid locking everything away until a relative comes along to claim itsomeone who likely wouldnt be with the government or tibet or the nazis and here you are junior detective his tone was admiring which she liked rein it in rominy she picked up the scarf and examined it the silk was dirty frayed white and unremarkable in every way had it been given to him by some potentate in tibet or was there something hidden in its meaning what would a junior detective do or a man at the end of his life at the end of a terrible war she held it up to light from a window parts seemed cleaner than others which meant what jake light your lantern suns up rominy light it anyway i need some heat but i dont want to hold this by the fire and risk setting it ablaze the lantern was the old gas type and its mantles flared to life with a familiar hiss in short order the glass cylinder enclosing the mantles was too hot to touch and rominy held the scarf near the light this is something we used to do as kids hold scarves to lanterns invisible ink you can use juices honey diluted wine urine you name it coke even you mix with water write and let it dry you cant see it until you heat it yes voila brown characters had appeared on the scarf rominy pulled it away and they read thats perfectly clear jake joked no it obviously means something is it a date a year has days not the ancient babylonians and egyptians started with that as the length of the year before astronomy was refined and thats why we use it for bearings today i think three hundred sixty means degrees like compass degrees this is another bearing perhaps sixty plus sixty thats one hundred twenty about opposite where the needle is fixed and one is i dont know why have another bearing to cross the first but it wouldnt cross it just leads in the opposite direction that doesnt help let me think he pursed his lips studying the relics in a way she thought was irresistibly cute yes shed fallen have you ever used a nautical chart no she said silently condemning her own lack of caution in affairs of the heart but then sometimes magic just happened didnt it and the nautical mile is based on the length of onesixtieth of a degree or one minute of one degree of latitude on the earths surface thats a distance just a little longer than our land mile but his invisible writing has two sixties which would suggest a nautical second which my boating days taught me is about a hundred feet a hundred and one i think so one inch on his map equals a hundred feet is that all that means to his fingerprint from the bullet hole is only a few hundred yards she looked at the cloth again wait is this another number they peered less distinct than the first were more numerals look at your contour map again so what if its seventytwo point one times a hundred and one feet where does that put us he multiplied it out thats seven thousand two hundred eightytwo feet that could behe looked from modern map to hoods fingerprint and back againthe far side of this peak here lookout mountain and teebone ridge toward eldorado plot it on your usgs map here about below little devil peak above marble creek canyon and what are the coordinates he read them off i think thats where we need to go she said a little tricky to find in the woods im guessing not necessarily he said i have gps we can use it to walk exactly to this spot cool then what happens i dont know he seemed to go to a lot of trouble to plot this but then make it obscure if you didnt have the contents of his safety deposit box nothing would make sense maybe our interpretation is still off but i think youre on to something rominy we follow this frozen bearing the required distance and find treasure maybe his tone was cautious he was trying to control his hope what are the coins for then rominy thought a moment and then beamed triumphant thats easy you said yourself these mountains are riddled with old mines were going to find a gold mine i like your optimism maybe he found something in tibet to help him mine ill get the daypacks jake said ill clean up the breakfast when you go out could you check for ghosts and skinheads and raccoons jake had started a garbage sack the night before he was out by his old truck dragging stuff from his big toolbox and poking around in the cab when rominy stooped to scrape leftovers into the bag she saw hed lumped in some perfectly good recyclables the spaghetti can and two plastic water bottles odd for a seattle boy he was no tree hugger she decided to fish them out for proper disposal when she did so something small round and shiny dropped from some crumpled paper towels where it had been caught had barrow lost a coin diving past strands of spaghetti she picked it up not a coin but some kind of small battery odd that hed think to toss one here then a thought occurred she glanced out the window he was still busy so she opened her purse took out her cell phone and opened its back its battery was missing she put the discarded one in the phone still didnt power on toward the kunlun mountains tibet september t he germans drove seven hundred miles north and west of lhasa first on a winding caravan track through a maze of mountains and then on the trunk road that led across asia toward kashmir and the karakoram a hundred miles before karakoram pass they turned north again into wilderness so high and unpopulated that they no longer encountered any nomads animals watched them curiously and without fear not understanding what the twolegs were raeder itched to kill somethey wandered near enough to try the submachine gunbut hunting would only slow them down the distant peaks were getting whiter as autumn began the snow line lower each morning the kunlun mountains a twothousandmilelong range that parallels the himalayas forms the northern border of tibet it lay along the horizon like a white wall remote as the moon keyuri lin had combined her fragmentary clues from the old peches or books with ancient legends to turn tibetan mystery into a tangible goal a gamble like columbuss sailing west to go east now the roof of the world swallowed them as they drove into a geographic vacuum maps were blank here when the british motorcar broke down after thirty straight hours of dirt roads and steppe trails its tires blown kurt raeders party siphoned its gas tank and unceremoniously rolled it off a hillside they whooped as it bounced and spun pieces flying off like bright marbles the truck and trailer made it for three more days some of the germans riding like coolies on the towed cart then they came to an impassable gorge it was as if god had taken the earth into two mighty hands and cracked it across its crust this was not a canyon it was a rock crevasse a split in the plateau that extended as far as the eye could see in either direction water glinted at its depths a thousand feet down the lip of the other side was a tantalizing fifty yards away the rift was effective as a moat now what asked muller we cross it said raeder impossible said diels we need a balloon nothing is impossible for national socialists and your idea of a balloon is not a bad one if we had means to make one raeder inventoried the truck and trailer unfortunately i dont see how maybe we can drive around it through those boulder fields how far and what if the tibetans are pursuing detour and delay could ruin everything we could throw a light line to someone on the other side eckells said do you see anyone franz muller asked he sat on a rock one of us climbs down and up the other cliff eckells peered over the edge but we dont have rope enough for the entire route a single slip their cameramanpolitical officer was the most eager of the group and the most stupid raeder paced the edge like an impatient animal let me think perhaps this is why no one has ever found shambhala said muller raeder ignored him scratching a design on the dirt with the toe of his boot what if we could shoot a line across eh comrades a rope to shimmy across shoot with what our truck look i have an idea the trucks exhaust pipe became their cannon muzzle the vertical stakes of the front grill were dismantled crossed and bent to make a grappling hook the lightest line they dared trust a mans weight to was tied to the hooks cross and carefully coiled next to their makeshift launcher gunpowder became the charge and a revolver was dismantled to provide a trigger and firing pin were going to blow our eyes out kranz said nervously raeder grunted you sound like my mother im going to film it on camera promised eckells he backed away he was not as stupid as the others thought a sloped trench had been dug and the butt of their launcher braced against the dirt the muzzle of the exhaust pipe pointed across the canyon the pole of the grappling hook inserted like a ramrod someone had to get down in the trench to pull the trigger ill do it diels finally said if someone else is first across that will be me raeder said diels closed his eyes and squeezed there was a boom the tube jerked and the archaeologist yelled as hot metal lacerated his arm the butt of the makeshift cannon had burst but their hook was arcing like a rocket line unreeling like a writhing snake the grapnel struck ten yards beyond the far side and raeder pulled until it caught on a boulder he swiftly tied their end to the truck back enough to give it tension then he slung a heavier rope coil on his shoulder grasped the line wrapped his legs and pulled himself out into thin air it was like watching a spider bob in the wind a thousand feet above a maw of rocks foot by foot he pulled himself across the line sagging but not breaking heil hitler he called from the far side in astonished acknowledgment they raised their arms the heavier line was pulled back across the chasm flywheels from the truck were unbolted to make a crude pulley system for a rope cradle by the end of the day even keyuri had been conveyed across along with all the food water and ammunition they could carry the truck was left bottomed on rubble and leaking oil the remaining canisters of gasoline were left in the trailer raeder turned to keyuri are we close enough to trek from here somewhere on the far side of that she pointed to a horizon of snowdusted hills ahead he nodded i know you could lead us into oblivion my people want shambhalas secret too she shouldered a pack yes and if you mislead us youll never see lhasa again if we find it i may not see lhasa either no one has ever returned kurt raeder didnt tell keyuri the germans wouldnt return to lhasa either maybe theyd sneak through china to the japanese or go north to the transsiberian railroad and take ship at vladivostok on the pacific to avoid communist scrutiny in moscow but the safest route might actually be west through the wilds of afghanistan to persia a direction in which no power including tibet was likely to stop them a route that brought them and the secret of shambhala safely home to germany hed no intention of sharing anything with the holy men of the potala palace despite what hed promised the prize was to help conquer the world nor would those holy men even hear what the germans had found until it was too late raeder had no intention of leaving keyuri lin alive the nazi leader had reestablished his domination of her the first night muttering to the other germans not to come near hed pitched a british tent out of earshot of the others ordered keyuri inside and pointed his luger take off your robes he was master she was slave a game that delighted him shaven or not she was ripe as a young peach under her religious cloaking but keyuri was annoyingly indifferent to his attentions she didnt respond to his caresses didnt protest and didnt fight her mind fled raeder had been angry at her surrender and took her quickly his rutting savage all he felt afterward was disgust she did curl and weep but that only added to his dissatisfaction where was the fire theyd felt in hoods camp where was her fear where even was her hatred she was nothing like his fantasies he hadnt touched her since worse the other men had grumbled muller was disapproving what did you do to her kurt look at her shes a whipped dog shes pretending why do you get a woman and we dont complained eckells take her yourself for all i care but he would kill franz if he did and somehow the man knew it im not taking anyone i just say there should be women for all of us or no women at all yes we need a guide not a concubine grumbled muller and i need a geophysicist not a nanny he scowled at them all right she asked me for it but from now on she sleeps alone shes only here because she has maps and clues we brought her for national socialism comrades she stays until we find shambhala keyuri hiked in the center of their file shed acquiesced to her new destiny with the curious fatalism of the asiatic she didnt seem terribly surprised that raeder had successfully ambushed the british nor that he would drive their vehicles to ruin without hesitation nor that hed bridged a chasm no normal person could cross that was who kurt raeder was had she actually been waiting for him to return a secret she withheld not only from her nunnery and reting but from herself did a flicker of attraction still exist kurt still thought it possible but she hid all signs of it was indifference her way of punishing him for what happened before had her study of the old books infected her with the same lust the nazis had to find shambhala and harness its powers was she the buddhist nun as greedy as any of them yes that was it raeder didnt believe anyone could shed longing no matter what religion they claimed longing was what humans were one convoluted mass of longings people were defined by desire keyuri could pretend to spiritual superiority until the sun went cold but her soul was still his hed caught her eyeing the deathshead insignia the blue gleam of weapon barrels the hard forearms of his company of ss knights she was secretly fascinated he was sure of it serenity was a facade he was determined to see some kind of final lust in her eyes a desire for something before he had her murdered so they marched the utter emptiness of the land had begun to strike the germans as eerie there was desolate beauty of course much of their route led by lakes three miles high backed by snowcapped peaks one to two miles higher the water ranged from indigo to the iridescent green of a hummingbirds neck as if the plateau were a succession of watercolor cups the sky remained deep and clear as roofless as outer space everything was immense shrinking their party to insignificance the other germans whispered did the tibetan woman hope to lose them in this wilderness would it swallow the reichs finest as the reting had warned it had swallowed all who sought shambhala before them were they being led astray no raeder assured the tibetans were as curious about the legends as the germans were theyd work together until the inevitable betrayals at the end there were no trees at this altitude and the grass brown and desiccated at the end of the season was sparse on the stony ground as they marched the blue and brown snouts of bulldozing glaciers came more sharply into focus descending from the sea of peaks ahead clouds clung to the summits casting gray shadow the explorers drank from pothole lakes that had a fringe of ice on the shore and woke in pup tents that each morning had a coating of frost there was no wood or dung for fires their fuel for cooking was dangerously low then the ground heaved up into the hills keyuri had pointed to and they climbed upward the air thinner the wind more shrill early snow puffed the men wrapped scarves over their beards their eyes pinched into narrow slits keyuri coughed but never complained is this the kunlun muller asked keyuri this is only its porch they trudged up on old snow patches until there was no more up and they were on a summit of shrieking wind and stinging flakes kurt wheres shambhala kranz gasped there the setting sun broke through to their left they could see ahead for a hundred miles another vast frigid basin a desert dotted with frozen lakes stretched before them beyond were higher mountains yet icy mistshrouded implacable raeder pointed the kunlun keyuri nodded come lets get down into the basin as far as we can before nightfall they made eight more miles and camped when he roused them at dawn their clothes were stiff their only liquid water was what theyd kept in canteens close to their chests they shuddered as they ate cold food ice mountains behind them ice mountains ahead and marched on then they came to the disappearing river a milky glacial stream ran from the mountains seeming to emerge from nothinga wall of cliffs far aheadand sink into nothing it fanned out onto the stony plain in a braid of channels getting smaller instead of bigger as it poured from its source it was obviously seeping into the ground its last tendrils disappeared in a bed of rocks as they hiked upriver along its bank toward the kunlun range the flow paradoxically grew stronger its very peculiar said muller following this feels like walking backward in time who ever heard of a river bigger at its source than downstream therere no tributaries to feed said keyuri the plateau drinks it im guessing that in winter when the source glaciers stop melting it disappears entirely but this is what the legends talk of a river without end i thought they meant endless perhaps circular but instead they meant it never reaches the sea the running water cheered the germans up before the immensity seemed too quiet except for the ceaseless sigh of the wind now they walked beside the chuckling sound of a glacial stream familiar from their treks in the alps and himalayas the longer they followed the river toward these highest mountains however the more forbidding their goal became the kunlun loomed white stormwhipped forbidding there was no valley or pass promising entry glaciers ended like gray palisades their leaning snouts cracked and leaning huge moraines of gravel ran out on the plateau like tongues plants were shriveled and stunted it was the ice age the stream itself sprung improbably from a wall of black cliffs which made no sense at all then they topped a small hillock next to the nowroaring river foaming tan with glacial slurry and saw where the water was coming from there was a vertical cleft in a cliff that muller estimated at two thousand feet high as if some giant had split the wall with an ax this canyon was no wider than a room its walls sheer as a castles and it was from this narrow gate that the stream erupted shooting into the air like a fire hose before falling a hundred feet to the plain they stood on there was no obvious way up this waterfall to the canyon and certainly no way through the canyon to whatever the source was the roaring river filled the cleft from wall to wall its mist coating the slit with a rime of ice they stood dismayed this cant be right raeder told keyuri she looked baffled as well but everything else is as the stories describe a river that becomes a gate beyond it the legends say is a valley nestled from all storms and from there an entrance to shambhala its a trap muller muttered a trap is something you can get into diels disagreed this we cant even enter but what a sight eh said kranz have you ever seen a canyon so narrow this is more sheer than that gorge made from an earthquake perhaps or a lightning bolt franz you must get some pictures their cameraman was already setting up his equipment look you can see a glimpse of white beyond it he said theres a glacier in there i think giving birth to this river this will excite the geographic societies raeder was studying the wall with his binoculars the cliffs soared up to precipitous slopes of snow that went into the clouds the white mantle scarred by avalanche tracks at the crests wind blew the snow into sharp cornices their edges swirling away like smoke weve no ability to get over the mountains he said if theres a valley in there its guarded like a fortress by this canyon gate and if we cant get in no one else can either said muller were chasing a myth about an inaccessible place i think thats why tibetans could invent stories about it a valley with no entry why not pretend a secret kingdom lies within who will contradict you wait said raeder his binoculars aimed at the canyon theres a path maybe or at least a ledge here take a look he handed the binoculars to their geophysicist you cant be serious said muller focusing what path theres a ledge in that canyon twenty feet above that rushing stream too narrow for most animals im guessing and maybe too narrow for us if we fall into the water and dont drown we go straight over the falls it looks ludicrous and yet it doesnt appear to end the ledge goes on into the shadows as if it were hewn you want us to follow that kranz said taking his turn through the binoculars its suicide i think that is a trap or a test said raeder if shambhala was easy it would have been found long ago no we need to at least get up there and see if its really a trail and what might lie on the other side and then what we leave our extra equipment and sidle our way in there if we fall we die but if we turn back nowif we return to the reichsfuhrer and say yes we saw something promising something that fit the legends but prudently turned backthen i think we die anyway eckells nodded the fatherland does not permit failure summer palace lhasa tibet october s o much for agent hales diplomatic letters of introduction since his arrival in lhasa benjamin hood had been kept prisoner in a gilded cage a meditation pavilion with a pagoda roof his jail was a serene retreat built on a stone island in a rectangular pond on the summer palace grounds of the dalai lama no one could approach his flowery eden without permission nor could he could leave it soldiers guarded the bridge it was a claustrophobic paradise the terrace girded with a carved stone railing ducks and swans floated in the green pool and trees turning golden with the fading year showered the water with leaves the color of bright coins hood had demanded an audience with the reting rinpoche and been denied hed demanded release and been ignored hed demanded an explanation and been met with the buddhist chant om mani padme hum it was a mantra open to endless interpretation but in general called its practitioner to the correct path which path was that from one corner of his little island he could see past the trees to the winter palace called the potala on its spectacular hill its golden roofs as remote as heaven was kurt raeder up there laughing at him what had happened to beth calloway flown the coop he assumed did his museum or government even care where he was the lack of all communication was maddening so it was with cautious relief that he heard the thump of drums and the guttural moan of the dugchen the tibetan long trumpets so huge that they had to be rested on the ground it was like a growl from the bowels of the earth some kind of monkish procession was coming toward him a ribbon of scarlet and purple from another direction a file of tibetan soldiers trotted up rifles ready and took up position around the perimeter of the lagoon where hood was kept they wore pith helmets and british field uniforms with puttees another file of ceremonial archers in long robes drew up on either side of the gravel path that led to the stone bridge as handsome and taut as their bows between their ranks came the aristocracy of lhasa stately as a wedding procession a single robed figure with high peaked cap detached himself from the column and walked forward the soldiers snapping to attention he brought no escort carried no weapon and seemed to have no fear of the american so why was hood being held the man approached slowly as if not to spook a wary animal in his hands was a white silk scarf a khata of greeting i am the reting rinpoche the regent of tibet who rules in the name of the dalai lama before his holiness comes of age the man said he bowed and held forth the scarf i welcome you to our kingdom alerted to this custom by beth hood dipped his head to take the cloth he offered his own flying scarf to the regent it was smudged but reting took no notice its a pleasure to at last make your acquaintance hood said carefully i apologize for your incarceration but im afraid its necessary events needed time to occur before we could have this meeting weve made you as comfortable as possible comfortable but anxious im benjamin hood of the american museum of natural history and ive come here to warn you yes weve been expecting you expecting me the scarves signify peace reting gestured toward the pavilion should we sit and enjoy it clearly tibetans preferred to take their time the two men retreated to rest in the shade the small brilliantly colored army on the other side of the pond waited stiffly youve come very far the reting began ive been sent by my government on a diplomatic mission i know all about your mission dr hood but how i havent been able to speak to anyone word of your approach came to the british legation from their counterparts in hong kong two days before you arrived i myself spoke to the english authorities on a wireless set that a german delegation thoughtfully gave me as a present as you might imagine what the british had to say about you and the germans differed a great deal from what herr kurt raeder untersturmfuhrer of the ss told me hood was taken aback the tibet hed seen in his previous travels had been technologically backward and preoccupied with religion hed expected complacency and lassitude in the potala not a wireless yet the young regent seemed calm and knowledgeable not a naive potentate easily manipulated by the west you know about kurt raeder ive conferred with him where is he searching i presume for the ancient powers of shambhala in the kunlun mountains far to the north and west hes promised to share anything he finds with my government the reting smiled as if hed made a joke do you know what kind of a man raeder is more than you think ive had the remarkable counsel of a young nun who knows about shambhala raeder and you me her name is keyuri lin he waited for the americans reaction my god whats going on here hood made no attempt to mask his confusion shes alive very much so she serves you she serves her religion but yes shes a patriot of tibet is she why im being held captive oh no shes why youre going to be let go i can see her not unless you can find kurt raeder what do you mean keyuri is with him hoods face fell not again by her choice not just his but not for the reason you think im confused i came to warn you about raeder its not warning we need he looked about its a crisp morning breathing of winter but the air is pleasantly clean is it not this is the best time in lhasa when the trees turn yellow and the first storms sprinkle the distant mountains with snow hood shifted impatient your soldiers took me and my companion beth calloway by surprise it was embarrassing reting looked serene it was natural things happen as theyre meant to what did that mean perhaps then you can tell me whats going on the reting arranged himself his robes fanning like a dress thinking about what to say his air of gentle patience seemed alien after new york in a world sliding toward war he was eerily calm approximately one month ago the british consul called on me in the potala to report that a german delegation of ss men had left calcutta without permission lhasa was their announced destination messages to that effect had arrived to the british legation via wireless from india the consul suggested that i mobilize troops to stop the interlopers and turn them back toward the british raj he warned me they meant no good for tibet so raeder eluded you oh no we knew where he was at every moment and could have stopped him at any time but a tibetan buddhist owes the weary traveler hospitality and in any case i was curious who would be so bold as to approach our kingdom uninvited so the english gave me the names of the germans whod been in calcutta and one of my scholars exclaimed at mention of one it was keyuri who exclaimed about kurt raeder wasnt it yes shes a scholar a woman in tibet miss lin is an unusual young woman four years ago she elected to enter a buddhist nunnery after serving on a western research expedition the expedition was mine and both you and kurt raeder had been involved with her shortly after she had been widowed she confided hood bowed his head yes her experience with westerners had greatly troubled her part was their worldly ambition part was their ability to thrive and travel in a land so far from their own part was the strength of their desire their madness if you will you are formidable and restless were scholars too but raeder reting held up his hand it was raeder who gave keyuri the impetus to study legends of ancient tibetan powers she fears the west and wants my people to be ready to cope with it so i spoke with her for many hours in private getting her story and pondering what to do the easiest thing would have been to turn the germans back but was it the wisest thing theyre nazis and hitler preaches world domination yes but theyre skilled and unafraid of the legends that inhibit us theyve instruments to probe the earth that we dont have they are scholars of the tibetan past and have the ability to understand technology that might elude us so keyuri suggested a solution she proposed that we cooperate with these ss men but raeder abused her shambhala has long been rumored but never seriously sought we tibetans know the difference between legend and history yet what if part of the legend is true could these ambitious germans find it and understand its secrets understand only for germany i warn you of course reting looked mildly away studying the paddling ducks keyuris plan was to go with raeder and see what he could find learn what he could learn she knows hes still obsessed with her because in the end he couldnt have her heart our nun went to help the germans and yet spy on them to share in discovery but bring it back to the potala more intrigue than the buddha taught hood was wary of this game these are perilous times will the coming storm reach my people and if so how will we shelter from it maybe china can protect you china is our greatest fear of all keyuri offered to raeder to go along of course not hed never expect her to after his treatment of her hood looked surprised yes she showed me some of the scars reting said we had to be cleverer than that instead she betrayed the secret of his mission to the british who immediately set out to find shambhala for themselves as we knew they would raeder also knew they would and he arranged to ambush them north of lhasa my god you planned all this the british were unharmed but their vehiclesthe only ones in lhasa capable of such a journeywere stolen so was keyuri as the tibetan with the most knowledge of what the germans seek so now they hunt the legend together youre crazy raeder will eat her alive youll never learn a thing about shambhala the germans dont want you to know my nun is quite aware of this but fortunately she has a solution which is you he gave a slight smile i dont understand youve been confined here while we give the germans time to find what theyre looking for with the motorcars they quickly outran any feasible pursuit but wed heard you planned to fly here and that gave us our solution we want you to pursue raeder by airplane learn what he learns deal with the germans in whatever way you see fit and bring shambhalas secrets and keyuri back to the potala beth calloway has been promised sufficient fuel to return to china in return for helping us with this task shes been employed patching your flying machine me instead of the british or your own officers im not a soldier no but you have one attribute that recommends you to the tibetan government and persuades us that you will do the right thing which is to return to lhasa with what you learn whats that that youre still in love with keyuri lin she told you that you told me that by coming this far at all hood flushed he realized that what the reting said was true and that the reting had known this truth before he had now he wanted one woman he was falling in love with to take him to another theres only room for two in beths plane i hope that many survive the reting said calmly ah he stood listening thats miss calloways plane now shell land just outside the palace grounds and youll be on your way eldorado peak cascade mountains september present day r ominy and jake started on a trail to monogram lake took a fork toward lookout mountain and climbed to the spot where it made sense to cut through the forest this was not the most direct waythey could have plowed straight uphill from hoods cabinbut even the switchback misery of the forest service trail was better than scrambling across logs and breaking through the salal and sword fern of thick cascade forest rominy wore the womens boots jake had providedhalf a size too big she estimatedand had cut off the oversized jeans at midthigh it was nice barrow had the gear but after the revelation about the saliva and the starbucks cup rominy was suspicious of his story had jake learned her shoe size too was he an investigative reporter or a stalker had he deliberately disabled her cell phone if so had he simply been buying enough time to sell her on this wild story she also remembered his caresses and couldnt believe her instincts were that wrong christ he could kiss hed found her inheritance too but the cash had been put in his heavier backpack not hers rominy had thought of trying to sneak the old into her own pack for protection but it was as inconspicuous as an anvil and she was doubtful it would even fire her safeway skirt was packed away her purse was in the truck her identity stripped jake said he was taking the money for safekeeping better than risk it lying around the cabin just in case you did see someone which was not exactly reassuring dont worry im trustworthy as a bank like thats reassuring after the wall street meltdown he laughed the money was in a zipper pocket of his backpack about as fat as the other one that carried energy bars rominy thought about demanding to carry the cash but hed found the inheritance and she didnt want an argument to break the mood of partnership instead she quietly did take one secret scrap along for herself just so she did something jake didnt know about she tucked the old tibetan scarf with its invisible writing in her bra between her breasts it wasnt much but it was something she did not mr reporter she needed to regain a measure of control but she also wanted to get to the bottom of this crazy mystery and so far theyd made a great team so shed play along learn about her ancestor and then if necessary run screaming for the cops well it was a plan barrow was certainly fit not unusual in this part of the nation but he soon had her panting as he chugged up the trail with the determination of the little engine that could rominy had done her share of hikingguys saw it as a cheap datebut her idea of alpine adventure was driving to the parking lot at paradise on mount rainier and meandering with the mob through the wildflower meadows until pavement ended if god had wanted people to walk on dirt trails why had he provided asphalt this path seemed to be made of equal parts mud rock roots and brush and was empty for good reason there was no view just monotonously steep forest rising above the cascade river valley it was shadowy and still few birds lived in these deep woods did you bring a flashlight she finally remembered to ask ive got two plus gps working compass climbing rope swiss army knife and food for two days we could invade afghanistan you seem awfully prepared i was an eagle scout remember why arent i surprised ski patrol lifeguard training cpr and ballroom dancing she didnt know if he was kidding ballroom dancing really i took some lessons intriguing i thought newspaper reporters hung around bars and stayed up late and ate bad food i do eat bad food havent you noticed but you know about wine and you have all this outdoor gear im a backpacker and camper and i knew about hoods cabin i just couldnt get to it without your help ive been preparing this for a long time rominy i didnt expect the car bomb or how clever youd be i dont feel clever i feel bewildered or how pretty male bullshit but she liked it even now huffing and sweaty she felt a kind of satisfied tingle from their lovemaking why wasnt anything ever simple what do you think well really find did hood come back from tibet with some kind of treasure is that why he hid out here i hope so not for the money but for the story ive already got a good story of course you the bomb the ancestor and the safety deposit box but ive got a hunch i still dont have the whole story and why are those skinhead goons after you what happened to your relatives why did ben hood make this a game of clue i hope were hiking up to all the answers each answer just seems like it poses new questions kind of like life isnt it too many questions and then you die after two hours of steady climbing jake took a reading from his gps consulted his contour map and announced it was time to leave the trail and strike due eaststill upon their own just make sure we can find our way back ive got a satellite to guide me but if worse comes to worst just head downhill eventually you should hit the cascade river road if you dont starve or get eaten by a cougar or a bear thanks for that jake fortunately the trees had already shrunk in size at a mile in altitude so the downed logs were more hurdles than walls it was slow going through huckleberry and silver fir jake shouting once in a while to warn any bears away from their plowing slowly they broke out into heather meadows with a view to higher peaks rominy caught her breath a great rampart of rock and snow glaciers hanging loomed above a densely forested valley alpine meadows were a bright irish green between the dark trees and the snow jake looked from his survey map to the horizon dorado needle triad mount torment forbidden peak cheery and that one is eldorado appropriate when looking for a gold mine no except el dorado didnt exist or oz shangrila or camelot or did they he smiled fetchingly lead on dorothy jake would stop periodically to take readings from his gps and then plot their position on their two maps his usgs green contour one and hoods fingerprint chart they steadily closed in on their target the entire idea of using satellites in outer space to plot their position in the cascade mountains struck rominy as little less than magic and using clues from a petrified finger as little more than weird the entire day was fantastical the air crisp the sun bright the distant glaciers gleaming and this new man beside her whod come out of nowhere and seemed able to do anything and everything her heart beat faster just watching him move his mystery made him frightening and fascinating what wasnt magical is how the coordinates forced them to work in and out of ravines scramble across downed timber and get clawed at by underbrush the morning dragged into hard work only the excitement of a treasure hunt preventing the bushwhacking from getting dispiriting and then they were there supposedly it was a steep mountainside in a stand of alpine firs twenty to thirty feet high dropping off below to a cliff that fell down to the forested gulf between them and eldorado there was no striking outcrop no x marks the spot no gleam of gold or skull the spot seemed utterly unremarkable i dont get it rominy said jake squatted studying his gps and his maps if we guessed right in the cabin we should be here he peered up at the sky as if the satellites might give him a different answer maybe we figured the clues wrong great she looked around with her hands on her hips all that sweat for nothing she felt dirty and uneasy maybe your greatgrandfather miscalculated a little he didnt have our instruments after all maybe my greatgrandfather was crazy as a loon well lets check around could be were just off by a hundred yards though it looks to me its more likely a hundred miles you go back up ill go down just dont step off that cliff they began scouting in opposite directions it was just more trees and brush rominy grazed on huckleberries as she moved cautiously down the slope she and jake would shout hey bear once in a while to keep each other in earshot suddenly she slipped on something slick soil or wood and fell on her butt sliding down she panicked a moment because it was in the direction of the lip of the cliff but heather and huckleberries quickly braked her now all she could see was leaves she stood up to look back toward jake but he was hidden she was in some kind of hollow more important she wasnt near him and he had the maps gps and compass not to mention her money jake no answer jake what he sounded too far away and she wanted him closer i think i found something after a while she could hear him thrashing toward her meanwhile she inspected her position since shed have to justify calling him over it was a depression like an old crater about a dozen feet wide and three feet deep what is it jake looked down at her from the lip of the hollow poking up out of the huckleberries like a bear himself he was sweaty its a kind of pit like where people dug he looked skeptical but clambered down to join her maybe just a hole where a tree went over its root ball pulling out of the ground trees dont grow that big up here and wheres the log true he looked around considering and then with an ominous crack the ground around them split and the hollow caved in they spilled down into darkness shambhala canyon tibet october i f shambhala canyon was a gate to paradise it was designed to discourage all but the boldest no sun penetrated the rift from which the disappearing river exploded the canyon walls were coated with great tapestries of icicles as dramatic as the limestone drapery of a cave its end was hidden raeders party had to climb the waterfall cliff first this precipice actually leaned out the curtain of water allowing an icy backstage behind and the climb was impossible for all but the most experienced mountaineers the germans were alpinists however survivors of the eiger they had to leave their scientific instruments behindtoo bad because muller couldnt measure for underground cavitiesbut among the goods theyd carted since abandoning the truck were pitons and rope they also shouldered their rifles and the submachine gun and crammed their pockets with bullets if you have to choose between food and ammunition take ammunition raeder instructed food we can seize from the shambhalans on the other side they strung a route next to the roaring cataract the climbing line taut enough so that even keyuri could haul herself up the cliff her small booted feet scrabbled for purchase on the slippery face raeder muller and diels went first and pulled themselves up to a ledge above the brow of the falls their perch not much bigger than himmlers old desk in berlin the shelf was slick with frost and tilted outward as precarious as greased glass but it connected with the trail raeder had spied with his binoculars this path was hewn into the western cliff in a sevenfoothigh groove that led into the darkness of the canyon the roof of the groove leaned out over the trail its eave draped with ice the overhang had the advantage of keeping the worst moisture off the path the cliff trail itself was just two feet wide below was the river white and roaring a mad slurry of racing foam if they fell in theyd be hurled into space by the force of the waterfall and then drop a hundred feet to their deaths the canyon bent slightly so they still had no idea what lay on its far side raeder however was exultant he put his hand to his chest where a vial of blood from the legendary frederick barbarossa stayed warm near his beating heart someone built this he shouted above the roar of the river to muller madmen the geophysicist muttered we cant get through that kurt we cant haul our supplies well slip into the river we can carry what we need get keyuri up here the woman was dragged up her hair streaming a coat of frost on her clothes this canyon raeder demanded whats on the other side supposedly shambhala she said open to the chosen he frowned chosen reminded him of the tribal jews but also the ss the master race like men who brave this trail its all legend metaphor and symbol i cant promise theres anything on the other side she looked at the forbidding trail maybe this is a natural fault maybe this used to be a road thirteen feet wide and the rest of it has caved into the river and its now impassable maybe the taletellers all stopped here without going on and invented everything we think we know and maybe no one has dared this since ancient times his eye gleamed you wouldnt be here keyuri if you didnt believe that yourself you wouldnt have tried to betray me to the british if you didnt think there was something to find she blinked looking into the canyon do you believe in destiny kurt you mean fate fate that you met me yes things happen for a reason opportunity comes for a reason her eyes were solemn pain happens for a reason he nodded yes yes im going into shambhala with you but never think im truly with you this is for my country not yours of course each of us has our loyalties but destiny has brought us this far together he held her shoulders lets see where else she takes us until i dont need you anymore he thought the climbing rope was reeled in and a fresh piton driven above the ledge where they crowded kranz looked excited muller doubtful diels like a fatalistic infantryman resigned to making a charge eckells whod come up last because hed insisted on bringing his cameras was muttering heil hitler to summon nazi courage they squeezed like a single organism then raeder went first his face to the cliff sidling sideways his mauser hunting rifle slung across his back the cataract roared and sucked at the cliff face twenty feet below his boots it was like mincing on a frozen pond rope spooled out behind him at a hundred feet he drove in a second piton when the rope was secured the second german sidled forward each member of the party followed in turn until they were strung like beads on a string now stay still and hold on while i advance he ordered them again he extended like a spider fastening a line the others could follow when the last german advanced a slipknot let the first line come loose so it could be reeled in and used again it was like the creep of a caterpillar raeder always went first with nothing to hold on to the leader takes the most risk the canyon grew darker and colder as they penetrated what if they ran out of pitons keyuri was shivering but said nothing she was sandwiched between muller and eckells and shuffled forward with them as her turn came hour followed hour theyd no idea what the sun was doing it was eternal shadow in this crack in the mountains they crept a hundred feet at a time raeder refusing the offers of the others to pioneer the route i led us here and i will lead us out he said the fatherland calls us to courage my friends muller rolled his eyes diels shared a sly smile after an eternity the canyon seemed to be lightening raeder had diels grip his pack while he leaned out over the rushing river to peer ahead then he gestured and was pulled back i see the canyon ending he said theres a wider valley beyond and distant snow i think were coming to shambhala comrades what does it look like kurt he winked paradise all he had glimpsed was the white of ice but his men began shuffling faster they could see where the trail broadened at the end of the canyon two hundred yards ahead when the pitons at last ran out what if we need them for this shambhala muller asked moodily ill send you crawling back to get them raeder snapped then even though he couldnt possibly know dont worry were past the worst he addressed the others were almost there from here we balance youve seen me do it were almost off this hellish path theyd made another thirty yards legs trembling from the strain of mincing along the icy ledge when there was the flicker of a shadow above the others might have missed it but raeders senses were honed by the concentration required when hunting his head jerked upward a vulture no a plane it flashed a moment in the narrow ribbon of sky above the canyon and then disappeared behind the other rim an airplane here the tibetans had none was this some british trick he could hear the craft circling god in heaven he muttered not god kurt keyuri said benjamin hood what for just a second his practiced composure was gone he looked back to where she clung on the canyon wall hes pursuing you she said youve led him to what hes looking for youre lying she looked at him evenly and he knew she wasnt how do you know this i planned it as did the reting damn you she allowed herself a smile the other germans looked bewildered the american asked diels in tibet raeder thought he cant land ahead in the valley of shambhala or hed be doing so already wed hear the drone of his motor hell have to come in the same way we did but were first and ready for him youre going to shoot him stop him but if he brings the british or tibetan army no one is bringing an army he glanced around the precipitous canyon you others go around me ill be last go around you protested kranz well fall off the river thundered below steaming as if boiling ill jam my mitten into the crack here to brace myself ill be like a root in this cliff hold on to my pack and squeeze by there was another flicker and a faint sound of engine noise the biplane again hurry one by one they crept around him clutching his pack trembling at the strain and then continued sidling on the narrow trail creeping toward where it widened to a shelf in what must be a valley muller kranz diels keyuri eckells was last the nazi cameraman was exhausted the movie camera and tripod were awkward and unbalancing he grabbed raeders pack began moving around and hesitated his limbs shaking from exhaustion his gear was hauling him backward a foot slipped and he leaned out over the river franz dont stop move move eckells began to flail franz youre pulling me loose well go into the river the cameramans eyes widened as he panicked he tried to make a sound but nothing came out all he could sense was the water below franz youre peeling me off the cliff let go eckells clung tighter raeder began to lose his own grip so the untersturmfuhrer stomped on the cameramans instep the pain causing eckells to release his grip in surprise his mouth formed an o of pain and shock then he was falling there was a splash and eckells was gone in an instant a dark form flashing down the racing sluice of a river sinking from the weight of his own pack in less time than it took to drown he would reach the falls and then it was as if their companion had never existed at all raeder slammed himself back into the protection of the cliff the others froze horrorstruck all were in front of their leader now staring back raeder took a breath cursing and then ignored them he slung off his pack put it on the slippery ledge and hauled out some explosive kurt muller yelled in alarm what are you doing the zoologist jammed dynamite into the crevice hed just clung to there was no way to wire a detonator he fumbled for a lighter and lit a fuse sending the american a message he called no army can follow kurt no silence he began following the others facing forward on the trail to make better speed ignoring the torrent below as he tottered the fuse was burning go go if you dont want us all to be blown off the cliff but how are we going to get back diels shouted by finding shambhala and a new kind of power the german roared youre a madman muller cried and youre dead if you dont move keyuri put her hand on mullers arm its all right she whispered muller stared at her what did she mean soon it will all be over shes a witch the geophysicist thought were doomed they crept on as fast as they dared trying to put distance between them and the explosive it went off like a clap of thunder the shock wave nearly shaking them off rock blew out from their side of the canyon to crash against the other wall before falling into the river where the precipitous trail had been where eckells had fallen there was now only a bite out of the rock they had no more pitons no means of ascending glaciers no route home the biplane passed by one more time a flicker as it flew from rim to rim raeder laughed lifting his arm in nazi salute to the sky try to follow me now hood his companions huddled they had become shambhalans shambhala valley tibet october i f kurt raeder hadnt set off his explosion benjamin hood might never have confirmed the nazis were there beth calloway had shouted that their fuel was getting low that they must turn back if they were ever to return to lhasa she wasnt about to abandon her precious corsair by having it run out of gas in this desolation but then there was a flash and smoke from what almost seemed inside the earth and the americans realized theyd guessed right the germans must be inside a narrow canyon trying to reach the valley beyond and the nazis had seen them and were destroying something in reaction hood bet the race was to its final sprint it was the end of a long wearying day of flying from lhasa when hed met calloway and her plane outside the summer palace grounds in the tibetan capital hood was honest this was a woman hed last seen when they were making love and now shed been asked to fly him off the edge of the map do you know who were going after he asked not what but who your old lover and your old enemy she said it matteroffactly the tibetans had been candid and this is okay with you shut up and crank the propeller its dangerous so i double my fee to buy more shoes beth i didnt expect to go after keyuri again but you hoped you would shes not what this is about yes she is when we get back well sort all this out if you get back im flying this crate and ill be judging which of the pair of you is lighter she smirked menacingly he hunted for the right words your plane is the only chance to catch the nazis the only chance after giving them time to find what the tibetans want them to find right the germans are playing the tibetans and the tibetans are playing us and youre playing me everyones got a bet in this fiasco ben so dont worry about stamping out medals lets just do what we have to whats your bet she shrugged that your nun is unlikely to be alive by the time we get to her or as sweet as you remember or available but if she is ill save as many of our hides as i can its what i do they took off the altitude forcing them to snake through passes instead of hopping over mountains to fly direct the biplane followed the trace of dirt roads below hood watching for the germans but finding only what he expected herds of goats and caravans of yaks and oxen the trade traffic thinned as they flew north and west of the city and then nearly ended altogether they followed the main trunk road that led west a thread of connection in a vast plateau wilderness the wind so biting that hood almost wrapped his head like a mummy with the silk scarf reting had provided in trade calloway had a khata of her own the fabric hid her expression behind her flying goggles he couldnt see her eyes at some point theyll have to turn for the kunlun he shouted watch for sign an hour later he saw it a lighter scrawl of dust on a tributary track suggested a place where dirt had been kicked up by more than animal hooves he pointed and she banked nodding at the line of tire tracks they turned north the biplane bucked in the cold air a hundred miles on a glint of metal confirmed they were on the germans trail it was the british motorcar overturned wheels up slid down a hill an accident they circled twice looking for bodies or survivors but saw none i think it broke down hood said over the roar of the engine beth nodded they flew on three hours more and they came to an enormous crack in the crust of the earth a huge canyon sat athwart the path and the truck and trailer were beside it a rope stretched across the chasm again no sign of life pray they left the gas beth said this landing spot was even rougher than the one with the shootout but there were no bandits this time no germans either nobody at all just the sighing wind of an emptiness even the tibetans didnt want beth topped off her tank with the german spare fuel while hood got more by siphoning the german truck dry she put three canisters in the biplanes storage compartment while he hid the rest behind a rock if they survived this was the only way theyd get back then they took off again the engine throaty as they clawed over the precipitous canyon it was getting late there was a range of snowy hills they barely skimmed over boot tracks in the snow and then a barren basin the kunluns beyond were a frozen rampart that stretched as far as the eye could see when they saw the river hood pointed and beth nodded following it the waterfall was a white beacon miles away and when they flew near it seemed to be spurting from the cliff face the canyon was a cleft too narrow to see into odd they circled down at the base of the waterfall hood spotted abandoned bundles of equipment go as high as you can see if we can fly above the source of the river and get into the mountains they pivoted upward like a climbing bird there was a snowy saddle at the top of the cliffs that led toward white haze a jagged black line represented the rift in the rock below as they passed over it he got brief glimpses of racing gray water were the germans somewhere in that chasm beth rapped him on the shoulder and pointed several miles east at the outer base of the kulun range there was a wisp of smoke they saw a tracery of wall there did someone live near the gate of shambhala then they saw the flash of the explosion deep in the crack of the river theyre here he shouted where she peered over the side the crevice was narrower in places than her wings they must be pushing through see if we can fly over the saddle it must be where theyre going were already at our limit climb anyway shaking her head she aimed where he pointed pray mountain piled upon mountain they skimmed the snow the engine was laboring in the thin air wheels dipping toward a crash and then the ground plunged abruptly away sheer cliffs again and they popped out over a hidden valley shambhala was like a well the vale was shadowy ringed by towering peaks with glaciers that fed the river yet at the bottom it also had an improbable wash of green totally unexpected in october somehow the basin below must be warmer than the bitter norm beth dipped and circled rotating around the curve of the mountain bowl there was a party of people down there hurrying through a jumble of old ruins can you land where look at that mess but the germans must have blown the only way in one of the ways unless your germans and your old girlfriend dont plan on ever coming back she glanced around everywhere mountains higher than their maximum altitude her biplane a fly in a cup pass a few miles in either direction and youd never suspect this secret hole was here christ hood cursed we cant climb over those cliffs either there is another way college boy but you aint gonna like it she kept them rotating the party below had disappeared what jump i wish he looked down if only he could step onto those snowy slopes maybe he could pick his way down wish granted she unbuckled straps put the plane straight and level for a moment half stood and wiggled out of her parachute tie the straps as tight as you can when you fall yank that cord there you dont have much room and need time for the canopy to deploy youll still land hard ive never used a parachute neither have i hood groaned theres no alternative this is what you get for chasing your tibetan sweetheart ill try landing back on the plain we crossed and check out that smoke no house has only one door he closed his eyes igloos do so youd better hope the shambhalans werent eskimo hurry up were wasting gas pretty soon it might occur to raeder to start shooting at you hood lengthened the straps for his frame and awkwardly put the parachute on it felt bulky and flimsy at the same time to think i was bored what are you complaining about now i dont have a parachute at all go go its getting dark he glanced around a cirque of mountains frigid air strange greenness below enemies whod vanished the sun had long since set behind the mountains and all was pale gray too awkward to jump with his rifle he checked his duncan haleissued government taking a breath and trying to think of as little as possible he grasped the rim of the cockpit and boosted himself out tensing as the wind hit him full force he clawed for a strut trying to get in position to jump every instinct screamed not to let go but then beth abruptly tilted the biplane and the cold air plucked him off hood fell toward shambhala eldorado mine cascade mountains september present day r ominy plummeted slid and dropped again it happened so suddenly in such disorienting darkness that it was over before she could scream she and jake tumbled into a tangle at the base of some mine shaft the rotting wood of an old lid piled around them as her wits returned from the blast of adrenaline the real fear began what if they couldnt get out rominy are you okay i can move she groaned but when she tested her limbs they all seemed to work thank god barely she coughed im covered with dirt my body aches and i can barely see i think my knees are getting scraped down to the bone ive got more bandages dim light filtered down from where the cavein had occurred above it was like looking at the top of a well you know youre the worst date ive ever had jake coughed too ditto she looked around theyd tumbled at least forty feet and were in a wider cavity about ten feet high which meant it was impossible to jump up to the narrow tunnel theyd fallen down the walls and ceiling were rock the floor dirt and rubble and the darkness in every direction but up was profound this is very bad jake she tried to keep any tremor from her voice what now he stood up weaving a moment from dizziness before straightening and brushing himself off im guessing you found where x marks the spot maybe greatgrandpa came back to be some kind of hermit miner great she wobbled to a stand too yep nothing broken not that it mattered if they couldnt get back out it didnt occur to him to dig sideways i dont know maybe this is an old pioneer mine he found so why is it on his fingerprint map youre asking all the right questions fortunately for us im a boy scout remember theyd fallen with their packs and he rooted inside for a moment before digging out a flashlight ill keep the other in reserve lets see where this thrill ride goes the beam was as welcome as coffeehouse neon on a cold seattle night gloom shrank back to reveal a horizontal shaft that must run toward the cliff face theyd spied from above the old horizontal shaft would have opened to a view of eldorado mine timbers at the ceiling sagged from age in a hundred feet the tunnel ended disappointingly in a wall of rubble and snapped bracing cavein rominy said this place feels very unsafe youve got all the instincts of an investigative reporter he played his light on the blockage and then on the ceiling back and forth he shone the beam like a paint roller look at those streaks soot radiating from an explosion which means that maybe this mine didnt cave in but was sealed dynamite and boom that closes the front door we fell through the back so no way out maybe there was a rope or ladder at one time would have rotted since the end of the war of course he kept staring at the ceiling looks pretty firm to me but im not a mining engineer probably best to go back to where we fell in while we figure out what to do but you know i dont get it he sounded more puzzled than worried what did hood expect us to find here my guess is an old gold claim rominy said maybe he thought his heirs could make something of this but no way today too many environmental restrictions i think were on federal land in the exact middle of nowhere which means he definitely thought he had children or a child thats interesting isnt it because theres nothing in the records about one living up here so where was greatgrandma mystery upon mystery jake the mystery is how were going to get out of here maybe i can lift you up until you can get a grip in that shaft im not much of a climber consider the alternative and then rominy stumbled on something that gave way with an audible crack an object softer than rubble on the floor oh geez whats that theres something creepy jake he shone the light yuck a shoe a mans dress shoe had been kicked out from the rubble by her stumble there was a gleam inside barrow bent to peer with a foot attached you broke the bone oh my god im going to be throw up its just a corpse rominy dust to dust jake lets go ill climb i promise no this is important greatgrandpa led us to a body the ankle bone is attached to the shin bone he singsonged playing the light there a bone projected from the loose rock and near it was another shoe hello looks like we really found someone this is so sick what if this is your illustrious ancestor dunnigan said they found him in the cabin thats right so in that case whos this i dont think i want to know i cant take looking at bones not when were trapped like this we cant just walk away girl he squatted and calmly began throwing aside rock yep theres a whole dude in here what was wrong with him that he could just dig up the dead like that isnt this desecration my guess is hes been here since and either the explosion or subsequent rockfall covered him up the poor guy has never had a decent burial maybe we can arrange one but whats he doing here thats the milliondollar question isnt it here shine the light can you the flesh had long since rotted away thank goodness but the skeleton was still enclosed in shreds of decayed clothing there was no obvious injury to the skull and no indication of how the man had died it was a man because the other shoe was male as well the clothing looked like the ruin of a business suit out here not really outfitted for mining was he jake asked what was he doing in the woods dressed like that we need identification the flashlight danced eureka he crouched again and threw aside more rocks to uncover a pack look old oilskins to keep out the weather he pulled it out ignoring the mold and grime bones fell aside fabric deflated and inside ah a leather satchel maybe this is what your calendar map was directing us to rominy despite herself she was getting excited again she played the light over what jake held whats inside he opened the satchel carefully there were papers documents with script in a foreign alphabet curious diagrams and maps he carefully unfolded one central asia they could still read it clearly in the flashlight beam tibet hallelujah said jake so it is my greatgrandfather in a business suit a burial suit he rocked back on his heels was he a suicide he makes obscure clues hikes in his funeral best to an old mine and uses dynamite to seal himself in man thats grim i dont get it but they said they found him in the spring of dead of natural causes yeah and this happy camper has all ten fingers look so its not benjamin hood or thats not grandpas finger she shook her head im more confused than ever me too but i think this is some other guy who maybe grandpa sealed in so who is it he began digging through the leather satchel looking for a clue rominy had spied something else caught among the tendrils of decayed fabric and old ribs it was a much smaller bundle she didnt want to touch but curiosity animated her arm besides once they identified the body maybe they could concentrate on escape squeamishly she reached in snagged the packet from the bones and pulled it out jake looked up from his papers what you got his wallet or something open it up it was a leather folder of the kind that carried official identification stuck shut with moisture grime and time gingerly the old leather cracking she spread it apart its some kind of government credentials she read slowly in the beam of the flashlight a badge office of strategic services oss thats the wars predecessor to the cia he frowned what was an overseas operative doing here theres a name too ive never heard of have you she held it out he looked his head next to hers special agent duncan hale shambhala tibet october k urt raeders mother had taught him that life is a series of disappointments where reality falls short of hope shed been widowed by the great war and impoverished by that widowhood shed almost starved in the chaos of the weimar republic that followed germanys defeat and become bitter because of it a shrew for whom even the good was never good enough shed spent kurts youth recoiling from any suitors and railing against fate in reaction raeder had retreated into adventure stories his childhood strategy was to believe that if he just hiked hard enough or climbed high enough or won prizes enough he could reach the end of the rainbow and flee his family gloom his thicknecked mustached father who disappeared at verdun had glared balefully at him from a photograph fading in a tarnished frame hed sought to please the brutal ghost who had beaten him in his earliest years by fighting bullies until he became one himself always though kurt felt destined for something nobler than his mothers religion of pessimism and his fathers eternal dissatisfaction he would scale valhalla well he had hiked and climbed now hed come to the very end of the earth a place of thin cold air and epic vastness a hyperborea of ice and rock seeking the victory of the hero stories hed escaped in as a child and here finally was the rainbows end the el dorado hed dreamed of all his life hed found shambhala he was sure of it the survivors of their party had fallen silent when they emerged from the gorge into the valley even keyuri who had somehow betrayed him to hood had gone quiet in awe and trepidation the valley into which theyd emerged was surrounded by cliffs so precipitous that it was craterlike glaciers hanging above like halfdescended curtains a dozen waterfalls that cascaded down from those ice fields were drawn like wavering lines of chalk feeding the river theyd just inched along the river gray and cold bisected the valley there was no pass at the upper end just towering mountains the effect was claustrophobic but sheltering the valley floor was a wonder it was green in this otherwise brown tibetan autumn not lush by any means but full of grass and heather the mountains must catch the clouds and wring out more rain muller speculated as much to himself as to the others the cliffs trap warmth this pasture was broken by old ruins a crumbled maze of roofless walls and pillars their style was vaguely tibetan the walls sloping slightly inward to mimic mountain slopes and brace against earthquakes yet in detail the stonework was different from anything raeders party had seen there was a hint of egypt rome and china and yet the architecture was none of these and impossible to date abstract patterns created a frieze on some of the broken walls pediments buttresses and porches had carvings of animals both recognizable and fantastic from lions and camels to winged serpents shaggy yetis and crocodiles the length of a mediterranean galley here the remnants echoed babylonia there the geometry of the yucatan erosion had taken its toll but there were still bits of bright paint on the stonework this place might once have been as brilliantly colored as the potala in lhasa said diels the archaeologist the egyptian and greek temples were like that too before the paint wore away weve found our lost city raeder announced unnecessarily hed expected the others to cry out in wonder at this moment or slap him on the back but instead everyone seemed subdued and wary there was something haunted about this place feel the air said diels its warmer is it not not warm but warmer than outside isnt that strange theres an odd tingling too said kranz do you feel that a silent buzzing like electricity the feeling you get in a generating plant could this be some trick of electromagnetism julius like an energy field if wed brought my instruments i could tell you muller was grumpy and if i had my cache of schnapps we could drink a toast quipped diels are you mad snapped muller franz eckells is dead i cant get my instruments because our leader has destroyed our only escape and you want to celebrate or comment on the temperature a scientific phenomenon diels sounded hurt we cant bring franz back and he was too much the nazi brownnose anyway come julius were making one of the greatest discoveries in the history of the world dont you feel anything i feel trapped look at what youre seeing the citys dead theres no way out were led by a fanatic and i feel on the brink of achievement raeder retorted germany sent us here out of conviction that there were valuable secrets to be learned this is what heinrich himmler dreamed of sulk if you want by the river here muller but the rest of us are going to explore shambhala even her this delilah who somehow helped the american find us muller pointed to keyuri especially her to interpret what we find she can scheme all she wants but the american cant follow us and look at her eyes she wants to explore this too you didnt really believe it did you keyuri you thought we were chasing a myth but german will prevailed national socialism prevailed destiny prevailed she said remember none have ever returned ill return with vril he addressed the others unsling your weapons we dont know who might be hiding here ghosts muller said they advanced into the bowl the geophysicist reluctantly bringing up the rear the valleys sides had been terraced raeder realized with the glacial streams feeding pools that at one time were part of a complex irrigation system at some point in the past this had been an intensively farmed oasis why had this civilization tucked itself away like this whod come to build it they found themselves walking on what must have been the principle avenue many of the paving blocks heaved or broken their gun muzzles swept the road the lost citys layout and order became plainer but so did the fact that it had almost certainly been abandoned contrary to myths of long life and perfect harmony had it fallen prey to catastrophe or to the simple old age that doomed all civilizations this find was the fantasy of any archaeologistdiels was walking goggleeyedbut raeders goal was a practical one to find a new kind of power they passed two enormous statues of warriors or kings each at least sixty feet high the men one on either side of the avenue were holding staffs thrust forward in their fists their bodies were encased in a kind of chain mail this was overlain by rigid armor across the chest and groin curiously however their helmeted heads were turned backward as if looking for followers through the narrow slit of their visors their faces couldnt be seen they dont know whether theyre coming or going joked kranz not the most heroic of poses theyre looking for something behind them i think said diels or theyre turning away said muller turning from the face of god keyuri said quietly god or his manifestation the power of the universe its blinding like the sun hmph said muller what do you think kurt i think all humans have historically worshipped the sun because its the obvious source of life on our planet were dust and water animated by energy some theosophists believe theres a black sun at the center of our planet with similar power perhaps the shambhalans tapped that or brought their own energy with them look at those friezes they could be ships but were thousands of miles from the ocean they could also be flying machines or rocket ships like the american buck rogers their suits could be spacesuits or they could be gods with winged chariots but why tibet in this valley said kranz if you wanted an outpost or base hidden from hostile natives diels speculated this is the very best place its too high for conventional civilization and far away from roads and cities its on the highest plateau of our planet the valley is hidden but easily defended maybe they just stopped here to build something or repair something who stopped here the helmet men raeder said gods or visitors from outer space the ancestors of us aryans they cast the seeds of civilization completed what they wished and moved on possibly leaving descendants germans to rule the earth or they didnt leave but just died keyuri said quietly like any number of european explorers muller said disease starvation despair maybe what they were seeking didnt work or they couldnt control it she said i will if its here raeder said he looked at his companions are we women worried about the worst like keyuri or are we going to get what we came for he pointed i think the helmet men are looking back at that tunnel entrance see that glow thats the real entrance to shambhala they arent guardians theyre guides just then they heard the whine of the airplane again the sky was already twilight blue everything in shadow the biplane caught a last ray of the sun at its height and shone for a moment like a star its hood raeder growled looking for us he could strafe us even run to that cave before he spots us hell soon run out of fuel and turn back if he ever finds his way in here it will be too late well have vril and be ready for him he jerked keyuris arm and began hurrying her the other germans broke into a trot as well ahead was an arched entry into a hill the stone portal carved into a scrolling tapestry of what looked like mathematical and geometric symbols from within came a faint green glow the opening was as big as a train tunnel the causeway they were on peaked at the entrance and then sloped down into the earth while the others ran under its roof a few yards raeder paused to look up at the sky the biplane was circling aimlessly there was no place to land hood had come all this way for nothing satisfied the german stepped inside somewhere below is our el dorado shambhala tibet october t he vault of the shambhala tunnel was as riotously decorated as the painted pillars of the potala palace but the intricacy was carved with stone instead of drawn by paint a universe of images enclosed them as they descended on a gently sloping ramp thick jungles with slanteyed beasts peering through prehistoric fronds high mountains with plunging waterfalls vast temples marching armies strange ships that seemed to float on air instead of water voluptuous dancers stampeding chariot teams grinning monkeys the figures wound around each other in spirals and loops a giraffe nibbling at a maidens hair a salmon leaping through a ring of fire a soldier thrusting a spear at what looked like a dirigible here a prisoner had his heart torn out there figures erotically entwined the artwork was in panels as if telling a story like the stainedglass windows of a church the panels were separated by geometric bands exquisite and barbaric at the same time kranz said it looks almost mayan or mexican but also indian cambodian minoan could the connections between ancient cultures be deeper and more profound than even the ahnenerbe has dreamed either these people copied from everyone diels said or the world copied from them he was transfixed and wanted to stop and study but raeder dragged him on time for art history later what intrigued and worried him was the mysterious force that infused the stone with a green electric glow as if the rock itself was somehow alive and illuminated from within what caused that its the dream of madmen muller whispered looking about in the ghostly glow every surface is covered and what is this light curies radiation in a hundred yards their progress ended at a massive gate made of an unknown substance dull as pencil lead it sealed the tunnel the gate divided into petals like the shutter of a camera was a disk a dozen feet across it bore a carved tibetan mandala like theyd seen in the potala palace a symbolic portrait of the universe it was a map of a fantasy temple or palace as viewed from a bird or flying machine a succession of canals dividing the utopia of palaces and gardens into circular bands each section was grander as the eye was drawn to the center the atlantis of legend was like that according to plato the heart of the design was not a throne or king however but a literal hearta carving of the human organ where the petals joined at the center of this universe was the universal human pump of blood a carved artery sprouted from it like the tube of a flower that looks aztec too said muller remember how the ancient mexicans plucked out hearts is that a symbol of blood sacrifice and worship its a way in raeder said why did they delve underground at all asked muller because invention is not the same as wisdom said keyuri what these people were doing was dangerous they hid it down here they were seeking to protect themselves or others was dangerous in ancient times said raeder dangerous before the rise of science dangerous before the rise of national socialism dangerous before the research of the ahnenerbe he addressed them as a group we have a chance comrades to change world history all it takes is courage providence rewards the bold kranz seconded not said muller with more practicality unless we have a key to this gate the barrier weighed many tons but had no handle or keyhole the joint where the sections met was at the heart but the means of opening was unclear diels pushed on the gate it was as firm as a mountain its a blood lock said raeder what does that mean tell them keyuri she looked at raeder with unease surprised that he had guessed this the shambhala legends say the ancients had keys that only one person on earth could open the person with the correct blood the mechanism could detect the worthy from the unworthy thats nonsense said diels on the contrary isnt that what national socialism teaches said kranz race is real blood is real heredity is real perhaps theres some code in blood that tells one man from another which we dont have said muller which is why i in fact may have the necessary key said raeder he withdrew from his shift the silver vial slightly bigger than a rifle shell a small chain was attached to a metal cap ive been carrying this for ten thousand miles what is it diels asked before we left germany reichsfuhrer ss himmler entrusted me with a relic that has been brought to the nazi party by german scholars of the medieval period for eight hundred years it has been guarded passed from custodian to custodian as the shambhala key no one understood what that meant until the research of the ahnenerbe its aryan blood from the mists of history brought from here to europe after being taken from the veins of our great german ancestor frederick barbarossa barbarossa said muller are you mad if i am then so is heinrich himmler barbarossa didnt die in the third crusade comrades he secretly came here came for what to learn and perhaps to lock this door until the time was right until national socialism had been created by adolf hitler and our people were ready to receive shambhalas secrets wait said diels barbarossa went to tibet and back maybe not back but his blood did and locked the door until his rightful descendants returned to make sense of what hed found see the hole in the heart that artery he uncapped the vial and stepped forward the stone artery gaped like a little mouth leading into the stone heart this is where i pour dont i keyuri she said nothing raeder shrugged carefully tipped the vial and emptied the bright red contents into the gate as wilhelm said scholars of our ancestral heritage research and teaching society contend that shambhalas doors read something individual in blood some code that we do not yet understand but which differentiates each of us from the other this code is too tiny for even microscopes to see keyuri is right only chosen individuals somehow programmed by nature like the numbers of a combination lock can gain access and in reading the door responds indeed there was a sudden whir and growl like the sound of a machine gears and levers clunked at the sides of the tunnel then the great stone gates groaned and an aperture began to slowly open dust puffed out to settle around them the air that blew out was musty this is crazy muller said barbarossa was an old man by the time of the crusade how could he have come here a better question is why what did he know or seek i suspect he heard tales of this place in the holy land who knows who else visited here abraham jesus mohammed a key to its entrance was our kings last gift to germany perhaps this door was locked when he left or perhaps his bones are here and not in the holy land you believe that raeder pointed the doors believe it the massive petals had mostly receded into the tunnel walls just a small portion of each still jutting out like the curved teeth of a shark a circular entry led to more tunnel the way was clear raeder cautiously stepped through nothing happened the broad avenue sloped down as before but this time the way ahead was dark there was no green glow the germans hesitated what does legend say is down there raeder asked keyuri revelation and the danger that comes with it like the apple in your bible everything you believe is counter to my own religion kurt everything you strive for my religion teaches is illusory go down that road and youll only bring misery to yourselves and the world and i say everything that is wrong with your religion can be seen in the medieval barbarity of your country keyuri you teach acquiescence and despair we teach hope and triumph he turned to the others this door has been waiting for the right men to open it the triumphant heirs of frederick barbarossa and it opened thats the lesson here kurt we cant go down there without lights warned kranz maybe we can make torches said diels look theres a rack of staffs to the side here they must be antique weapons or tools we tie on some brush light a match and proceed if we carry several we can light the next with the last one and have some time to look about good idea said kranz he strode and seized one and it lit the upper third of the staff glowed the german almost dropped the staff in surprise and then raised it higher in wonder when he lifted his arm the tip shone brighter in bright daylight the output would seem modest but in the gloom just beyond the massive gate it sent shadows fleeing what magic is this kranz gasped shambhala keyuri said see said raeder its a sign from godour godthat were on the right path a sign that our nuns fears are groundless the others picked up staffs as well with the touch of a human hand each glowed the light staffs tingled the palm as they illuminated and there was an odd energy to the air a feel like an approaching thunderstorm i hope its not black magic said muller no more magical than a battery torch would be to a medieval knight raeder said were encountering what we came for a technology more sophisticated than our own our theosophist philosophers dubbed it vril but under any name its the power that girds the universe we cant detect it but these staffs absorb it from the air or the cave walls were going to find it comrades were going to control it and when we control it we control the world then where is everybody muller asked why were the doors sealed opened only by special blood i sense a wickedness about this place youve turned into an old woman julius weve got two nuns not one the other nazis laughed this from a man whos marooned us all who let poor franz fall into that river who just led you to the most exciting find in all history if you have the sense to seize it my god heres your magnetic anomaly your underground cavity your source for a hundred scientific papers and everlasting fame and you dont want to walk down this ramp fine then sit outside with the machine gun and keep watch for more interlopers like benjamin hood youre not rid of me so easily i want to keep an eye on you im the only one here who retains common sense then stop undermining morale and help lead the way live up to the ideals of the ss julius the fact that no one remains is a blessing we can explore the city in peace raeders eyes burned they descended muller in reluctant lead the main avenue remained the size of a train tunnel and from it opened doors on both sides dark rooms beyond they peered into a couple but they were empty with stairs leading both up and down into darkness its a vast hive im guessing raeder said see the size of the steps these were people just like us they didnt pause to explore any other rooms instead they kept to the main path noticing more decay and detritus as they did so there was broken pottery and scraps of odd material flexible like cloth but stiffer and hardercanvas or oilskin but from a substance theyd never felt before the deeper they went the more cracks appeared in the tunnels walls and ceiling from them water dripped the leachate forming small stalactites some of the basrelief carvingspresumably of kings and queens courtesans and captains royal pets and a zoos bestiaryseemed deliberately defaced if shambhala had been sealed it had not been when it was in pristine condition they were fleeing i think and dropped things behind said keyuri or they were an army issuing forth said raeder or they were fighting each other said muller rioting at last the ramp leveled and they came into an enormous cavern the size of a train station the ceiling so high that it was lost in darkness overhead raeder guessed the stone hall was a lobby or assembly area for this underground maze arched doorways directly ahead led to what had evidently been a huge dining room with stone tables and benches some of them shattered beyond was a stone counter and ovens on the walls were faded murals of fantastically opulent gardens and pavilions with brilliantly colored birds huge butterflies and grinning apes eden in a cave i suspect they worked down here but didnt live down here diels said theres too much love of nature thats what the valley was for or they missed the nature theyd abandoned keyuri said but why dig underground at all kranz was baffled but fascinated by his own bafflement here was a lifetime of research and prestige what was down here come before these glow staffs decide to dim muller said i dont think theyll ever dim diels said i think thats the tingling that they replenish can you imagine a lightbulb that powers itself forever that alone would make us rich kurt i just hope youre right said muller its a long climb back in the dark they went back to the cavernous lobby there were more small doors to the left side leading to dark tight chambers to the right however was a large garagelike opening when they explored this they realized there was a hangar door halfattached it had been knocked askew into this new room but still hung by one hinge this gigantic door was metal and a solid red from rust flakes littered the floor like cinnamon beyond was a vastness into which their light would not initially reach there was a sensation of cold empty space and their footsteps on the stone floor echoed lift the staffs as high as you can raeder ordered when the glow strengthened its light was reflected ahead by vast hulking machinery that filled the wall opposite the door it reminded them of a factory or power plant its engines extending into a cave hewn from rock as they approached this apparatus their light brightened even more and the staffs vibrated more there was a faint insect hum this is no ancient civilization diels murmured this is some incomprehensible future some great beast of a machine the size of a hundred locomotives loomed above them a great matrix of pipes wheels gears drums pistons and levers receding into gloom cables looped like vines catwalks allowed access to higher levels at the top pipes branched out from the machine like the limbs of a tree to run and entwine along the ceiling at the machines center these pipes gathered into a trunk that dived into a faintly glowing pit in the earth as if this apparatus had organically grown out of some kind of hell some parts were metal but other parts including the piping were of dullcolored material the germans couldnt guess at there were no obvious wheels or buttons for control and no obvious purpose to the contraption it did have a focus however in the center of the machine at floor level horizontal tubes from left and right ended in a gap in this gap was a stone cradle and lying on this cradle was another staff this one looking as if it were made of crystal its ends were aligned with the hollow pipes that ran in two directions from the machine these pipes disappeared into horizontal tunnels about ten feet in diameter at either end of the huge room the tunnels themselves extended into darkness there were squat boxes at the base with blank screens diels passed his staff near one it hummed and then made a residual crackle when the staff lifted away perhaps these boxes showed some kind of picture or signal the scientist hazarded they could be the controls but what does the machine do asked kranz i have no idea there are tunnels at either end of this big room raeder said lets check them these were more peculiar still the hollow pipes near the crystal shaft became encased in larger pipes that ran through the tunnels extending as far as their light would cast is it a pipeline asked diels is it to send some kind of oil or chemical from that machine a refinery to someplace else or perhaps this is the refinery and these tunnels conduct crude oil kranz guessed it must go to other parts of the city raeder turned to keyuri what do you know that to truly understand we need wisdom nunnish nonsense and he was tiring of it should we follow it kranz asked i think we need to figure out this big machine first said diels look more staffs said muller there was a rack of them near the squat boxes at the base of the machine like a rack of arms some were dull and black like carbon some were crystalline some were metal when muller took one it flared brighter and whiter than the ones from above they blinked in its illumination i can feel it vibrating the geophysicist said its like its a radio receiver for energy are they more powerful light sticks i think theyre here to be charged in the machines cradle raeder said i think theyre instruments of vril weapons wands the improved visibility from the new staff only deepened the mystery now they saw that some of the pipes at the ceiling had been torn and knocked askew these walls roughhewn and undecorated had black rays on them like blast marks from explosions there had been some kind of accident and in the center of the machine where pipes ran down into a circular well was a high metal mesh to guard its perimeter raeder took mullers staff and walked over to this looking through the grill to peer down the shaft far far belowimpossible to say how far but tremendously deepwas an eerie red glow heat wafted up stairways pipes and cables descended into the pit on the sides of the shaft gates led to new stone stairs that seemed to delve ever deeper perhaps i have led you to hell raeder told the others or a chute to the center of the earth what do you think the pit is for asked kranz looking down warily it was dizzying how deep it delved theyre getting energy from the earth muller hazarded heat energy and perhaps electromagnetic energy as well or some new form of energy we cant guess at perhaps they mined into this valley for this very connection or went underground because their experiments would only work in places deep and dark maybe it was so dangerous that they had to pick the most remote spot on earth in any event every machine needs fuel and this one uses the planets core im guessing the black sun perhaps but a machine for what for vril raeder took the brighter staff and passed it near one of the squat boxes the black rectangle on its top began to glow there was a clunk a groan and a hum as the huge machine began to start nothing moved but some of its components gave that same ghostly green glow theyd seen at the top of the tunnel and now the room was fully lit for the first time its coming to life muttered kranz they stepped back unsure what the mechanism might do it began to make a whirring sound in the stone cradle before them the crystalline staff began to glow its a generator raeder decided its transferring energy from the center of the earth or energy we cant detect to these instruments or weapons look those pipes from the deep bring energy the motors and gears transfer it to the horizontal pipes that extend into the tunnels and they in turn feed power to that staff charging it like a battery but how could an ancient civilization master such a thing all their knowledge was lost diels hazarded or they left here for another world left where to prehistoric germany to our age of heroes did they give rise to the legends of the gods muller was looking about peering into shadows or they didnt leave at all he said look he pointed kranz followed his finger oh my god the hangar door theyd seen had been almost knocked from its hinges but what they hadnt seen was that some blast or force from the machine had swept across the room and hurled everything against the far wall in the shadow behind that door in that newly illuminated gloom there was a white shoal of bone a bleached reef including hundreds of blankeyed human skulls it was a ridge of bony remains it was a hurled heap of longdead people the lost valley tibet october f or one terrifying moment after ben hood pulled his ripcord during his fall toward shambhala nothing seemed to happen then the parachute opened with a bang and he snapped hard against its straps gasping he looked up the silk had blossomed into a reassuring canopy beths biplane was a black dot against the dying light and then was gone past the mountains alone he looked down the ground was coming fast he tensed for the shock until remembering to relax the ground was dark and jumbled ruined walls running in every direction and small canals descending from the mountains pools from ancient reservoirs were rectangles of gray nor did he have any idea how to control his direction obstacles rushed up he lifted his knees reflexively and then with a thud he was down rolling his chute snagging on some old parapet for a moment he lay still stunned then he sat up to confirm nothing was broken there was no sign of raeder or anyone else hood unbuckled his parachute and let it sag over the wall the strings trailing like long white worms in the gloom now what he had no food no water and no weaponry except the on his hip but raeder must be here and with him keyuri unless the bastard had already tortured and killed her thered be other germans too his one advantage he hoped was surprise judging from the explosion the nazis expected theyd blocked his pursuit by dynamiting the canyon hood began navigating over old rubble the dusk continuing to deepen then he came upon a clearer path an old road with ruptured paving he stopped there was a low hum was the ground vibrating the sound seemed to come from where the road led there was the faintest green glow in that direction keeping to the deepest shadows and wary of ambush ben hurried as fast as he dared walls turrets and huge statues rose all around the statues were looking backward in the direction he was going shambhala looked very strange if only roy chapman andrews and agent duncan hale could see this the road led to a tunnel sloping down into the earth it was from there that the humming emanated there was a faint sickly luminescence that seemed to emerge from the walls of the tunnel itself as if the rock were alive with energy how this could be hood had no idea then a hundred yards in a circular entrance with a narrow pocket to either side into which some kind of aperture door had slid beyond was darkness except not complete darkness because far far below a yellow light glimmered like a candle at the end of the tunnel in that direction too was the source of the noise a whir like a turbine the ruin looked centuries or millennia old yet trembled like a powerhouse hood took out his pistol wary then there was a new rumble the tips of the doors black petals began closing like an insect maw for just a moment he considered bolting but then whatever hed come for would be forever beyond his grasp wouldnt it hed be haunted by incompletion like last time he stepped through and watched die cast as the door slammed shut he was in shambhala it was dark except for that distant light he carefully began to walk downhill as hood descended he occasionally felt currents of air from what he assumed were openings on both sides of the central tunnel and felt like he was being watched by the spirits of what had once been here no one challenged him however there was only the murmur of spoken german ahead the humming grew louder and he saw light slanting out from a hangarsized opening it spilled into a cavernous lobby a great stone atrium with carved pillars branching across a rock ceiling various doors opened to all sides now he heard excited voices to the right he trotted lightly to where a massive iron or steel door had been wrenched askew shielding his own body from view he peered inside the next room and there was raeder and his party it was startling to see his quarry after four years standing in a ballroomsized stone chamber barren of all furniture or decoration he was as hood remembered him tall handsome and carrying himself with that peculiar teutonic poise raeder and three other men he assumed to be nazis were dressed in mountain boots and heavy jackets their packs on the floor a smaller slighter figure was keyuri when she moved his recognition was instant her slim grace was like a fingerprint each of the five people held a long staff he saw from the tips a light shone like a gas wick and beyond was some kind of vast machine high as a cliff glittery from metal and somber with black pipes and boilers this contraption glowed and emitted a low whine pipes from the machine led into low tunnels at each end of the room at the center of this behemoth was a cavity in this cavity was a rack and on that rack rested another staff but this one translucent like a piece of agate it was not shining like a lantern but instead pulsed with a golden glow like a beating heart beyond was a pit that appeared to descend into the earth its mouth reflecting red what ancient civilization had built this thing i think the machine is energizing the staff with a power weve no knowledge of the power of vril raeder was saying to the others something comes through those pipes in the long tunnel whats the staff for one of the germans asked think of legends and fairy stories remember the magic wand or wizards staff what if they were true i think our forebears wielded these rods of power its dangerous keyuri warned and hard to control said a german who seemed unhappier than the others why are all those bones there kurt where are all the inhabitants weve discovered exactly what the reichsfuhrer sent us here for raeder said ignoring his question what matters is germany hood looked to the shadows beyond the twisted door there was a great ghastly pile of human bones the dead of this civilization in a macabre tableau what the devil had gone on here why was this place so secret so remote so buried touching the staff may be like touching a hot wire another of the germans cautioned or like holding the butt of a gun said raeder most savages would be afraid to pick up a firearm but not all he hesitated just a moment looking at the others then he strode decisively under the brow of the machine stooped and reached for the cradled staff kurt no stop sounding like an old woman julius yet as he reached the humming died with a sigh and all the lights from the staffs they held dimmed he paused somehow youve turned it off one of the germans called like blowing a fuse or cooling a candle so you can touch it this wand wants to be held so raeder hesitated just a moment more and then seized the staff and lifted it clear it shone like amber a beautiful sixfootlong staff of honeyed crystal pulsing like life itself unlike the other staffs this new one didnt cast light but instead purred with it honey and amber flowing up and down its length i can feel its energy raeder reported from my hands to my toes energy for what one of the germans asked its an elixir tentatively raeder moved the staff through the air it gave a hum when he swept it in an arc it hummed louder an odd chord that echoed in the vast room it makes music he laughed unearthly music one said the music of the spheres perhaps raeder told them the music of the cosmos it isnt wicked its beautiful weve come ten thousand miles to a hole in hell for a toy the grumpiest german said this is what franz died for kurt this is what you blew up our only route of retreat for a music stick were going to starve in this cellar while you wave your baton around raeder looked annoyed we make a greater discovery than king tut and you call it a toy a machine bigger than a battleship and you think weve come for nothing youre a coward julius the german flushed but what does it do kurt the man named julius pointed toward the bones and hood shrank into the shadows why is shambhala a catacomb every city has bones look at rome why is no one left to attend the machine were attending it maybe the builders got what they wantedvriland left locking it for the return of the descendants of barbarossa preserving it for us youre risking our lives without careful consideration lets be cautious here experiment test use the scientific method im seizing what i need because the buddhist bitch here fetched her american boyfriend this is not an archaeological dig its a treasure hunt and we may be in a race with the americans and im tired of your criticism muller he pointed the staff at his companion im tired of your reckless leadership and then there was a flash bright as lightning a terrifying crack and with a cry the complaining german went flying across the machine room and crashed into the far wall sliding down he was grotesquely burnt clothes smoking everyone froze in shock the man named julius had been killed his flesh had blackened and peeled the corpse sat on the floor mouth frozen in a gasp of pain and then huge parts of him sloughed off bone hed not just been blasted hed half disintegrated great god one of the other germans cried you murdered muller raeder was white with shock i did nothing his protest hung in the air keyuri stepped back from him except think it he finished in wonder he stared at the staff in his hand but i didnt mean for it to happen it reached out for him at its own accord like your wife eh kurt one of the other germans said shakily raeder rounded on him dont you dare mention lotte the man swung a submachine gun around youre going to fry me too no no dammit i dont know what happened its wicked i told you said keyuri a sword or gun from ancient shambhala its power comes from the deepest pits of the earth the core of the universe and youve no idea how to control it raeder let the staff fall to the floor where it clattered it fired on its own he stepped away i never meant to harm muller i needed him dammit its his fault his criticism his whining he glared at the others none of you can tell himmler i wont have my career ruined it wont be if its really a weapon kurt one of the other germans said youre still a hero if this is what himmler wanted us to find he looked at the disintegrating corpse its too bad about muller but im sorrier about franz if only we had his camera to document this my god a handheld lightning bolt a ray gun imagine an army of these no nation could stand before us hood had been calculating the odds one german had let his submachine gun drop dangling from his shoulder and another had rested a hunting rifle on the floor raeder had shed his own rifle all had pistols on their hips but would he ever have a better chance than this when the nazis were in turmoil over their own fiasco he stepped out from the shelter of the wrecked door pistol leveled and closed the distance as quickly and quietly as he could then raeder fastened on keyuri this is your fault you knew this was going to happen he was tired of moralizers everyone was always questioning whereas his need was to act i did not point the staff he pulled his pistol you should have been a better lover because i dont enjoy your assaults youre going to murder me too he blinked i dont need you anymore hood was within twenty feet freeze he aimed at raeder the germans whirled the muzzle of hoods was pointed at his enemys head raeder looked at him in bewilderment but i blew up the path i dropped in anyway keyuri take the staff she hesitated hurry pick it up and if they go for their guns use that witchcraft on them i dont know how neither did kurt but a man that dared talk back to him is dead how did it feel kurt to have the finger of god hes alone the german said to his companions he cant escape us we outnumber him when i give the word use your weapons keyuri now hans raeder shouted the archaeologist jumped and hood instinctively swung his gun toward him and as keyuri bent for the amber staff raeder grabbed for her and it shots blazed all their light abruptly vanished eldorado mine cascade mountains september present day i t just gets weirder than weird jake said studying the sad heap of bones what in the devil was special agent duncan hale doing in an old gold mine in the cascade mountains with city shoes and a business suit it had to have something to do with benjamin hood my greatgrandfather took him here rominy guessed or forced him here if he worked for the government he should have been on grandpas side shouldnt he lets review what we know jake was squatting thumbing through the papers in the satchel now the businesslike investigative reporter grandpa is recruited to go to tibet he comes back but instead of returning to new york he becomes a hermit up here somewhere theres a child who will turn out to be your grandmother and hale comes calling to lure him out of retirement to find out what he knows what if hale was stealing this satchel what if greatgrandpa ben lured him here or was hiding here or the satchel was here so agent hale comes up the mountain or was killed at the cabin and brought up here carried like a sack of potatoes i dont think my ancestor would do that can you imagine carrying a corpse up that mountain and wouldnt the oss have come looking for him and found benjamin hood and killed him jake stood up thats pretty melodramatic well all we know is that everybody died except your grandmother except maybe she was murdered too eventually rominy shivered so who was her mother who did hood marry you dont have to be married to have a child rominy he stopped shuffling the papers and pulled out a photograph it was a faded shot of a woman standing next to an old biplane in flying helmet and pants take her for example rominy craned to look shes pretty you think shes my greatgrandmother its possible who is she he turned it over it says beth calloway maybe theres more in here about her this is so strange finding people whove been dead so long and having some obscure connection to them not obscure a blood connection blood is thicker than water descent is important ancestry is important dont talk about blood down here its creepy historically it used to mean everything you were who your parents were children inherited the sins of their fathers now genealogy is just a hobby nations are mongrelized race is politically incorrect but blood is who we really are no too confining im talking about family rominy dna selfidentity belonging as an orphan you should understand that better than anyone belonging to a race yes jake politically incorrect you want to know how to become a messiah tell your followers theyre chosen jews bornagain christians muslim fundamentalists it doesnt matter tell them theyre chosen and theyll follow you anywhere you think hitler didnt understand that people long to be told theyre special blood my dear makes the world go round he turned the flashlight so it lit his face from below drawing deep shadows like a halloween mask the trick he said in a deep voice is deciding whos really chosen she looked at him in confusion now he was frightening her who are you jake he turned the light away becoming a silhouette in the dark im a reporter remember i just try to see the world clearly without all the selfcensorship crap that goes on these days we dont burn witches we fire the blunt from media jobs well i speak to truth isnt that what journalism is all about why did you take the battery out of my cell phone what he cocked his head i found it in the trash this morning thats why my cell wouldnt work wasnt it youd taken the battery out i took the battery out because it wouldnt work i was trying to fix it when it was obvious it was really dead i tossed it what you think i sabotaged your phone yes somehow way back at safeway i wanted to call and i couldnt because your battery was already dead how could i get your battery out do i look like houdini come on dont be paranoid were trying to help each other here figure this out together she sighed he was right the battery was dead im so confused jesus im not did last night mean nothing jake she groaned im falling for you rominy youve got to trust me on this were onto something big really big its going to make all the difference come on lets walk back to the shaft we fell down where its light and look at whats in the satchel she was consumed with doubt she was falling for him too at the same time every instinct told her this was way too sketchy hadnt she been wary the first time she spied him but now he looked a little wounded boyish and she still buzzed inside from the night and the morning which instinct was true how did you get that scar what scar on your chin like youve been in a fight he looked at her as if she were a lunatic i flipped my bike when i was ten now she felt foolish she flushed if he was some kind of rogue why was he trapped down here with her deep breaths one step at a time get out of here and then think everything was happening too fast she needed a dayheck a month to decompress to figure out if anything with this guy was real she was falling in love with a man she didnt entirely trust which wasnt smart cubicle girl get gone get focused get clear meanwhile the satchel was a treasure trove maps diagrams diaries photosthe raw remains of a strange truncated life there was a crude drawing of mountains with a bowllike valley with coordinates a diagram drawn in a circle with arrows and boxes and a journal with the title page reading for the heir only jake solemnly handed it to her i think he means you she thumbed through it unable to resist excitement this was real the handwriting was surprisingly neat almost feminine well they did teach penmanship in those days the diary appeared to be about some kind of journey fleeing from some terrible thing but also notes to return there when the time is right and underneath it wisdom before invention maybe this would explain the whole story her old life seemed so trivial jake was peering at the map my god i think hes telling exactly where we need to go go i thought we were already here in a hole in the ground no in tibet to find what he found tibet thats the other side of the world dont you see his death your relatives deaths the skinheadsit all must come back to this theres something wonderful there something huge and its been waiting for you the heir to get into this safety deposit box the heir to find this mineto go find it again were supposed to go to tibet and retrace his journey his eyes were alight hed found his treasure map jake we cant even get out of this mine were going to crumble into bones like poor old duncan hale and some other descendant is going to find this satchel and our stash from summit bank he laughed we havent had time to make a descendant yet actually we have except im on the pill there you go but look if were going to tibet wed better focus on getting out he stood peering up at the shaft she didnt understand his confidence he didnt seem like a newspaper nerd he seemed like a commando im not going to tibet jake im going to where theres a shower they have showers in tibet listen im going to boost you up and youre going to grab that ledge and that root if you can pull yourself up into the chimney you can wedge back against one side and feet on the other and inchworm your way up then what go get help theres rope in my truck youll be back for me by tomorrow morning unless you were really dissatisfied with my performance i dont want to go down the mountain alone well maybe you can throw down a log i can climb out on first step is to get you up there she sighed what choice did they have he was strong surprisingly so and he hoisted her up on his shoulders can you reach just barely try to pull yourself up ill push your feet it was like her worst memory of gym class jake i dont have any upperbody strength try rominy weve got to get out of here she reached straining and he took the soles of her shoes in his hands so she wobbled as she tried to pull herself up into the shaft it felt like a cheerleader stunt she got so her waist was even with the bottom of the hole grabbed a root and pulled her legs thrashed now that she was above his reach arms shaking she was hanging helplessly looking for something higher to grab nothing then it was as if a pin burst her effort all strength left her and she fell back into his arms he sat down hard with a woof i cant jake im sorry but i just cant lift myself her voice shook weve got to try i did try can you lift me but that was even more useless she tried to boost him but he was nearly two hundred pounds of hard muscle and it was like trying to hoist a piano they collapsed together rominy crying they were going to die in this hole they lay awhile panting and then there was the baying of some hounds he sat up listen the baying came closer there was the sound of thrashing brush and then frantic barking there were dogs at the lip of the shaft rominy sat up too drying her cheeks as hope filled her rescue thunder damnation what the hell did you find it was delphina clarkson her new neighbor mrs clarkson were down here jake called that you whatd you do with that girl shes down here too can you call search and rescue i dont need no search and rescue hell id be raccoon meat if i waited for the likes of them i know this hill like my own lazboy she peered over the lip missy he treating you right yes mrs clarkson we fell in accidentally we need help getting out yeah let me tie a rope to this tree city folk a line slithered down jake boosted her once again and this time with something firmer to hold on to and the promise of salvation above she managed to climb once she got her feet and legs working in the shaft it was much easier jake was right behind her hauling himself and boosting her when she needed it while also carrying both their packs and the satchel they crawled out of the hole dogs sniffing and yipping and collapsed the sky a miracle what the devil is down there mrs clarkson asked old gold mine i think jake said we found this depression and wondered what it was and then boom cavein were really lucky you came along ill say what are you doing over here youre way off the trail you know theres a cliff right there she looked at them suspiciously yes maam the dogs tried to lick rominy and she pushed them away i tracked you with my hounds delphina said started with your truck at the trailhead and followed you on up thank goodness but why did you do that rominy asked because youre all over the news missy there was a bomb down in seattle and nobody knows where the heck you went or who youre with be it city slicker here or the taliban you got half the cops in the state looking for you you know that i had no idea everything has been happening so fast she realized jake had never played the truck radio she couldnt even remember if it had one yep youre lucky i had the sense to hunt you men my dogs here well pay you for your trouble jake assured oh no need for that she picked up her shotgun and swung it on them theres a fiftythousanddollar reward out for the two of you she nodded they think you might be terrorists or worse neighbors you are under arrest shambhala tibet october h ood dared not fire lest he hit the woman the germans were under no such compunction and muzzle flashes blazed in the blackness luckily the american had thrown himself flat and bullets ricocheted with an awful whine while raeder shouted at them to stop listen listen for his footsteps sound echoed away hood inched across the floor i think we hit him kurt you almost hit me you idiot do you have the girl no she bit me scheisse wheres the staff i dont know i cant see a thing i didnt know it could be so dark were dead men muller was right shut up shut up listen something rolled across the floor hood snaked on his belly toward it and reached the staff as his hand closed upon the smooth crystal it was as if his finger was inserted in a light socket a jolt shuddered through his arm and he winced the staff glowed illuminating their tableau keyuri was on her belly a dozen feet away the germans turned raeder his rifle on the floor sprang with a knife his boot coming down on hoods wrist that held the the ss dagger swept down to pinion his other hand which held his staff hood twisted as the knife struck feeling a sharp pain in his ring finger and meanwhile losing hold of his gun then raeders boot slipped off his wrist and stamped on the staff there was a bang like a short circuit some mysterious but stupendous energy kicked the german backward and he fell and skidded with a grunt the american picked up the strange weapon in a bloody grip wincing and swept it toward the nazis not knowing what to expect something bright hot and terrifying stabbed out it also stabbed in to hoods injured hand and he shouted there was a boom like thunder and lightning that was blinding the germans shrieked hands to their eyes and ears frozen in the flash it was like looking into the sun then there was a crack on the ceiling and stone rained down slamming against the floor and bouncing the staff and hood went skidding away across the floor shot like a puck his teeth clenched in agony finally it was dark again except his eyes were filled with sparks from the dazzle he could dimly hear the germans shouting and he wondered if any had been hit by the debris what had happened it was as if the staff had a life of its own or as if his thoughts had merged with its properties to eject some kind of thunderbolt if this is what shambhala held he wanted no part of it yet he didnt let go as his night vision returned he realized the thunder stick still glowed dimly light footsteps and someone seized his arm hurry it was a hiss keyuri i have your pistol then shoot them i tried its jammed hood staggered up the third finger on his left hand was hanging by a tendon blood gushing the hand seemingly electrocuted as well as sliced felt on fire meanwhile his gun hand had been stomped on the room echoed with german curses keyuri clutched his arm and forced the tip of the staff to the ground to mute its illumination like an aisle light in a dim theater numbly he followed her pull he thought at first that shed lead him past the bones and onto the main causeway theyd descended but the germans were between them and the door instead she was pulling him toward one of the tunnels that led away from the side of the machine there was the crack of a revolver and a bullet whined off machinery they ducked around a massive metal arm making themselves invisible just as the submachine gun went off with a stutter more bullets pinged and buzzed stop theyre ricocheting toward us but theyre getting away the germans began arguing some more where are we going hood whispered to keyuri where we close one door and open another if you can use that magic staff again they entered the tunnel a stumbling trot taking them along horizontal pipes he looked back there was a faint whitish glow the german light sticks must have reignited hoods body ached and he mentally cursed raeder that madman made a mess of everything theyve gone the wrong way he heard the german cry weve got them trapped leave them another said muller was right this place is evil no i want her and i want the staff she knows more than shes telling keyuri caught hoods arm and they stopped a moment looking back seal us in he looked at her questioningly theres supposed to be a second door a back door somewhere deep inside this underground city use the staff seal us in and well look for it this is legend this is our only chance he lifted the staff again feeling energy surge through it and him his arm shaking it glowed bright and he heard the germans shout and begin to run toward them blood dripped from his grip to the floor gritting his teeth he aimed toward the ceiling of the tunnel entrance another crack and boom the recoil excruciating but then with a rumble a section of rock roof gave way and crashed onto the pipes at the tunnel mouth a cavein that blocked that entrance dust blew back at them grit swirling hoods head ached and his ears rang they were in a tunnel about ten feet high that stretched as far as he could see large pipes running through it at breast height bravo he said sealed us in trapped like moths in a jar and them out for a while the staffs illumination was dimmer than before was it weakened like a battery keyuri pulled at him again and they went on deeper into shambhala wheres this second door he asked i dont know i think this fire stick is losing its power will its light go out i dont know should we run now she pulled to stop him no she wiped her mouth free of a smear of blood he hit me she said when his look was questioning what happened to your hand he clenched his halfsevered finger raeder cut me and the recoil from this devil weapon didnt help either hurts like hell he felt dizzy from the craziness of the last hour how did the shambhalans use these things open your hand wincing he did so she placed it on one of the huge pipes so the damage to his digit was more apparent it was throbbing and covered with blood now kiss me what she was looking at him with her great dark eyes her features fine as polished porphyry her lips insistent her hair still short but growing out since leaving lhasa she seized his head with one hand bent him to her and kissed him fiercely not like a nun but a lover then the pain from his hand seemed to explode and he roared shed chopped with another knife and completely severed his finger god almighty what did you do keyuri im sorry but weve got to bind it give me your scarf she took the white silk reting had given him in lhasa and ripped off a portion using it to wrap and gap where his finger had been and cinching down on the dressing couldnt you warn me his eyes were watering it hurt so bad that would have made it worse she inspected her dressing weve got to get the bleeding to stop or you might faint he sat down hard against the pipes that might happen anyway ive had quite a day he couldnt quite believe where he was probably the greatest discovery in his museums history and hed just deliberately caused a cavein roy chapman andrews would have shot his way out by now she knelt beside him me too she picked up the severed finger i may use this for a blood lock a what the locks of this place like to the door of that main tunnel can be opened only by the right persons blood raeder said he had the necessary blood from a longdead german hero that makes no sense he thinks the germans and shambhalans are cousins aryans hood laid his head back and to think he and i were partners once scientific colleagues i sure know how to pick em hes still embarrassed you fired him ashamed of what he is but unable to change keyuri looked at him her own cheeks wet now with tears im sorry i had to do that to your hand im sorry destiny made you come back here she leaned and kissed him again im sorry you picked me not just kurt but we were meant to be together again benjamin despite the pain he kissed back the communion an instinctual antidote to everything that was going on her lips were full ripe soft everything that was opposite the machine nightmare that was shambhala pressing against her seemed to lessen the pain and then she was pressing against him and he groaned with sudden lust and longing he broke from their kiss panting keyuri im sorry i cant help myself i know youve taken vows you must have me now her voice was commanding insistent i think we may die in here and i want you to make love first for gods sake were in a cave running from a lunatic the tunnel is sealed now ben its important i want to erase the memory of raeder now now please she was crying please to undo what he did to me she was clawing at his clothes unbuttoning his pants and to his own surprise he was responding what was wrong with him she was a buddhist nun this was as crazy as the nazis but of course he didnt care she pulled him down on top of her her robes pulled up knees high hips lifted and in seconds theyd fused she clung and rocked urgently please we may never have time again she was impatient a few thrusts she bucked he finished im sorry you took me by surprise she put her finger to his lips rather than be displeased with his speed she seemed fiercely satisfied pulling him as deep as she could hips quivering as she gently rocked its good at least hed forgotten about his hand keyuri let out a loud shuddering breath squeezing her eyes shut then she reached up to pull him close again and kissed fiercely and then just as abruptly pushed him off her we must go but this was my only chance for salvation thats some salvation he looked at her in wonder what about your vows he already raped me again raeder did the other krauts know yes and no i dont know what does it matter there was sorrow there a profound sense of loss and doom i just didnt want him to be my last now tend to your clothes we have to hurry to find the second door i thought you said you sealed the germans off seems to me we have eternity he looked down the tunnel into the dark to westerners everything is a line to us all is circular look down the tunnel how far can you see its dim the pipe doesnt extend forever it disappears like a ship going over the horizon this tunnel gently curves what does that mean the tunnel is a circle if you walk far enough from this end of the machine you will come to the other like walking around the world the beginning is the end and the end the beginning these pipes stretch to infinity they never end and yet they go nowhere at all is that some kind of tibetan riddle whatever is in these pipes its meant to come back to where it started she said thats not a riddle its a mandala a map of the universe he stood but if this tunnel leads back to the machine yes they can come at us from the other end we have to hope it will take them a while to figure that out maybe theyve given up and weve got this crazy staff raeder would give you up even give me up but not the staff hood took a breath furious at raeder for keyuri all over again but also oddly renewed she hadnt depleted him shed tapped new strength shed recharged him like the machine apparently had done to the magic wand here by blazes was she in love with him still was he in love with her as reting and beth believed what happened to the three of them if they got out of this nightmare but keyuri he sensed didnt expect to okay he said listen for nazis coming the other way the light from this staff keeps getting weaker and ive got a feeling theres not much pop left i think its low on ammo give me back my pistol you cant carry it in your injured hand and i told you it doesnt work he grimaced we need to find that second door then we can destroy the tunnel in the other direction and escape the rock tunnel they were fleeing down had no decoration on its sides and no doors it just ran on and on mile after mile a tube in solid rock the pipes were mute beside it they ran then jogged then trotted wheezing from exertion mile followed mile hood left bright drops of blood on the floor like a spoor trail how long is this tunnel not long enough said keyuri and then there was a burst of machinegun fire bullets whined and pinged as they bounced down the curving tunnel it was a german coming from the other side they were trapped hood clenched the staff better to go down fighting he said i can try to blast with this or maybe hide in the dark behind the big pipe and clobber them youve got your knife keyuri he turned shed fallen down keyuri blood was pooling out beneath her onto the smooth rock floor one of the germans not raeder shouted give it up hood i have a machine gun surrender the staff and i let you live the nazi wasnt coming close however hed seen the explosion at the other end of the tunnel and was keeping a wary distance hood knelt near the nun and gently turned her over the front of her coat was sticky with blood and she was wheezing it looked like shed been hit in the lower lung not instantly fatal but not good keyuri im going to drag you between the pipes and the far wall at least it will protect you from a stray bullet she moaned maybe hell go past us she whispered no hell see the light of the staff how do we turn it off i dont know the beam of a flashlight stabbed toward them the german kept a cautious fifty yards away too far for accurate submachinegun fire but also far enough to be out of easy range of their thunder stick hood i know youre there come out with your hands up if you want to live he called in english come out and we spare the nun he and keyuri stayed silent hiding behind a pipe you cant escape you blocked your own retreat come out american and we negotiate eh do you want the girl hurt hood squeezed the shaft with his left hand feeling the familiar jolt of power his only hope was that he got a shot at the german before the german saw him then the nazi flashlight went out the staff glowed brighter amber illumination peeked from under the piping ah there you are you ran with the wrong man keyuri he led you into a trap why not at least save her she wasnt dead yet im going to surrender in return for your life he whispered raeder still wants you in his own twisted way he may still spare you she shook her head if he does it will be to destroy me slowly he needs to destroy people ben you know that they heard footsteps a heavy tread coming toward them slowly cautiously inexorably dont make me kill you the german called let him come closer she whispered then erase him feisty for a buddhist nun hood rose and braced dreading to have to fire the painful thunder stick again would it bring everything down on top of them then the flashlight came on blinding its cone of illumination fell directly on him and then played over the pool of keyuris blood i see you stand stand the stubby snout of the machine gun gleamed dark and oily in the gloom the german was nervous but excited come out come out its your only chance come out or i machinegun the girl slowly hood put down the staff no keyuri groaned he didnt care the german was too far away a thunderbolt could bring the whole tunnel down on them he had to save her raise your hands climb over the pipes he began to do so the german raised the submachine gun now we finish this and get out of here he nodded and aimed and then there was the crack of a pistol several shots rang out and the german jerked a hole appearing in the middle of his forehead and he slowly toppled backward a tendril of blood ran down his face his torso was punctured too his submachine gun fell with a clatter he sat down with a woof looking at where a new light blazed from the ceiling his mouth opened as if seeing an apparition and now a new voice came down as if from heaven this way college boy and bring baldy there with you eldorado peak cascade mountains september present day y ou cant arrest us mrs clarkson jake said patiently eyeing the muzzles of delphinas doublebarreled shotgun youre not a police officer and were not terrorists which is just what osama binlunatic would say i figure this is a citizens arrest of two highly suspicious young people who seem to be mixed up with bombs and banks and who knows what all and by the grace of the lord my dogs could smell the evil on you when you came up that driveway now march before my finger gets tired and sits down on this trigger but they bombed me rominy exclaimed were the victims were escaping from the terrorists if thats what they are you have to help us mrs clarkson im helping you into a holding cell where you can sing your story to great big guys with buzz cuts and badges move woman rominy was in shock first the cavein and now this shed never touched a gun except for her greatgrandfathers old pistol and now one was being pointed at her the twin muzzles looked as big as manholes jake handed back her pack but kept the satchel and the backpack with the money on his own shoulders then he winked as if this were all part of some game part of his mysterious irritating admirable enviable selfconfidence was that supposed to reassure her he could dig through bones and wink at a loaded gun who was this guy rominy led the way the dogs flanking her with jake behind and delphina clarksons shotgun behind him ill bet you seattle people figured i wouldnt have tv way up here on the cascade river didnt ya their captor said as they retraced their route to the trail you think i never go into marblemount for a buffalo burger and a beer oh yes the safeway bombing is all over the news and miss rominy picketts picture is getting more airtime than a politician with his pants down so im missing right thats what the reward is for and you know what not one newscaster has said anything about some heir of benjamin hood not one newscaster talked about prettyboy newspaper reporters or musty old mysteries you know what i dont think thats your cabin at all so at least i wont be scooped jake murmured whats that i said im glad youre a vigorous news consumer mrs clarkson shut up with your fancy talk they hit the trail again and started down it no amount of reasoning seemed capable of getting the crazy old woman to lower her gun the only good news was that she seemed to have no curiosity about what theyd found down in the mine or what might be in the decaying old satchel she couldnt think past the possibility of a payday rominy tried to calm down once they were in the hands of the police theyd be safe wouldnt they just get dotty delphina to swing the muzzle away or take her finger off the trigger how could she connect with her mrs clarkson im impressed your dogs could track us my dogs could sniff out a brussels sprout in a meatpacking plant and then there was a hiss of something slicing through the air a lethal whisper and a soft thud as it hit damnation one of clarksons dogs gave a sudden jerk squealed and flipped over the shaft of an arrow jutted from his flank where it met flesh the dogs chest rose and fell pumping blood rominy whirled there was a man in the forest who was dressed in camouflage and drawing back a bow his head was shaved with a strip on top like a mohawk indian it was the same guy shed thought shed seen in the cabin window another arrow loosed and then both shotgun barrels went off with a roar next to her ear run jake raced past and jerked rominy like a rag doll leaping off the switchbacking trail and straight down the forested mountainside crashing into brush with his hand on her arm they half ran half plunged down the precipitous slope there was a frantic yelping and cries of outrage behind rominy tensed for the sting of another shotgun blast but none came the gun had swung at the skinhead and then they were far enough downhill that the woods gave them screening that crazy bitch is too old to follow us this way run run run she leaped like a gazelle heedless of obstacles bounding over logs shed hardly dare crawl over in normal times a single misstep and shed break a leg and yet their flight seemed charmed magical even exhilarating as they fell through the forest they came to the trail again which zigzagged the other way but simply leaped it and continued straight downhill in a barely controlled plunge there was another gun blast but far up the mountain faint shouts too step leap step leap as trees flashed past she was not so much out of breath as breathless stunned afraid excited they hit the switchbacking trail again and jake pulled up gasping he was grinning too the bastard geez rominy what was that it was that man what man the man i saw in the window that sobered him its them skinheads come on i thought you said he was a raccoon i thought wrong they ran again but down the trail now jake sometimes drawing ahead but then slowing so she could catch up her legs were jelly her feet ached but she dared not rest what if shotgun lady was chasing them what if mohawk man was doing the same for the thousandth time what was going on jake why do skinheads care about my greatgrandfather nazis they were in a race with hood for something important and these neonazis know more than i thought they tracked us here which means they know about the cabin her eyes darted as they ran every tree seemed to hide an archer or street tough with a swastika tattoo the towering fir and hemlock blocked out the sun casting their escape in shadow the world had become nothing but menace lets cut through here he said i dont want to run into a bad guy waiting at the trailhead they left the path again skidding down through sword fern and salal toward a growing light the road there was a final embankment she almost pitched over but instead slid on her butt hitting the road shoulder in a shower of dirt and gravel her bare legs were a mottle of scratches and dirt jake was already crouched peering up and down the lane there he pointed it was a dusty black suv windows tinted pulled off on the shoulder jakes truck was out of sight in the small trailhead parking lot you think thats their car i saw it before at safeway he started toward the explorer what if somebodys in it if they were theyd already be out the door and in our face by now he trotted up chest heaving and peered through the windows then he jiggled the handle locked what are you doing lets get out of here that is what im doing he began feeling the driversside wheel well and beneath the door bingo he pulled out a magnetic case hikers dont like carrying keys youre going to steal the nazis car were going to steal it because ive got the key for my own truck and i dont want mr bow hunter following us any longer this ends now he can walk out to marblemount if delphina clarkson hasnt finished him we go to the police he unlocked the doors jerked open the door and climbed in waiting for her to join him on the passenger seat the rig still smelled new and had every bellandwhistle accessory that detroit could invent apparently skinhead nazis had money or theyd stolen the car themselves the engine started with a roar no way he shook his head we go to tibet shambhala tibet october b eth calloway had shot the german while hanging upside down from an airshaft that rose from the ceiling of the tunnel a stone door had slid aside to reveal the chimney now she turned tucked her smoking pistol into her belt and dropped lightly down onto the big pipe running to infinity she glanced in both directions any more of them not yet hood said whats down here anyway deviltry he held up the amber staff with his mutilated hand blood dripped from the bandage no good on your lonesome are you what happened we were fighting over some kind of goddamn magic wand ss cutlery is pretty sharp actually keyuri here finished the amputation she chopped off your finger with a kiss he grimaced no wonder youre smitten shes not dead is she not yet wounded though youre going to have to boost her up therere more nuns above nuns theres a nunnery outside the valley with tunnels into this anthill the abbess gave me blood to unlock the booby hatch i just dropped from she said they use blood like a key can you believe that unfortunately yes my surgeon has already saved my finger for that quaint custom he bent under the pipe keyuri help has come were going to patch you up all right the young woman groaned beth stooped to examine her wow thats bad okay im going to use my flying scarf to bandage her up then were going to boost her on top of the pipe ill get in the shaft that goes upstairs and you lift her to me youre saving her life beth you probably saved mine damn right professor so lets move or do you want to spoil my track record he looked up the hole shed dropped from there were torches flickering far above and a halo of shaven figures peering down a well at him clad in scarlet the womens eyes were wide and fearful as gently as they could they lifted keyuri atop the pipe and climbed up themselves then beth leaped for a handhold in the shaft hauled herself up swung her head and arms upside down again and braced to lift the nun hood felt awkward having the two women together hed made love to both of them keyuri however was going into shock and beth seemed intent simply on escaping then the earth quivered slightly there was a clunk a whine and a pale illumination came on in the tunnel below it came from everywhere and nowhere from the rocks and the air and the motes of dust spangling the corridor raeder was starting the machine again hood called up to calloway how did you find us after i put the biplane down i hiked up to that smoke we saw turned out to be this crazy nunnery these nuns stand watch until the time is right the abbess said they were buzzing like a disturbed hive because no one had approached for centuries and then those nazis climbed in like human flies when i told them youd parachuted in it was like announcing herbert hoover had snuck back into the white house they went nuts then we heard this gawdawful noise what the hell do these germans have a big bertha cannon its a stick that shoots fire a fire stick were indians now in our technological understanding theres stuff down here that looks like its out of buck rogers beth heaps of bones too something went terribly wrong ill say is your pal raeder still down there yes i think he just started the big machine again i think it reloads a fire stick a magic staff like this one he held it up i dont think we should let a man like kurt raeder have it ill say well lets start with keyuri ill drag her up to the nuns hood lifted the groaning halfconscious tibetan watching her small dangling feet disappear up the chimney in the dimness it was as if she were floating skyward then beth dropped back down to the hole in the roof of hoods tunnel holding out an arm you next he shook his head thanks for coming back for me but i was sent here to put a stop to this i think raeders going to try to take another one of those thunderbolt staffs back to adolf hitler i dont think i can let him do that how you going to stop him just two krauts left i think then im coming with you ben even odds no this isnt your fight the hell it isnt that bastard dragged my biplane to the middle of nowhere she looked at him expectantly keyuri was shot hood desperate this was a way to cement their partnership no he shook his head decisively i might not make it i want you to take this staff of mine to the surface its too low on juice to fight with but i think we need to show it to the american government wars coming we can leave it with the nuns for a minute we get raeder and then we worry about the shaft no beth i want you to fly it and keyuri back to lhasa im flying you to lhasa listen theres only room in the biplane for two if i dont survive none of this matters if we cant report what happened somebody has to get out alive somebody has to warn the tibetans so they can arrest raeder if he tries to escape overland theres something strange about how this place feels like it does something corrupting so stay clear if i stop him ill come back here if not keyuri and you have to tell what happened and keyuri is shot you have to make her well im no doctor you make her well maybe we can just seal raeder in and maybe hell blow his way out if we let him play with this infernal machine long enough please go up and wait this is nuts it was the end beth could feel it and it tore her in two she liked this guy he was an egghead all right but an egghead with gumption dammit leave the fanatics down here to play with their machine ben if hes got another magic wand what chance do you have if you give this one up wheres your pistol it jammed and keyuris carrying it but ill take the submachine gun of the german you just shot ill get the drop on them ben she was pleading he wearily held up his bloody hand ive been lucky my whole life rich my whole life catered to my whole life and rarely had much i cared about except shooting blue sheep and falling for both of you now ive fallen into something important against a man i know better than anyone kurt raeder and i have been destined to come back together ever since the death of keyuris husband beths faced twisted i dont want to lose you and i need to straighten things out it starts with shambhala this isnt shambhala beth said not this evil power this isnt what the legends promise well whatever it is we need to button it up before all hell breaks loose in the world i was told it wouldnt be difficult for me to kill kurt raeder and i realize duncan hale was right go seal the door until its over save keyuri the aviatrix shut her eyes try not to lose any more fingers i wish wed kept that scotch i could use a swig myself the nuns called down hurry in english at least ive got a flashlight for you in case the lights go out beth handed him one and glanced at his holster and take my pistol no ill have the machine gun i cant leave you unarmed youre the one going to a gunfight and youd better have a backup take it dammit so i can go heal your girlfriend meanwhile ill fix your fortyfive shes not he stopped frustrated thanks he took the revolver a cowboy sixshooter and jammed it in his holster dont get too grateful theres just one bullet left its for you if you get trapped in the cave oh i think ahead he smiled tiredly then he went to the body of the dead german lying in a flower of blood calloway was quite the crack shot with a pistol there were three holes in the bastard he picked up the machine gun lighter and more practical than anything americans had goodbye beth well be waiting she said it without conviction he watched as she climbed up out of sight a stone door slid shut fitting so tight he could barely see the joint how many access points were there then he stepped off down the tunnel to hunt kurt raeder a boeing over the pacific september present day r ominy had never flown business class before but jake persuaded her that they needed the indulgence to rest before the tiring journey ahead and we need room to inspect benjamin hoods lost satchel with some measure of privacy you want to do a treasure map in the middle seat coach since the money shed just inherited didnt seem real shed acquiesced to the surreal oneway cost for the two of them she was betting on jake barrow despite her doubts in for a penny in for a pound his sense of purpose confidence and journalistic mission had cast a spell theyd raced from the cascade river road in a stolen suv taken back roads to darrington and granite falls and driven to seattles airport without stopping shed asked to get fresh clothes at her apartment and hed refused too risky the skinheads might be watching well buy a few things at the airport jake the police are looking for me i cant just disappear you have to for a while how he thought your adoptive parents are retired right in mexico they dont keep track of me close relatives no we just need a few weeks were going to stop at the business center at the airport and set up a new email account write your boss that youre alive mention something only you and he would know youre working on so he knows its you then say you quit what he glanced at her gaze opaque behind sunglasses hed found in the glove department youve got more than a hundred thousand dollars in the bank a deadend job and the adventure of a lifetime as they say on tv do you want to go back to your cubicle an email will save police the trouble of looking for you the money gives you a year or two to look for a job to travel first if you want to see what happens between us and if you decide to bail on me theyll probably hire you back probably not but yes a door had cracked open to freedom it was as terrifying as it was exhilarating she bit her lip all right she considered that doesnt explain the mini cooper email a friend that youve met a guy whos changed your life and youre on a journey of selfdiscovery thats true isnt it i torched your car for the insurance to get some cash to travel with you never thought it would be on the news but dont worry youre safe and happy she blinked at the audacity youre quite the liar jake barrow some is true im expedient you think the cops will buy it no but they get reports about a hundred runaways and messedup chicks a day it reduces the crime to insurance fraud a low priority and even if my truck was spotted at safeway and they find it abandoned up by eldorado well be in asia we go cold case then we come back with the story all will be explained and its bookandmoviedeal time movie deal think who you want to play you this is big it was crazy thrilling absurd hypnotic if you get the story if we get the story to cut all ties and vault halfway around the world liberating irresponsible irresistible i feel like bonnie and clyde not woodward and bernstein im hoping its more like pierre and marie curie discoverers of radium theres a couple of things i have to tell you on the plane im losing my old life jake and gaining a new one hed parked the stolen car in the halfempty lot of a discount storeleaving it here may confuse the police more than the airport garage until were out of the countryand called a cab to take them to the terminal to her objections that she had no passport he produced two proclaiming them mr and mrs robert anderson her first name listed as lilith of all things along with the requisite permits to fly to china of which tibet was now a part i was hoping the story would take us this far he said so i got these from a forger i met on the crime beat a forger jake were going to go to prison not if you hang cool he also had two simple gold wedding bands i got them from a pawn shop and carry them in my car every once in a while it helps to look married when im on assignment what kind of assignment when im focusing and dont want to flirt its just less distraction that seemed unlikely you need two they came as a pairprobably an estate saleand i put one on a photographer once when we were nosing around in a conservative hamlet in the idaho panhandle getting background on a religious sect it relaxed a few sources still living in the nineteenth century so long as your photographer was a woman he laughed right and caroline made me swear not to tell the newsroom so keep a lid on i still kid her about it though the marriage charade struck rominy as almost sacrilegious but they couldnt afford questions at the airport it was weird having him hand her the ring fraudulent and yet touching just for practice jake said he actually blushed which she liked her heart hammered a little as she slipped the ring on at the ticket counter he paid in cash which cost them an extra five minutes while the agent doublechecked the nofly list and yes they only had carryons i wont pay those new baggage fees jake told the agent you guys are air pirates business class doesnt charge for luggage sir its the principle rominy expected her to trip an alarm for an air marshal but the agent only gave a sweet smile have a pleasant flight sir in fact rominy expected arrest at any moment for arson kidnapping auto theft or identity fraud but none materialized instead as she was trying to buy some emergency underwear in the seattle concourse jake nudged her and pointed to four shavenheaded young men at a pub table disturbingly attired in bomber jackets combat boots and tattoos one of them kept glancing her way were they watching so they hastily moved on and shed postponed her shopping until the twohour layover in los angeles buying jeans sweater and parka from there theyd caught the transpacific flight to shanghai and then chengdu china from which theyd fly to lhasa what is it with skinheads anyway she asked as they waited to board why do they want to intimidate people they just want to belong thats the basis of all gangs armies and nations the nazi stuff is rebellious enough to get a rise out of people which is an improvement if youve been poor and ignored your whole life and theres a philosophy behind it an idealism being a nazi look the nazis lost and didnt get to write history hitler told his followers to stick up for their own thats what skinheads believe too so do jews blacks women everyones got a tribe except white guys jake they didnt stick up for their own they tried to conquer the world it spiraled out of control but in the beginning the key nazi philosophers were reformers who believed in selfimprovement discipline classic art and bringing back some of the old beliefs in nature and environment people voted for them did you know the ss had a research division thats why the nazis were sent to tibet heinrich himmler wanted to build a kind of vatican for the ss a camelot or a valhalla at an old castle called wewelsburg just like hitler wanted to make his hometown of linz the art center of the world im not saying they were right but it didnt start with panzer divisions and death camps i think it did start with that i think it was embedded in what they stood for from the very beginning and i think it got twisted which is more believable than a nation deciding to get evil for a dozen years and then get good again she shook her head this was like going on a blind date and learning your liberal agnosticism had been paired with a supplyside creationist just what were his beliefs ive heard of being openminded but this is ridiculous and white guys are the tribe its not ridiculous im a reporter and im trained to look at both sides hey im the one who saved you from the skinheads im on your side but i try to understand the other side so i can write about them what i understand is that they blew up my car which is why were moving on it did feel reassuring to get away from seattle where all this madness had started so did a bloody mary on the first flight two martinis at lax and the welcoming champagne in business class shed fallen asleep soon after they flew over open water and woke up somewhere midpacific it was dark she was hungry and jake had saved her a bag of peanuts dont worry theres another meal in an hour or two she felt groggy and uncertain the intimacy shed shared with jake in the mountain cabin had been overwhelmed by the rollercoaster terror of falling into the mine and then careening downhill from madwoman delphina clarkson and the mohawk bow hunter then sending the cryptic emails from the airport the new clothes paid for from the stash of cash and flinging herself into the void had the destruction of her mini cooper really been less than two days ago instead of her old life they had two backpacks more than in cash a swollen bank account a bag of peanuts and moldy seventyyearold documents taken from a skeleton good sleep jake asked brisk as a butler hed bought some toiletries and looked washed combed and competent though hed left the twoday stubble for that fashionable badboy look that dammit did look good on his strong jaw well she was alive richer and an aisle curtain snobbishly separated her from the coachclass proletariat shed long been accustomed to one day at a time rominy maybe jake was the answer shed been waiting for at least there were no skinheads in business class i need some aspirin actually got em picked up a vial at the airport newsstand hed given her sunglasses and a sun hat to wear at seatac where she was already old news in the twentyfourhour cycle but where her picture popped up once on airport tvs shed kept her head buried in people magazine reading about celebrity calamities that seemed ridiculously trivial compared to her own no one had looked at her with even a flicker of recognition now she was stateless groundless historyless suspended in midair water she ordered from a flight attendant and a gin and tonic maybe adventure would make her an alcoholic i waited until you woke up to dig out the documents barrow said theyre really more yours than mine though i think theyre going to show us where to go in tibet i think were thousands of miles ahead of any pursuit now rominy if we get through chinese customs youre a missing person not a fugitive you wont show up on chinese computers what about you jake what have you told your editors that im on the biggest story of my life and ill be out of touch they cut me slack because im good its only been a couple of days by the time they start wondering about my clock hours ill have the biggest scoop of the year and theyll be drooling pulitzer im the biggest scoop of the year no shambhala is sham what actually i did peek a little thats what greatgrandpa was after rominyshambhala a mythical kingdom in tibet a reallife predecessor to shangrila how many bloody marys have you had the nazis were after it too led by a man named kurt raeder ben hood was in some kind of race for new powers like the atom bomb captain america against hitler and i think they found it or found something according to this stuff maybe thats what agent duncan hale was after too think about it end of the war atomic bombings soviets in berlin the smart ones see a new arms race and so mr hale gets wind that the reclusive mr hood just might have found something that could tip the balance of power he comes out to washington state tracks greatgrandpa down snatches the secret papers but then dies in that mine maybe hood trapped him with a cavein but why wouldnt greatgrandpa share it its his country after all i dont know why didnt he go back to new york why didnt he claim his family fortune why didnt anybody know he was dead for months were a team were going to learn the answers she sighed all right wed better start reading the papers were not in order there was a journal of fragmentary entries and a collection of sketches maps random notes and coordinates there was a crude map of a valley in a bowl of mountains and a drawing of a waterfall there were clippings and torn textbook pages on amps volts and equations she couldnt make sense of with graphs and charts hood had a fine feathery hand but she didnt see how duncan hale or anyone else could make sense of this without her greatgrandfathers verbal explanation there were sketches of some kind of machine with things that looked like pipes boilers and stacks but no indication of what it was for or how it worked it was so incoherent that the notion hed become eccentric at best crazy at worst seemed reasonable shed bought in airline tickets based on this i dont know jake this seems pretty vague it gives us a place to go to no ones had these coordinates rominy coordinates to what a mythical utopia a waterfall to this actually he pulled out one of the diagrams shed glanced at it before but it had meant nothing to herjust a narrow ring a thin doughnut it could be a circular plaza the orbit of some planet or someones design for a wedding band which is it looks like an ancient design for a cyclotron what in the world is a cyclotron an atom smasher he smiled as if his super bowl bet had just paid off okay i give up why are we flying ten thousand miles for an atom smasher you know what they are right they smash atoms she wasnt about to admit she didnt care until now they break them apart so we can see whats inside scientists already have atom smashers now yesbut this one looks to be hundreds or even thousands of years old the principle behind them is very modern very sophisticated to accelerate atomic particles fast enough to smash them you push them along with magnets but it takes a long track to get up to speed like a long ski jump in berkeley physicist ernst lawrence realized that if you could bend the beam accelerating them in a circle your track was essentially infinite they just go around and around faster and faster with enough size and power you could get things up to almost the speed of light so shambhala figured this out hundreds or thousands of years ago at a time when no one else knew atoms even existed imagine that rominy an ancient civilization as sophisticated or more sophisticated than our own there were some primitive attempts at cyclotrons in the s but we didnt really get going on them until the s yet the shambhalans if these diagrams are real had them when we were in togas or suits of armor she looked back at the diagram im sure this would thrill indiana jones why do nazi skinheads care ah when you take little things apart you understand how they work and when you understand how they work you can begin to manipulate them nuclear weapons are the most obvious example once physicists realized that atoms could be split and that energy is released when that happens it was a relatively short step to a bomb even though the details were expensive and complicated neonazis want this to make a bomb what was she mixed up in well the original nazis the s nazis wanted it to make something more controllable than that atom bombs are kind of indiscriminate it would be nice to have such firepower that could be aimed if youre a mad scientist if youre trying to defend your country when i started reading about your greatgrandfather i stumbled onto all kinds of theories and legends about tibet heinrich himmler and secret expeditions yet all of it was just that stories until i found you then we discovered together this satchel of documents hood was the guy who was the key but he died and left clues only for his heirs who have had a disturbing habit of dying off until you only because hed saved her life in that safeway parking lot the nazis killed my grandma and birth mother maybe maybe buddies of agent hale killed them because the us government wanted this secret covered up they didnt know what hood had hid so they just discouraged any attempts to find out heck it took me a long time to track you down thats why it was so awkward in the grocery store i didnt know how to start this conversation hi baby can i talk to you about nazis but if weve got cyclotrons theres no need for an old one right tibetan holy men have always been reputed to have magical or supernatural powers what if those rumors have some basis in science our atom smashers are designed to break things apart but this one according to nazi legend was designed to put things together to reassemble energy in a new way how do you know all this im a science nerd like i said he took her hands in his rominy have you ever heard of a secret power source called vril shambhala tibet october t he noise of the great machine was growing louder a rising whine more powerful than any sound hood had heard before he advanced down the tunnel cautiously grateful it was lit but also feeling exposed at any moment he expected another german to appear at the tunnel horizon from the other end maybe with a bizarre staff that would fry him like the electric chair but nobody appeared they were waiting in ambush for him no they were preoccupied the circle of pipes was several miles in extent and it took him an hour of cautious walking to get from shambhalas back door to the machine room where hed first caught up to raeder at the end of the pipeline tunnel he crouched and crept the mp ready until he had most of the big cavern in view at the far end was a heap of rubble where the other entrance of the circular tunnel had been caved in by hoods thunder stick the main hall was still littered with rock from the blasted ceiling bones were tossed about like confetti and the horribly mutilated german whod triggered raeders wrathor at least the wrath of the weirdly diabolical staffstill sat halfdisintegrated against one wall raeder and the other surviving german were at the machine a staff reinserted in its cradle the weapon was pulsing amber and presumably was being charged the two were arguing shambhala did not seem to induce harmony hood stepped out submachine gun in hand and walked toward them raeder had another staff in his hand the american saw it too glowed lets try this again hood said drop your weapons the germans turned momentarily disconcerted but then regaining their poise ah you found that the tunnel doesnt go anywhere raeder replied yes now were back as we were except what did you do with keyuri your henchman shot her ah too bad and you shot him something like that its gotten a little crazy has it not benjamin hood we have here i suspect something more valuable than the gold of el dorado he shook his staff and instead of rejoicing were fighting why is that because you want to give it to a bunch of bookburning nazi lunatics hood gestured with the muzzle of the machine gun youre finished kurt am i under whose authority the tibetan government sent me here to get this power for themselves its their country isnt it so i repeat hands up and what proof do you have that you work for anyone but yourself hood i have the machine gun what happened to the staff you already stole it went cold keyuri is spiriting it away thats what i think we still have a destiny she and i and i have something entirely different from your primitive gun reichsfuhrer ss himmler called it vril and it makes that toy in your hand as obsolete as a stone club i have a weapon as quick as thought itself and just as mobile i think therefore i destroy he lifted the staff slightly imagine a tool that doesnt hammer on reality but rearranges it thats what i feel when i hold it benjamin ive gotten hold of the fabric of the universe itself dont make me pull the trigger will you really shoot me down like one of your museum specimens just like you fried your own man there hurled against the wall the other german looked at raeder nervously raeder ignored him who really sent you the chinese the americans what faith they have dispatching you all by yourself were both scientists kurt they sent me as a fellow scientist to steal discovery alas i got here first and he raised the staff to point it so hood fired the m spat the barrel climbing slightly as he fought to control the unfamiliar weapon it stuttered like the guns in the gangster movies shells flying like flung coins raeder should have been cut down instead there was a blinding flash a boom as loud as bells in the belfry of a cathedral and the whine of angry hornets hoods bullets flew all around the room anywhere but at raeder having been deflected by the force in his crystal staff the american meanwhile was cuffed backward by power like hurricane wind flying off his feet and skidding on his back against the pipes the sound of raeders shot gonged off the walls before rolling away into a throaty rumble the air crackled as if thered been a bolt of lightning it tasted like ozone more rock rained down from the ceiling and bounced off the floor the other german wincing ive no idea how it works raeder called or what it can really do if it hadnt had to deflect the energy of your bullets id guess youd be dead by now so lets just finish what i started and bring the curtain down hood scrambled for cover in the tunnel raeder aimed the weapon at the tunnel mouth a thunderbolt flashed again and the cave quaked the tunnel ceiling shattering and rock dropping down as hood rolled under the pipes it smashed onto the second entrance of the tunnel burying it stray fragments bounced out across the floor of the main chamber and a cloud of dust shot out the great machine itself seemed to shift gears and whine higher oh i do enjoy that energy even if it hurts hood have i killed you for gods sake kurt lets go the other german urged silence hans do you realize that at this moment im the most powerful man in the world diels lifted his own staff no youre not this one is charged too we both have vril then go make sure hes finished none of this slaughter would have happened without the interference of that damnable hack scientist and his nun keyuri lin has my comrades blood on her hands the german archaeologist walked warily into the cloud of dust the vril staff throbbed in his hand casting light but everything was obscured by the fog of the explosions i dont see him diels called escaped buried or trapped in the tunnel then help me puzzle out this machine its running higher and higher and im worried it will race and break with the tunnels sealed we can work in peace diels turned weve buried the piping at both ends maybe its running too hot then lets try inserting another staff to absorb its power we dont know what were doing kurt we should walk away from godlike power then there was the bark of a heavy pistol and dielss forearm shattered he screamed clutched it and dropped his staff a figure rose out of dust and rubble emerging from a pocket under the pipes hood was gray with cave dust rock scratches bleeding the submachine gun ruined beneath the rocks he hurled beth calloways nowempty revolver over dielss head at raeder who instinctively ducked instead of lifting his vril staff hood charged and dove for the other one diels grasped too screaming as the american rolled onto his injured arm raeder couldnt use his staff without incinerating them both then the other german was knocked away hood rising to his knees his captured staff swinging around twin thunderbolts met the world went white it was like a twin star exploding two radiating coronas of energy there was a shriek from diels as its fury caught and dissolved the ss man shredding him and throwing the spray of his body against the walls what hood and raeder felt encased in the energy of their own staffs was far different a pulse of dark energy punched through their bodies but lit them with a glow that was a transfiguration that infected every cell and corpuscle their air was sucked out then punched back in they were blind from the flash and yet could feel the granular texture of time and space itself they saw a shimmer of force fields and fogs of particles a part of the universe beyond normal human perception the machine was rising to a scream as it accelerated in the cluster of pipes that led to the red glow below something broke and steam shot upward in a geyser at last raeder ran in fear something was being unleashed he didnt comprehend he retreated up the ramp that led out of this underground city hood wearily pursued half staggering since every nerve seemed on fire the irradiation of staff energy was painful exhilarating numbing his senses had been heightened yet ached at the entry of the machine room where the great door had been knocked askew and the bones piled he turned back and aimed his weapon at the machine a jolt shot out and there was a bang more pipes punched and broken wire unspooling the machine whined higher he didnt want nazis toying with this monstrosity again then the american was running up the central ramp following raeder there was an explosion ahead and a rush of cool air when hood got to the circular mandala door he saw it had been blown to pieces raeder was somewhere beyond on the surface of shambhala hood trotted out his body not just tingling but almost sizzling a boil of electrons alive with a strange new music was this what death felt like was he dead but no he could see his own flesh but it had a weird radioactive glow he was translucent as amber where was the mad untersturmfuhrer it was night the roof of the valley ablaze with stars the snow glowing silver the waterfalls iridescent lines of pearl the entire valley was quivering from the tremors theyd unleashed he could hear the rising shriek of the machine far far below how to stop this madness before it escaped into the world how to ambush kurt raeder before raeder ambushed him and then he had an idea he ran down shambhalas main surface avenue broken ruins rising to his left and right the walls snaggletoothed and sadlooking had its inhabitants buried what was too terrible to have in the open had they fled when the energies they unleashed proved uncontrollable or had they made something they needed and simply returned to the stars then there was a crack like a thousand whips being swung at once and light seared by him and boomed off a valley wall the whole cauldron shook snow and ice broke off the surrounding glaciers and avalanched down bringing rock with it raeder had taken a shot at him hood turned and swept his own staff back at the ruins letting loose a rippling sheet of fire that played over the devastation and turned the uppermost ramparts into shrapnel thunder rolled and reverberated it was a battle of demons then he turned and ran again down the river that ran through shambhala he was making for the narrow slit of a canyon where raeder had dynamited the only path sheer blocking cliffs rose in front of him a thousand feet high in the night it looked as if the river disappeared into a cave so dark was the canyon but he knew the cleft was like a sword stroke in the edge of a shield he waited as the noise of their vril shots grumbled away trying to hear raeder over the rush of the river where was the german hiding then he turned toward the gorge and lifted his staff summoning every ounce of his will into bringing down those canyon escarpments he pointed and thought the universe seemed to flash into rebirth light blazing his arm snapped broken and the staff flew wide sailing into darkness he roared with pain the rock walls that gripped the river fractured and leaned precipitously but didnt fall one more but he didnt have it his staff had broken on the boulders by the river all the light had gone out of the amber crystal his arm was shattered his hand once more gushing blood hood turned to face the valley the ground was shuddering from earthquakes below and there was grinding as the machine in the deeps kept accelerating into overdrive i still have the machine gun kurt he yelled to give away his position by the damaged cliffs it was his bravest lie i can still shoot you and then the biggest corona of all pulsed out toward him the earth shook like a shocked muscle and the mountain shattered a boeing over the pacific september present day n o jake i have not heard of vril unless thats the new cleanser that cleans the bathroom so you dont have to rominy was smart but she didnt spend her pretty little brain cells worrying about nazi power sources at least not until now its a fictional name a kind of code for what german theosophists hoped might be out there somewhere german what just guys who provided some of the intellectual underpinnings of national socialism the creed of hitlers party it did have a philosophy you know you bet blow up the world in the s many highly educated people took race and evolutionary theories quite seriously after darwin it seemed selfevident that if you wanted to improve the human speciesif you wanted it to evolvethen you bred the best with the best people do exactly that every day they want to mate with the prettiest or the smartest or the strongest or the richest the nazis simply thought you could apply that common sense to the group master race aryan supermen sore point for jews and vril did i miss that oprah episode she glanced out the window the view over the pacific looked exactly as it had hours ago god it was a long way to china it sounds goofy like looking for a way to turn lead into gold or the legend of king arthurs sword excalibur yet for thousands of years humans believed in a much more spiritual world than we do in which gods or ghosts manifested themselves then along came science everything opposed to science was labeled superstitious heresy and ideas of exotic power sources like vril were dismissed until modern physics came along cyclorama cyclotron but its not just particle accelerators or atom smashers its our whole concept of the universe now some people think the nazis were on to something maybe himmlers lewis and clark expedition to tibet wasnt so wacky after all maybe vril or whatever you care to name it really exists and you think benjamin hood discovered this maybe you know what an atom is rominy jake i am literate bear with me it was the greeks who came up with the term they looked at the world and saw that big things could be made of smaller things buildings out of bricks beaches out of grains of sand and even sand could be ground down into dust or flour tiny and tinier but was there a point at which things couldnt get any smaller such a fundamental particle they proposed could be called an atom this was a moment in which women learned to humor men you nodded as they held forth and if you were really interested in the guy you could smile in amazement or widen your eyes if guys were smart they learned that the inverse of this seduction was to pretend to listen sympathetically while the girlfriend kvetched about her day and then rub her feet barrow plunged on it turns out the greeks were right there are fundamental particles called atoms they come in nature in about ninetytwo sizes or weights and out of them you can build anything we see in the universe its like how you can make any englishlanguage book from just twentysix letters or any song from just eight notes you take the atoms of the periodic table and you can make anything but heres the problem by the beginning of the twentieth century scientists knew atoms werent the smallest thing after all do you know what they believed was smallest the unholy heart of ronnie hoskins my twotiming high school boyfriend he laughed hey im being serious here ill say electrons protons and neutrons their number in an atom controls the type of atom it is now were down to everything being made from just three things amazing she widened her eyes but then they wondered what would happen if they smashed those particles together boys do that with trains it turns out theres smaller stuff still quarks and there are at least six varieties of those neutrinos muons leptons a whole bunch of stuff physicists call a particle zoo there are separate families of particles called tribes its bizarre and confusing a quark is a thousand times smaller than the nucleus of an atom and remember i said thats just a pinprick of the fuzz we call atoms more than percent of an atom is empty space jake this is sweet but why are you telling me all this because it drives physicists crazy theyre romantics they believe the universe is not only simple at the tiniest level but that it needs to be simple to be aesthetic and neat and religious and right they want to explain the whole shebang with a single equation so short you could fit it on a tshirt like emc exactly that explains the relationship of energy to matter that theyre two sides of the same coin but then scientists have found four basic kinds of energy too the weak the strong electromagnetic and gravity it drives them crazy i certainly hope so at these smallest levels everything goes woowoo a particle can be in two places at the same time it can move from one spot to another instantly without traveling through the intervening space oh come on even worse is that all of the universe we can see all that beautiful stuff that shows up in the hubble telescope photos isnt everything in fact it isnt most things scientists think more than percent of the stuff that makes up the universe is matter and energy we cant see or even detect its called dark matter and dark energy earth to jake what does this have to do with nazis so some of the nazis believed in an energy source called the black sun buried at the center of the earth woowoo right except not entirely different from our ideas of dark energy an energy so mysterious we cant even detect it how do we know its there somethings driving the universe apart faster than it should that thing has been labeled dark energy and you take these physicists seriously this is real okay so now theres this idea that theres a smaller particle still something a trillion times smaller than an atom called a string its a onedimensional line meaning its so small this string has length but no width she groaned wheres my gin and tonic and then when this string vibrates it creates everything everything the way a vibrating violin string creates music music isnt stuff this music is its all the stuff all the energy why cant i hear it its not real music rominy were talking metaphor but you can hear it too since if these vibrations make everythingif theyre really the fundamental building blocks of atomsthen they made this jet and your ears and the air the engine noise travels through its like the music of the spheres the music of the cosmos she shifted in her seat feeling something hard in her pocket poke her in the thigh and nazis wanted the music in essence yes what if you had a violin bow that could play these tiny tiny strings and in so doing manipulate reality in ways we could barely imagine im not talking just lead into gold im talking matter into energy and consciousness into action and space into time and time into space im talking extra dimensions because string theorists think there may be a dozen or so were not even aware of besides the usual four im talking about walking through walls and teleportation and well magic the tibetans believe in tulpa s or beings created by conscious thought that we can think things into existence if we understand how the universe really works im talking about extraordinary abilities that the smartest people in the world searched for over many centuries wizards alchemists priests and kings it would be like the bow of god he looked at her expectantly adolf hitler wanted to play these strings no hitler and the nazis had no idea they existed there were these legends of vril but no one in germany had an idea what it really was or how it might be controlled but since then weve had all these amazing discoveries in physics and suddenly this crazy s idea sounds more plausible what if an ancient civilization somehow figured this out centuries ago or some alien civilization came down to earth what if shambhala was a research center think about ittibet is the highest plateau on earth the closest to angels and aliens a natural landing point for a visiting civilization what if someone at some time figured out how to play the music of the cosmos to draw a bow across the fundamental strings you think this is what my ancestor and the nazis were after yes she thought these strings are really small right i mean were talking about tiny violins teenytiny so this is a tiny bow like im not going to pick it up with my fingers i dont know my suspicion is that they forged a great big bow that could play very little strings you know whats come down to us in legends and stories is the idea of a sticka magic wand or a wizards staffwith magical powers like gandalf exactly and not just fictional wizards cardinal richelieu carried a wand of gold and ivory his enemies thought had special powers newton was entranced not just by science but by alchemy and magic and hunted for ways to transcend normal material boundaries nikola tesla thought there was a connection between the mental and physical planesmind over matter if you will what i think is that these legends have some basis in reality that shambhala devised very big toolscompared to subatomic particlesthat could play this subatomic music and control the natural world with what we would call magic what if they really existed what if they still existin a hidden city that your greatgrandfather found jake this is starting to sound a little bigger than a newspaper scoop a little scarier too and a whole lot crazier conceded but maybe my weirdness makes a little more sense to you now i seemed crazy because the story seemed crazy until your car blew up thats when i knew this was real and you had to be protected i can protect myself she said automatically even though the idea of a protector was not entirely unappealing sorry i mean you needed a partner a friend she glanced down at the sheaf of diagrams you think the skinheads are after these staffs of shambhala yes or at least after the idea that theres something to the shambhala legend rominy sat back thinking she didnt know if she was sitting next to a lunatic or einstein but then a thought occurred she knew what had poked her thighthe empty bullet cartridge shed found on the floor of jakes pickup behind the seats its meaning hadnt been clear but all this talk of big things and microscopic things had jarred her memory she let her fingers touch it next to her leg but decided against pulling it out instead she remembered its size it was small smaller than she imagined most bullet shells to be in fact the shell was the right size to hold a bullet that would make a small hole just like the one in barrows rear window when they were being chased on the freeway what was the shell from such a bullet doing inside jakes cab had that gunshot come from assailants she never saw as she was mashed down on the seat or from jake barrow himself should she challenge him on it okay but i still dont get it jake you got me to go along get the safety deposit box find the mine and retrieve the satchel thats my part as the heir right why do you need me now he smiled putting his hand on hers covering where that gold ring burned on her finger cant you tell ive fallen in love with you lhasa tibet september present day l hasa gave rominy a headache but then it gave almost all firsttime visitors a headache at nearly twelve thousand feet it was one of the highest cities in the world yet its dizzyingly perched airport was still tucked in the valley of the infant brahmaputra river the runway surmounted by taller mountains that glowed like green felt the sky was a deep blue and clouds drifted overhead like galleons the topography was so steep that she and jake had to take a tunnel to get to lhasas neighboring valley golden willows and cottonwoods bordered gravelly rivers lines with flapping prayer flags were stitched from tree to tree like cloth graffiti telegraphing prayers to the eternal buddhas peered down from niches in cliffs painted ladders symbolized ascension through reincarnation toward the final grace of nirvana tibet was a jumble of time there were more oxen than tractors in the barley fields the stone houses with small openings looked like fortresses compared to the glass expansiveness of american homes and they were enclosed by adobe walls instead of white picket fences yet their geometry was more proportional and pleasing than a mcmansion with trapezoidal windows walls alternately whitewashed or the color of the earth and prayer flags fluttering from the four corners there were bands of black and ocher at the eaves of the roofs the tops flat because it so rarely rained the sun burned with an intensity never felt in sealevel seattle everything was crisp the clarity defeating attempts at perspective because there wasnt enough haze to judge distance shadows were intensely black rock glittered even the facial bones of the tibetans seemed sharp like their mountains their skin the color of the earth if you wanted to contemplate the workings of the universe this was the place rominy had expected lhasa to be backwardly quaint but the city was a burgeoning carcrowded metropolis of more than people in which native tibetans were a minority han chinese had flooded in to dominate tibets capital the potala palace was as awesome as jake had promised an otherworldly edifice of more than rooms but opposite were the huge concrete parade grounds beloved of totalitarian states complete with a musical electronic billboard pedicabs jockeyed with honking taxis there were billboards for budweiser beer shops for italian clothing and stores full of glistening motorcycles and mercedes the chinese communists invaded tibet in jake recounted and by the dalai lamathe one who was just a child when benjamin hood was herehad to flee into exile the same guy has since become a global celebrity but we can get into the potala as tourists while he cant as regent the wars and upheaval are said to have killed more than a million tibetans meanwhile chinese have moved in so you have this country thats half traditional and half modern everything put on overdrive by gogo capitalism ruled by communist dictatorship even now if border guards find a book with mention of the dalai lama they confiscate it you seem quite the expert ever since i got on the ben hood story ive been reading about tibet some of old lhasa remained east of the potala around the goldenroofed jokhang temple the barkhor neighborhood of historic buildings and markets sustained sights and sounds kurt raeder might have encountered in here the streets were narrow and winding jammed with booths with cheap clothing and globalized souvenirs the smell was charcoal braziers and cypress incense a single stall of scarvesa brilliant bank of pinks reds purples and yellowswas a detonating rainbow they like color dont they said rominy wait until you see their temples in the rectangular plaza in front of the jokhang men and boys flew kites that looped and dueled in the blue breeze trying to slice each others lines on the foothills to the north the sera nechung and drepung monasteries clung to the hillsides like oldman eyebrows limpets of medieval glory overlooking the modernist bustle below and around the mount of the potala a constant circuit of pilgrims shuffled in a clockwise direction called a kora turning prayer drums and working their rosary mala s jake and rominy checked into the shangrila hotel if were traveling incognito isnt the name of this place a little obvious she whispered nobody knows were here said jake besides we wont stay long but you cant just run around china willynilly you need a guide with permits i emailed ahead to a booking service and they found one lastminute which probably means no one else wanted him great it wont matter we just need his paperwork he turned back to the desk clerk a room in the back please and yes double not twin rominy didnt contradict him in their room jake hugged her take some aspirin and a nap to help acclimate to the altitude im going to pick up a few things in the market and will see you for dinner t heir guide was an american expat in khaki cargo pants rei hiking boots and a torn led zeppelin sweatshirt a geniallooking nobody of the kind rominy had spent half her life meeting at seattle coffeehouses and passing over as amiably directionless they all seemed to have the goals of a fourteenyearold play hard this one had made a living of it guiding in tibet but if what jake said was true theyd drawn the bottom of the barrel he was travelershaggy with a mop of dark hair that hadnt seen a shower for days a weedy beard and just the beginning of beer pudge he wore peace beads at neck and wrist and had a sweatstained camouflage booney hat from ll bean he wandered into the restaurant tapping an iphone absentmindedly bumping the tibetan waitress sam mackenzie he said sliding into a chair at their table and offering a large horny hand hear youre looking for an expert jake gave rominy a sideways glance bob and lilith anderson he replied we need someone to get us to the kunlun mountains none of the tibetan guides seem anxious to go there so the travel agency suggested you the kunlun heck you want to see mountains i can show you several from the sidewalk what do you want to go to the kunlun for theyre kinda off the beaten path my friends and i could show you two entire mountain ranges from seattle mr mackenzie but we flew halfway around the world anyway rominy said we want to see mountains not everybodys seen before mackenzie considered her cute fair enough better than because its there yeah i might get you to the kunlun i got the permits to go through the chinese checkpoints i got the toyota land cruiser i got the maps its a trek however late in the year your butt will have calluses from the washboard road and youll eat so much top ramen youll think youre made of monosodium glutamate its actually kind of a long monotonous rugged wheezy kidneykilling trip a mountains a mountain but hey youre right the kunluns are special high higher and highest he smiled encouragement youve been there jake asked close enough he waved his hand i can get us wherever we need to go can we fly sam laughed if you want to play tag with the chinese air force this is tibet not topeka mr anderson nobody flies who doesnt have the permission of the communist government no private planes so you get off the main highway and the roads are tracks and you get off the tracks and the roads are trails aaa is one hell of a long ways away there are no doctors no search and rescue no gas stations and no bushes to pee behind if you pardon my french mrs anderson i get the picture yeah the tibetans who guide theyre not anxious to go to the kunlun takes a long time theres nothing there except old legends and enough ice to restock canada they tell ghost stories about the place the kunlun mountains are two thousand miles long do you care which kunluns you see yes we have coordinates to a specific place jake said the western half of the range approaching the hindu kush im a writer and were following a historical mystery the guide squinted from under his hat i love a mystery what is it wed rather not say so what exactly are we looking for id rather not say i see mackenzie considered them and then scratched his chin yep the kunlun are a sight to behold if you want mountains theyre an outstanding example but a trip like this is kinda pricey im thinking a couple thousand yuan a day or three hundred bucks he waited for protest and getting none plunged on and gosh we could easily eat up three weeks getting there and coming back so thats what six thousand ill give you ten thousand dollars jake said cash sam blinked really plus money for supplies if you can do it in less time you keep all the money if you know a shortcut by all means take it if you want to pack something besides top ramen ill give you another thousand dollars to do so rominy was alarmed at how jake was burning through her money even if it was necessary to hire such people and get the rugged trip over with but then the cash didnt seem real anyway it felt more like theyd robbed summit bank than withdrawn money from it but she made a sudden decision that night when he was asleep she was going to peel off of their bankroll for emergencies and keep it in her own pack and not tell him shouldnt she trust a man she was sleeping with she did mostly but she wanted some things for herself like the khata scarf from the cabin tucked near her heart like a good luck charm you must really want to see those mountains mackenzie said were tourists in a hurry sam gotcha he looked from one to the other youre not really mr and mrs anderson are you were whoever we tell you we are listen i dont care but i dont want to squirrel my deal with the government i mean the guiding is supposed to go to tibetans but i kind of grandfathered in and get the yank jobs no one else wants youre not spooks are you and no guns right i dont want to see the inside of a chinese prison tourists sam just like our visas say awesome well he looked at them uncertainly then shrugged and stood a thousand bucks for supplies you like beer i could bring some beer along bring whatever it takes but we need two axes two shovels a pry bar and two thousand feet of climbing line if you can just rent some of it great rent for how long three weeks i thought you said theres something at these coordinates right we hope by the way does your iphone work here i dont hold it to keep my ear warm the chinese have much better reception than the states theyre leaving us in the dust man we bicker they build this country is so smart its scary india too everyone has their turn in the sun can we leave first thing tomorrow sam squinted again whens first thing eight he frowned sounds good but maybe nine would work better ten if i have trouble rounding up supplies ill meet you in the courtyard and the money barrow counted six thousand in american hundreds into sams hand the guides eyes going wide he stuffed the wad in his pants glancing around the restaurant to see if anyone else was watching the other five when you get us there and back jake said and a bonus if we find what were looking for a report to the chinese police if you screw us sam saluted you got it bwana lhasa tibet september present day m ackenzie didnt show until eleven a delay that left jake fuming their guide explained hed been assembling supplies enough for armageddon or at least for the absence of convenience stores in northern tibet the odometer on the faded white land cruiser indicated hardwon miles but sam assured them the rig was indestructible taliban seal of approval man its storage area had been expanded by putting down half the backseat and it was crammed with jerry cans of gasoline camping equipment food water beer a spotting scope a camera two board games a frisbee and coils of brightly colored climbing rope inserted into the pile were the digging and prying tools jake had asked for as we drink down the beer well buy more jerry cans with gasoline theres a station about four hundred miles from here and then well turn off into the backcountry i tried googleearthing where you want to go but that part of the world is pretty fuzzy as near as i could tell theres nothing there thats exactly what were hoping youd see jake said it will explain why were the first to see it sam cocked his head i like your logic man they inched through stopandgo traffic to get out of lhasa and then broke out onto the main highway mackenzie demonstrating an apparent belief in the assurance of reincarnation by recklessly passing crawling trucks on narrow twisting roads he did seem to handle the fourwheeldrive vehicle well and popped in a cd of bemusing buddhist folk pop he enjoyed telling them more about tibet what you got is the most religious country on earth ruled by the least religious country the spiritual versus the material the next life versus this one so theres tension man and more machine guns than scarface whenever chinese poohbahs fly in for a visit its too bad you know whats cool about tibet is that theyre not like everybody else that they had this theocracy and their own laidback spiritual thing and now comes china which is desperate to keep its billionzillion contented by giving them the western good life you want the story of the twentyfirst century were driving through it cant they coexist somehow rominy asked thats what the chinese say and they do to a degree the commies have allowed the monasteries to reopen after decades of suppression because tibet is a great tourist draw not just for westerners but for the rising chinese middle class but is south dakota run under the precepts of the sioux nation the dominant culture dominates so i dont see an end to the tension anytime soon the chinese are just waiting for the dalai lama to die and with him the last hopes of tibetan independence but hasnt some of the change been good for tibet asked jake roads power water manufacturing i suppose i dont know if its made anyone any happier jake looked out the window you cant stop progress you can bitch about it though sam mackenzie thought his clients were more than a little eccentric what was the pretend marriage gig in this day and age but he was accustomed to getting the oddball americans the tibetan guides didnt want and heading off to oddball places the tibetans didnt want to go the tibetans had families to come home to and sam just had himself weirdness was his business what he didnt like was complicated baloney now that were out of town and set to camp together for three weeks who are you really mr anderson shouldnt we level with each other jake considered i guess it wouldnt hurt im jake barrow a newspaper reporter from seattle and thats rominy pickett whos been helping solve an old mystery concerning her family its a genealogical quest where were going has meaning to her sam looked in the rearview mirror you have family that came to tibet lilith i mean rominy she glanced up from some old papers she was studying i guess so im sort of here for my roots interesting most of sams clients came to check off another global experience on their bucket list bagging enough buddhas to fuel entertaining dinner party conversation back home digital slr with fullmotion capability sunglasses propped on hair spf sunscreen sacred strings tied around wrist a tantric tattoo or two altimeter ipod kindle pedometer compass watch good to one hundred meters underwater boots with more pieces to their assembly than the space shuttle down fleece goretex and a determination to rough it once they got over their disbelief there wasnt a power outlet and a portapotty round every bend those tourists were okay they came they looked they paid more problematic were the seekers of enlightenment the buddhist devotees and questing christians who desired desperately to break free from desire and preferably do so sooner than their friends or neighbors so they could brag about it the worst of them were spiritual snobs contemptuous of anyone who didnt share their particular muddle of mysticism guessing ahead as to which buddha statue was which like a bright child eagerly lifting its hand in class sam had quested too but then seen it through the eyes of too many fellow american pilgrims and now he didnt think you had to fly to enlightenment or that high elevation produced anything but lightheadedness but if you played along complimenting the women without flirting and hanging with the men without pretending to be their equal the seekers might leave a good tip for a week you became their confidant and then never saw them again to the relief of both parties this pair was different barrow seemed about as religious as a hedge fund trader shorting the investment trash hed sold his clients something about the newspaper tag didnt sit right mackenzie had gotten drunk with journalists and this one was too what smooth and free spending he had a wad like a mafia don the girl was oddly tolerant of jakes bullshit having perhaps been well and truly fucked one too many times she was bright but in lovea disastrous combinationand was probably convinced her dude was deeper than any dude could ever be in sams considered opinion any attractive woman who preferred her own feckless companion to mackenzie charm had by definition terrible taste in men rominy was pretty and if andersonbarrow wasnt around sam might have a go at her but there was more to their oddness barrow spent money with the ease of a man who hadnt really earned it and both of them seemed after more than family memories they were going for their precious sam guessed and the guide worried what their reaction would be when they inevitably didnt find it there was nothing in the kunlun which is why lhasas tibetans didnt want to go there travel often disappointed and when it did some people took it out on their guide meanwhile barrow passed the time with dorm room philosophy what makes us happier is the real question isnt it jake said after staring out the window for a while money flush toilets enlightenment what did you come for sam god didnt find him but i stayed for the people the third world is homey you know the germans came here in the s did they now he hated it when clients tried to lecture him the nazis and i guess they tried to sell the tibetans on some kind of alliance but the gap was pretty wide and then came the war mackenzie decided to humor jakes trivial pursuit the krauts came to tibet ill bet that went over big lets be friends with crazy adolf jake laughed the weird thing is hitler did some good things in germany they could have used here the autobahn employment the volkswagen i dont think tibet needed an autobahn in the s since they had no cars and i dont recall hitler doing much good mr anderson i mean barrow jake thats because its the victors who write history holymoley sam thought was this guy a holocaust denier wouldnt that be fun to prattle on about for the next three weeks so why didnt hitler stop with the volkswagen sam asked in his most carefully calibrated neutral guide voice what was his thing with the jews psychologists have had a field day jake said matteroffactly hitler the prude a grandfather who had some illicit affair with a jew hitler the mamas boy the doctor who cared for his mother when she died of cancer was jewish there are rumors young adolf contracted syphilis from a jewish prostitute that he was insulted by a relative of the jewish writer kafka when he was down and out in vienna that he was in love with his niece and got twisted over her suicide or murder that he only had one testicle and some freudian thing was going on i go with the niece theory nazis just werent good with girls were they actually most were happily married if anything they were socially conservative familyvalues types hitler didnt marry because he thought bachelorhood made him more politically appealing the messiah there were more than a few germans who thought that not that theyd admit it afterward you too of course not i just study the period rominy puts up with it jake calls it openminded she said from the back and what do you call it sam asked nutty she flipped a page and jake laughed youll be sorry you got him started sam i admit it barrow said i like to argue sam didnt like jakes casual confidence because he was jealous of it the other thing about the tourists he guided was that they were usually paired like jake or rominy or bonded in some mountaineering fellowship they always belongedeither to each other like the three musketeers or to some place back there where theyd come from and where theyd return to they were anchored they had careers money or the expectation of it maybe family at least friends facebook something and sam the drifter the broken home kid the college dropout stung from one too many dumpings by indifferent rattyhaired girlfriends and one too many lazy betrayals by selfcentered traveling mates and with one too many fuckups from one too many drinks or joints or dumbass decisions had only secretly sensitive sam for company his very own self indivisible with liberty and restlessness for all reduced to accompanying people he didnt know and sometimes didnt like for a fee like a craigslist whore what the hell was he doing with his life driving to outer bumfuck and trying to make conversation about nazis driving belongers around barrow he thought gave all the signs of being in some kind of tight fraternity a letmechallengepoliticalcorrectness nerd who sam decided was annoying as hell rominy he liked but adolf cant get over his own private frustration sam challenged so he kills six million jews and six million more besides poles russians gypsies retarded people homosexuals freemasons i mean come on lets assume he did barrow said mildly some people think he was possessed by the devil hitlers own explanation is simpler he was gassed during world war i and said he had a vision while in the hospital of saving germany he thought jewish financiers and leaders had cost germany the war you defend this guy i try to explain him unlike most people ive actually studied him if we could understand hitler maybe we could understand anyone even ourselves good luck with that yep barrow was a smug little prick or maybe jake was just fascinated with the third reich like any number of people who pause to look at accidents tour torture museums and walk the gravel of old concentration camps you know whats funny sam asked he goes after the jews and gets israel be careful what you wish for thats why im laid back man why the tibetans are laid back mind your own business and look after your own soulif everyone did that the world would be happier right thats what jesus said thats what john lennon said one crucified the other shot that doesnt make them wrong no but their world would be medieval john lennons world would be medieval their laidback world i suspect would have no land cruisers barrow trumped we wouldnt miss land cruisers if we didnt have them sam said doggedly its a long walk to the kunlun mountains we wouldnt miss the kunlun mountains look said jake ive studied hitler because where were going is where the germans went in im curious what they found curious what they were looking for rominy here is an heir to someone who got wrapped up in it all an american explorer so the more i understand about the nazis the more idea i have of where they might have gone the kunlun they went to nowhere central man they went to where theres no there there he glanced at barrow you really got the hots for hitler dont you i just think he was complicated like everyone and interesting like everyone complicated thats an interesting way to put it what if he was an idealist in his own way driven into wars he didnt want thats not how i heard it went down bro yes get real jake rominy chimed in dont be provocative just to be provocative a lot of people followed him for some reason barrow sounded defensive im just saying if you want to make sense of history lets understand what it was not parrot cowboyandindian dogma about who was right and who was wrong sorry amigo i saw the movie the nazis were wrong thats my point all youve seen is the movie holymoley hey you want a picture of some yaks sam pointed time to change the subject before he got too steamed rominy was in the backseat trying to ignore the debate of the men while sifting through the satchel documents again the more she read them the more she came to believe that benjamin hood hadnt written them the script was in a feminine hand and the maps and diagrams had a vagueness that might come from someone getting the information secondhand from memory there were no measurements or dimensions no logical depiction of a machine with interlocking parts the entire packet was impressionistic could that mean it was myth that they were chasing a fairy tale or did it mean that someone like the woman pilot in the picture had befriended ben and taken his dictation or descriptions beth calloway a good deal of the journal seemed incoherent more a collection of notes than a narrative or diary there were names kurt keyuri beth ben was her greatgrandmothers name beth rominy considered maybe calloway and hood pursued the nazis together beth flying a plane so they get back to the cascade mountains and beth tries to make sense of it all maybe hood was disabled but the journal was riddled with question marks arrows and blanks as if it were a jigsaw puzzle only half put together maybe rominy could put it together here in tibet maybe she was supposed to finish what her greatgrandmother started maybe the journal would make sense in shambhala concrete united states september s o this is where the elusive benjamin hood has gone to ground thought duncan hale special agent of the office of strategic services his agency had been created in the cauldron of the recently concluded world war ii and had absorbed his old army corps of intelligence police ive arrived hale thought backwater usa it wasnt until the end of the war that hale had realized the necessity to start tracking the man hed sent to tibet eight years before rumors of hoods discoveries had been fantastical and his disappearance perplexing the millionaire had gone mad most thought and withdrawn like a hermit crab somewhere into the american wilderness then with the wartime explosion of science the fantastic had become commonplace the german vs jet fighters the atomic bomb and suddenly an anonymous letter had arrived that made the strange rumors more compelling just what had benjamin hood discovered in the nether reaches of tibet and would any of it be of use in this new uneasy embrace with the bearlike soviet union with the help of the fbi banking records had led hale to this tiny burg at the edge of the known universe the aptly named concrete washington now as he stood on the train station platform near the junction of the skagit and baker rivers hale could look uphill to a oneblock downtown that slumbered under a haze of morning mist and coal smoke with gas rationing still in effect not much moved on the roads the war had ended only three weeks before but a new more dangerous war the oss believed was just beginning with the red hordes of the soviet union it was time to learn what ben hood knew and make sure nobody else could learn it hale burdened only with a briefcase walked uphill to state bank of concrete flags and bunting from the recent vj day celebration still hung from houses and no service personnel were back home yet yet the sense of relief after a bad depression and worse war seemed as palpable as the sweet smell of the surrounding forest the bomb had ended the thing and ushered in a whole new world there were even rumors of turning the oss into some new kind of permanent intelligence outfit hed heard the russians were throwing their weight around just like the nazis had and america was going to have to respond hale knew he might be wasting his time on benjamin hood the guy was a crank giving up a family fortune to live like a recluse on some stump ranch hoods trip back in had cost the government next to nothing it irked hale that hed never gotten much credit for yoking the playboy for all the heavy lifting and nothing had come of the nazi expedition near as he could tell it was as if tibet had swallowed the whole lot hoods disappearance had been small brew in a world hurtling toward total war so hale hadnt thought much of ithe had a war to winbut when the japs threw in the towel after nagasaki the old mystery came back hed received an anonymous letter raising all kinds of interesting questions had hood perished in central asia or had he gone to ground like some crazy hillbilly hiding out like some kind of goddamned draft dodger to let the others do the fighting for him more important had the curator found something that could be important in the coming struggle was hood trying to hide some terrible secret terrible secrets were what duncan hale liked to find picking up hoods faded trail hadnt been easy the american museum of natural history had no contact since his family assumed him dead and his inheritance had passed to his brothers thered been brief talk of giving hood a posthumous medal so the department could take credit for another secret mission except no one was quite sure what the mission was or what it had accomplished the germans were no help either their archives silent on tibet except for some enigmatic hints from people like goebbels himmler was dead a suicide after trying to sneak by the allies in disguise so was most of the ss ancient history except duncan hale never forgot anything he tried military records first then social security and then voter registration and census data no ben hood it finally occurred to him to try banking records that was a needle in a haystack except the fbi had required reporting of abnormally large deposits to keep tabs on spies during the war tucked in a card drawer from late was a deposit of a tidy sum at the time the depositors name was calloway but there was a crossreference noted to a caucasian whose former address was lhasa on a hunch hed called up the bank the deposit had been made in another name benjamin hood bingo so now hed come out to the mossshrouded ass of the earth to find the happy hunter himself hood had gone from a corner office overlooking central park to a shack in the armpit of the cascade mountains this when you had enough sitting in the bank to buy a nice house and an inheritance back home worthy of a rockefeller it didnt make sense and duncan hale didnt like things that didnt make sense he showed his credentials to a teller i need the address of one of your depositors the bank president a fellow named henderson came out to confer a visit from a gman to concrete was unusual indeed this hood he live around here hale asked upriver quite a few miles cascade river i understand we never see him what do you mean you never see him isnt this his bank hes a hermit except theres a woman living up there too and a childnone of it sanctified by marriage im afraid maybe he doesnt want us judging him in any event he never comes downriver we see miss calloway once in a while shopping for groceries and supplies and who is miss calloway his housekeeper girlfriend they have joint custody of the account have you ever seen ben hood why no i havent im sure my employees have is there something hes done or not done look if i go upriver can i find him im sure you can everybody knows everybody up there just approach carefully upriver folk are possessive of their privacy and some shoot first and ask later ill be careful he thought this womanshe ever talk crazy what do you mean about treasure or knowing something secret or having to hide things from the world she doesnt talk at all a real tightlip for these parts goodlooking dame but nobody really knows her you think shes some kind of axis spy he put his hands up laughing dont start that rumor the wars over buddy no no not a spy just some anomalies on a tax form he winked what on a tax form mistakes and thats just between you and me the gossip would be from one end of concrete to the other by suppertime he knew which was just what he wanted thanks for the help your government appreciates it well henderson puffed proudly glad to serve hale picked up his briefcase just one more thing you said there was a kid yes a girl by rumor daughter i assume she should be in school by now but the district hasnt seen her ah ill ask about that too there are laws he tipped his fedora good day to you mr henderson and good day to you hale stepped outside breathed in the clean air and looked at the patriotic bunting concrete was probably a nice place a decent place it was too bad about the kid he walked to a garage where hed been told he could rent a car bought a county map and asked some directions then he slipped in the front seat opened his suit jacket and checked the load on his colt m automatic the oss issue was light deadly and small enough that it was said gangster bonnie parker taped one to her thigh to break clyde out of jail sweet little gun time to tie up loose ends as hale drove off the gas station attendant looked again at the card given by an oddly pale stranger whod shown up in town the day before asking where a man might rent a car the fellow didnt rent one but the business card came wrapped in a onehundreddollar bill a staggering sum now the attendant mouthed the number picked up the phone and cranked for the operator he was going to report who did rent a car the kunlun mountains tibet september present day n ine days after leaving lhasa the trio of americans stiffly got out of a land cruiser that had been transformed from white to brown from dust and mud thered been three flats and one broken water pump all patched by sam pavement had turned to dirt road and dirt to rocky track they jounced down jumbled dry streambeds and ground through the gears to creep up snaking passes rominys heart almost stopped as they crept over a ropeandwood suspension bridge hung across a precipitous canyon water shining a thousand feet down had the germans come this way later the wind cut like a knife on one particularly high pass there were still patches of dirty snow from the winter before and the smell of new autumn storms in the air beyond were a vast basin and then the white wall of the kunlun now they parked directly below those remote and lofty mountains to their left ran a cold river gray with glacial silt theyd picked up its trace where it sank into the sands on the plain as they drove toward its source the river became loud and vigorous originating in a waterfall that plunged hundreds of feet before running white down a slope of shattered rock the escarpment ahead was otherwise as sheer as a fortress wall its black rock cliffs topped by slopes of ice and snow theyd come to a dead end this is where you want to be sam asked jake studied his gps unit if the coordinates from the documents are correct yes instruments werent as good in those days but hood and calloway had navigation skills their guide turned and surveyed the landscape behind a pitiless plain ahead precipitous mountains chill gray sky and lonely wind scenic if you like eastern wyoming whats beyond that waterfall never been here man im feeling pretty cocky i got you here at all this is pretty intense its not like we can call for pizza no sam we cannot he took out the binoculars and studied the cliff rominy what did hoods satchel say about the waterfall that there was one low on the cliff with a canyon above it this looks different from the drawing jake the falls seem much higher im not sure were at the right place wed better be in the right place he studied the falls as if willing them to look like he expected weve come ten thousand miles to be in the right place there was silence jake was the one who had used his gps to direct them here so sam finally asked we just going to hang out is this what you came for we could camp by the river rominy said i came for the history of the kurt raeder expedition of jake finally said were going to climb that cliff and see whats on the other side you dont mean we the literal way right sam said its like the royal we meaning you weve been sitting on our asses in that land cruiser for nine days the exercise will do us good ill lead the way jake i cant climb that rominy said i think i see a way up well fix some ropes and just whats so fascinating on the other side sam asked jake considered the guide before answering debating how much to confide shambhala he revealed if the stories are correct shambhala sam groaned come on were not here for some shangrila legend are we i could have talked you out of that one over beer in lhasa ill tell you when i look over the top of that waterfall sam shook his head tourists jake smiled guides you cant get decent help these days why dont i just wait with rominy down here its not safe to climb alone besides i feel better having us all together were united on this right rominy she frowned looking up the falls ive never felt so far from everything sam is there anything out here no but im getting paid to humor your boyfriend hell see for himself well come back down and console ourselves with rice krispies treats and baileys sugar makes everything go down gear up mary poppins jake said once more the eversurprising mr barrow seemed to have a good idea of what he was doing they each took two coils of line heavy but reassuring and a hammer with some spikes jake called pitons well string a rope across the worst pitches its mostly a scramble across rubble wont be too bad and it wasnt at first the three of them ascended alongside the roaring plunge of the river staying just outside the mist that coated the rocks with frost it was mostly like climbing a steep staircase but eventually they came to sheer pitches or stretches of cliff where they couldnt boulderhop their way jake went ahead driving pitons and shouting down to sam until a length of rope was secured that was their handrail with it rominy found the courage to climb higher the last two weeks had carried her a long way from her confined existence as cubicle girl theyd been camping in the tibetan wilderness fixing tires pouring fuel out of jerry cans and speculating under the stars she made love to jake in their tent his anticipatory happiness calmed her and his wacky historical and scientific passions were tolerable he was very bright shed fallen in love with him too but hadnt confessed it yet nor had they taken off the rings your boyfriend looks like hes done this before sam remarked as they waited for jake to lead a pitch above hes climbed in the cascades back home she said for a journalist hes a jackofalltrades all this for a story he thinks it could make his career looks like hes got a hell of an expense account he found me an inheritance im helping hmph sam looked skeptical how about you how about me what do you do when youre not retracing nazi footsteps im a publicist i spend my days promoting bugladen software that will be obsolete six months after we sell it im like dilbert oh he unwrapped a piece of gum want some no thanks he put it in his mouth to chew howd you two meet she pulled back her filthy hair he kidnapped me after my car blew up mackenzie looked at her questioningly like she was joking oh kay its a long story i guess you know this guy well two weeks and you come all the way to tibet with him wear a wedding ring and pretend to be his wife like i said its a long story dont you find his nazi crap a little weird he just likes history mackenzie made her defensive he talks about them like they were normal somehow like he could explain them who does that man i asked him what he wrote for the paper and he was real vague he just seems a little off you know you seen his stuff she was annoyed sam mackenzie had no idea what had been going on no meet his friends visit the paper trust me we havent had time but this guys on the level right hasnt he paid you well so far zing well thats the thing most guys your age are backpackers roaming asia on the cheap theyre always trying to bid me down or trying to write a check or cursing at the cash machine at the jokhang for not giving them what they want because they dont really have it and jake pulls out all this cash he shook his head i guess thats impressive that he got you to give it to him but unusual too you know she flushed unexpected inheritance but he spends it we spend it okay i mean im cool with it i just just what want to make sure youre okay she spread her arms other than being perched on a cliff in the middle of nowhere im fine see sorry i just cant talk about everything dont worry its nothing illegal no drugs were looking for my greatgrandpa and greatgrandpa was a nazi he was fighting the nazis okay thats cool but it wasnt completely and the look he gave bothered her because it reignited her own doubts that bullet casing the cell phone battery but jake had been kind to her a hundred times this trip gentle caring loving sexy able confident it was like a checkoff list from cosmo so why hadnt she admitted she loved him because he was guarded he only revealed what he wanted to reveal because he was eccentric because to be honest sometimes he seemed too good to be true guys werent like that because hed given her his charm she sensed but not his heart and because if she were honest about her own heart she was here for herself not him it was an adventure she was curious she wanted to do something to be something that wasnt just as addalong to some guy that wasnt the same as love jake called down ready and up they went again in all it took three hours at last they neared the brink of the falls the last scramble the steepest jake impatiently disappeared over the brow of the cliff and then sam wearily rominy dragged herself over too were they about to see the oddities depicted in the satchel of diagrams a cold wind cooled her sweat when she stood blowing out at her from a broken canyon jake was staring as if hypnotized his arms dangling his shoulders sagged sam mackenzie had already slumped to rest on a boulder puffing above them a ravine continued to climb toward ice and clouds but its edges were uneven and the rock a lighter color as if great chunks had broken loose and tumbled down ahead seen through the fractured gorge was a bowl of bright mountains shimmering with snow a perfect stadium of peaks and in the middle was a lake the water was slate gray and opaque from it ran the river twisting through a broken barrier of boulders before dipping over the falls rominy went to where jake was standing he was staring shocked clearly this wasnt what he expected to find theres no shambhala jake she touched his shoulder he twitched like a wary animal they dammed the canyon he whispered who dammed the canyon they made a lake it flooded the valley it flooded shambhala i dont see a dam we just climbed up it its a rock dam an earthfill dam not a concrete one look he pointed up to the lightercolored rock they blew out the canyon walls and it came down and plugged the river whatever was here is underwater it looked like other alpine lakes shed seen in the cascades and olympics but rominy decided not to contradict him if he wanted to believe some kind of lost utopia was under the water fine with her but if the coordinates were right they werent going to learn more about benjamin hood and jake didnt have his scoop now they could go home to what how much of a couple were they now that the quest had ended you mean this happened sometime after she clarified or even during maybe this is why hood slunk home to america and hid maybe he spoiled what would have been the greatest find in archaeological history the tone was bitter you mean he was embarrassed by whatever happened here i hope he was embarrassed if there was a shambhala and he drowned it maybe you could come back with scuba gear maybe he walked back to the brow of the cliff to the south were the plains and mountains theyd already crossed an immensity of emptiness far below their parked land cruiser was a tiny toy vultures wheeled between them and that bottom so it aint here mackenzie asked told you so he thought to himself jake ignored him looking all about he glanced at the lake but didnt seem inclined even to scramble the final distance to its shores instead he suddenly stiffened and pointed bringing to rominys mind for a moment one of delphina clarksons hunting hounds his head turned to them and he smiled smoke the nunnery of the closed door tibet september present day t he nunnery that jake had spotted was a hunkered quadrangle built like an old tibetan fort a stone outer wall twenty feet high grew organically out of the rocks on a steep ridgetop that jutted like a tongue from the kunlun mountains the wall undulated with the terrain to enclose a temple sleeping cells and kitchen the wall and utility buildings were gray while the rectangular flatroofed temple was the red ocher of the potala palace the buildings turned inward from the worldall doors and windows opened onto the courtyard not the harsh environmentbut prayer flags rose gaily to the apex of a darchen like lines to a maypole golden finials marked the temples four corners it was from this refuge so earthtoned that it was invisible from any distance that smoke emanated what the devil are buddhists doing way out here sam jake asked their guide contemplating the universe he shrugged usually the monasteries are near villages ive never heard of this one an unlikely location jake murmured unless there is a shambhala getting to the nunnery was a tricky traverse halfway down the rock dam theyd already climbed and then sideways to meet a goat track that led to the protruding ridge a squall swept down from the mountains first blowing gritty dust and then when the sky darkened rain mixed with snow the dust and ice bits stung the americans hoods up looked like pilgrims themselves the gate so old its wood seemed petrified looked firm enough to withstand a battering ram but it was the design upon them that startled rominy strips of brass had been laid to make a pattern of interconnected squares woven together so that each led to the other it vaguely reminded rominy of an escher drawing of endless staircases leading up and down at the same time an illusion that tricked the senses but thats not why she found it arresting it was the same pattern etched onto the gold coins left in benjamin hoods safety deposit box what does that symbol mean rominy asked that infinity sam said you see it everywhere in tibet just like you see swastikas at times theyll take symbols like that and weave them into more complicated ones like a sun wheel jake raised his eyebrows and gave her a glance rominy shivered in the damp hoods souvenir gold coins werent a clue to a north cascades gold mine they were a reminder of this nunnery a sign theyd come to the right place the americans were wondering how to contact the residents inside when the gate suddenly swung open of its own accord and scarletclad nuns beckoned them into the courtyard that promised shelter from the wind a returning sun made the puddles on the cobblestones shine and steam the two young women who greeted the travelers were not at all surprised at their visit from this aerie they could have seen the land cruisers plume of dust for miles and followed the americans antlike assault up the rock dam yet so artfully was the nunnery situated that it was invisible from the base of the waterfall it watched without being seen the heavy gate swung shut behind them the nuns spoke and as always rominy struggled even to pick out meaningful syllables dga bsu zhu sgo brgyab i think it was welcome to the closed door sam said but they opened it and closed it again jake said after the hike and rain rominy was trembling with cold the nuns beckoned them onward to the temple inside a single shaft of light shone down from a clerestory at the ceiling the perimeter was shadowy lit only by the flames that burned in lamps of yellow yak butter the lamps werent enough to make it really warm but it was drier and warmer than outside rominy shivered and a young nun slid a red woolen cloak over her shoulders which she gratefully wrapped around her a huge bronzecolored buddha the bright paints of its decoration faded by decades of time and lamp smoke rose toward the clerestory its flesh as round and robust as a planet in front was an altar with seven sacred silver bowls of water and sculptures carved from butter as transitory as life itself to the side was a pillared seating area the wooden benches softened by pillows they were directed to sit kha lan sam offered thanks steaming cups were brought rominy sipped it was milky broth strange but pleasantly hot and rich butter tea sam said yak butter has the protein and fat to keep you going some people cant stand it however jake had put his aside anything warm is heavenly rominy said im so discouraged weve come so far for nothing not necessarily jake said why is this nunnery even here yeah maybe we came for this experience said sam these nuns are friendlier than scientologists trolling for converts at a singles bar we lucked out their eyes adjusted to the gloom nuns were silently stitching and weaving great skeins of yarnyak wool she guessedwere heaped in corners the colors were brilliant and she wondered if the handiwork was sold in lhasa to support the nunnery she assumed they must have gardens or fields somewhere but how did they get even the most basic tools to such a remote place were there no monks after tea the day fading the americans were beckoned with gentle pantomime to rooms in the adjoining dormitory each cell had two cots and jake and sam were given one room and rominy another the nuns making it plain they were expected to spend the night supper was barley cake tsampa s and dumpling momo s and then thugpa a noodle soup the flavors were plain and pastelike to western palates but the trio ate greedily the nuns pleased with their appetite everything was dim and medieval there was no electricity only butter lamps when the americans finished the nuns withdrew and they were left to sleep on cots of woven leather the only mattress layers of thick woolen blankets rominy thought the strangeness would keep her awake the next thing she knew it was morning they were given broad bowls of warm water to wash in and then led outside to a courtyard bright with highaltitude sunshine the snowy crowns of the kunlun mountains soared above the nunnery roof vultures majestic from a distance wheeled through the vault of heaven sky burial sam whispered as she watched them traditional tibetan practice is to dismember the dead and put them on a rack for the vultures to devour its considered divine recycling it seems appropriate here rominy said like letting them go to the sky through the birds theres more sky here than in seattle sam closer sky youre beginning to see why i stayed she wondered if jake minded that she was talking more to sam the guides questions while uncomfortable had made her feel he cared her boyfriend didnt seem to notice it would have been selfishly satisfying if he had but jake seemed a million miles away with his thoughts he dreamed of lost cities a hooded woman head bent was crosslegged on the paving and they were directed to sit on the stones before her the americans awkwardly crossed their legs several nuns in a semicircle behind then the central figure lifted her head hood falling away like the others her skull was closecropped its irongray hinting at her age her face was lined but kindly a regal grandmothers face with the high cheekbones and deepset eyes of her people my name is amrita she said in accented but fluent english you have come many miles to the closed door you speak our language jake asked in surprise we cared for an american generations ago and decided others might eventually be back your return has been foretold the american taught us some of her tongue and were not entirely isolated i was educated in lhasa and beijing she so it was beth calloway and not benjamin hood rominy asked yes but where was my greatgrandfather shambhala we never met him this was disturbing news then shambhala is really here jake leaned forward where is here mr barrow yes we looked at your identity while you were sleeping is paradise a place or a state of mind is the journey to reach it an outward one or inward he sat back disappointed i know youre on a spiritual journey but were on a physical one rominys greatgrandfather and it appears her greatgrandmother came here and saw something we climbed to where we thought shambhala might be and found only a lake if it doesnt exist so be it but i want to know if it existed for real not just in fable your definition of reality and mine are not the same she looked at them closely but not unkindly in turn but ill show you another door to satisfy your curiosity the real closed door may or may not open it may or may not give you what you need to find sometimes not finding is as important as finding rominy said you need things to end yes beginning and endings the western goal the eastern illusion come they entered the temple again butter lamps flickering the air tanged with incense and smoke the buddha vast and hazy as a dream amrita led them around the statue at the back of the temple was an ancient black iron door set in a wall of stone it looked crudely hammered but immensely strong from her cloak she took a ring of big medievallooking keys and inserted one in the lock it wouldnt turn she addressed jake this is the first closed door mr barrow we never have occasion to open it and so the lock is rusty do you have strong fingers strong enough to get me this far he wrenched there was a grind and a clunk and the metal door was pulled open squealing on its hinges even though the temple itself was chilly the air that wafted out at them was noticeably colder and moist their breath fogged weve been the gatekeepers for two hundred generations but what we guard is very different now do you have electric torches yes then descend she looked at jake be careful what you seek i dont seek it for myself they stepped forward on the other side of the door stairs hewn out of mountain rock led downward in a spiral like a castle tower it was utterly dark below i must close the door behind you to keep out the draft amrita said knock when you wish to return and with that the iron door swung shut shutting with a booming clang they jumped well thats cozy sam muttered this feels like frankensteins castle and shes frau blucher youre a very skeptical guide sam jake said lapsed converts turned doubters are the worst i came for enlightenment and got statuary and yak tea i think im homesick im paying you enough to get you home and you hired me to take you as far from it as we can get well i trust her rominy said you trust everyone said sam they crept down their flashlights providing a fan of light in places they passed lovely carvings in the surrounding stone a graceful script reminiscent of tibetanits not the same sam informed thementwined with flowers beasts strange machines and largeheaded people in flowing robes the basrelief gave a threedimensional quality so that the plants seemed to be blossoming from rock these carvings werent done by nuns jake said shambhala is real so who did do them sam asked ancients or aliens who knew more than we do dont you think i like the vines and trees the greeks believed we began as happy plants and devolved into our unhappy animal and human form getting farther from the divine as we did so the farther back you went the better things were they thought the ss who came to tibet thought that too that the distant past wasnt something we escaped but a paradise of adventure and power wed lost i dont know sam said an ancestral vegetable sounds even worse than an ancestral monkey theres something peaceful in being a carrot rominy said not on a salad bar then the walls would get plain again suddenly one wall disappeared and the americans found themselves on an exposed stair at the side of a huge shaft a hundred feet across it rose higher than their flashlight beams could probe there were dark openings on the other side and bats fluttered when jake banged the edge of his flashlight on stone ventilation shaft he guessed bats means there has to be an opening above this was for shambhala my friends its huge said rominy which means shambhala was huge i smell water sam said were going to hit your lake barrow they carefully wound down the shaft the staircase having no railing to keep them from falling then it wormed into the mountain again a horizontal passageway ran on into darkness like the shaft of a mine more stairs continued down down first said jake the stairs ended a hundred steps farther at water dark and still there was no landing the steps just continued into the deep its the lake jake confirmed he drowned shambhala who drowned it rominy asked your greatgrandpa but why he shook his head who knows look at the dark lines on the walls sam said you can see how the water rises and falls with the seasons jake looked frustrated we need a submarine into that better you than me buddy this is as big as machu picchu or angkor wat well do it eventually maybe grandpa made the lake to bury whatevers down there rominy said maybe it was something dangerous or evil or something invaluable jake sighed its still a find ive still got a hot news story benjamin hood drowns a city is that why he became a hermit maybe he tried to hide what he found rominy said they were quiet the water opaque then jake pointed back the way theyd come theres still that horizontal shaft last chance lets check that out they climbed back to the passageway and followed it the shaft ended abruptly at a massive door again a riot of decoration but this time cast instead of carved as if the door were made of bronze the material was dark and swallowed light however and was unlike anything theyd ever felt it wasnt quite like stone wood metal or plastic another dead end sam said jake seemed transfixed not necessarily doors open theres no handle or keyhole rominy said jake let his fingers trace the vines sculpted into the door or its a different kind of lock he followed them down a tangle of flowers to a basrelief of an anatomically correct carving of a heart an artery was a tube with an opening like a flower as thin as a fine vase but firm as steel this is weird sam said his palm to the door do you feel that this substance kind of tingles rominy put her hand on the door it seemed to vibrate in response like a purring kitten it almost feels like its alive she agreed which raises the question of just what life is jake said at what point does matter allied with energy become life is energy itself life do you know our brains chemistry throws off enough electricity to power a small lightbulb so talk to it barrow open sesame wait i recognize these designs rominy said this door was drawn in the papers from hoods satchel maybe this is the way into shambhala the closed door why would benjamin hood have drawn this jake nodded and pointed blood lock he said pointing to the carving of a heart blood what asked sam according to my research the shambhala of legend devised a means by which doors could be opened only by a specified individual who was identified by drops of his or her blood the germans who came in brought a vial of blood with them for just that purpose they didnt understand how such a thing could work but today we know about dna and how each of us has a unique genetic code whats interesting is that access could thus become hereditary a descendants blood might contain the very same key he looked at rominy a greatgranddaughter perhaps he slung off his pack and stooped to put it on the floor groping inside his tone had become businesslike which explains rominy why youre really here what do you mean he pulled out a knife and slid the blade clear from its hard scabbard it was a wickedlooking twinedged weapon with an eagle on the handle and twin lightning bolts on the pommel some german words were etched onto the blade what the fuck said sam i mean that i hope we found what weve been looking for after all jake looked up at the woman he said he loved with a face drained of all expression im afraid i need your blood shambhala tibet september present day a re you crazy rominy was looking at the blade with wide eyes it wasnt a hunting knife it was a dagger the kind you used to kill people lets cool the jets here barrow sam said his hands raised in alarm i think youre overdosing on the exotic culture man jakes face was dead as a zombie his tone clinical and i think weve finally found what we hired you to help us find sam he used the other hand to pull a gun from the backpack and rominy gasped this is only a but i assure you that at this range i have the skill to make it lethal so you can stand in the corner there and shut up mackenzie or i can shut you up in my own efficient way he had the remoteness of a lab technician sam took a step back just dont hurt the girl bro im not your brother but shes the greatgranddaughter weve been seeking why it was all rominy could think to say the blade looked as big as a sword we wont know until we open it will we but someone very very important thinks some thing that is very very important was hidden here which is why i had to find and seduce you youre going to cut her for a newspaper story for crying out loud are you both stupid enough to think i was really a journalist ive never been in a newsroom in my life rominys mind was reeling her eyes hypnotized by the bright dagger blade was everything a lie if id allowed you a way to contact the seattle times rominy youd have learned in a minute theyd never heard of me he said matteroffactly so you did take the battery from my cell phone i used a magnet to disrupt it first and removed the battery later ive appreciated that youve given me the benefit of the doubt since youve had quite legitimate suspicions fortunately weve been in a bit of a hurry and youve been more resourceful at solving hoods puzzles than i ever hoped the fourth reich will acknowledge your contribution someday the fourth reich sam asked try try again jake smiled at his little joke their guide was struggling with which question to ask first how in hell did you get a pistol in tibet he finally managed by spending four thousand of my girlfriends dollars outrageous markups in the jokhang but its true with cash enough you can buy anything the bullets cost ten dollars a piece can you believe that bandits so think hard before you shoot one i think very hard about everything i do he was in a squat gun in one hand knife in the other now hold out your hand rominy its very sharp so it really wont hurt what is this really all about she asked all certainty lost all balance undone had it all been an act even their lovemaking had she fallen for some lunatic nazi who then was the skinhead in the cascade mountains once more nothing seemed to make sense power and before she could react he seized her wrist jerked her to him and sliced her palm with the ss dagger now she saw the words on the blade meine ehre heist treue it stung blood ran with alarming quickness from the wound he stood and kissed her quickly to make it all better then he matteroffactly tucked the dagger in his belt and brought out a tin backpacking cup catching the flow she thought she might faint when the cup was full like thick burgundy he brusquely shoved her backward toward sam and set the cup aside he reached inside the pack again and pulled out some bandages throwing them at the guide bind the wound mackenzie then picking up the pistol and keeping a wary eye on them he went to the door squatted again and started pouring rominys blood into the carved artery of the heart what are you doing barrow sam asked watch and see i dont know how much blood it will take but well do it by the cup everything is alive if you look at it the right way or rather life itself is a kind of conceit an illusion of energy once you realize all is one a glow began to emanate from the rock there was a clunk a whir and a line appeared to divide the solid slab and then with a grind it slowly slid apart there was a small chamber beyond blank and featureless it led nowhere you cut rominy to find a closet sam asked jake ignored him leaning against the back wall was a translucent staff no light emanated from it but it was a beautifully sensual thing smooth like colored glass and its surface had subtle basrelief of beasts and warriors heil hitler jake whispered seriously dude this isnt cool you need help man on the contrary mr mackenzie im one of the few sane people on this planet but you lied rominy said about everything not everything i did save you from dying with your car but i knew it was wired to explode i did lie about who i am but i didnt lie about who you are and taught you more about yourself than you ever knew i didnt tell you everything about what i was looking for but i was absolutely sincere in bringing you to tibet i needed your dna rominy and you can feel satisfied you played a role in history there were never any skinheads chasing us on the freeway were there you pretended and shoved my head down and fired that shot through the window yourself with that pistol very good i used a silencer how did you know i found the bullet casing behind the seat ah i looked for it several times but you needed the safety deposit box you needed me for that that and your blood you are the correct descendant of the one who apparently sealed this chamber you came for that rod like we talked about on the plane that rod or staff is a necessary first step in reconstituting shambhala as youve seen the original city is quite wet and even if we did have scuba equipment im sure seventy years of immersion hasnt helped whatever machinery is down there but science has advanced a great deal since and some of us are prepared to become shambhalans ourselves you have to understand that conventional history is a monstrous distortion of the evolutionary goals of national socialism now we can finish what we started and when we do our species will realize its potential finish the holocaust sam asked finish purification once we regain power end global warming stop population growth by the wrong people and make room for the right all it takes is organization discipline and will barrow listen to yourself sam groaned hitler couldnt do it with most of europe under his boot germanys gone liberal its too late on the contrary it is finally time the pair of you can take satisfaction in playing a role in the greatest experiment since the manhattan project jake please rominy pleaded this makes no sense if there was really vril wouldnt scientists have found it by now whats vril sam asked this fantasy power source he thinks shambhala used it but the city is gone jake drowned hitler lost the war please put the gun down the resurrection will begin in the camelot of the ss my dear beyond that i think the details are over your head you already know more than is good for you or rather me so youre going to kill me theres one other thing i didnt lie about i was falling in love with you even as i used you youre pretty youre smart and youre more than just a good lay she was shaking with fear and fury what a flatterer you are im not comfortable shooting you instead im going to have you step inside that chamber there if you shut the door well suffocate sam said not if the nuns find you in time so the answer to your question rominy is no im not a murderer but he was crazy so rominy lunged her goal was the knife or gun but her target was simply jake barrow all the lies hed told and all the manipulations hed fostered her vision had gone red furious at herself and furious at him furious for letting herself stay offbalance while this maniac led her like a sheep the fury consumed her she didnt know anger and loathing could be so great so she sprang with rage she didnt know she was capable of and struck with explosive frustration jake pitched back in surprise one hand on his knife and the other holding the gun and they both went over hitting the stone floor hard get him sam she screamed she clawed at jakes face then the pistol went off a pop and she hesitated for just a fraction of a second the butt of the gun struck her temple and her vision blurred meanwhile sam mackenzie was thrown back hard grunting jesus fuck he shot me he sounded unbelieving barrow twisted and threw rominy offhe was strong as an animaland leaped up to kick her in the stomach she was gutted of wind that was really stupid he snarled now youve killed your friend curling in agony she twisted to look sam had been shoved by the bullet against the back wall of the chamber and had slid down his mouth gasping for air the front of his shirt had a spreading red splotch her eyes blurred with tears a torment of fury pain remorse and helplessness barrow lifted her like a sack of potatoes and pitched her into the little chamber against sam who yelped with pain then he grabbed the oddly translucent staff and stepped outside unfortunately for you your blood doesnt open the chamber from the inside theres no lock there he clicked the staff against the edge of the portal and it began to slowly slide shut he held the pistol on her i do care for you rominyive enjoyed our time togetherso i really dont want to shoot you i think this is better closure dont trap me here she screamed id rather die too late the portal slammed shut they were locked in total blackness shambhala tibet september present day j ake barrow trudged to the top of the stairshe couldnt trot at this altitudeand pounded on the temple door to be let back into the nunnery there was no latch on his side he had enough c plastic explosive to blow his way out if necessary and the pistol to cow the nuns but the last thing he wanted was a running retreat from a mob of angry buddhist women a massacre would make it hard to escape tibet he had what hed come for and with shambhala swamped there could be no more investigation until the fellowship triumphed best now to slip quietly away to the land cruiser and head to germany he waited impatiently for what seemed like an eon but was probably only a minute and then there was a clank a squeal and the door creaked open even the dim light of the temple seemed bright after the gloom of the descending stairway mr barrow amrita bowed did you find what you hoped i think so but theres been an accident sister he was a good actor and trusted that his face showed appropriate concern rominy and sam are trying to open some kind of door but sams hurt rominy is looking after him while i fetch our firstaid kit from the land cruiser are there some young nuns you could send to help amritas eyes fixed on the staff you found your desire yes but sam is more important perhaps we could use your new rod to help make a litter im afraid the ancient glass might break ah youll share your discovery with the chinese authorities of course he smiled to mask his impatience please sam is in pain ive got to get some pills these shavenheaded women were loopy as loons with religious mysticism and thwarted desire it shouldnt be hard to lie his way past them but amrita still blocked his way i see youre impatient mr barrow but sometimes its better to pause and meditate about your course not when a friend is injured she held his eye for a moment his gaze sliding uncomfortably away and then stood aside of course ill take some acolytes and look to your companions while you hurry bless you goodbye the ring holding the key to the iron door was hung nearby while amrita called out for help he rounded the buddha feeling squeezed by its presence its consciousness concentrated inside instead of out no nazi statue would ever pose in such a pensive passive decadent way then he hid in shadow he needed as much time as possible three other young nuns appeared with bandages cloths and what looked like their own herbal medicines the nuns lit lamps small enough to carry by hand and amrita leading disappeared down the winding stairs jake slipped back looked quickly about and slammed the iron door shut locking it with the ring of keys these he pocketed then he hurried to his room scooped up his backpack and crossed the nunnery courtyard a nun said something to him in tibetan and he tensed ready to draw and shoot her through the eye if he had to the horror of it making the others hesitate his hand curled on the grip but while he didnt understand tibetan he did know one name amrita he held his other hand palm out in a gesture of confusion and nodded toward the gate the nun shook her head as if she didnt know he nodded as if searching and was past her out the gate and down the mountain cold wind snapping at his clothes he hurried to the plain where the land cruiser waited keys still in the ignition even if they realized where amrita was trapped it would take them hours to pry that iron door back open hed put the pieces in motion and he hadnt killed anyone he told himself not yet even when surprised by rominys tackle he had aimed very carefully r ominys tomb was absolutely dark absolutely hard and absolutely silent except for sams labored breathing terror was held at bay only by her mental paralysis she was in shock at her own catastrophic misjudgment why had she followed anyone into the bowels of tibet because of vanity curiosity at her own heritage and importance and belief that jake barrow had fallen hard for her it had been the fullblown fairy tale a kind of adventurous elopement complete with fake wedding ring what a fool she was the jewelry burned on her finger and she tugged it off hurling it against the closed door it made a little clink as it fell she was going to suffocate and no one would even know where she died muthur fucker sam coughed groaning i cant believe that lunatic shot me it doesnt matter sam rominy said dully he locked us in were both going to die it matters to me of course her guide was shot and she was just sitting here feeling sorry for herself attention kmart shopper theres a man bleeding to death right next to you im sorry i just feel so dumb where are you hit sam can we stop the bleeding he coughed again he hit me in the most vital part your heart my iphone what it was in my shirt pocket under my jacket the bastard just plugged two hundred dollars worth of hardware bruised a rib or two and made me feel like ive been kicked by a mule you mean the bullet didnt go in i can feel it squashed in the ruins all my contacts were in there you mean youre not dying you just said i am going to die well yes but from lack of oxygen or water not bleeding this is good news isnt it it was odd how his survival cheered her good news how i dont want to suffocate alone he was dead silent for a moment then he barked a laugh a gasping chuckle and then coughed ow jeez that hurts oh man what a crazy chick you are no wonder you wound up with losers like me and jake nazi geez im glad to accommodate you rominy that will be another three hundred dollars please sam im really really sorry i dont understand any of this i wasnt with jake on this at all i mean i was with him but i thought he was a reporter and we were on this treasure hunt i got greedy i think i wanted to matter and he babbled about atom smashers and funny little strings and it all seemed to make sense until it didnt ive heard of getting dumped but man that guy is cold why do women have such bad taste in men because we hope but what had she even been hoping for excitement purpose love oh god how she ached they were quiet for a moment then sam spoke again so whats with the stick he grabbed is it a light saber or what a magic wand he called it a wizards staff he thinks ancient people knew about particle physics and could do advanced science wed think was magic so now hes a sorcerer my guess is hes fetching for somebody else if they really knew how such a thing works why would they need an old one ill bet hes taking it somewhere to study he wants to see if they have this power called vril from shambhala man i must be one lousy guide thats why i draw the lunatics at least you try thats supposed to make me feel better i think trying to do good counts trying to do bad counts bad im just doing this because i ran out of trekking money college dropout drifter slacker but i speak a little tibetan and here i am locked in shambhalas bowel they were quiet should we stop talking to conserve oxygen rominy finally asked if we do that ill start to cry no better to curse that sonofabitch to the final breath maybe if we try hard enough we can levitate our way out of here if only that were true but she decided to try to not just wish but pray to see if thoughts really could somehow affect the tons of rock hemming them in so she concentrated calling on the help of every catholic saint she could remember and buddha to boot nothing happened it was as dark and confining as ever she could hear sam wheezing like an old man she could feel the throb of her heart in her temples and then there was a clunk a whir and the door locking them in split in half and the soft flickering light of carried butter lamps found its way inside a miracle prayers answered they blinked from both the light and tears whos there a tall slender robed woman was silhouetted in the doorway its amrita rominy we came to let you out they stood balancing against the wall and then stumbling into the arms of the nuns rominy was shaking with deliverance her mind whirling sams shirt was blotched with red but how could you open it he said it was a blood lock he said it could only be opened with my blood she lifted her crudely bandaged hand or the blood of your ancestors amrita smiled and lifted a vial mr barrow never thought to ask if wed kept something like this but youve never used it we were told to wait for you now that mr barrow is gone weve got a letter thats been waiting for you for a very long time a letter i think its time you finally got some answers hoods cabin cascade mountains united states september w hen beth calloway pulled into the weedy yard of her cabin hermitage ten thousand miles from where the nightmare had begun the gas gauge on the ford woody was hovering on empty the trucks panels were stained and mossy its bed holding only her backpack no matter it was interesting what didnt matter when the end was finally near theyd come sooner than shed hoped later than shed feared once she read about the atomic bombings she knew theyd want more magic the world had gone nuts shed done her best and now it was in gods hands whatever god really was she eased herself out from behind the wheel and stood her knees almost buckling duncan hale had been quick and shed been quicker but the bastard had still put the bullet in her gut that changed everything shed wrapped a girdle of bandages around her waist and worn a pea jacket to hide the bleeding so her neighbor margaret wouldnt be spooked any more than she already was but christ on a crutch it hurt perversely beth smiled at the pain shed known a man like benjamin hood was bad news and shed still fly him anywhere if she still had a plane limping she crossed the yard and stumped up onto the porch wincing as she did so she wished she still had the pistol for comfort if nothing else but shed had to entrust it to margaret to add to the other things in the safety deposit box she couldnt fight anymore anyway im moving gertiemoving back to nebraska tonight she lied to her friend you tell em youre just running an errand for me and dont let em see the gun when you lock it in the bank shed rehearsed these instructions many times in her own head then you get my kid down to seattle and leave her with the sisters until i can come back that hundred dollars will more than cover it i know but why cant you do it beth margaret had wailed she wasnt the strongest of women but there hadnt been time for a better choice margaret was just five miles down the road and beth dared not risk more time or blood loss poor little sadie short for palisade would likely wind up in an orphanage no matter who she picked but that was a better chance for safety than she had here it broke beths heart to hand her over but it was a relief as well would it ever make a difference that was in gods hand too and you mail that letter thats the most important of all you mail that you hear i will beth her voice quavered she was alarmed at the pallor of calloways complexion what trouble had she brought here why this sudden run back to her family shed always been a little fascinated by beth calloway but a little afraid too when you going to come back for sadie when i finish what i have to do but you didnt get back not from eternity beth knew the end had finally come that morning when duncan hale had driven up in the pale light of predawn his hair was greasy from lack of washing his face citypale and his suit looked about as appropriate as a hickory shirt and caulk boots on wall street but hed skipped up her deck slick as eliot ness badge out and hand in one jacket pocket the snout of his little pistol poking against the fabric like a tiny erection girls gun thats what beth had thought shed slipped bens heavy automatic in her backpack before she opened the door hale had been arrogant as snot informing her that he was a bygodgenuine government gman of some agency or otherwho could tell which one since roosevelt and truman had spawned all those bureaucraciesand that he was looking for one benjamin grayson hood a special agent whod gone missing for uh seven years you havent found him in seven years city boy i have now sweetheart havent i or do you want to go to jail shed shrugged sure i can show you ben or rather whats left of him but thats not what you really want is it arent you after what he found im after both benjamin hood has a lot of questions to answer its a matter of national security miss calloway we live in a dangerous world a very dangerous world hitler was bad but stalin is going to be worse if theres something that might help america uncle sam has a right to it does that include paying for that right the gman smirked mr hood volunteered to bear most of the expense of his expedition himself nothing has changed that arrangement he never paid me you know i flew him there i can help you file the necessary paperwork for possible compensation he glanced around well have to do it downriver wed need a typewriter i got all day you take me to hood first she looked him up and down hes a bit reclusive its up a mountain and down a mine no offense but you arent dressed to even trek across my yard he lives in a mine its safer that way hale looked suspicious is there a trail miners trail then dont worry how im dressed miss calloway how do you know im not a mrs i checked the records before i came all the records shed even fixed him breakfast before they went thinking over what she had to do and not liking the way he eyed sadie so intently shed have run the child down to gertie then but she couldnt risk him knowing where the child was in case things didnt go as planned sadie you stay in the cabin here and play while mama goes up the mountain with this man understand the girl nodded the sevenyearold had been alone before and was precociously independent when will you be home by lunch i hope if im not you fix yourself a peanut butter sandwich just stay here and dont open the door to anybody or anything you want to be a cupcake for a black bear it was a running joke between them sadie giggled no mama is the suit man a friend no honey just a man shed turned so sadie couldnt see her cry it spooked her every time she looked into the childs eyes then they drove down the brushy lane sadie at the window watching them go hale was in shape shed give him that hed kept up with her brisk stride up the crude trail in country that stood on end and even city boy hale had marveled when they came over the rise and first saw eldorado wiping his face on his handkerchief as he viewed the glorious panorama of the north cascades then theyd cut downhill on the eastern side carefully working over to the mouth of the mine it was halfway up the cliff face with a bank of old tailings providing a crude ramp what is this place he asked old gold mine probably didnt produce much more than cheap copper nobodys going to work it in todays economy so its a good hideyhole cautiously he entered hello there was no answer he turned im warning you miss calloway my superiors know exactly where i am if this is any kind of an ambush the entire weight of the united states government will come down on you like a ton of bricks she looked around yeah i can see em he hesitated she smiled an effort go on city boy ill show you what you came for they walked back into the shaft for a hundred yards there was an oasis of light ahead coming from some kind of hole above except for a couple of rusting tools and a pool of drip water under the vertical shaft the mine was empty wheres hood she gestured with her head there a satchel dangled from one of the old mining timbers wrapped tight in oilskins to keep out water and animals is this some kind of joke you ever wonder what we are mr hale what do you mean the meaning of life and all that he grunted the meaning is to win instead of lose we learned that in the war the tibetans believe its divine thinking that created us that when you kill somethingkill anything that thinks youre killing something divine dont you wish the nazis believed that before they started the last six years of insanity whats your point hoods dead if benjamin was really just a thought a divine thought hes still a thought i figure i mean if i write down his thoughts write down what little i understand about what he found then hes still here there in that satchel thats all we remember and if you can makes sense of it youre smarter than me but its all inside there shambhala then he did find it he sure as hell found something but he didnt come back she pointed at the satchel i just told you he did the slightest glint of greed crossed his eyes then his face more masklike he took down the satchel and put its strap over his shoulder by the fact that hood was on a governmentsanctioned mission this satchel is the rightful property of the us government an heir might dispute that so sue me not me that kid of yours i have to get back to sadie your child should be downriver enrolled in a proper school shes going to grow up like an animal out here i think ill take your advice beth pointed to the mine entrance lead on agent hale this is it were done yeah were done he looked down the long dark length of the mine and shook his head ladies first it was an ambush all right hale thought but not hers regrettable but if hood was dead it wasnt smart to leave calloway alive either too much loose antigovernment crap about confiscatory federal agents and she could still sell stories to the commies so as she started walking for the mine entrance silhouetted against the circle of light his hand felt for the little pistol to plug her loose end first this pilot then the little girl hed had to do much worse in the war but at a spot shed picked where just enough light came from the entrance to give her aim without being blinded she suddenly stopped unslung her knapsack and knelt on one knee i need a drink of water she said reaching inside he watched her like a predator her hand closed around the the bitch was trying something he yanked out his pistol as he did so she shot him through her knapsack the bark of the report opening a neat little hole in the fabric an instant later his own gun went off the reports boomed and echoed in the mine as one they both hit each others stomachs slow wounds a terrible way to die beths caliber was heavier and hale was kicked backward grunting in surprise that the woman had beaten him he fell on his back his pistol flying wide before he could think to hold on to it damn she simply sat back stunned that it had finally happened and clenched her muscles against the pain she hadnt expected it would hurt so much it was hard to breathe she imagined she could feel the bullet in there eating and a wash of nausea almost made her faint steady beth not until youve taken care of sadie because it hasnt ended yet wincing she stood up her gun out of the pack now and steady hale was lying on his back his arms and legs making swimming motions as he tried to move he was looking at her in fear she walked past him and scooped up his gun pocketing it and then quickly patted him down for another he groaned as she pressed his sides then she stepped back you dont deserve a finishing shot dont leave me he begged she walked back to her pack you werent going to let me live were you hale because if there was anything really valuable in that satchel anything really top secret you couldnt risk having me run around with it in my head you didnt even ask if i was a patriot or if id help because you didnt want help you wanted possession she started to work pulling sticks of dynamite out of her pack his mouth bubbled hood the funny thing is that you got what you came for ben is in that bag and all the strange and wondrous things you hoped for are in there too ive no doubt youd find someone smart enough to figure them out maybe some of those nazi scientists you boys have been capturing so now were both dying and thats the best outcome of all because you know what mr hale you dont really want to find shambhala you dont want to find what ben found hood it was a gasp she unreeled fuse toward the mine entrance goodbye duncan the explosion sent an arc of rock flying out toward eldorado as the fragments bounced and ricocheted off the talus slope below there was a roar of collapse and a cloud of smoke and dust rolled out of the mine beth waited for the air to clear and then checked to make sure the cave was completely plugged yep a solid wall of rock entombed hale then she ripped off the bottom half of her shirt bandaged herself as best she could using the pain to keep her focus and painfully climbed to the top of the cliff where the mines vertical airshaft was shed prepared this cover long before wincing as she felt her gut leak into itself she dragged the logs and brush over the hole and kicked on some dirt erosion and growth would seal the shaft for decades to come agent duncan hale would bleed to death in the dark then a stagger down to the cabin forced smiles to a confused sadie and quick delivery to a frightened margaret the effort had just about killed her but not quite too bad because what was coming up the road next would kill her shed die all right but in the most horrible way possible and not before she told them everything she knew one side would bring the other like flies to rot shed long figured so she lay on the bed unarmed dizzy and resigned curious about this other man to come she prepared by putting on male boots and jacket the latter with the fake credentials for ben shed had made in china and then used at the bank it might help confuse things until the right descendant came along the calendar pages were taped shut by the tibetan stamp she didnt think the county coroner would look too hard at a hermits leavings and after that would any of it ever matter she just had to hope the right blood lock heir would survive when dusk fell headlights swung up the old access road two or three vehicles at least doors slammed and she heard the heavy tread of big men getting out she pulled off the rest of her bandage and peered at the puckered and swollen bullet hole her stomach a mottle of purple and yellow bruising pain came in pulses she didnt know you could hurt so much they were gathering outside she could hear the muttered german so she plunged her forefinger into the bullet hole screaming as she did so they froze uncertain then there was a command and they broke through the door beth yanked her finger out it was like taking a finger out of a dike blood spurted in a rush a fountain of mortality and her vision blurred as she faded into unconsciousness and death she got a last glimpse of the man whod first burst inside oh my god he looked wild with disappointment and far far worse than she did the nunnery of the closed door tibet september present day s ince sam wasnt critically hurt the nuns didnt have to lug him wheezing and constantly cursing until he remembered the company he was with but then the soreness would make him forget again he staggered step by step under his own power he was bleeding but the wound was a surface cut where the shattered iphone had bruised and scraped his chest once at the iron door jake barrows theft of the keys delayed the party only fifteen minutes after pounding amrita shouted directions to a spare set she kept hidden in her cell and more nuns scurried to fetch them it helps that mr barrow has to think everyone else a fool she told them if he didnt think that his philosophy would collapse against commonsense reason when the americans were released into the yellow glow of the nunnery temple rominy felt a rush of relief escape was like being raised from the dead she knelt and touched her forehead to the base of the buddha as the nuns looked on in sympathy she could swear electricity coursed through her when she touched the relic restoring her spirit and strength did god have many faces come on lets go after him sam said he coughed and winced how said amrita hes taken your vehicle and by now is many miles from here which isnt such a bad place for him to be but hell get away always you americans are in such a hurry youve just opened a secret that has been waiting for more than seventy years no time has been lost the world had to wait until this moment for the closed door to be relevant and no time will be lost because you must first understand what it is you must do why is it relevant now rominy stood up from her prayer because of atoms she said sam squinted care to translate dharma jake talked about how shambhala may have had an ancient atom smasher he thinks that staff is a wizard staff that can somehow play strings smaller than atoms scientists are learning new things that convinced jake he can finally make the staff work thats why he came after me now after all this time he thinks he can harness the new power source called vril this is the guy you picked as your boyfriend i didnt know this at first and yes ill be kicking myself the rest of my life which might be a short life if any more nazis are around sam nodded soberly how about it amrita you spot anyone else skulking she shook her head i suspect mr barrow has not fully convinced his superiors whoever they might be they left him to succeed or fail on his own recovery of that staff may prove him to the others and if anyone else had come with him i wouldnt have trusted jake rominy said or at least i hope not we cant catch that misguided man now amrita said so lets bind our wounds give you butter tea and let you sleep a little then before you decide what to do next i have something important to show you t hey met later in amritas cell the floor was packed earth the bed little more than a plank and yet the nun seemed more content than any woman rominy had ever met what was the secret of satisfaction was letting go of desire liberation or lobotomy this letter was sent from america sealed and with instructions to give it only to the heir who could open the closed door amrita said that would be you rominy the envelope crackled with age its airmail stamp and border dating from long long ago to the last shambhalan it read she shivered sam watching her closely then she opened it the writing was in english as she expected the script a feminine hand similar to the other notes shed retrieved the paper was yellow and the ink slightly faded but still quite legible the penmanship was of a quality never taught anymore read it aloud rominy sam said she did so dear descendant if you are reading this youve used the essence of your veins to open the last blood lock of the drowned city of shambhala or at least that is how i think of that odd troubling place my companion who made more study than i ever will doubts this is the shambhala of legend at all that it was a tragic experiment that delved too deep into the mysteries of creation and tapped what shouldnt be tapped i dont know those of us who escaped did so in panic and confusion and there was no time to really understand if youve refound the door that we shut its possible you know far more than we do nonetheless there may be some confusion let me share what i can in i was a pilot flying scouting and transport missions for the chinese air force at the order of madame chiang kaishek i flew an american museum curator named dr benjamin hood from hankow to tibet he was in pursuit of a german mission to that same mysterious nation the nazi goal was secret and our own pursuit was secret as well the world was slipping toward war and great issues were at stake in due time we were sent by the reting rinpoche to follow germans led by a man named kurt raeder the nazis were going to the place in the kunlun mountains where you presumably are now hood parachuted into a remote valley that appeared to contain the ruins of shambhala the legendary city that was supposed to be a paradise and redeem the world instead my companion related they found a dead city full of bones as if some terrible calamity had struck i meanwhile landed my plane made my way to this nearby nunnery and convinced the nuns to show me a back way into the mountain and city i found ben but could not convince him to flee with us he was determined to stop raeder shortly afterward huge explosions rocked the kunlun mountains and a canyon caved in on itself damming the citys river shambhala or whatever name it once really went by was flooded ben and raeder were gone this puzzled rominy hadnt her greatgrandfather gone back to america she looked at the envelope it was postmarked concrete i cant explain precisely what caused that catastrophe but i can explain a little of what happened afterward if youve come this far on the clues i left youre worthy of your ancestors but no doubt youve wondered at your origins and how i cametoo briefly i predictto be a guardian guardian hood had saved a tibetan nun named keyuri lin from the nazis keyuri was wounded in the fighting and after that terrible night in shambhala neither keyuri nor i was in a condition to go anywhere the nuns healed wounds both physical and spiritual and then came the pregnancy we should have been grateful but instead were apprehensive what if the nazis came back we wrote down what we remembered but it was like reconstructing a dream keyuri was crushed by the entire experience and i feared for her sanity my duty was to return to the chinese front but i dared not leave the birth was a difficult one and keyuri became even more depressed acquiescence and acceptance had failed her she said her buddhist faith had been shattered i hoped the child would give her hope but the memories were too painful there were always fears the germans were coming always rumors of the very worst things i think the force in shambhala had made her go mad so a year after the discovery of the city at a time when hitler was marching into poland i decided during a sleepless night to ask her to come home with me to america where we might seek a cure but she wasnt in her cell which was very unusual it was a cold windy night the moon giving the mountains a ghostly glow and i was about to give up and return to bed when i realized the baby was missing as well dread overwhelmed me i ran out the courtyard and up along the ridge crest calling i saw her at a cliff edge silhouetted against the distant snow and shouted she looked at me once sadly and then stepped i leaped and clutched as she was about to go over i couldnt save her but i saved your ancestor i was sprawled at the lip my arms outstretched the baby no bigger than a ball and i watched keyuris robes flapping as she fell far far away into a chasm finally at peace when i stretched out my arms and rescued that bloodline i made a choice i could leave the artifact locked away forever as keyuri urged a forgotten power buried or i could preserve the chance it might someday be harnessed for good but only by the right person if youre reading this youve followed clues i left behind i hope youre that person then it was time to go home to america as i write this the united states has plunged into war the stakes are enormous and the effort vast we are experiencing defeat after defeat and the world grows ever darker because of this whole armies would be traded for what we glimpsed at shambhala so if you find the staff we hid you must safeguard it it must only be shared with the right people at the right time when weve gained wisdom to use it if you lose it you absolutely must get it back maybe our species is too young to cope with such responsibilities someday millennia from now when our wisdom has caught up with our ingenuity maybe it will be time to finally go back to that lost dark city in the meantime youve found all that is left to give you strength remember that the babys mother was a good person caught in a terrible time i will do what little i can for the child but sooner or later the men that dream of power may come looking for her and me if that happens i will bury the secret until the right bloodline comes to set things right and mail this letter that blood dear reader is you may god protect you on your quest e lizabeth c alloway a pril it was postmarked september rominy put the letter down i dont understand who exactly was this keyuri lin and why does my greatgrandmother talk as if shes already dead she read again the babys mother was a good one dont you get it rominy sam asked gently no i dont get it amrita took her hand and covered the young womans beth calloway took your grandmother to america as a baby to raise her there after leaving a vial of the childs blood here but she was not the mother your ancestor rominy is not american but tibetan what your greatgrandmother is keyuri lin she was part tibetan ben hood had had sex with a buddhist nun when how she remembered what jake had first told her youre not rominy pickett well that was the understatement of all time her previous life seemed lightyears away it wouldnt have been easy for a halfasian baby in the s sam added west coast japanese were being locked up maybe thats one reason calloway hid out in the sticks rominy slowly nodded how much tibetan would she be now oneeighth she wanted to save the baby but she didnt want to be found to have the blood lock be found she turned to amrita i thought they used a finger we found from my greatgrandfather as the source of blood to lock the door but they didnt they used keyuri the nun nodded and keyuri as she meditated here in the nunnery decided the door should never be opened again she and miss calloway disagreed on what they should do thats why she took her baby to the cliff to end the bloodline the nazis would have no more reason to come to tibet but beth saved the child and something of benjamin hood the clues that brought you back here and the nuns helped beth and the baby it is not for us to take life or alter destiny and because of that you are alive and you are here is that not curious who knows what fate intends rominy sat back worriedly and now jake barrow if thats his real name has the staff why did i ever go with him and where will he go and why did he want it so badly it didnt look like it still worked to recharge it im guessing said sam for some reason the nazis decided it was finally time to find the descendant and open the blood lock so he hunted you down lying all the way to get you here in case they needed lots of blood sheep to slaughter she murmured which means sam mused hes going to an atom smasher maybe where do they have those anyway hell if i know geez my chest hurts no offense amrita but im losing all serenity you didnt have much to lose rominy said it may help you that jake unwittingly didnt take all his belongings with him amrita said in checking your identities we removed an old baggage tag from a side pocket of his backpack before showing you too much we wanted to know as much as possible about who you were heres the airport code they looked at it fra france guessed rominy frankfurt sam said i flew through there to get here when i came to tibet two years ago it figures the dude goes to germany maybe hes from there he seemed pretty american to me where else would a nazi go listen during the war the germans had guys posing as americans they misdirected our troops during the battle of the bulge youre a victim of an impostor rominy a secret agent whatever she sighed but where in germany wait he mentioned a vatican of the ss he told me in the airport that there was a castle himmler used do you remember where it was no but if i saw the name again id recognize it i bet we could look it up on the web if we got to germany so how do we get to germany theres something else he left some money i took because i got tired of him doing all the spending she felt more resolute shed been led since the explosion of her car it was time she took charge of her own life and turned the tables ill use it to go to germany well go to germany mackenzie amended sam this isnt your problem after a bullet in my chest and youve demonstrated you need adult supervision me has anyone accused you of being adult your entire life he smiled no but id like to try besides that bastard owes me an iphone rominy was actually relieved at the idea of company since she had little idea of what to do next except look for this castle was all this supposed to happen just dont lie to me okay promise sam said and wed better start packing hes got a long head start yes she said but weve got one big advantage whats that he thinks were already dead tibet to germany septemberoctober present day t he trek back to lhasa was daunting but there was peace in having to do little but walk a very long way the nuns gave rominy and sam thick blankets barley cakes and yak butter a gruesome but nutritious cuisine to keep them alive until they could find help and eventually western food they spent many miles discussing ideal pizza toppings winter was fast approaching and traffic was infrequent even on the busiest highways but eventually theyd encounter a vehicle when they returned to a road in the meantime the empty immensity was a recess from nazis autumns line of white kept creeping down the kunlun range but the cold north wind was at their backs and the only mystery was how to put one foot in front of the other despite a chest blackened with bruises sam took two thirds of the weight without complaint he was big strong angry and oddly serene about their immediate predicament but then tibet had been home to him for two years its not a question of if well get help just when he assured her id rather be lost in tibet than nevada less loopy they slept together not for love but for warmth it was too cold to take clothes off anyway they had no fuel to make a fire and no tent for shelter so theyd find a wadi or outcrop and curl together behind the windbreak burrowed beneath blankets she knew he wasnt ignorant of the fact she was a womansometimes he moved restlessly as they nested and at other times he looked at her with shy longingbut they were both filthy and cold with no energy for sex and no reason yet for romantic affection she appreciated him not talking about it they huddled like fox kits and when she woke up shivering hed wrap her in his big arms and hug her until she stopped do you know all that ive got left of my old life she said one morning after lying on her belly like an animal to drink from an icy pool a social security number she reached into a pocket inside her parka i took this from my greatgrandfathers cabin its a tibetan scarf he was given and somebodybeth calloway i guesswrote a code on it so wed find an old mine thats it thats my ancestry no journal no satchel of maps no car no job you told me you stashed some of the inheritance in a seattle account with no identification to get it the less you have the more it means give me a break when they recrossed the low saddle that had given them their first view of the kunlun an enveloping snow squall robbed her of any sense of direction sam had retained a compass in his pack however and followed a bearing as if he were at sea always carry the ten essentials compass margarita mix dark chocolate his skill was reassuring meanwhile shed been cold and hungry for so many days that discomfort had become the background buzz of existence she knew shed gone past the point of dieting to malnutrition but the monotonous food did supply enough energy to keep her trudging her fantasies turned to yak burgers in the shangrila hotel she didnt dwell on their mission she dreaded having to confront the man shed loved and now hated jake barrow she wanted to simply go home but couldnt she wanted to give up but had to win courage shed decided wasnt bestowed it was chosen her ancestors had decided to be brave now it was her turn do you believe in god sam she asked at one point as they trudged god he paused looking about nope dont see him santa claus for grownups rominy youre not spiritual anymore im not religious theres a difference take jesus for example a xerox copy of gods who preceded he was the son of a carpenter and virgin like krishna born on december twentyfifth like mithras heralded by a star like horus walked on water like buddha healed like pythagoras raised people from the dead like elisha was executed on a tree like adonis and odin and ascended into heaven like hercules the religious tradition is genuine but to pretend hes the one and only instead of the latest software updateno way youre quite the theology student you dont come to tibet without wondering about things i was a searcher like everybody but after a while i got bored with dogma you know the buddhists dont have a lot to say about god or creation at all they stick to what they know which is dealing with our fuckedup heads but they talk about love and empathy wasnt that jesus too those nuns devote their lives to this cosmic thing this goodness this grace that unites all the great faiths they see him or it or the essence theyd see god right now right here in this wilderness im sorry but that rock isnt god not for me and what essence living in the middle ages at the edge of the world praying twenty million times a day for more of the same in the next life ive watched them for two years its an interesting show for tourists but not to buy in to im sorry rominy but for those who find life pointless and death terrifying without religion i just say maybe it is pointless and terrifying well ive seen god she said now he stopped hands on hips you have and you didnt ask her for a ride very funny remember when we climbed up the edge of the waterfall to the lake saw the smoke from the nunnery and started cutting along the mountain to get to it yeah it was so empty so desolate so lonely that he or she filled it filled what everything if your dope was that good i wish youd shared it it was a very odd feeling and it only lasted for a minute as we worked our way toward the nunnery i suddenly felt completely at peace as if i were exactly where i was supposed to be and i felt connected i felt connected to jake i felt connected to you i felt connected to the river and the rock and the birds orbiting overhead to the universe i felt everything was one and i thought this must be what heaven is like he regarded her skeptically brain chemicals high altitude sleep deprivation faulty diet you hallucinated rominy like every prophet and guru whos gone into the desert and deliberately starved you felt what you wanted to feel but i didnt want it in fact for a few moments i didnt want anything he sighed do you feel it now no will you concede it could all be a trick of the mind no that maybe the twelve apostles were a bunch of potheads no it was too real it was so real that that was the reality notshe waved her hand at the landscapethis not what i feel now its like i woke up just for a second and now im back asleep again in this dream we call life wow whoa jake was just a snake rominy there was no connection to that naziloving bastard thats the weird part he is a snake but there was a connection that if we could really see the essence that this staff is supposed to tap that if we could lift the veil and get down to the fundamental thats behind everything there was is a connection it was spooky wonderful scary the real shambhala isnt lightning bolts sam its unity thats what we lost thats what were looking for im looking for a yak burger even hitler even though he was irretrievably lost rominy come on now youre starting to sound like jake barrow is that what were going to say to that bastard when we catch up to him all is one all is forgiven now please give your stick back no just that he has no idea what hes really carrying he was in a place to see and stayed blind and he locked us in a tomb you pray and ill go in shooting i t took them six days for the track to turn to a dirt road and two more for the dirt to turn to gravel and one more after that to reach pavement they finally flagged down a farm truck and paid a few dollars to ride it back to the capital sam was apprehensive that barrow might be laying a trap but they saw no sign of him so they had a blessed night in a hotel separate rooms a feast of the most american food they could shamelessly order and then a flight coach this time to delhi dubai and frankfurt sam retrieved his american passport rominy traveled as lilith anderson it was in dubai during a threehour layover that sam wandered out of a magazine store with a herald tribune look what i spotted it was an inside story one column from the associated press collider to attempt full power the headline read the european nuclear agency cern will attempt soon to reach full power at its large hadron collider near geneva in hopes of testing theories about the origin of the universe the story began by smashing subatomic particles at a velocity near the speed of light scientists hope to answer such fundamental questions as why matter exists at all the underground cyclotron biggest in the world is designed to reach proton beam energies of up to trillion electron volts you think this has something to do with us rominy asked no i think it has something to do with ratbag jake barrow and why he played you when he did this is an atom smasher right going to full power can you say coincidence jake cant have anything to do with a huge supercollider can he dollars to doughnuts says he does how i dont know is he an errand boy for some mad scientist i just think its too neat not to mean something what about his ss vatican or whatever he called it we should start there if we can find it and warn this cern outfit if we can get any evidence on the scum sucker he stopped to listen for an announcement come on theyre loading our plane r ominys joy at being lifted from the twelfth century to the twentyfirst in a matter of days faded when they broke through the clouds and saw the green platter of germany somewhere they hoped was the stolen staff the problem would be if it came packaged with a packet of nazis sam persuaded her they needed to rent a bmw series coupe if it was me it would be a ford fiesta he admitted but were secret agents now and have to keep up appearances this is great using your money maybe i am beginning to understand jake barrow ive never been so popular with men she said drily dont worry weve almost burned through my cash after we save the world i just hope well have enough left to buy a ticket home you are home all is one remember cologne cleveland kathmandu i dont believe youre as cynical as you say you dont live in tibet for two years for nothing he laughed check my bank account rominy it was for nothing a google search at the frankfurt airport business center swiftly identified the town of wewelsburg as the site of himmlers camelot or the wouldbe spiritual home of the ss there was nothing secret about it thus making it seem an unlikely place to run jake barrow to ground but it was only a hundred or so miles north of frankfurt and they had no other clue sam threw himself into the task of driving with salacious joy getting up to mph on the autobahn and then throwing the sporty car into curves once they left the main highway it reminded her of jakes freeway escape in the pickup truck sam had lost weight hiking from shambhala and shaved in lhasa and he looked good without scraggle on his chin with jake shed felt a tense electricity but with sam there was easygoing comfort not so much dependability as dogged loyalty an instinct to look after her he was after all a guide shed catch him glancing at her at times do you think a lot about beer breasts and baseball rominy asked once as he drove what its just something that jake said im wondering if all guys are alike oh no way man football is king shed found she supposed a guy from the beer and chips aisle the shadow of war and nazism seemed purged from germany as they approached wewelsburg the landscape was fat bucolic satisfied the villages were quaint the cars were washed the people looked prosperous the politics were liberal hitler was dead history wasnt he sam pulled to the side when the castle came into view it looked a little like a bluntbowed ship perched on a low ridge that rose above the alme valley its apex pointing north a round lowroofed tower was at the northern end at the other two corners were smaller towers with dome roofs like derbies sam counted theres a good sixty windows just on the side we can see for the home of the most sinister organization in world history it doesnt look very scary its not a king arthur castle its a renaissance castle rominy was reading from notes theyd made in the airport himmler wanted it to be more of a church a pagan church than a fortress or a meeting lodge for a new kind of freemasonry they had a world globe in there so big they couldnt bring it in the conventional way they had to lift it through a window the better to carve up the planet my dear well whats our plan if barrow sees us hes going to go ballistic you know there was a b and b about five klicks back lets check in there and go up to the castle after dark we can sneak around when he cant see us great unarmed clueless unable to speak the language i like the way you think tomb raider we need evidence for prosecution or to take to cern jake tried to murder us sam and we need to take him by surprise jake thinks were dead or that im a ninny waiting for him to tell me what to do the best defense is a good offense lets start doing the unexpected what evidence is there the staff i want it back it belonged to my greatgrandparents im going to find it and steal it then we go to the police and tell them what that he tried to murder us in tibet that he stole from the nunnery and how do we prove that exactly the staff seemed made of something ive never seen before we find that and jakes real identity we show the bruises on your chest and the bullet in your iphone we even call the seattle times back home and get them to investigate this impostor we sneak we steal we give a news tip and we go to the cops golly dday wasnt this carefully crafted she ignored the sarcasm studying the castle like a besieging general sam you dont think the police could be in on this somehow do you you know like neonazis he got serious not in germany theyre pretty paranoid about that stuff and that was three generations back im guessing jake barrow is on his own except for a lunatic skinhead or two rominy started had the bald man in the cabin window been working with jake barrow did he shoot his arrows to help them escape she realized how little she still knew about what was really going on wewelsburg germany october present day i t was near midnight when they parked a quarter mile from the castle and cautiously made their way through the outskirts of wewelsburg their bags in the trunk in case they had to suddenly flee it was autumn the days shortening the crops in but even at that the town seemed oddly quiet every curtain was drawn they could see the glow of lights and the flicker of television in a few houses but only occasionally did a car hiss down the village lanes it was so quiet that the slam of a door could be heard from a hundred yards away and the bark of a dog twice that their footsteps seemed loud and rominy had a sense of being watched yet no one challenged them they studied the castle from the shadow of trees the building was entirely dark shut for the night a ramp led across a ditch to the castle entrance but the way was barricaded with lumber and tape signs bearing international symbols for construction apparently offseason remodeling was going on looming above the edifice seemed somber and sad not a camelot at all did the ghosts from old ss plots seminars initiation ceremonies and aryan weddings still linger here looks like a wildgoose chase sam murmured if the castle is closed barrow wouldnt come here would he but where else would he go she was frustrated were not detectives rominy we might have to hire one or find some officials whod believe our story and do the detective work themselves jake might not even be in germany we need interpol not our instincts but we dont even have proof jake barrow exists or whatever his real name is maybe if we told our story the chinese police would verify it for interpol by interviewing the nuns im not going to sic communist chinese cops on a buddhist nunnery he looked back at the quiet village it looked disney clean like everything in this model railroad of a country what then i dont know lets look around a little more we cant even get in the place theres a dry moat on this side i think that sign in german says it leads to a tower lets try that maybe we can peek in some windows you got balls girl i just dont want to waste my plane ticket and im angry for letting life happen to me instead of me happening it happening it you know what i mean come on youre the one who lost his iphone to that maniac skirting the barricades they made their way down into a grassy moat a threequarter moon floated above and gave enough light to mark their way through the mown trench down there the castle seemed even higher and darker a cliff like the cliff that had barred their way to shambhala there were actually no windows at moat level to peer into and rominy was almost pleased shed be glad to get away from this creepy castle but she had to do something her best and then go home the moat led them north to the big flatroofed tower the ditch ended where the castle ridge dropped toward the valley below since no barrier was needed on that steep side a few farm lights glittered on the plain beyond they backed away from the tower and looked up its crenellations picked out by the moon nothing except that did you see it rominy whispered what a candle it moved someones inside she shivered from both excitement and dread this isnt one of your wacky i see god moments is it no there was a light i swear it she pointed it was up where the main floor of the tower would be a janitor with a flashlight or someone sneaking around inside in that case lets call the cops we cant it might just be a janitor with a flashlight rominy look there are some stairs leading down from the base of the tower into a well with a basement door maybe we can get in there youre going to break into a nazi castle in the middle of germany and then make our case to the police we need proof she sounded a lot braver than she felt it probably is just a janitor im not even getting paid anymore i let you rent the bmw or should i go by myself no you need adult supervision lacking that you get me they descended the stairwell to a wooden door with an oldfashioned iron handle and latch how are your lockpicking skills sam whispered she grasped the latch it lifted perfect its unlocked he put his hand on her arm thats not necessarily a good sign sam we have to peek we dont know what else to do vin diesel and schwarzenegger would go in shooting come on it was pitchblack inside they shuffled into the basement of the tower carefully wary of unseen steps then they halted only the palest radiance came from the open door theyd crept through they could see nothing light the candle she whispered theyd found one in the bedandbreakfast theyd checked into provided either as insurance against power outages or to let guests cast a romantic mood now sam pulled it out and used the hostels matches to light it the sudden illumination threw back the shadows and revealed a round stark gloomy room it was the basement of the tower the roof was a stone dome oh my god look at that rominy hissed at the domes apex was a stone swastika each arm extended with additional turns despite countless war movies it looked in its geometric intricacy oddly compelling ive seen that kind in tibet sam muttered sometimes its called a sun wheel their feet were at the edge of a sunken circle in the room like a shallow pool directly below the swastika was a circle within this circle a depression that sank a few inches deeper its purpose was unclear arranged around the room were twelve squat round stone pedestals like the bases of pillars placed on each one was a bronze sculpture the signs of the zodiac rominy said what could this be for pagan cosmology said sam twelve is an ancient sacred number like seven the ancients believed the gods were aligned with the planets and the web site said himmler planned an observatory here maybe the nazis came down here to cast the future must have been disheartening if it worked maybe they still come down the sculptures look bright and new and theyre not all aligned evenly like someone just set them up very perceptive mr mackenzie a new voice said the door through which theyd entered closed with a boom and they whirled there was a figure in the shadows its actually valhalla a womans voice said with a crisp german accent a flashlight blazed freezing them like deer in its beam a hall of the dead the woman shining the light was standing next to the door wearing a business suit and pumps and holding a wickedlooking assault rifle there are tours that explain all this when the castle is open which it is not the door was unlocked sam tried convenient dont you think the light danced on them making sure they had no weapons you know jake barrow rominy asked her voice trembling despite her best effort to be brave why not get to the point silly girl of course i do the woman came closer the beam lowering so they could see and rominy almost fainted her hair was coiffed her teeth were perfect her makeup carefully applied and her look a generation younger but holding the gun was delphina clarkson rominys backwoods neighbor from the cascade mountains wewelsburg germany october present day h immler built it as a hall for the dead of the ss elite clarkson said letting the beam bounce around the chamber for a moment what the pedestals were designed for isnt entirely clear statues urns the twelve comes of course from the twelve signs of the zodiac so we decorate accordingly when we meet nazis decorate sam asked she isnt a nazi shes my neighbor arent you but why was delphina dressed up and talking with a german accent why was she here and youre supposed to be dead rominy arent you her smile was sly you look different she sounded one step behind again naive and dimwitted which was precisely what she didnt want to be no rominy it was mrs clarkson who looked different i usually look exactly like this the perfection of the disguise the tar heel accent the language the age was stupefying was anyone who they said they were the castle entrance is closed for construction sam said it is closed for us clarkson corrected remodeling is a cover this is a special time and we wanted a special place with special privacy with special uninvited guests we watched you approach whos us sam asked she motioned with the wickedlooking weapon upstairs it was an order they passed through an interior doorway with a gate of iron bars and ascended to the room above the crypt this was circular too with twelve pillars and twelve arches at its periphery and a round medievalstyle chandelier overhead with twelve bulbs the lights werent lit and the only dim illumination came from a couple of desk lamps sitting on the floor against the walls whoever was here did not seem anxious to advertise their presence to the village outside on the marble floor beneath the chandelier was another design that played off the wheeling swastika rominy had a jolt of recognition its the sun wheel you saw on my shoulder said a voice from the shadows and out stepped jake barrow or the man whod claimed to be jake he was dressed in a black business suit with white shirt and silk tie of maroon like a politician or ceo the ties subtle pattern was runic lightning bolts jakes left wrist glinted with an expensive gold watch and his right held an automatic pistol black and deadly its dark mouth aimed waist high there were rominy decided entirely too many guns in the world thought wed catch you in storm trooper drag barrow sam said and i thought you might try to improve on slackerslob apparel should you ever make it to europe but apparently not jake responded the clean chin is a start however trying to impress rominy sam just airport security we of the fellowship dont wear the clothes of three generations ago national socialism is about ideas not uniforms yeah genocide conquest looting book burning and attempted murder of a woman you claimed you loved not murder but simply a delay so we had time to prepare things id no doubt the nuns would get you out sooner or later no doubt that youd follow me here i deliberately aimed for your mobile phone so youd survive to help deliver her i deliberately gave rominy clues so welcome weve been impatiently expecting you and now the final act in our little play can finally begin play rominy asked surely ursula kalbs performance as an american hick deserves an academy award jake gestured toward the woman she thought of as delphina so it was all a charade the skinhead too fashionably bald and the man rominy had seen at the cabin window the one whod killed the poor hounds emerged from behind another pillar his mohawk stripe was gone and he was completely shaven otto nietzel at your service he too had a suit and narrow black tie but his feet were armored with hightop black military boots tie or no tie he still looked like a thug im real not a charade you butchered those dogs put them to use you fled with jakob as intended she looked from one to another my car explosion was your doing she finally asked jake im afraid so more effective than an opening line in a singles bar was anything real as i said in tibet you to start im glad your hand appears to be healing the mystery was real we couldnt get access to the safety deposit box short of robbery which would bring in the fbi we didnt know if there was anything useful in it but had to look we knew nothing about the mine or satchel the physics we discussed on the plane is real your ingenuity was real and your body was real is your scar real flipping your bike he fingered his chin a jew fought back she shuddered shed had sex with this manipulative monster ursula did use the hounds to track us and rescue us at the eldorado mine he went on after i sent a signal from an epirb rescue beacon id hidden in my pack the toughs at the airport were an american bodyguard for me should you panic and run for a cop the inheritance was a stroke of luck youve contributed to a noble cause is there a real delphina clarkson there was she has alas passed away you murdered her we solved a problem she was recalcitrant oh my god rominy felt sick the poor woman would never have been harmed if rominy hadnt drawn these lunatics into her life it just got worse and worse im not real jake said amiably im not a reporter not an american and not very fond of wine my german name is jakob at least your english is impressive sam said sourly i studied at columbia and yale laughably liberal decadently idealistic obviously you flunked at that frau kalb rammed the muzzle of her m assault rifle into the guides kidneys sam gasped and fell to his knees otto grinned at the blow rominys heart was hammering please dont be a hero sam he struggled to talk brave move ursula just like your massmurdering master uncle adolf never won a battle when he couldnt land a sucker punch ottos expression darkened and he strode quickly across the rooms circle the steel at the tip of his boots ringing on the marble you want to fight american he grabbed mackenzies ears and brought up his knee slamming it into sams face blood spurted sam fell sideways and nietzel kicked viciously a hard boot to the groin the victim curled like a slug thats been salted the nazi kicked him again in the side sam went white enough it was jake or jakob youll have opportunity to play with him later otto the skinhead spat and stepped back rominy was trembling she hated violence and these people were bullies killers and liars and now she had some answers at least to who they were and what theyd done which meant they were planning to kill her too didnt it or were they she was tensed for a blow herself but none came for some reason they were leaving her alone it didnt make sense why did you even let us come here she hated the way her voice broke its obvious isnt it a new voice sounded low and sonorous and when this figure stepped from behind a pillar the other germans unconsciously straightened more people emerged as well men and women all dressed as highranking professionals conspiracy with style but this figure alone advanced across the rooms circle walking erect and gracefully over the inlaid sun wheel youve been chosen rominy the man said thats why jakob here didnt simply kill you in america and take your blood to tibet he didnt kidnap you either weve been testing you to see if you meet our criteria as a chosen one its not that different from the hunt for the next dalai lama really jacob sam wheezed the jew who wrestled an angel and was renamed israel have your friends checked your bloodline jake shut up or otto will kick you again jakeor jakobwarned no one here is interested in your muddle of religious tripe sam dont provoke them rominy added she turned to their leader you murdered my mother and grandmother too your mother and grandmother had to be disposed of because the time of discovery was not yet ripe and we didnt want to risk them falling into american hands the new man said smoothly ignoring the others we waited for the next heir before extermination youre fortunate in being alive at a pivotal time science has saved you you mean physics particle accelerators jake said atom smashers youre going to try to revive the vril in that staff youre going to use the big supercollider near geneva and make a weapon that can kill more people very good the older man said calmly there was something wrong with this new individual who was clearly their leader rominy thought he was still in shadow so she couldnt pin it down but there was an odd mechanical manner in his movements and a sickly paleness in his face so if physics hadnt advanced id be dead too yes thats why it was best you grow up not knowing too much it made you safer it made you happier her mind was struggling to absorb just how thoroughly shed been duped theyd all been duped for decades what happened to my greatgrandfather he never left tibet then who lived and died in the cabin ill explain all that on our journey but first let me introduce myself he moved into the light and held out a hand in a leather glove involuntarily she stepped back his skin wasnt just pale it was partly translucent hinting at the muscle structure beneath like the rubber of a yellow balloon stretched over someone who had been skinned his eyes were bloodshot and feverish his hair iron gray and his frame thin cadaverous like an ascetic prophet or concentration camp victim he looked gaunt fanatic ethereal what was wrong with him hello rominy he smiled his teeth dull and worn you are witness to a miracle im kurt raeder im the man who slew your greatgrandfather and ive been waiting for this moment for more than seventy years wewelsburg germany october present day r ominy and sam were marched down stairs even deeper than the tower crypt to the hexenkeller the witches cellar and shoved inside a whitewashed stone cell by otto the room was barren and cold youll be leaving in the morning the skinhead nazi said to rominy see that you get some rest what about sam her friend was leaning painfully against one wall we dont need him anymore a twoinchthick heavy oak door slammed shut they heard a bar drop over it the only ventilation was a tiny grilled window in the thick castle wall too high to reach and too narrow to crawl through there were two mattresses on the floor with woolen military blankets sam sat down heavily on one groaning it crackled straw welcome to the middle ages there was a single lightbulb in a protective cage high overhead and no switch they could see to turn it off a bucket was apparently supposed to serve as a toilet there was no water and no privacy ill never complain about motel six again rominy kneeled by him are you all right sam no im not all right rominy ive been shot in the chest forced to walk out of the wilderness and clubbed in the kidneys and dont get me started about the leg room and inflight meal on the airline im a disaster for everyone who comes into contact with me poor mrs clarkson mrs clarkson apparently never came into contact with you at all dont blame yourself for what these lunatic murderers have been up to were victims of madmen led by a guy who looks like he climbed out of a coffin if a bat flies through that little window im giving up he shifted and groaned that couldnt be kurt raeder hed be over a hundred years old doesnt look a day over ninetynine did something happen to make him live this long who knows these may just be inmates from the local asylum next up will be a guy with a charlie chaplin mustache giving a hitler salute and another with a bicorne hat and his hand tucked into his waistcoat at least we were right about the atom smasher theyve been waiting for it to go to full power how are they going to make use of it its a big international science project i have a feeling these nazis arent going to ask permission he looked at the door and apparently we dont get a vote so what now she sat next to him having no idea but the worst choice would be surrender i think wed better starting acting and not reacting i think wed better make some plans t he cell light never went out and they dozed as best they could on the thin scratchy mattresses there was no heat and the temperature hovered somewhere between barely tolerable and freezing rominy crawled to sams mattress and curled inside him as shed done in the wilderness of tibet there was a comfort to it more profound than anything shed felt with jake sam put his arm around her and actually managed to doze while she thought fretfully he groaned sometimes in his sleep so the thinnest light from a gray dawn was just penetrating their distant window when he abruptly sat up what is it she whispered i hurt sam im sorry thats okay it woke me up enough to think rominy theyre going to take you somewhere maybe the collideri dont know whyand kill me its the only thing that makes sense so the only thing that makes sense to me is to get clear of these thugs and come after you so thats what i have to do just save yourself her tone was hopeless no thats what people like this count ontheir enemies just trying to save themselves and being picked off one by one do you know what a fascist is like a nazi extreme rightwing the term came from mussolini in italy and he got it from the romans in ceremonies roman leaders would carry a bundle of sticks called fasces it symbolized the strength that comes from sticking together any one of the sticks could be broken but if bundled in a bunch they were unbreakable the gauls or the germans might have the biggest warriors but when they ran into the bundled power of a roman legion pow the barbarians lost mussolini liked this idea and called his followers fascists how do guys carry so much trivia around so so weve got to become fascists too work together he rubbed his hands im going to save you rominy thats very sweet but youre not a roman doesnt matter ive got a crush on you sam she didnt want to start something shed quickly lose you cant help it youre cute its just biology forget about it but ive got an idea for a weapon and an idea of where youre going that atom smasher when you get there youve got to figure out some way to let me know exactly where you are and then what his smile was a tight white line in the gloom we avenge your family u rsula kalb came for rominy soon after dawn dressed in a business suit and stylish pumps she looked like a corporate vice president come the construction workers will arrive soon and we must be out of here by then their boss is a believer and gives us good cover but not all his men know about us rominy remained sitting on the mattress im not going without sam that is not your choice then im not going kalb struck like a snake the woman stepped forward and jerked rominy up with surprising strength and slapped her shockingly hard and blindingly fast once twice across the face the blows knocked her head sideways and her eyes spurted tears you think i am a patient person like our fuhrer kurt raeder you come or i sic a real dog on you not those mutts you saw in america come leave her alone the german dragged rominy to the door otto is coming for you she said to sam the guide was rubbing his lower back and eyeing frau kalb with malice but the german kept rominy between her and mackenzie her nose wrinkled as she held the young woman little pig a shower first and then we go sam her hands were outstretched but he hung back goodbye rominy he said it with resignation the farewell of a doomed man they had rehearsed this wait she tried to yank away from kalb but the womans grip held her like a manacle remember what i told you sam said flatly please dont hurt him and then they were out of the cell and the door slammed shut f or half an hour sam heard little then there was the faint sound of doors slamming a car starting and tires crunching on gravel quiet he was thirsty and hungry but he was betting they wouldnt just leave him to rot otto would want to have some fun he stretched and loosened trying to get ready he trembled from anticipation fear was good fear made him ready he heard the faint sound of electric saws and pounding hammers the construction crew had arrived finally there was the tread of boots coming down the stairs outside and then the scrape of the bar being lifted the door opened to reveal otto not in a suit this time but in loose combat pants tucked into his army boots he wore a black turtleneck and bomber jacket now we play yes he smirked youre a skinhead goon otto dont you need to wait until my back is turned the nazi shook his head i dont think so not for you you look like a pussy man you know that word look i have no weapon bare hands like you maybe you can teach me a lesson ive been a very bad boy the skinhead took a step in and closed the door so the workers arent disturbed yes sam braced balling his hands and putting them up im a lover not a fighter otto sneered you sleep with your woman no i will rape her when this is over i think maybe she will be a screamer his own hands went up opened to chop but i can make the girls promise not to tell he smiled evilly imagining it then he weaved slightly like a boxer as he advanced into the cell sam swallowed his eyes flickering with fear his voice quavering with false bravado where did it go wrong otto bad parents wrong crowd bullied at school i just like to hurt things the german jabbed sam ducked to one side but the punch was just a feint ottos boot swung up a wicked arc that swung across the cell and kicked the american in the side mackenzie gave a bark of pain and went over landing on his mattress ow he cried he groaned holding himself oh fuck get up i want to kick you again sam crawled toward a corner of the cell gasping leave me alone so the german came after him grasping his shirt to haul him upright no i think we play some more sam raised his hands to cover his face fists clenched he was sobbing otto felt revulsion the american was a woman the german spat at him to try to get a reaction sam just cringed it was like beating dead meat mackenzie reached to clutch at his captor please please this was so pathetic it wasnt even fun otto decided he would bounce sams head against the stonework he would bounce it and bounce it and count how many times it took to crack and then the german felt the most excruciating pain of his life sams fist suddenly slapped the side of the nazis head and it was as if someone had inserted a hot needle into his ear something sharp and wicked rammed piercing the ear canal and driving deep into his skull my god he could feel it sliding in like the mandible of an insect as if burrowing from one side of his head to the other the agony was electric unbelievable explosive what had the bastard done did he have a knife or pick the german opened his mouth to scream then sams other fist plunged something into his right eye it pierced through ottos eyeball the pain was like fire blood spurted from his socket he was paralyzed with horror too shocked for a moment to react the delay was catastrophic because then the other eye was blinded by another excruciating splinter and otto exploded backward launching himself off his unexpected tormentor and crashing back against the door of the cell he clawed at his face shrieking boots scrabbling there were sticks in his eyes he was blind where had the american gotten them his back arched in agony he slid to the floor a boot came down on the nazis nose and it broke exploding and then on his teeth they cracked otto couldnt react his muscles wouldnt obey because the pain was like an electrocution he was accustomed to hurting not being hurt then he dimly felt hands clawing at his turtleneck hauling the collar down and something very thin and very sharp sliced deep very deep into his neck his jugular geysered when he opened his mouth to scream no sound came out s am sat back wheezing he was sprayed with blood ottos corpse was frozen in a spasm of pain back arched boots twitching crimson spurting from his neck until it stopped like a depleted gusher oh lord hed just killed a man and in the most brutal way possible he hadnt been sure it would work the anger had been easy to summon but to actually do it he surveyed his handiwork his makeshift weapons jutted from ear eyes and throat fasces sam knew it was unlikely he could beat otto in a fistfight he was already halfcrippled from the earlier beating and had no martial arts training so hed pondered some advantage or weapon he could obtain then the word fascist had popped into his head and hed remembered where it came from what did he have to work with in this bare cell straw the only thing they had in their lousy mattress it was stiff and prickly but weak if each stalk was taken alone but a bundle carefully shaped like a sharpened pencil and reinforced with more straw wrapped around its shaft became a crude stiletto if rammed into something vulnerable sam had fashioned four of them each with the strength of a quill and practiced hiding them in his fists and sleeves then hed pondered how he could get otto close enough to use them by playing coward now the arrogant skinhead was dead and the weird thing was it didnt feel completely horrible it felt good shakily sam stood he felt like hed just been pummeled in a football game but he was breathing and otto wasnt he spat at the man for good measure rape rominy i dont think so nazi shit shuddering with release he cracked open the door what if more of them were out there then youre already dead sam no different from five minutes ago one step at a time man but the hall was empty he stepped out otto had left a pistol a menacing black one on a bench probably to make things fair how thoughtful skinhead above he could hear the bang and clump of the construction workers which meant there must be vehicles out there sam crept up the stairs and turned to the gate that led to the crypt then across the basement room and out the rear door to the dry moat if anyone saw him hed look like some lunatic jihadist with his blood and pistol but no it was still very early and the worker guys were all inside a plumbing van had keys so he drove carefully through the village parked the vehicle behind a shed and retrieved his bmw he popped the trunk their belongings were still inside including passports and rominys remaining cash slowly not wanting any attention from police he drove out of wewelsburg in a stand of trees by the river he stopped to wash rinsing his clothes as best he could and putting them back on wet hed crank up the beamer heater he had a little cash a pistol and their hunch about where kurt raeder and jake barrow or jakob were going he had a young woman who didnt deserve any of this and he had just maybe a world to save sam mackenzie necessary who woulda thunk it wewelsburg germany october present day r ominy had been given a shower coffee and a german pastry by a stonefaced ursula kalb plus a reassuring smile that was not at all reassuring by the ghostlylooking kurt raeder then she was shoved into the backseat of a big black german mercedes solid as a tank and smelling of money apparently being a nazi fanatic paid very well rominy had never been in a mercedes before and this one had leather seats an engine that purred like a puma and wood trim as shiny as a violin she felt intimidated they drove south very fast the tires taking curves in the bucolic german countryside as if they were on a train track whats going to happen to sam she asked raeder he was sitting next to her in the backseat with jake in the front passenger seat as ursula drove raeder was looking straight ahead without turning he said do you know that ive been waiting for this moment since if you hurt sam i wont help you sam is on his way to a plane back to the united states dont worry about sam she hoped that was true but didnt think so had this man killed her parents and grandmother too was he really more than a century old i cant believe youre kurt raeder he must have been born near you look weird but not like youre one hundred and ten or something ill take that as a compliment and i dont believe your liar jakob up there intended us to escape from tibet he boasted that there was no way to unlock the door when he sealed us in and there wasnt from inside she wanted to provoke some reaction beyond smug superiority were going to an atom smasher arent we we are going rominy to the large hadron collider operated by cern the european organization for nuclear research it operates a seventeenmile circular tunnel capable of accelerating subatomic particles to percent of the speed of light he clicked off every decimal as if taking credit for it nothing like this has been achieved since the days of shambhala for me its a homecoming its a return to what i found in tibet why me that will become clear in due course in the meantime i think ill tell you a story you asked last night about the body found in a cabin in americas cascade mountains do you want to know whose body that was yes it was elizabeth calloway an aviatrix who flew benjamin hood from china to tibet jakob tells me youve heard of her i thought she was my greatgrandmother but i learned in tibet my greatgrandmother was actually a nun named keyuri lin she killed herself and almost killed her baby my grandmother ah keyuri is a sad story but jake told me the body was my greatgrandfather benjamin hood jakob told you a lot of things to make happen what is necessary to happen but now that youre with us rominy much more can be explained we can share the truth so you come to trust me i want to tell you what happened by telling you about me what i was and what i am how can you be kurt raeder because i was changed yes i am more than one hundred years old even though i have the body of a much younger man he glanced at her skepticism all right just younger i can only assume that such transfiguration was for a purpose a higher purpose dreams that were ashes in are about to be revived of nazi conquest of human transformation she put her hands to her temples i wish i was home you are home hear me out jake turned in the front seat we do care about you rominy he sounded like an insurance salesman betting she wouldnt die to collect she stuck her tongue out at him and he flushed in raeder began i led a scientific expedition to tibet wed heard legends of an ancient lost kingdom called shambhala and national socialism took the initiative to investigate keyuri was a scholar who had studied old records she agreed to act as our guide working together we found a hidden valley and an underground city where we found the lake correct unfortunately just as we were beginning our research we were interrupted by benjamin hood who came in shooting he literally destroyed what would have been the greatest archaeological discovery of all time keyuri managed to escape with the staff that jakob has since recovered for us but my companions were all killed and as hood attacked he set off explosions that wrecked the valley youre the victim here she said drily no we both wanted to possess shambhala but i hoped its secrets would yield a higher purpose not some cheap exhibit in a dusty new york museum hood would have bottled shambhala but i wanted to harness it in any event there was a machine we believe was related to todays colliders it shattered and threw out a blinding light and thats the last thing i remember none of which would have happened if you hadnt led nazis to shambhala i awoke thrown on the side of a mountain my body in a state id never felt before youre familiar with the process of photosynthesis by which plants absorb and use the suns energy i felt i was absorbing energy too but from a new and wondrous source its not just that my flesh tingled it felt like i was aware of every cell every capillary ever corpuscle i saw the world i was familiar with and at the same time a different world of shimmering force fields a veil had been lifted the blind had been given sight its impossible to accurately describe but if you think of the aurora borealis or the galactic clouds of gas photographed by the hubble space telescope you have some idea of the beauty of whats all around us all the time that were ignorant of i thought id died and become a ghost and in a way you had said jake yes i was still alive and hungry and susceptible to heat and cold and all our other environmental burdens but id somehow been infused with new dimensions of power as well i was enormously confused of course but over the decades ive come to suspect id broken into a part of our universe we cant yet perceive we nazis called it vril modern physicists talk of dark energy and dark matter we cant see it but we can see its effects on the universe we do see it helps hold galaxies together and accelerates the expansion of the cosmos its rather like a child recognizing the reality of air or watching a bending tree from inside a house and realizing its windy outside kurt had become a shambhalan jake said a new man like the superman dreamed of by german theorists the next step in evolution the master race rominy said that term has been besmirched by history but yes said raeder hominids became human neanderthals gave way to homo sapiens are humans never to evolve again or is there a higher destiny wed no time to determine where shambhala came from was it simply an act of early human genius that somehow ran afoul of some calamity was it a work by space visitors who subsequently left was it the product of early gods from other dimensions whom weve squeezed out in our narrow perception of existence ive considered all these things what if satyrs and dryads and minotaurs were once real what if whatever the shambhalans found killed them rominy asked the notes we found talked of bones raeder shrugged or transformed them transfigured them for escape and elevation if not for hood we might have answered such things instead ive been wandering for decades waiting for our own science to catch up to that of the shambhalans ive become a very patient man why did my greatgrandfather die and you didnt i wasnt at all sure he did die i awoke to total disorientation i was no longer at shambhala id been displaced like a subatomic particle to a spot some distance away it was as if the entire experience had been a dream or shambhala had vanished i wouldnt learn about the nunnery and beth calloway until much later i wouldnt hear rumors that the staff hood stole had survived until much later when gold and terror persuaded some fallen nuns i wouldnt learn about the lake until jakob here returned from tibet so i set off on foot weary but buoyed by this curious new energy knowing the british would likely try to capture and torture me for what i knew i made my way west through the hindu kush begging working and stealing i survived blizzards and bandits in afghanistan i was briefly enslaved in kandahar i finally came to persia there i contacted german embassy personnel and was eventually flown to berlin by then alas the war had started and travel back to tibet became impossible id been exiled like adam and eve from eden youre not adam and thats no eden he paid her no mind no one knew what to make of me my appearance had changed not as drastically as you see now but people responded to me as an oddity a freak the yellow ghost i seemed infused with light and babbling nonsense my superiors kept me out of the way in obscure research work then came barbarossa he paused whats that rominy finally asked shed heard the name but had no idea what it meant the code word for the invasion of the soviet union in barbarossa was a medieval german hero a crusader king and the world assumed the code word was simply taken from history a few of us knew better it was the blood of frederick barbarossa that won us admittance to shambhala and i was determined to return it was the one thing that could win the war barbarossa was not just to conquer russia it was to reopen the way to tibet but you didnt conquer it no raeder looked sad lost in memory i accompanied the panzers driving toward the caucasus but we were turned back and then trapped at stalingrad i was captured when paulus surrendered and transported east to a soviet prison camp yet shambhala was as far away as ever i had unusual powersi could see what other men cant and sometimes disable men with my willbut my capability wasnt mastered or consistent i couldnt walk through the soviet union to tibet instead i took an opportunity to escape and head northeast into the siberian wilderness toward its junction with alaska i waited until autumn knocked down the blackflies and froze the worst of the mud and then raced the onset of winter the natives recognized me as something strange and gave me a skin boat to get rid of me i paddled across the bering sea and made my way to alaska pretending to be a wrecked merchant seaman suffering from amnesia eventually i reached seattle was given the necessary american papers i claimed id lost and took the train to new york i wanted to track down benjamin hood but at the museum of american history i was told hed never returned from tibet even more mysteriously his office papers had been shipped at the request of the united states government to a federal agent named duncan hale and there the trail ended i had no way to effectively hunt for hood in a foreign country as a german national i was wary of approaching hale and being arrested as a spy by now it was and clear that the end was near finally the fuhrer died and the mongol hordes seized berlin everything wed dreamed of had crumbled except for killing millions of innocent people raeder looked disapproving then came news of the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasakifar more indiscriminate than anything germany had doneand inspiration came here was terrifying new atomic energy that would change the course of power politics what if there was another rival energy what if there was vril i wrote hale an anonymous letter explaining that the american naturalist benjamin hood had found just such a power and was in hiding somewhere in the united states why look for my rival when your government would do it for me i didnt have to follow hood i only had to follow hale which i did much to my surprise he traveled to seattle the very city id used to enter the united states and then north to the area where you and jakob visited the cabin i bribed people to alert me where hale might be going a practical consideration had occurred to rominy didnt you have to work how did you get the time and money to do all this there was still a network of nazi sympathizers in the united states the fbi thought theyd caught all our agents but they hadnt i looked up members of the old germanamerican bund and was eventually put into contact i had a team following hale to concrete and cascade river yes our plan was for hale to confront hood have him seize whatever the zoologist had or knew and then ambush them both in the cabin it was too late for hitler but if we could return to germany with a secret as potent as the atomic bomb a secret revival could begin the fourth reich said jake purer and better than the third hitler made mistakes raeder conceded which this time well avoid jake amended unfortunately raeder went on it was at the cabin that the real mystery began we didnt find hood we found beth calloway dead of a gunshot wound nor could we find duncan hale until jake and i found his corpse in that mine my guess is there was some kind of showdown between hale and beth jake said gunshots a mine cavein we wont ever have the whole story but in the secret seemed lost and moot raeder said shambhala was closed off and the staff id had was shattered in the explosions the legend was lost and yet i couldnt let it go i snuck back into tibet in the turbulent s and heard rumors that a surviving relic had been locked away by keyuri lin who was gone there were also stories of a child taken to america i began to put two and two together i guessed there was another blood lock meaning the only one who could open it was the missing child your halftibetan grandmother but even if we found a surviving staff what would we do with it the machine to energize it had been destroyed so i decided to wait immortality gives you patience said jake youre immortal rominy asked raeder raeders smile was stretched like rubber over those worn teeth unfortunately not just extended vril does not end the aging process as we hoped but it has prolonged it by halting the natural aging process in the telomeres of my cells we have a fuse that burns down but in my case the fuse got snuffed i get sick i feel pain but i persist which meant that no one followed the progress of subatomic physics more avidly than i this i realized was the answer so i began to recruit promising young scientists and encouraged them to enter the field we are a fraternity within a scientific fraternity with political goals as well as scientific ones to bring back nazi barbarism to resurrect the aryan and with it a new germany a germany of the kind envisioned by national socialism but better firmer truer pure evolved cleansed the leader of mankind a race as superior to the rest of our species as homo sapiens were to neanderthals it will start with vril rominy this secret energy i was the first to find with vril and with you im not cooperating with any of this you have the right blood rominy were going to expose you to this new light this new science and turn you with me into the first shambhalans large hadron collider geneva switzerland october present day b etween lake geneva and the jura mountains a platter of farm and industrial land hides the largest supercollider on earth it is built in a tunnel seventeen miles in circumference and more than feet underground split into eight arcs and interrupted by four gigantic detectors the size of dam powerhouses these trace the invisibly small particle collisions that the device creates the cern collider consumes enough electricity to power the homes of geneva switzerland it creates vacuums that in total equal in size the nave of a great cathedral it uses liquid helium to cool its superconducting magnets that bend and accelerate the beams to nearly absolute zero the machines goal is to recreate on the tiniest scale the extremes of temperature and energy at the big bang and thus give a peek at the origin of the universe its particle beam is so sensitive that the tidal pull of the moon must be taken into effect when it whirls around its gigantic racetrack kurt raeder was determined to put this achievement to his own use physicists had made careful calculations to reassure the public that the large hadron collider would not create earthswallowing black holes or theorized strange subatomic quarks called strangelets that might detonate with matter what theyd not calculated was that the vast energies the machine focuses could be used to reconstitute the lost technology of shambhala instead a cabal of neonazi physicists secretly had our fellowship has been waiting for a long time rominy raeder lectured as the mercedes hummed along the lakeside boulevard in geneva headed toward the cern complex west of the city night had fallen and lights glinted in the lake waiting for science to catch up waiting for the blood heir we needed which was you and waiting for generations of our ideological followers to graduate with physics degrees and infiltrate the subatomic fraternity yes we have allies not just scientists but guards administrators public relations personnel science writers mechanics custodians and suppliers for half a century ive been constructing a web of loyalists a mafia if you will who have been working toward this day the large hadron collider itself has been a project twenty years in the making youre claiming that nazis built the supercollider no a few who helped are national socialists or in more contemporary terms conservative visionaries and our broader fellowship plans to use it to borrow it our members extend to the very highest ranks of government and finance think about it why are the worlds organizations spending more than six billion dollars to slap protons together six thousand million dollars they raised this for a science project yes many of those involved naively believe the supercollider is for pure science in their ignorance they are our most valuable allies the american physicist leon lederman used the term god particle to explain the search for the higgs boson a property that could explain why matter exists at all scientists are very clever and they have succeeded in capturing the publics imagination but youre smarter than all of them rominy said sarcastically he smiled but governments and business want more out of this underground cathedral weve constructed they want power for their investment and so we promised if they built it we would deliver magic of a kind never seen before and turn the balance of power on its head northern europe will regain its rightful role as ruler of the world those bureaucrats who have backed construction and development think the secret benefits will be shared yielding discovery that will remake economies and technology they envision an era of unparalleled prosperity but those closest to me know that the mysteries of shambhala must not be shared that democracy is a jewish idea that poisons society and that these discoveries are by rightful bloodline the inheritance of the aryan governed by national socialism and will be used to establish our reign on earth if you want to call that nazism so be it he was obviously mad but that didnt mean a cabal of madmen couldnt wreak havoc hadnt that been the cause of world war ii and out of it had come the atom bomb and now this but you needed the staff hidden in shambhala she clarified this machine wasnt enough he looked at the window at the dark lake yes we dont really understand how the staff worked or how to duplicate it but if it can be made to work now we can begin to study and replicate eventually well have legions of staffwielding aryans imposing their will by the force of their thought they will strum the consciousness that undergirds the universe well play the cosmic music and reconfigure the world what did you mean about us becoming the first shambhalans that you will be envied by every woman in the world what we are about as i explained is human evolution we cant go on as advanced apes armed with atomic bombs and spewing a million tons of carbon a day we have to evolve to reach a higher plane we need to reproduce selectively to accelerate mankinds biologic destiny so weve been searching for candidates they sped on a boulevard she saw an airport hotels office buildings and the cozy rectangles of lighted apartment windows a world of normality that seemed impossibly far away what quiet domestic life was plodding along there a pot of tea a tv show a book and the silken warmth of a cat on someones lap children in their beds a glass of wine with a loved one all lightyears away shed already tried the handle of the mercedes useless like the handle of jake barrows truck hadnt her mother told her never to get in a car with strangers how was she going to stop this if sam didnt come then they were approaching a sculptured sphere lit by floodlights that rose above a lawn like a representation of what the earth the atom the cosmos it was rust red driedblood red what the hell does that mean she pressed reproduce selectively that will be explained at the moment of transfiguration ah here we are they were pulling into a parking lot at a complex of large mostly windowless blandly boxed research buildings of the kind stamped out all over the world like pieces of a game of risk there was a word on one atlas hadnt he held up the cosmos will you give me your hands please my hands just lift them up hesitantly she did so keeping balled in her fist something shed held tightly as a teddy bear since wewelsburg raeder smoothly reached out and snapped handcuffs on her wrists just so you wont hurt anything or yourself routine precaution then the sedan doors opened and strong military hands pulled her out into the chilly air someone snapped something on her ankle a tracking device jake said please dont try to run we have dogs and tasers yep thats quite the boyfriend you picked rominy shed felt this way only one time before on a gurney wheeling down a sterile hospital hallway for removal of her appendix lights passing overhead like flickering suns doors hissing open and shutting behind her like portals to hell shed been ten and terribly frightened now she felt numbing dread as she realized that the last weeks had been a long sickening plummet into an abyss six billion dollars to find a particle absurd raeder said as they walked toward the building but six billion dollars to manipulate those particles and with them the world itself thats a bargain six billion dollars of taxpayer money to seize power for yourself to rule to monopolize to become unbelievably rich by reducing lesser races to slavery their natural state thats why so many were persuaded to help us some with doubts were bribed others blackmailed any wouldbe heroes suffered untimely accidents weve been very thorough they stopped at a door greenuniformed guards with black berets and belts weighted with equipment were clustered there one of them stepped forward we can only guarantee control of the sector until the morning shift reichsfuhrer he said addressing raeder rennsler is still in the dark but when he comes to work hell mobilize the rest of security against us after that it will be on the news and everything will come crashing down the german nodded if our calculations are correct the remaining night will be time enough once we demonstrate the staff theyll give us time to complete our mission key government officials will stand with us and if not they cannot stand against us once we have vril the man gave a stiffarmed salute fellowship fellowship they passed inside as they did rominy let the thing shed held in her hands fall kicking it against a drainpipe a milliontoone shot but when there was no hope those were good odds the next door was stronger and here waited a cluster of men who looked like academics one had the proverbial white jacket but the others were casual in khakis or jeans they looked nervous but none showed any surprise at her handcuffs whitejacket greeted raeder and then stepped to a keypad next to the door and typed in a code then he put his eye to a small eyepiece above it retinal scan jake said to rominy standing close like he was still her freaking boyfriend maybe he thought he still would be once the master race had established control she looked away and tried to psychically relay waves of revulsion at him but if he detected her contempt he gave no sign the door opened and they entered a shaft landing stairs led downward into gloom next to it was an elevator shaft elevator doors opened and a dozen packed in rominy squeezed by aspiring nazi lunatics her handcuffed hands held humiliatingly in front of her men glanced at her curiously and she wanted to spit in their face should she make a scene but what could she do she was utterly alone at the spire of a scientific cathedral buried in the bowels of the earth the elevator disgorged them just one floor down another door and another retinal scan and then they passed into a control room banks of computers and video screens taking up an otherwise bland offwhite windowless space industrial carpet mesh office chairs laminate counters the screens showed columns of numbers graphs and video camera scenes of tunnels and huge machines she assumed the videos were showing parts of the supercollider it looked as colorful as a tinker toy then she started three bodies lay facedown on the floor against one wall with a cowl of blood around their heads and neat round holes in the backs of their skulls it was easier to dispose of them than try to persuade them the security chief said raeder nodded theres no turning back well put up a plaque sacrifices to human evolution the scientists who had ridden the elevator with them scattered to the screens now there was a faint whine as something was started up a faint odor of oil and ozone it will take about an hour to regain full power one of the men said time enough to get the girl into position jakob rominy follow me she hesitated wondering where best to make a stand but then the big cop guy stepped menacingly toward her so she reluctantly followed but took a moment to turn and stick her tongue out at the security chief too he took it in his expression not changing not a good sign on they marched meek little rominy like a little lamb to the slaughter software cubicleista to her newest duty proud feminist a dutiful two steps behind she began trying to guess how to blow things up she didnt even have chewing gum down an elevator again much farther this time dropping three hundred feet into the bedrock of the swissfrench border they came out into the nave of this colossal church of physics an enormous room four or five stories high and atop it a shaft the size of a missile silo that clawed toward the surface like the spout hole of a whale to look at the origin of the sky the physicists had delved underground like tolkiens cursed dwarves but what a wonderland theyd created the chamber was lined with tiers of catwalks like the balconies of an opera house plus pipes ducts great metal troughs crammed with cables cranes stairs ladders columns beams grids tanks levers air conditioners hatches it was a cornucopia of technology and the colors they were taken from a crayon set red green blue and yellow bright as legos and then spotless stainless shiny copper burnished bronze reflective blacks all glinting at each other like a hall of mirrors how had they ever conjured such magnificent complexity it was like the riot of color shed seen in the temples of lhasa it was not just science it was art not just instrument but beauty it hummed and buzzed and clicked and crackled like a childs toy and had the smell of a place entirely unnatural concrete paint oil grease rubber and plastic the particle detector was scrupulously clean absolutely sterile and yet as sensory as a field of wildflowers fluorescent light cast everything in a cold metallic glow it was another secret city like shambhala and somehow kurt raeder had penetrated this to corrupt it to recreate his lost ruin another scientist saluted them my god how many physicists had signed on for this craziness but then raeder if it was really raeder had been building toward this moment for seventy years an incongruous thought occurred did you ever open a bank account he turned what when you got back from tibet with compound interest you might be a rich man by now if youve really lived all those years hood did that or beth calloway i inherited he wasnt sure if she was joking and for the first time looked offbalance ive spent ever pfennig every moment every drop of sweat and blood on this dream too bad you could have retired by now and left us all alone jakob or jake pushed her from behind pay no attention to her kurt shes an idiot who will completely waste your time i wasted your time but then she felt the press of a gun barrel in the small of her back shut up and do as youre told her exlover said they walked a balcony heels drumming on textured metal walking into the technology like sperm penetrating the gigantic egg of this vast bulky machine centenarian raeder obscenely spry like an animated cadaver jakejakob robotic rominy mournful if the cathedral nave was complicated this tighter area deeper into the machine works was incomprehensible there were steel panels copper conduits and brightly colored pistons bobbins and spools she was making the words up because she had no idea what she was looking at the riotous assemblage of finely machined parts reminded her of pictures of rocket engines and submarines the barrelshaped thing was as big as the cross section of a small ship on its face triangular piepiece panels each the size of an apartment radiated out like the petals of a flower the stamen in the middle was a narrow pipe that jutted out and ran toward a tunnel beyond it reminds me of a sun wheel jake said all worship rightfully so goes back to the sun all life originates there they came to a smaller gallery leading to the jutting pipe there was an arched ceiling twenty feet overhead with a tracked crane spanning the gallerys width an orangecolored hook to hoist things dangled from it cables and chains dropped down to a narrow pipe little bigger than a household waterline which ran from the center of the vast machine this extended to a much larger pipe the size of a sewer line with the diameter of a manhole the big pipe was painted blue and extended into a tunnel as far as she could see it was like being inside a giant mechanical cocoon a section of the silvery smaller pipe had been removed and technicians were bolting a new apparatus in its place this new piece was about the size of a submarine torpedo and consisted of a cylindrical bundle of rods there was space between each rod connected with colored wires inside was a clear plexiglas tube the bundle reminded her of the fasces that sam had talked about she hoped his scheme had worked but she suspected otto had killed her friend by now the sadness added to her feeling of hopelessness then she noticed that there was another rod a staff lying horizontally in the midst of this new device its ends lined up with the narrow pipe it was the ambercolored staff jake had stolen from the chamber below the nunnery at the edge of shambhala it was kurt raeders magic wand the wizards staff the gun of vril my god they were going to recharge it hurry before the radiation levels climb too high raeder told the technicians they nodded we have our rem badges but you can hear the machine accelerating and indeed the background whine was rising there was a deeper rumble too of huge generators and pumps the lungs of the whale radiation her heart began to hammer rominy were at the end of our journey and i cant follow you any longer said jake not yet he was still pointing a pistol at her it looked like the kind the germans used in the old world war ii movies what were they called a luger at least he wasnt hanging around to have some kind of weird ss sex with raeder talking about spawning a new master race shed worried she was supposed to get it on with her kidnapper but then that couldnt be true could it she was part asian thanks to greatgrandma keyuri and mongrel american to boot so just what was she doing here the technicians twisted a few final bolts and stood thats it really just a harness to hold the staff in place the rest is up to the accelerator itself you may watch from the control room raeder said jakob youd better remove her handcuffs what if she panics theres nowhere for her to go im worried that with the electromagnetic energies involved that much metal might trigger something we havent planned for take the tracking device too i dont want the large amounts of electricity involved arcing into her body maybe i should stay with you kurt its too much of a gamble to risk both of us on vrils first manifestation raeder replied ive staked my life on this but if it doesnt work as expected i want you to survive to carry on rominy must be the seed carrier the what carrier she protested kurt turned to her as jake removed the cuffs and stooped to take off the ankle bracelet of the next evolution youre going to experience the fundamental energies of the universe as i have rominy it will stun you and frighten you but its quite survivable as you can see by looking at me you will be transfigured transformed it will feel good when its over youll absorb dark energy like a plant youll have a longevity that the ones left behind will long for and then youre going to carry my first child you are going to be as revered as the virgin mary he smiled plasticky lips stretched over worn teeth eyes sunken skin like wax she looked at him with horror and stay a virgin right we all know youre no virgin and no im not a god to inseminate you with my spirit im afraid well do it the oldfashioned way are you joking not with barrow but with him its a necessary step for the future the fuhrer dreamed of you want me to have sex with you my god youre a hundred and ten a hundred and twenty years old which doesnt matter youll see its just sex rominy jake added dont put so much meaning into it it sure as hell had no meaning to you did it he shrugged i enjoyed it well enough god why dont you just shoot me im afraid that isnt part of the plan jake said youre to be infused with the light as kurt was at shambhala and then bred no different than on the farm no this is crazy look at him hes hideous and im no aryan she was desperate you said yourself im part tibetan and who knows what else im the wrong blood youve got the wrong woman no we dont raeder said calmly how do you know that because jakob did all the dna tests back in the united states youre precisely who we thought you are she was sweating the younger man had stood closer and she longingly eyed his pistol but then he gave it to raeder and backed away ill wait in the control room he said himmlers dream kurt the older man nodded himmlers dream he watched barrow retreat she heard the click of a door closing now you learn who you really are who she asked who am i raeder youre my descendant rominy now there was a roaring in her ears what benjamin hood wasnt your greatgrandfather i was she looked at him in horror i possessed keyuri lin on the way to shambhala she insisted on sex with hood but it was my child she had in the nunnery thats why she tried to kill it but fate intervened in the person of beth calloway it was my dna that jakob brought to have tested in the united states with yours to prove the match to the bankers not that from hoods finger but you and i are separated by enough generations and now we you and i are going to have a childa superchild a master childtogether his eyes were bright his skin cracked his grin a deathshead grimace one of the powers of vril is that my sexual appetite hasnt slackened its increased he took a small leather folder from the breast pocket of his suit so have my tastes he flipped it open it held an array of bright shiny surgical instruments things to cut and pinch the whine of the machine climbed to a shriek matching her scream large hadron collider geneva switzerland october present day sam had gotten the beamer up to kilometers an hour which he calculated was somewhere north of mph faster than hed ever driven it was gray german autumn the autobahn his crowded racetrack and hed weaved past speeding trucks as if they were standing still the astonishing thing was that occasionally an audi or lotus kept pace with him what a crazy country he was gambling where theyd taken rominy and hoped he got there before the nazis found skewered otto back in wewelsburg or the german police came after him with too many questions it was dark by the time he got to switzerland and geneva where he promptly got lost because he was too hurried to ask directions thats dude thinking dude he finally got straighteverybody seemed to speak some englishand now it was the middle of the night as he drove more cautiously toward cern headquarters he was looking for something out of the ordinary and hoped to find rominy in the middle of it there was a weird globe thingy that looked like salvage from a worlds fair and a sprawl of office buildings in generic businesspark blah roads parking lots museum signs the whole nine yards so he was at one point in a seventeenmile underground loop he couldnt even see how was he ever going to find rominy and then there was a cluster of cars and men and bobbing flashlights by some boxy building that looked about as elegant as an airplane hangar so what was a cluster of men who looked like they were carrying assault rifles doing in the middle of the night in a science park he slowed had rominy left a sign as hed asked and then he saw it a scrap that would be taken for insignificant garbage at any other time it was the white of a khata scarf the scrap beth calloway had used in a cascades cabin to write a code in invisible ink rominy had dropped it bingo mackenzie youre not such a bad guide after all he murmured yep why were the worlds top physicists hanging out in a parking lot in the wee hours of the morning unless they were up to some nazinogood so all he had to do was what he had ottos gun but it was twenty to one at least how many skinhead sympathizers were there in the world anyway what he really needed was a bazooka or a battery of hawk missiles or the ability to call in an airstrike but hed left his pentagon calling card at home while the good ol usa would have had a neon reader board thirty feet high screaming guns and a cash register line of stubblehead goobers who looked like they shouldnt be licensed to handle screwdrivers everything in europe was very lowkey pacifist and urban cool where did you get your hands on an rpg launcher when you needed one especially on a continent where every town looked as dandy as disneyland he had to get inside and poke around for rominy which meant getting in the door which meant distracting the nazi goons which meant he let his car cruise by the cluster of crazies they eyed him like an la street gang but didnt budge then buildings shielded him from view and he looked around which meant driving fulltilt into something that said verboten and was decorated with skull and crossbones like those tanks behind a cyclone fence next to what looked to be some kind of laboratory double bingo he needed noise there couldnt be that many people whod signed on with that lunatic raeder which meant the more folks sam could pull into ground zero the more likely someone in authority would start asking the bad guys some awkward questions and if ottos murderous intentions were any indication sam mackenzie needed to hurry plan one suicide charge into a tank farm and hope the airbag worked and he was conscious enough to crawl out before he fried bad plan so how about plan two he parked in the shadows and popped the bmws trunk he took his backpack stuffed rominys passport and cash with his own belongings and slung it on his back there was an emergency kit inside with road flares there was also a doughnut spare tire just the size for what he had in mind he drove the bmw to within a hundred yards of the cluster of tanks aimed the wheels and used the jumper cables in the rental trunk to clamp the steering wheel to the passenger door handle that would keep his new robot car on course he hoped the beamer was still rumbling unaware of its impending sacrifice parking brake on he cradled the spare tire took it to the front seat and leaned in the rental company is going to be very very pissed he whispered to himself he jammed the spare forward under the dash on top of the gas pedal where it stuck snug as a cork the engine screamed parking brake off and as sam sprang backward the car howled that beautiful bavarian whine and shot forward it was his very own cruise missile the beamer accelerated like a drag racer tires smoking and hit freeway speeds at the collision point there was tragic beauty in how it ran straight and true the coupe smashed through the fence and plowed into the tanks knocking them sideways the bang of the collision echoed in the peaceful night air and he could see the white of the beamers airbags deployed as a building alarm began to sound there was a gush and the air smelled like propane the cars front end had accordioned steam erupting but nothing else had happened yet sam ran as close as he dared snapped a highway flare to light it and threw then he dashed away night flashed into day a fireball erupted skyward pieces of tank and car arcing outward like meteors then another explosion and another he could feel the heat and punches of air wow better than the fourth of july sam ducked into the shadows the swarm of men outside the hangarlike building had broken and were running toward the fire hed set shouting in german and french and waving guns in the distance he could hear sirens the concussions from the explosions had set off car alarms well its a start he glanced about and spied a utility pipe grating lifting it he saw metal rungs he jammed the pack behind them for temporary safekeeping then he trotted in the shadows toward his goal im coming rominy there was still a sprawl of cars and vans around the entrance but most of the nazi goons if thats what they were had been drawn off to investigate two remained at the door holding wickedlooking rifles sam didnt hesitate if he did his nerve would fail him he knew something awful was about to happen to the young woman hed come to like so much sam had ottos automatic tucked in the small of his back and a second or two of surprise he walked forward like he belonged the men raised their guns raeder sam demanded they hesitated one giving a nod inside and then thinking better of it triple bingo the nazi bastard was here all right which meant sams spectacular arson and wewelsburg killing just might be justifiable to the authorities in the unlikely event slacker mackenzie survived this night he strode for the door trying to look as important as the vips waved through the velvet rope at a nightclub rather than the cheap third world tourist guide he was attitude man the goons hesitated and sam guessed these werent hired paramilitary but just weekend nazis told to keep watch while the big dogs worked inside they shouted some german crap stoppen wer sind sie so he pulled the pistol and shot one of them in the leg necessity made you one motherfucker of invention didnt it the man yelped in surprise and fell writhing before the other could lift his assault rifle sam was on top of him his barrel pressed against the mans left eye droppen you nazi dick im tired of this shit as the mans gun fell he shoved him through the door slamming and locking it behind them schnell schnell he ordered pushing the man down a short corridor yeah ive seen the war movies a fusillade of shots stuttered through the door hed just locked the wounded man didnt care for being wounded apparently and was venting his frustration the bullet holes popped through the metal like expressions of surprise that was okay the noise would bring more police there was another door with a keypad next to it open it his prisoner shook his head his courage back after the surprise attack so sam shot him in the foot he yelled and hopped sam grabbing his shoulder and pistolwhipping his face open it he screamed he shook his gun or i kill you verstehen yeah he understood shaking the guard tapped some numbers nothing happened sam lifted his pistol to the mans temple one the man was sweating but frozen two surely this bastard knew how to count to three in english three is the last word youre going to hear fritz nothing thre he tightened on the trigger the guard lurched forward blood gushing from his foot mouth bruised and put his eye up against some kind of reader now there were shouts outside and more shots with a bang the outer lock disintegrated damn the nazi rescue posse had arrived theyd probably gotten tired of watching his car burn but now the door sam needed to get through was opening he brought down his pistol as heavily as he could on the guards head and with a crack the sentry went down then the american stepped through and the door slid shut as he did so he could see men bursting through the outer entrance and spying him they raised their guns sams door hissed to a close just as another volley of bullets hit it none penetrated good swiss engineering sam shot a keypad on his side hoping that would disable the opening mechanism and looked around there was an elevatora box to be trapped in he fearedand flights of stairs sam started down the stairs large hadron collider geneva switzerland october present day youre too young to fully understand the intellectual marathon i required to get to this point raeder said to rominy he regarded her with disappointment youre shaking please dont hurt me im going to pleasure you youll see pain is exquisite what could she use as a weapon everything was bolted wired fused there were danger signs and voltage warnings when we found shambhala raeder went on it had a machine much like this one but we were like cavemen contemplating a computer we had no idea really what it was for except that it seemed capable of energizing quite marvelous staffs then a blizzard of inventions radar television atomic bombs microwave ovens laser disks and more than these toys this incredible creation story being spun out by physicists a big bang a divorce between energy and matter thirteen billion years of galactic evolution and even a microscopic wonderland of particles too tiny to ever see which didnt even seem to follow the laws of nature or rather we had the laws all wrong at the most fundamental level moreover new kinds of energy and matter we cant even detect that nonetheless dominate the universe i began to understand what had infused and powered me and had infused and powered shambhala the legends of the vril society were based on truth so i began to seek out key young physicists who wanted to do more than just watch protons collide men and women with ambition vision a sense of history german scientists some but not all people of ruthless greed the ideals of national socialism have universal appeal nobody told you that you look embalmed some color actually came into his cheeks invigorated given my age potent as youll see she closed her eyes thats the last thing i want to see eventually i realized that shambhala had been a supercollider we began to theorize the staffs properties we didnt have one to study and no technology to make it but bright young men could calculate a molecular structure that might carry messages from the string realm and its curled dimensions to our own eventually we realized that the energy levels achieved by the large hadron collider at cern might be enough if properly diverted to activate a dark energy flow if it ran at full power what we needed was an actual staff and to get that we needed an actual heir and if you helped us how to reward you by making you mother of the new master race i dont want to be the mother of your damn race your stupid lectures are not seductive the whine was growing louder its destiny rominy accept your fate were locked together by blood he raised his pistol to aim at her face his arm rock steady there will be a flash of illuminating light such as youve never felt before and it will irradiate every cell in your body do not fear it will only purify not kill will it hurt her voice broke and she was struggling not to cry yes lights flickered the sound of the machines kept rising like a building hurricane inside its fascist cage the staff of shambhala began to glow i fell unconscious when it happened to me he added she glanced wildly about for some way to fight back all she saw was a web of pipes and power cables a hive of bus bars and warning signs in english french and german if she grabbed the wrong thing she would die but was that so bad given the alternative then over the shrill sound of the accelerator there was a more guttural rattling she looked up the crane had moved to a point directly above them and now from the shadows a great black chain that had been suspended like the cord of a swag lamp swung down with its heavy yellow hook it was arcing toward them a thousand pounds in weight as powerful as a scythe riding it was a wildeyed tour guide rominy get out of the way sam he was aiming a pistol raeder shouted in rage and aimed his own gun rominy leaped and bit his hand he howled both men shooting as sam swept down like some demented tarzan bullets ricocheting like popcorn rominy bit harder raeder snarling hurled her aside his strength immense inhuman she skidded on the slick floor but the chain which had been suspended above cut down through the tunnel air with the power of a wrecking ball clearing the cement floor by inches with a tremendous clang it smashed into the side of the metal cage where the shambhala staff glowed and knocked the whole apparatus askew sam went flying toward the piping on the far wall and hit the cables there was a crack like thunder and a flash as blinding as the sun then all light winked out with a groan the whine of the accelerator began to drop its power shortcircuited theyd blown the mother of all fuses apparently and much to her amazement rominy was still alive red emergency lighting came on sam lay like a dead man clothes smoking obviously electrocuted the great chain and hook had come to rest against the pipe it had ruptured the break sizzled and a fog was filling the room the klaxons of alarms were going off and she thought she could hear distant shooting where was raeder she got to her hands and knees she was shaking whether from fear or adrenaline she wasnt sure probably both she crawled to sam and bent to his lips the wispiest of breaths barely he was alive rominy looked around two pistols lay on the floor and half falling out of its bent cradle and still glowing faintly was the crystalline staff she could smell burning rubber and plastic then a figure staggered out of the smoke and mist it was kurt now he looked every bit his hundred and ten years gaunt lined exhausted furious he lurched toward her like a broken monster eyes filled with disbelief he displaced the magnets the german croaked proton beam it went out of alignment seven trillion volts she didnt understand what he meant but then she saw his head droop toward his torso his shirt had been sliced open and there was a thin black line etched halfway across his chest even as he stared it began to bleed the thinnest of sheets the idiot cut me in two then raeder collapsed now rominy could hear explosions in the rooms above shouts doors slamming it sounded like a battle she had to hide she no longer knew whom to trust except sam who had somehow miraculously escaped wewelsburg only to fry here should she stay with him take a gun then she saw motion at the far end of the balcony theyd used to get to this chamber she recognized the silhouette with sick dread it was jake a voice came into her head a presence shed never felt before take the staff she flushed and felt renewed from a burst of energy and knew instantly that shed heard the voice of benjamin hood she looked around was he here nothing but his spirit that was present take the staff she hesitated only a moment then she seized the crystalline rod stood and began a stumbling run into the tunnel where the big blue pipe ran the rod vibrated slightly making her palm tingle jake must not get his hands on the staff not when it might have absorbed the necessary energy so she fled in the only direction she could straight down an apparently endless tunnel she didnt know where else to go she began running faster as the shock wore off carrying the ancient artifact the tunnel gently curved she realized just as jake had said it would how long had he said the tube was seventeen miles she had to be marathon girl but there was no end really she could run and run and just get back to where she started again and again with nazis after her now she did begin to sob rominy it was jakes shout far behind and then she saw a bicycle large hadron collider geneva switzerland october present day for the first time rominy felt hope bicycles must be how the collider staff got from detector to detector she was pedaling madly down the endless tunnel the shambhala staff jutting forward from her grip like a knights lance it glowed all she had to find was some exit from which she could escape and hide in the woods she had no idea what was happening elsewhere in the giant machine but it was a battle she wanted no part of shed done enough kurt raeder was finally dead jake hadnt fired at her shed heard him running shouting but not shooting was there a glimmer of feeling there or was it too dangerous down here to shoot in any event there was only one bike now she pedaled madly away in the red glow of emergency lighting lungs heaving terrified and exultant leaving him behind where was everybody why was she the only one down here then she remembered raeder had said something about radiation and barrow had prudently retreated was the radiation gone now that the power had blacked out or was she irreversibly poisoning herself i just have to live long enough to hide rominy thought shed sneak through the woods like an animal not chancing a meeting with anyone afraid of her own shadow staff in hand then if she could find lake geneva shed hurl the cursed thing into the deepest part and let it sink like excalibur drowned like the rest of shambhala then she could finally grieve for an identity and a past in tatters the tunnel debouched into another large machine like the one where shed descended another temple of physics painted in brilliant colors she considered ascending to the surface there but it seemed too close to the battle behind her and too close to jake barrow balconies led her past it and onward to the tunnel on its far side particle detectors seemed to be spaced every few miles shed try the next one it felt good just to pedal and flee the tunnel was lit the color of hell klaxons blaring in the distance pipes extending to infinity shed entered the mythical underworld mile followed mile she was gasping now as weary and sore as shed ever been and her bicycle slowed surely jake was far behind the opposite side of the ring would be what nine miles away less as the crow flies but any farther would just bring her around and closer to the nazis again could she guess how far that was as she rode she noticed that blue lights in red boxes gave a flash as she passed them and they seemed spaced about every half mile say eight miles how many had flashed ten perhaps or five miles when she got anywhere close to sixteen and there was a way up shed try that and after lake geneva she had no money no passport no clothes and no friends sam was probably dying the police perhaps but who knew how many millions of dollars of damage she and sam had caused or deaths theyd initiated would the authorities be in on the conspiracy too yet prison if it came to that seemed a snug refuge right now or would they just take her into a courtyard and shoot her like in the movies or put her in a cell with nazis another blue flash it came on only when she whizzed by was her passage triggering the lights she looked down the bicycle had a small metal box attached with two screws to its frame it was blinking too like a beacon an airplane transponder an ankle bracelet oh no the blue lights were tracking her u p on the surface kurt raeders mercedes screeched to a halt at the compact muon solenoid detector at the far side of the collider ring ursula kalb had driven like a madwoman to let jakob get ahead of rominy and descend to cut the american off now he leaped from the passenger seat and leaned in for final instructions our second fuhrer is dead but the staff has been energized were going to have to start over ursula but well be able to demonstrate its potential for key allies well have more powerful backers than ever if you can get the staff from the girl even from here they could hear sirens the burning propane tanks threw lurid light into the sky police lights blinked from the atlas complex and they could hear the rattle of gunfire the nazi plan had turned into a disaster but she didnt say that her life her love had turned into disaster too but she didnt say that either the cause is not lost jakob said trust me rominy still has feelings for the man she knows as jake ill persuade her ill subdue her and when i come back to the surface with the staff well go into hiding to reorganize you must kill the american girl no shes still a breeder kalb looked out the windshield with gloom wait for me i wont be long if you are i wont wait understood if i dont return ursula nodded i have the cyanide she watched him jog toward the cms detector building as he entered to take the elevator underground a helicopter roared over the mercedes stabbing the grounds with a searchlight ursula kalb looked up kurt had moved too fast with insufficient preparation and had refused to listen to her caution the staffs recovery had excited him too much she admired his keenness but it had eroded his discipline the night was another stalingrad now catastrophically her lover was gone so as soon as the door closed behind the young believer she lowered the window and pitched out the poison pills and her fellowship identification she didnt want to have to answer awkward questions if stopped yes they would start again but not with a damned american girl bred to kurt raeder ursula didnt think jakob would emerge police were converging so she put the car in gear and began driving at the exact speed limit away from the collider she had prepared a safe house on the amalfi coast and by dawn she could be in italy she touched the leather it was a very fine mercedes but ursula kalb did not intend to leave geneva just yet there was a blood debt to be answered r ominy realized the nazis knew where she was she slowed the bicycle wondering what to do and then as she coasted toward the next junction point someone was standing in her way the figure was still but alert poised like a gunfighter she felt sick stupid trapped it was jake somehow hed gotten ahead of her her concentration lost her bike wheel wobbled it glanced off the pipe in the narrow walkway and suddenly she lost control her tire hit a flange and she cartwheeled over the handlebars landing hard and skinning her knees just like in the safeway parking lot the staff clattered down next to her wincing she boosted herself up on her arms glaring ahead at jake this was the bastard whod arranged to have her mini cooper thirtynine payments still outstanding blown into scrap metal whod lied to her imprisoned her handcuffed her and seduced her with his remorseless cunning and now he was smiling in triumph its over rominy he called my men are behind you too you cant escape because we still need that shaft this isnt what we wanted to happen for you or kurt but now were left to carry on the quest you and me for the master race for world harmony with all pollutants finally eradicated he aimed a pistol at her id hoped youd be our queen by now you are so sick he shook his head idealistic give me the shaft he stayed a cautious thirty feet away the automatic pointed i will shoot you if i have to you think you can hide from the police after this fiasco rominy we are the police she rocked back on her heels and painfully stood up at least i dont have to be raped by my greatgrandfather yes well have to find another adam and eve the shaft please she picked it up the material was smooth and warm a cross between plastic and carbon fiber and she wondered what it was made of it tingled when she touched it vibrating slightly and the glow it gave off was weirdly beautiful even hypnotic i was really falling in love with you jake he nodded it was for your own good just beyond him near where the tunnel joined the next connector point and detector there was a small blue tank hoses led to a white pipe that ran next to the tunnels large blue pipe and more pipes connected the two couplings were white with frost something very cold was in there lettering on the tank said he he who but no what did that mean something tickled from chemistry course work with the periodic table rominy retained more science than this man gave her credit for and she longed for something terrible to match her own coldness liquid helium she recalled was very very cold she pointed the staff at jake barrow careful with that jake warned dont make me shoot you she realized he was nervous she finally had a weapon had it received enough charge from the what had raeder called it a proton beam she took courage from jakes fright dont make me shoot you put your pistol down jake rominy we dont have time for this lets take time with the authorities your police and mine lets talk this out in an interrogation room somewhere i know youre rattled its understandable but what youre holding is very very dangerous please lower the tip before you hurt yourself if you lower the gun jake he hesitated thinking how can i trust you she gasped how can you trust me he lowered his pistol barrel slightly okay im moving my aim you do the same we need to talk rominy talk and think about the future she began aiming the shaft to one side keep your gun down jake im very jumpy me too dont point that rod at me its aimed at the wall aimed at that tank that said he how did her weapon work how could it work there was no trigger no switch were pioneers of science jake said right here right now how she longed that the vril staff would zap that creepy bastard so she poured all of her hatred of jake barrow into the core of her being infusing her very soul and let it pour down her arm and into her hand and from her hand to the shaft she wished with her consciousness for it to destroy that helium tank its not too late for you and me to make utopia jake tried suddenly she experienced unity but not the warm feeling of brotherhood shed experienced on a kunlun mountain this was a link to something vastly darker and frighteningly powerful terrifying and wonderful a momentary glimpse of a universe of strange matter and different energies that had always been invisible rominy saw its not too late to join us join me and with that something leaped with her thoughts to the helium tank like a subatomic particle jumping from one point to another with no intervening travel there was an explosion a corona of sparks and electricity arced into a minisun that dazzled her the tank blew apart air flashed into snow the staff hurt it kicked her hand and arm so hard that she lost her grip and flew backward as if with a mind of its own the staff recoiled in the other direction toward barrow and the haze rushing from the pipes rominy fell to the floor and skidded simultaneously fearing his gun the sparks the cold and the vast energies shed glimpsed she watched horrified as the staff came near him but no hed been paralyzed by the burst of helium as the liquid flashed to gas and obscured by the bits of ice suddenly filling the wickedly frigid air every droplet of water vapor in the tunnel having instantly turned to ice liquid helium with a temperature at nearly absolute zero erupted from the broken tank and turned to a fog that rolled along the ceiling rominy crawled in terror trying to hold her breath the cold punched her puffing past so empty that her lungs ached but at floor level she could gasp a feeble breath she looked back to watch as the shaft fell through the fog of expanding helium thirty feet away jake was looking at her in disbelief the helium had displaced the oxygen in the air and all he could suck into his lungs was frigid gas there was nothing he could breathe his eyes were wide and desperate his hands had hooked into claws instantly frostbitten his joints had gone rigid his lungs flash froze and cracked it was as if hed become a statue a man turned to stone and then the staff of shambhala its light gone now since rominys explosive thought fell through the freezing fog and turned brittle when it hit the concrete floor it shattered the rod disintegrated into a thousand pieces of dusty glass jake toppled his eyes wide and sorrowful and the mist swirled on snow falling walls coated with frost rominy was covered with rime too she slithered on her belly to get away there was a box ahead with an oxygen mask more alarms were going off and there were shouts then she reached grabbed rubber and pulled it to her face she shuddered from the icy envelopment and blacked out geneva switzerland october present day the cantonal hospital of the university of geneva kept rominy and sam apart for two weeks she healed from cold burns and bruises and he battled for his life tests were run questions asked police american embassy personnel officials from cern and physicists all interviewed her some coaxing some cruel some sympathetic and all suspicious the neonazis had apparently died or disappeared so officials asked what were they after why had they taken over a particle accelerator how had they taken over rominy put the same questions back to her interrogators she trusted no one anymore we are the police she told the authorities that she and sam were dumb tourists whod stumbled onto a group of fanatics at wewelsburg castle while trying to poke about the ss shrine after hours it had been a foolish lark that resulted in being taken hostage sam had gotten away and helped rescue her there hadnt been time to call the police so hed heroically started a fire and nearly died fighting her captor and how did you and mr mackenzie meet miss in tibet he was a guide we hit it off chinese records show you had permits to go toward the kunlun mountains thats a very unusual destination at the beginning of autumn it was silly we never got there but you were with another gentleman a mr barrow traveling under a false passport as mr and mrs anderson he was in a hurry to get to china jake and i broke up and what became of mr barrow i have no idea and you turned to mr mackenzie as a friend the tibetan tourist season was ending we decided europe would be restful she laughed and then coughed the damage to her lungs would heal with time doctors said was sam mackenzie your lover thats a rather personal question isnt it he seemed unusually motivated to rescue you we rescued each other were just trying to understand ms pickett am i under arrest or something no then i think ill keep my love life to myself once shed woken in the hospital she realized no one would tell her the entirety of what had happened at the supercollider or who the conspirators were they didnt want the world to know nazis had invaded a scientific temple they didnt want to revealor perhaps they didnt knowwhat the fellowship was after so she began to piece together where she was and what had happened from memory comments from her interrogators and snippets of news while guarding what she remembered like a chinese gold coin how could she be certain what side anybody was on there was another reason for being coy she was tired of this madness and simply wanted to disappear as beth calloway had disappeared three generations before the helium breach no idea how it occurred the frozen corpse no idea who the victim was shed been fleeing the chaos when a man appeared and an explosion occurred the oddly aged old man cut almost in two by a beam of subatomic protons before the collider shut down another nazi nut she guessed hed certainly looked strange her own presence at cern they said id be a bargaining chip in case they got cornered i dont remember much else i was terrified and confused that was true enough you have a nasty scar on the palm of your hand a pocketknife accident we were camping in tibet and the glassy staff fragments on the tunnel floor intriguingly no one mentioned them she didnt either but she wondered if somewhere somehow laboratory tests were being done or if some janitor had swept them into a dustbin sending the secret texture of the universe to a landfill would authorities eventually find the same old records on her family that jake barrow had would somebody someday come after her again would she live in fear the rest of her life rominy had seen a brief press report in the international herald tribune genevaattempts by the european nuclear agency or cern to reach fullpower operation of its large hadron collider lhc here were dealt a serious setback tuesday when an electrical arc from a faulty bus bar broke a tank of liquid helium the accident killed eleven cern employees and will likely shut down the facility for months if not longer repairs could take a full year said franklin rutherford the american operations manager for the international consortium operating the machine the damage is quite extensive and we want to make sure we identify the causes so there wont be a repeat of this terrible industrial tragedy as you can imagine its been quite stressful for all of us at cern a faulty connection in superconducting magnets caused a similar delay at the lhc in late asked if there was a fundamental design flaw in the supercollider rutherford replied i think weve just had a run of bad luck these are very complex machines and every collider has startup pains witnesses said there was a surface explosion at the lhc and even reports of gunfire but rutherford said laymen had mistaken an auto accident and a mechanical issue for something more dramatic im afraid weve just had a problem with our plumbing after a thorough safety review we still expect to reach our goal of trillion electron volts sometime next year the kilometer supercollider largest in the world uses such energies to break apart subatomic particles scientists hope to learn the answers to such fundamental questions as how the universe was created and why matter exists at all the story suited rominy the last thing she wanted was a press conference or paparazzi she was alive and sam was supposedly alive and jake and raeder were dead that was science miracle enough the neonazis had disappeared like helium mist for the first few nights she had nightmares of them peering in her hospital window like the skinhead otto nietzel but no not a whisper not an arrest not a threat no story of a dead skinhead at wewelsburg castle even the police seemed reluctant to probe too deeply into the disruption we are the police when she asked to see sam they put her off when hes better we will discuss a visit doctors told her and before we can release you we need more tests they took blood samples several times her arms and fingers ached from the punctures there was an unsettling blankness about some of the physicians who looked at her seeing her without seeing her she was an isolated specimen a private room a door that automatically locked with its latch on the corridor side and no word from america there was no telephone television was set to a single french entertainment channel she asked be shut off surely she wasnt a prisoner was she where are my clothes we have them in storage wheres the locker in a safe place did you find my money or passport your hospital bills are being covered rest please from her bed she could look out at autumn leaves blowing down from genevas trees with the gray lake beyond she waited for release but none came she waited for information but that didnt come either rest rest tomorrow we take more blood she felt groggy were they drugging her why was she always waiting for someone else to act she waited for sam he is recuperating one of the nurses carried a smartphone in her white coat pocket pink as lipstick rominy finally complained of fever the woman leaned in to take her temperature and the phone slipped into rominys slyly reaching hand slick and palmsized she tucked it under a blanket the nurse read the digital readout touched rominys forehead and grunted no fever she peered at her ward suspiciously as if impatient with malingerers rominy shrugged some aspirin sil vous plait oui the reply was grumpy the nurse strode off rubber soles squeaking the hospital was listed on the nurses favorites list on the cell phone rominy dialed asked for the nurses station and began do you speak english oui yes melissa jenkins here from the american embassy i have some papers for patient sam mackenzie but hes not on the floor where i thought young american a minute rustle of papers fiveoneseven is not correct ah i had it wrong merci she hung up and deleted the record of the call the nurse came back with aspirin have you seen my cell phone rominy shook her head did it fall out the nurse found the device under a stainless trolley while she bent to retrieve it rominy tore several pages from her labslip tablet the nurse straightened to glare at her patient but the american was innocently taking aspirin when the woman pocketed her phone and went out rominy jumped from the bed and caught the door just before it closed she inserted the paper shed stolen in the jamb preventing the latch from locking later that night hospital sounds a murmur machines beeping she slid out of bed opened the door checked that no one was watching slipped into the corridor and padded furtively down the hallway her gown held tight around her peeking in rooms she found a deserted nurses changing station and pilfered a uniform bundling her hospital gown with its clipped identity tag under her arm after killing her former lover with liquid helium confiscating clothes seemed a minor sin she changed into the white belted dress in a restroom stall ascended an elevator and took a mans clothes from a drugged and sleeping patient lifting them from his closet those would be for sam then she set out to find mackenzie maybe it was time for her to rescue him geneva switzerland october present day sam was still bedridden but awake at two am leaner and betterlooking for it his face had matured in a way that flattered him he looked at her with surprised delight when she slipped in rominy didnt have the sense to ditch me girl he was propped up on pillows watching allnight french tv with the sound off dont you sleep thats all ive done for two weeks she glanced at the television how can you tell whats going on i just wait for the ads theyre sexier than ours so you are feeling better oh yeah i couldnt feel any worse not after getting a jolt thats the equivalent of grasping a power line then he squinted at her nurses garb what the hell she put her fingers to her lips im getting us out of here why im tired of being poked i dont trust them he grasped her hand tight as a knot me neither they ask a million questions and dont answer a one are you well enough to move healthier than kurt raeder you got him sam when you broke that pipe im told the proton beam is directed by magnets when i knocked some askew the beam went wide just long enough to slice the bastard it was like a microscopic knife cutting through his chest his heart exploded the beam only persisted one second before a circuit blew best second of my life do you feel guilty are you kidding the guy lived way past a hundred i should be so lucky she shook her head did you know raeder was planning to have sex with me youre joking he also told me dna proved im his greatgranddaughter what he raped keyuri way back in it wasnt hood it was raeder who made the baby oh rominy man im sorry this is sick those guys were animals and jake what a dirtbag were not all like that trust me she sat on his bed i know guys arent all like that sam but i dont think my grocery aisle method works very well your what ill explain someday i just wish it hadnt gone so far with jake i heard you ended that relationship rather emphatically as well yes she looked sad i dont regret it but its not easy to kill someone sam just remember it would have been easy for him to kill you she nodded but she wondered if that was true she hoped not even after all that had happened emotions dont conveniently evaporate they just burn holes and leave scars he raised an eyebrow well are we still friends sam you almost died saving my life i just half saved it you finished off barrow and the staff shattered odd that no one mentions it not odd predictable you can bet theres a lot theyre not telling us just like were not telling them you dont take over a seventeenmile doughnut without a lot of inside help you dont get away with having nothing in the media unless the big dogs have all pledged not to bark can you spell conspiracy they dont believe me any more than i believe them then thats it he took her other hand over fini kaput we beat the bad guys rominy at least the ones we could identify end of story for us the cops say they cant find any surviving neonazis yeah right the physicists claim everyone on their team is clean its like the whole thing never happened almost she looked away from him staring at nothing i had to playact to find you i broke out of my room snuck through corridors are we prisoners lets find out what if nazis are still out there theres no magic staff theres no shambhala unless we spill the beans and somebody drains that lake no vril unless scientists rediscover it on their own no more blood locks unless theres one nobody told us about nobody needs us anymore this is where we live happily after right i hope he looked at her worriedly whats bugging you girl i want to go home with you and maybe finish my degree she knew he wanted to be more than just friends someday after all theyd gone through together and so she shivered remembering the tender touch of jake barrow and the warning of delphina clarkson or was it ursula kalb stay away from men thats my advice no womans body had been reported among the casualties so rominy was taking relationship advice from a nazi now i hope we really can get away sam stolen clothes no passports no money trust your tourist guide it just so happens i stashed our spare clothes papers and cash in a cubbyhole if we can sneak out to the collider site before dawn we can retrieve enough stuff from a manhole to keep going well look for a redeye to america with cheap seats and cranky stews she smiled hope came from action will it work if we hurry and then came a rap on the door herr mackenzie medication time ah crap he muttered now im already dopier than a big league ballplayer shell report me rominy hissed he pointed get under the bed she slid under on slick linoleum feeling absurd and peered out as a germanspeaking nurse entered there was a clack of heels not rubber soles no blaze of room light just a click like a door locking footsteps to the window to close the blinds a blue plastic bucket set on the floor rominy listened to them talk im not scheduled for medication nurse i heard talking you alone herr mackenzie you heard the tv i help you sleep i think i sleep too much already doctor orders her voice was oddly muffled rominy felt trapped whats the bucket for sam asked and why the face mask i have cold here antiseptic cloth it stinks hey he jerked relax no take away pain sam thrashed then slowly stilled silence the nurse seemed to be waiting bent over the bed no one else had entered the room what was going on if rominy revealed herself thered be an uproar shed just have to wait it out of all the bad luck or was it bad luck why had this nurse come in the middle of the night right after rominy had entered sams room for the first time in two weeks had this medical worker been waiting for rominy to come the american had finally left the protection of her own locked room slipped through the hospital without escort not encountered another soul had someone followed and locked her in here closing the blinds leaving the lights dim the silent tv strobed with dim light rominy peered out an iv pole being wheeled to sams bed mackenzie had gone silent which was hardly characteristic was he drugged its all about blood the nurse murmured a loop of plastic tubing drooped twisting rominy looked out at the nurses ankles she was wearing low leather pumps the americans heart began hammering liquid began pattering into the plastic bucket she twisted to see now the tube was red we keep just in case the nurse murmured keep it for what lost cities and secret doors something was terribly wrong could she bolt for the door she shifted to crawl out from the far side of the bed and suddenly a grip as hard as prussian iron seized rominys ankle and she was jerked out from under sams mattress like a rag doll spinning on the floor the strength and violence of it was shocking yet sickeningly familiar a woman in a nurses dress similar to rominys clamped the ankle of the american like a vise eyes malevolent mouth covered by a gauze mask you think i let you go little mouse the nurse said i listened to your breathing like a cat the woman had a cloth in her hand that smelled of some kind of ether or chloroform rominy twisted and kicked flopping like a fish i have been waiting waiting for reunion it was the voice of delphina clarkson or rather ursula kalb you think you can have your blood if we cant american witch for one terrible moment rominy felt paralyzed fear froze her panic turned her mind blank then that voice again that ghost shed heard at the supercollider so what have you learned fight rominy lashed out with her other leg and struck the side of the womans knee kalb shrieked as the leg bent and then toppled cursing in german the nazi scrabbled toward her mask askew and tried to get a cloth to rominys face the american pivoted on the floor like a demented breakdancer kicking and punching she hit the blue pail and it went over spilling blood that made a crimson fan across the linoleum ursula fumbled under her jacket and brought out a gun with a sausagefat silencer stay still she hissed or i shoot rominy seized the base of the iv pole and hurled it at their tormentor on the bed one of sams arms jerked as an iv needle pulled out the needle and its medical tape writhing at the end of its tubing there was an arc of blood spatter across the walls of the room while the crimson on the floor spread like an oil slick a phhttt as a silenced bullet went by whapping into a wall but the distraction of the fallen pole had worked to make the nazi miss kalb reared up on one leg to take better aim rominy flung the bucket at her and lunged the german shrieked as she was peppered with droplets of sams blood slapping the bucket away filth she roared then rominy dove into her as the german fired again the bullet shredding air next to the americans ear ursula fell hard grunting her gauze mask ripped away they rolled in the blood the germans eyes wide with terror and hatred a trolley and a chair crashed they lurched upright clawing and wrestled against the window and its blinds then they slipped in blood and went down again with grunts you killed my lover ursula screamed my god which one jake or the hideous kurt raeder he wanted your genes now i kill you they were fighting for the gun another shot somewhere into the ceiling would anyone ever come or had hospital personnel agreed to leave the corridor outside sams room empty while the fellowship struck back how deep was the conspiracy the german woman was immensely strong she was twisting her gun wrist out of rominys grasp getting ready for a final shot so well get your blood this way ill drain you into that pail rominys other hand was scrabbling it closed on a cloth and she realized it must be the anesthetic she swung and slapped it over ursulas mouth the german writhed like a snake as rominy clamped her nose more shots thudded into the wallboard each puncture puffing a geyser of powder ursula kicked her yells muffled the women twisted across the floor in demented embrace soaked and straining finally the pistol fell with a thud kalbs movements slowed becoming feeble then she stilled completely the monster was unconscious rominy shakily stood leaving the cloth over the germans mouth she scooped up the pistol trembling but efficient functioning now with grim determination the pistol was an automatic with trigger hammer and a safety she saw should she shoot a quick execution of an impostor and murderess no there was more fitting revenge rominy tucked the weapon in the white belt of her bloody uniform who knew when some skinheads might burst through the door she wouldnt hesitate to fire if they did her days of being squeamish about firearms were over this ends now she went to sam his arm was bleeding where the iv draining his blood had been but he was still breathing thank god when would the ether wear off she found some gauze from the toppled trolley and bandaged his arm then straining rominy pulled and yanked sam to the edge of the bed she dragged kalbs unconscious body and heaved her up beside him making an unholy couple its just for a minute sam she whispered she took a breath then groaning as she bent she picked up the iv stand and wheeled it to the bed she wasnt sure how to find a vein so just started jabbing in kalbs wrist waiting after each stab for blood to come out when the flow started she inserted the tubing and let it empty into the blue bucket the receptacle began to fill with plasma dark and thick why wouldnt you leave me alone rominy found a bottle of anesthesia that kalb had brought and shielding her own face with a towel renewed the cloth then she put it back on the germans mouth the mere fumes making her dizzy the german grimaced and breathed them in shuddering from adrenaline rominy staggered to the door unlocked it and peered out into the corridor it was still deserted staff had been ordered to stay away she wiped her feet on the towel shed used to shield her face from the ether and slipped out pistol in hand no one she found a gurney and wheeled it back awkwardly rolling sam onto the bed he muttered which she took to be a good sign then she unclipped her hospital identification bracelet and taped it back together on ursulas wrist and fastened her hospital gown tag to the nazis collar it was time to disappear rominy pickett rest in peace it might buy them a little time the womans complexion had gone chalk white her eyes staring was she breathing rominy bent close holding her breath against the anesthetic no she felt only cold relief the last dribbles of blood were pooling in the plastic pail what kind of hideous mind would still want rominys blood after all the catastrophes it had caused she spread the towel out by the door so it would soak up any carnage on the gurney wheels sams hospital room looked like a slaughterhouse the floor smeared scarlet bullet holes in walls and ceiling furniture toppled blinds askew then she pushed sam into the hallway and let the door close behind her it clicked lock fastening she threw a sheet over her guide to hide his identity and wheeled toward the elevator at a desk she saw a lab coat draped on the back of a chair and put it over her own bloody clothes sticky and stiff she still had the male street clothes for mackenzie and theyd fetch replacements at his cubbyhole at the supercollider he was moaning waking up the elevator gonged and she pushed him in selecting a button for the basement she pulled the pistol out and set it on the gurney near sams head in case someone tried to stop them wake up mackenzie her voice was sharp she slapped him hard he blinked rominy at every floor she expected the elevator to stop and was prepared to use the gun to bluff if she needed to but instead the conveyance sank smoothly to the basement a blank corridor rumbling generators a sign with a symbol for cars she pushed ahead went through double doors spied a ramp and with a running start pushed sam up into a courtyard where a few privileged autos were parked the air was sharp and tangy after the hospital stink washed clean of all corruption she was trembling with excitement and exhaustion no strangers would ever take blood from her again sam hoisted his head woozily where are we girl out can you sit maybe i feel lightheaded we had to leave a lot of you behind he sat up swaying what happened she glanced up and around most windows dark an archway leading to the world beyond we chose to be brave i guess she thrust the stolen clothes at him put some pants on sam mackenzie were going home
