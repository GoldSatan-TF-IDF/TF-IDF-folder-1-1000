the death of balder from the danish of johannes ewald translated by george borrow author of bible in spain lavengro wild wales etc london jarrold sons paternoster buildings ec preface to the translation the works of the late poet ewald are deservedly popular in denmark the present tragedy and the opera of the fishermen fiskerne in which occurs the bold lyric which has become the national song of the danes are esteemed his best productions for the fidelity with which the present version has been made i appeal to those of my countrymen who understand the original and demand whether i have given a thought or expression equivalents to which are not to be found in the danish tragedy i have imitated the peculiar species of blank verse in which the original is composed in order that the english reader may form an exact idea thereof and though by having done so my poetry may have somewhat of a cramped embarrassed gait i have a firm hope that i shall not meet very severe reprehension for having sacrificed elegance to fidelity george borrowthe persons balder hother thor nanna loke the three valkyrier the place of action is a pinewood on the norwegian mountains round

dread unwonted torments ha were my voice like finds when he distracted goes over horthedal as when he bellows and wild at last and blind with fury splinters the oaks the glory of the sacred forest ha

die battle and die is the bidding they bring the first i hear the sound of arms but now it ceases how long will he delay the noble warrior the second whom waitst thou for the first and thou what will my sister in this wild spot which blood has never crimsond the second what has assembled us and here where scarcely a sword has flashed since days of jotun ymer was it a god or destiny which drove us the first thou knowest that the morning sun illumines ten thousand spears on scotlands heathy mountains high beats with joy each warriors heart in silence they forward press and only wait my oncry thither would ibut hear the strange adventurewhich stoppd my flight upon these rocks envelopd in a black tempest i a finman followd who boldly climbd the mountain summits and sprang oer every yawning rift undaunted then saw i hothbrods valiant son i saw him as in the brook he cleans from dust his armour and sharpd laboriously his rusty dagger and provd upon the pines thick stem his falchion then brandishd he his huntingspear far backward he drew his nervous arm i heard the weapon hiss but my eye beheld it scarce a moment for like the lightning which the black clouds swallow it vanished and the heir vainly sought it then lookd i round about and saw my finman who held the spear and laughd i stormd with fury then down he plungd within a midnight chasm and from the deep uprose a voice like thunder which slowly booms among the finnish deserts unarmd it bellowd shall the warrior perish wither shall he of age and deep in hælheim be hidden far from odin far from valhall angry i rooted up the oaks in search of a spear for battles friendand this i fixd on i gave it tempests speed and strength to humble each warrior whom it smiteth when with wonder of thy fast sounding voice i heard an echo the second ye stars what sorcery but to me now listen i hastend unto horthas gloomy forests to glut myself in roman blood then lookd i down from the thundercloud in which i journeyd and on these towering hills my eyes i fastened then saw i denmarks hother prince of battle like the rockpine which oer the ocean beetles he stood and stormwinds with his locks were playing then from the brake a wolf sprang grim and frightful and big as fenris wolf the skoldung saw it and brandishd high his spear forth went it booming as booming goes from the cold north a whirlwind straight vanished wolf and spear but deep aforest was heard as from a thousand wolves a howling see see it howld the skoldung hother loses his spear and in his hand the sword is fragile now have we peace and norways kemps may slumber disturbd at such dark sorcery i seizd on the spear of steel thou seest and laid lightning and fiends death on its point when i beheld thee the third who hitherto has stood in deep thought sharp is my sight in war but here is darkness but do not think that chance and magic here assembled battles angry daughters allfather for the fight prepares allfather assembles us with murky wink i saw him the mighty thor wroth was he and his hammer was in his hand he stood by gevars dwelling he spoke to me and soon as eer i answerd he vanished thundering in the eastern heavens it is not sport nor any childish quarrel be ye assured makes thor descend from asgaard the first he spake to thee the third as when the warriors slumber and suddenly are wakd to thousand dangersby din of shields and mingled squadrons tumult so towerd he up and shouted when he saw me and dread and hollow as the oceans bellow as moan of forests in the nightly tempest sounded his voice unto my ear what rota he shouted rota here ye gods of heaven whom seekest thou where unclomb rocks engirdle peace smiling peace o say whom sent by skulda wilt thou devote upon the stilly mountains but ah what light had i the power to kindle dark is my spirit the terrific norna she who allots to time ere it approaches its luck and binds it with determined fingers unto fates will is silent and drives rota far from each plain belovd where battle rages yet shook the fatal spear with which conflicting monarchs i greet at sunrise thrice it trembled and death lies heavy in my armthat know i but for the victim the first threatens fate our hother the second thors fear and even thine betoken danger the third so seems it ah if it concernd our hother ye mind full well how high the danish hero i ever lovdi saw him by a fountain dejected weaponless and half in slumber but deep into the forest fled the savage from whom he took his sword the sharpedged mimer and hothers spear in his rude hands he carried retain my falchion thou ferocious warrior little in conflict shall it eer avail thee so shouted he and all the rocks resounded then straight i brought my choicest spear from valhall long since i cut it from a lonely wild beech which hid from day grew up in laplands deserts a circle of grey stones stood round about it on each was clotted blood and bones and ashes blood as i cut the spear the stem emitted it
