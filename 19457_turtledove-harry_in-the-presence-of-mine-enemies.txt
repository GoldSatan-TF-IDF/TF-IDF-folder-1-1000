harry turtledove in the presence of mine enemies i heinrich gimpel glanced at the report on his desk to make sure how many reichsmarks the united states was being assessed for the wehrmacht bases by new york chicago and st louis as hed thought the numbers were up from those of well the americans might grumble but theyd cough up what they owedand in hard currency too none of their inflated dollars if they didnt the panzer divisions might roll out of those bases and take what was owed the germanic empire this year and if they collected some blood along with their pound of flesh the usa might complain but it was hardly in a position to fight back heinrich entered the new figures on his computer then saved the study hed been working on for the past couple of days the zeiss hard disk purred smoothly as it swallowed the data he made two backupshe was a meticulously careful manbefore shutting down the machine when he got up from his desk he put on his uniform greatcoat in berlins early march winter still outblustered spring willi dorsch who shared the office with heinrich got up too lets call it a day heinrich he said and shook his head as he donned his own greatcoat how long have you been here at oberkommando der wehrmacht now going on twelve years heinrich answered buttoning buttons why his friend cheerfully sank the barb all that time at the high command and a fancy uniform to go with it and you still dont look like a soldier i cant help it heinrich said with a sigh he knew too well that willi was right a tall thin balding man in his early forties he had a tendency to shamble instead of parading he wore his greatcoat as if it were cut from the english tweeds professors still affected setting his highcrowned cap at a rakish angle he raised an eyebrow to get willis reaction willi shook his head heinrich shrugged and spread his hands ill just have to be martial for both of us willi saidhis cap gave him a fine dashing air doing anything for dinner tonight the two men lived not far from each other as a matter of fact we are im sorry lise invited some friends over heinrich said well get together soon though wed better willi said erikas going on again about how she misses you me im getting jealous ohquatsch heinrich said using the pungent berliner word for rubbish maybe she needs her glasses checked willi was blond and ruddy and muscular none of which desirable adjectives applied to heinrich or maybe its just my bridge game willi winced you know how to hurt a guy dont you come on lets go the wind outside the military headquarters had a bite to it heinrich shivered inside his greatcoat he pointed off to the left toward the great hall the oldtimers say the bulk of that thing has messed up our weather oldtimers always complain thats what makes them oldtimers but willis gaze followed heinrichs finger they both saw the great hall every day but seldom really looked at it its big all right but is it big enough for that i doubt it his voice though was doubtful too you ask me its big enough for damn near anything heinrich said the great hall had gone up sixty years before in the great flush of triumph after britain and russia fell before the planes and panzers of the third reich it boasted a dome that reached two hundred twenty meters into the sky and was more than two hundred fifty meters across sixteen st peters cathedrals might have fit within the enormous monument to the grandeur of the aryan race the riches of a conquered continent had paid for the construction the dome itself sheathed in weathered copper caught the fading light like a tall green hill at the top in place of a cross stood a gilded germanic eagle with a swastika in its claws atop the eagle a red light blinked on and off to warn away lowflying planes willi dorschs shiver had only a little to do with the chilly weather it makes me feel tiny its a temple to the reich and the volk its supposed to make you feel tiny heinrich answered set against the needs of the german race and the state any one manis tiny we serve them they dont serve us willi agreed he pointed across the adolf hitler platz toward the fuhrer s palace on the far side of the immense square next to the great hall when speer ran the palace up he was worried the size of it would dwarf even our leader himself and indeed the balcony above the tall entranceway to the fuhrer s residence looked like an architectural afterthought heinrichs short laugh came out as a puff of steam not even speer could look ahead to see what technology might do for him better not let the security police hear you talk that way about a reichsvater willi tried to laugh too but the chuckle rang hollow the security police were no laughing matter still heinrich was right when the fuhrer s palace went up another huge eagle had surmounted the balcony from which the germanic empires ruler might address his citizens the eagle had been moved to the roof when heinrich was a boy in its place went an enormous televisor screen adolf hitler platz held a million people when the fuhrer spoke to a crowd these days even the ones at the back got a good view a bus purred up to the oberkommando der wehrmacht building heinrich and willi got on with the rest of the officials who greased the wheels of the mightiest military machine the world had known one by one the commuters stuck their account cards into the fare slot the buss computer debited each rider eightyfive pfennigs the bus rolled down the broad boulevard toward south station berlins myriad bureaucrats made up the majority of the passengers but not all a fair number were tourists come from all over the world to view the most wonderful and terrible avenue that world boasted blase as any native heinrich usually paid scant attention to the marvels of his home town today being what it was though the oohs and ahhs of people seeing them for the first time made him notice them too sentries from the grossdeutschland division in ceremonial uniform goosestepped outside their barracks tourists on the sidewalk many of them japanese photographed the fuhrer s guards inside the barracks hall where tourists wouldnt see them were other troops in businesslike camouflage smocks they had assault rifles not the ceremonial forces oldfashioned gewehr s and enough armored fighting vehicles to blast berlin to rubble visitors from afar were not encouraged to think about them neither were most berliners but heinrich reckoned up grossdeutschland s budget every spring he knew exactly what the barracks held neon lights came on in front of theaters and restaurants as darkness deepened dark or light people swarmed in and out of the huge romanstyle building that held a heated swimming pool the size of a young lake it was open twentyfour hours a day for those who wanted to exercise to relax or just to ogle attractive members of the opposite sex its berlin nickname was the heiratbad the marriage bath sometimes amended by the cynical to the heiratbett the marriage bed past the pool the soldiers hall and the air and space ministry faced each other across the street the soldiers hall was a monument to the triumph of german arms among the exhibits it lovingly preserved were the railroad car in which germany had yielded to france in and france to germany in the first panzer iv to enter the kremlin compound one of the gliders that had landed troops in southern england and behind thick leaded glass the twisted radioactive remains of the liberty bell excavated by expendable prisoners from the ruins of philadelphia old people still called the air and space ministry the reichsmarschall s office in memory of hermann goring the only man ever to hold that exalted rank willi dorsch used its more common name when he nudged heinrich and said i wonder whats happening in the jungle these days could be anything heinrich answered they both laughed the roof of the ministry had been covered with four meters of earth partly as a protection against bombs from the air and then lavishly planted partly to please gorings fancy his private apartment was on the top floor the reichsmarschall was almost fifty years dead but the orgies hed put on amidst the greenery remained a berlin legend willi said we arent the men our grandfathers were in those days they thought big and werent ashamed to be flamboyant he sighed the sigh of a man denied great deeds by the time in which he chanced to live poor us doomed to get by on matteroffact competence heinrich said the skills we need to run the empire are different from the ones hitlers generation used to conquer it i suppose so willi clicked his tongue between his teeth i envy you your contentment here and now i almost joined the wehrmacht when i was just out of the hitler jugend sometimes i still think i should have theres a difference between this uniformhe ran a hand down the front of his doublebreasted greatcoatand the ones real soldiers wear is that your heart talking or did you just remember youre not eighteen years old any more heinrich said his friend winced acknowledging the hit he went on me id fight if the vaterland needed me but im just as glad i dont have to carry a gun were all probably safer because you dont willi said this is also true heinrich took off his thick goldframed glasses the street outside the interior of the bus and even willi next to him turned blurry and indistinct he blinked a couple of times then set the glasses back on the bridge of his nose the world regained its sharp edges the neon brilliance of the street outside dimmed as the bus went past the shops and theaters and started picking up passengers from the ministries of the interior transportation economics and foodmore uniforms that dont have soldiers in them heinrich thought the buildings from which the new riders came were shutting down for the day two ministries though like the oberkommando der wehrmacht never slept a new shift went into the justice ministry to replace the workers who left for home german justice could not close its eyes and woe betide the criminal or racial mongrel upon whom its allseeing gaze settled himself a thoroughly lawabiding man heinrich still shivered a little whenever he passed that marblefronted hall the colonial ministry stayed busy too much of the world fell under its purview the farming villages in the ukraine the mining colonies in central africa the indian tea plantations the cattle herders on the plains of north america as if picking that last thought from heinrichs mind willi dorsch said how many americans does it take to screw in a lightbulb the americans have always been in the dark heinrich clucked sadly your father was telling that one willi if he was he sounded more relieved than i do the yankees might have been tough mighthavebeens dont count fortunately isolation and neutrality had kept the united states from paying heed as potential allies in europe went down one after another it faced the germanic empire and japan alone a generation laterand the oceans werent wide enough to shield it from robot bombs now it was trying to get back on its feet but the reich didnt intend to let it just ahead lay another monument to german victory hitlers arch of triumph heinrich had been to paris on holiday and seen the arc dtriomphe at the end of the champselysees it served as a model for berlins arch and was a model in scale as well the arc dtriomphe was onlyonly about fifty meters tall less than half the height of its titanic successor the berlin arch was almost a hundred seventy meters wide and also a hundred seventeen meters deep so that the bus spent a good long while under it as if traversing a tunnel through a hillside when at last it emerged south station lay not far ahead the station building made an interesting contrast to the monumental stone piles that filled the rest of the avenue its exterior was copper sheeting and glass giving the traveler a glimpse of the steel ribs that formed its skeleton the bus stopped at the edge of the station plaza along with everyone else heinrich and willi filed off and hurried across the square toward the waiting banks of elevators and escalators they walked between more displays of weapons from germanys fallen foes the wreckage of a british fighter shown inside a lucite cube a formidablelooking russian panzer the conning tower of an american uboat into the bowels of the earth willi murmured as he reached out to grab the escalator handrail the train to stahnsdorf boarded on the lowest of the stations four levels signs and arrows and endless announcements over the loudspeaker system should have made getting lost inside the railway station impossible heinrich and willi found their way to the commuter train without conscious thought so did most berliners but the swarms of tourists were grit in the smooth machine uniformed boys from the hitler jugend and girls from the bund deutscher madel helped those for whom even the clearest instructions were not clear enough all the same the natives grumbled when foreigners got in the way dodging around an excited italian whod dropped his cheap suitcase so he could use both hands to gesture at a hitler youth in brown shirt swastika armband and lederhosen willi growled people like that deserve to be sent to the showers oh come on willi let him live heinrich answered mildly youre too soft his friend said but they rounded the last corner and came to their waiting area willi looked at the schedule display on the wall then at his watch five minutes till the next one not bad no heinrich said the train pulled into the station within thirty seconds of the appointed time heinrich thought nothing of it as he followed willi into a car he noticed only the very rare instances when the train was late as the two men had done on the bus they put their account cards into the fare slot and sat down as soon as the computers count of fares matched the cars capacity the doors hissed shut three more cars filled behind them then the train began to move acceleration pressed heinrich back against the synthetic fabric of his seat twenty minutes later an electronic voice rang tinnily from the roofmounted speakers stahnsdorf this stop is stahnsdorf all out for stahnsdorf heinrich and willi were standing in front of the doors when they hissed open again the two commuters hopped off and hurried through the little suburban station to the bus stop outside another five minutes and willi got up from the local bus see you tomorrow heinrich say hello to erika for me im not sure i ought to willi said both men laughed dorsch got off the bus and trotted toward his house which stood three doors down from the corner heinrich gimpel rode on for another few stops then he got off too his own house lay at the end of a culdesac so he had to walk for a whole blockits healthy for me he told himself a consolation easier to enjoy in spring and summer than in winter thesnick of his key going into the lock brought shouts of daddy from inside the house he smiled opened the door and picked up each of his three girls in turn for a hug and a kiss they ranged down in age from ten by twoyear steps then he lifted his wife as well lise gimpel squawked that wasnt part of the evening ritual the girls giggled put me down lise said indignantly not till i get my kiss she made as if to bite his nose instead but then let him kiss her he set her feet back on the carpet and held her a little longer before letting her go she made a pleasant armful a greeneyed brunette several years younger than he whod kept her figure very well when he released her she hurried back toward the kitchen i want to finish cooking before everyone gets here all right he smiled as he watched her retreat while he hung up his greatcoat and took off his tie his daughters regaled him with tales out of school he listened to three simultaneous stories as best he could lise came out again long enough to hand him a goblet of liebfraumilch then started away the chimes rang before she got out of the front room she whirled and stared at the door i am going to boot susanna right into the net she declared heinrich looked at his watch shes only ten minutes early tonight and you know shes always early so you should have been ready hmp lise said while he went in to let in their friend meanwhile the girls started chorusing susanna is a football aunt susanna is a football heinrich why are they calling me a football susanna weiss demanded she craned her neck to look up at him im short yes and im not emaciated like you but im not round either she shrugged out of a mink jacket and thrust it into his hands here see to this chuckling he clicked his heels jawohl meine dame she accepted the deference as no less than her due fraulein doktor professor will suffice thank you she taught medieval english literature at friedrich wilhelm university suddenly abandoning her imperial manner she started to laugh too now that youve hung that up how about a hug lises not watching i suppose i can get away with it heinrich put his arms around her she barely came up to his shoulder but her vitality more than made up for lack of size when he let go he said why dont you go into the kitchen you can pretend to help lise while you soak up our glenfiddich scotch almost justifies the existence of scotland susanna said its a cold gloomy rocky place so they had to make something nice to keep themselves warm if thats why people drink it your boyfriend is lucky he didnt set himself on fire here a couple of years ago myformer boyfrienddanken gott dafur all the same susanna blushed to the roots of her hair her skin was very fine and fair which let heinrich watch the flush advance from her throat i hadnt found out he was a drunk yet heinrich i know he said gently if he teased her too hard shed lose her temper and nothing and nobody was safe if that happened go on lises trying that recipe you sent her the girls waylaid susanna before she got to the kitchen though shed never been married she made an excellent ersatz aunt she took children seriously listened to what they had to say and treated them like small adults heinrich smiled come to that she was a small adult herself he knew better than to say so out loud walther and esther stutzman arrived a few minutes later along with their son gottlieb and daughter anna anna promptly went off with the gimpel girls she was a year older than alicia the eldest of the three heinrich gimpel stared at gottlieb good heavens is that a mustache the younger male stutzman touched a finger to the space between his nose and upper lip its going to be one i hope at the moment the growth was hard to see for one thing hed only just turned sixteen for another his hair was even fairer than his fathers and for a third hed chosen to keep untrimmed only a toothbrush mustache the first fuhrer s style was newly popular again walther stutzman differed from his son in appearance only by the presence of twentyodd years and the absence of even the vestiges of a mustache as he handed heinrich his topcoat he asked quietly tonight yes i think alicias ready heinrich answered as quietly i told her she could stay up late how has anna done the past year well enough her father said were still here after all esther stutzman put in a slim woman with light brown hair she peered at heinrich through glasses thicker than his own somehow in spite of everything her laugh held real mirth and if she hadnt done well we wouldnt be would we wouldnt be what aunt esther alicia gimpel asked a doll under one arm wouldnt be standing out here in the hall if we expected the curlyhaired gestapo to listen in esthers grin took all sting from the words imitating her father alicia said ohquatsch anna stutzman tried to sneak up behind her but she whirled before she got tickled both girls squealed they ran off together alicias brown curls bobbing beside annas blond ones they were very much of a height though anna was older alicia was tall for her age dinner lise called from the kitchen dinner dinner dinner everyone trooped into the dining room heinrich gimpel and gottlieb stutzman dropped the leaves on the table to accommodate the unusual crowd walther meanwhile fetched in a couple of extra chairs and susanna weiss placed them around the table they all paused to admire the fragrantly steaming pork roast before heinrich attacked it with fork and carving knife with onions potatoes and boiled parsnips it made a feast to fight the chill outside and leave everyone happily replete most of the talk that punctuated the music of knife and fork was praise for lises cooking smooth wheat beer mixed with raspberry syrup went with the meal the two younger gimpel girls usually got only small glasses tonight they found grownupsized mugs in front of them francesca and roxane proudly drained them dry and were nodding by the time their mother brought out dessert they munched their way through the little cakes stuffed with prunes or apricots or mildly sweet chocolate but the filling sweets only made them sleepier the food and beer slowed alicia down too but she was buoyed by the prospect of sitting up and talking with the adults seeing her daughters excitement lise said she doesnt know yet how boring we can be with our chatter of children and taxes and work and whos going to bed with whom whois going to bed with whom esther asked its more interesting than taxes and work thats for sure susanna parodied a hitler jugend song in the fields and on the heath we lose strength through joy gottlieb stutzman blushed almost as red as she had before she teased him why gottlieb dont you hope to meet a friendly maiden when you go to work your year in the fields it is notnot practical not for me he answered stiffly rubbing a finger over his peachfuzz mustache it is not practical for any of us as susanna knows walther stutzman gave her a severe look it is also not practical for us to sing that song anywhere but among ourselves if the security police hear it its wiser not to draw the attention of the security police anyway lise gimpel said with her usual solid good sense even children know that she looked at her own two younger children who were valiantly trying not to yawn after i get the table cleared away time for the little ones to go to bed heinrich nodded to walther and gottlieb stutzman nice to have some other men in the house for a change he remarked you are outnumbered arent you walther said i kept the numbers even but then thats what they pay me for he held a moderately important post with the computerdesign team at zeiss everyone even the men pitched in to help lise cart dirty dishes and leftovers not that there were many of those back to the kitchen the two younger gimpel girls exchanged their party dresses for long cotton nightgowns francesca and roxane collected kisses from the grownups then went off to the bedroom they sharednot without a couple of sleepily jealous glances at alicia who got to stay up despite being sleepy alicia gimpel felt about to burst from curiosity and excitement she sat on the edge of the couch her eyes flew from her parents to aunt susanna or aunt esther or uncle walther or gottlieb as her mother had said alicia didnt know what the grownups talked about after she went to sleep and she could hardly wait to learn her gaze swung to anna she stuck out an accusing forefinger youve found out what this secret is yes i have anna sounded serious enough to startle alicia she looked back to her father behind his glasses he was blinking quickly as if fighting back tears alicia saw that but had trouble believing it she couldnt imagine her father crying and she couldnt imagine anna keeping a secret from her her mouth twisted down her eyes narrowed it was what her family called her angry face her father started to raise a hand before he could say anything anna who also recognized it hastily went on after tonight youll know too all right alicia said partway mollified but it wasnt all right she could tell why are you all staring at me like that i dont like it she twisted around to press her face against a sofa cushion its an important secret sweetheart her mother said come out please its such an important secret you cant even tell your sisters that got through to alicia she did pull away from the pillow and stared at her mother her eyes wide her father said you cant tell anyone not anyone at all not ever weve waited till you got old enough so we could tell you because we wanted to be sure or as sure as we could besometimes he was maddeningly preciseyou wouldnt give us away by telling somebody you shouldnt ive known for a year now and i didnt even tellyou anna said see how important it is she sounded proud of herself alicia looked over to aunt esther and uncle walther they looked proud of anna too and they also looked frightened alicia had never seen them frightened before but she couldnt mistake it seeing that frightened her too whats going on then she asked youre right annai never knew you had a secret and were best friends she still sounded hurt but only a little now whatever it was her time to learn it had come she repeated whats going on her father and mother didnt answer not right away they looked frightened too which alarmed alicia far more than the fear on the stutzmans faces whatever this was it had more weight than anything she could have imagined at last after a deep breath susanna weiss spoke one blunt sentence you are a jew alicia alicia stared she shook her head as if at a joke dont be silly aunt susanna there are no more jews not anywhere theyrekaputt finished she spoke with the assurance of one reciting a lesson well learned in school but her father shook his head too to contradict her youare a jew alicia your sisters are jews too so is susanna so are esther and walther and gottlieb and anna and so are your mother and i he means it hes not kiddingalicia realized her ears and cheeks felt cold that meant she was turning pale all the blood going away from her face butbut she didnt know how to go on so she stopped after a moment she rallied but jews were filthy and wicked and diseased and racially impure perhaps trying to convince herself she went on thats why the wise reich got rid of them thats what my teachers say all the textbook lessons her father let out a long long sigh i learned them too walther stutzman said one of the hardest lessons anybody learns is that not everything your teachers tell you is true for us its twice as hard is anna filthy alicias mother asked of course not alicia got angry at the very idea she looked over at her friend still wanting anna to tell her this was all just a game but anna looked back with impressively grownup solemnity shed had a year to think about what rode on holding this secret close are your father and i wicked alicias mother persisted is susanna diseased i can get to feel that way the morning after too much scotch susanna said hush susanna lise gimpel said impatiently butwhat happens if anyone finds out imim a jew alicia pronounced the name with difficulty it was too strong a curse to fit in the mouth of a wellbroughtup tenyearold if my friends at school know they wont like me any more if your friends at school find out dear it will be worse than that her father said if anyone learns youre a jew the einsatzkommandos will come for you and for your sisters and for your mother and me and for the stutzmans and for susannaand after that probably for other people too his voice was usually soft and gentle now he made it hard as armor plate sharp as a solingen dagger alicia couldnt doubt he meant exactly what he said shed learned about the einsatzkommandos in school too in the lessons they were heroes cleaning up the conquered east and then the ghettos of new york and los angeles but if they came to clean up her family her mother tried to soothe her nobody has to find out my little one nobody will unless you give yourself away and us with you were well hidden these days the few of us who are left we have to be but worry clouded even her sunny faceshe must have learned the same lessons i did alicia thought remembering what her father had said moments beforeshes scared of the einsatzkommandos too her mother repeated were well hidden but alicia wildly shook her head she knew about the millions who had died in europe and then a generation later in the united states every schoolchild knew the reich made sure of thatand now theyll come for me oh god theyll come for me my father helped keep us hidden uncle walther said he altered the reichs genealogical database to show that our families are all of pure aryan blood no one looks for us any more not here at the heart of the germanic empire no one thinks theres any reasonto look were safe enough unless we give ourselves away maybe one day not in our time but when your children or grandchildren have grown up alicia we can be safe living openly as what we are maybe till then we go on his soft words about changing databases had begun to reassure alicia what he didnt know about computers nobody did but when he spoke of living openly as jews she only stared at him she felt like an animal caught in a trap it will never be safe never she said shrilly the reich will last a thousand years and how can there be room in it for jews maybe the reich will last a thousand years the way hitler promised her father said no one can know that till it happens if it does but dear there have been jews for three thousand years already even if the germanic empire lives out all the time hitler said it would it will still be a baby beside us uncle walther was right one way or another we go on its hard to pretend not to be what we really are i hate it susanna weiss broke in ive always hated it ever since i found out alicias father nodded we all hate it but when times are dangerous for jews the way they are now what other choice have we got this isnt the first time jews have had to be what they are only in secret esther stutzman said in spain a long time ago we pretended to be good catholics now we have to pretend to be good aryans and national socialists but underneath we still are what weve always been the grownups all sounded so cool so collected as far as they were concerned everything was fine and everything would stay fine no matter what that wasnt how it felt to alicia i dont want to be a jew she shouted her fathers head whipped toward the windows sudden stark fright filled his face and everyone elses alicia understood that she clapped her hands to her mouth if one of the neighbors heard the security police were only a phone call away after a deep breath her father said you have a way out alicia what is it she stared at him tears and questions in her eyes you can just pretend this night never happened he told her you know well never betray you no matter what you decide if you choose not to tell your husband one day if hes not one of us and if you choose not to tell your children theyll never know youand theyare jewish theyll be just like everybody else in the germanic empire but one more piece of something old and precious will have disappeared from the world forever i dont know what to do alicia said to her surprise her father got up came over and kissed her on top of the head you may not realize it but thats the most grownup thing youve ever said alicia didnt want to sound like a grownup any more than she wanted to be a jew she didnt seem to have much choice about either figuring that out was another grownup thing to do not that she knew it at the time its not so bad alicia anna said i cried too when i found out so did i gottlieb added which made alicias eyes widen he was so much older than she that she thought of him as practically a grownup anna went on but its special in a way like being part of a club that wont take just anybody and its not like what we are is written on our foreheads or anything like that even though it does feel like it at first but if we keep the secret no one will find out what we are we even have our own special holidaystoday is one whats today alicia asked intrigued in spite of herself today is the festival of purim her father answered the germans and the spaniards aunt esther was talking about werent the first people who wanted to get rid of the jews weve always stood out a little because were different from the other people in a country and a long time ago in the persian empire he got out a bible to help tell alicia the story not every family had one in its house or flat these days still the national socialists mostly tolerated quiet christianity alicias teachers sometimes made scornful noises about a religion better fit for slaves than for heroes but shed never heard of the security police paying a call on anybody who believed in jesus she didnt know what would happen if somebody made a fuss about jesus but people knew better than to make fusses about such things christianity that wasnt quiet was dangerous too and so her father finished king ahasuerus hanged haman on the very gallows hed built for mordechai and mordechai and queen esther lived long happy rich lives afterwards caught up in the ancient tale even though she hadnt really wanted to be alicia laughed and clapped her hands very softly susanna weiss said i wish someone had built a gallows for hitler and himmler so many of our people gone she stared down into her snifter of scotch alicia stared tooat aunt susanna the first fuhrer and the first reichsfuhrer ss whod later followed hitler as ruler of the germanic empire were saints nowadays or as close to saints as made no difference even with what alicia had learned tonight hearing someone wish theyd been hanged was a jolt and susannasusanna sounded as if she felt guilty for living on where so many of her peopleso many of my people tooalicia thought wonderinglyhad died i wish i could tell my sisters alicia said her father and walther stutzman smiled at each other a moment later alicia discovered why for anna said when i found out last year i said i wish i could tell alicia uncle walther said its new little one its a shock i remember how confused finding out what i was made me but you cant say anything to francesca and roxane you knownot anything at all alicias father told her theyre too little it would be very dangerous theyll learn when the time comes the way you have now if this secret gets to the wrong ears were all dead just because there arent many jews left doesnt mean people wont start hunting us were still fair game are wethe people in this roomall the jews who are left alicia asked no her father said there are others all through greater germany and the rest of the empire sooner or later youll meet more and some of them will surprise you but for now the fewer jews you know the fewer you can give away if the worst happens whoalicia wondered her eyes went far awaywhich of our friends are really jews she never would have guessed about the stutzmans who with their blond good looks seemed perfect aryans not in a million years her teachers went on and on about how ugly jews had been with fat flabby lips and grotesque hooked noses and almost kinky hair it didnt seem to be true what else had they told her that wasnt true her mother said even though we have our own holidays sweetheart we can only celebrate them among ourselves the little threecornered cakes we had tonight are special for purimtheyre called hamantaschen hamans hats alicia echoed i like that serves him right yes her mother said but thats why you wont be taking any of them to school for lunch people who arent jewish might recognize them we cant afford to take any chances at all do you see not even with something as little as cakes alicia said not even her mother said firmly not with anything not ever all right mama the warning impressed alicia with the depth of the precautions she would have to take to survive isit all right alicia her father sounded anxious i know this is a lot to put on a little girl but we have to you see or there wont be any jews any more it really is alicia answered itsurprised me i dont know if i like it yet but its all right she nodded in a slow hesitant way she thought she meant what she said but she wasnt quite sure she and anna yawned together then giggled at each other aunt susanna got up grabbed her handbag walked over to alicia and kissed her on the cheek welcome to your bigger family dear were glad to have you my bigger familyalicia thought that she did like aunt susanna and the stutzmans had always been like family to her finding out they reallywere a family of sortsor at least part of the same conspiracy of survivalwas reassuring in a way susanna turned to alicias father id better get home i have to teach an early class tomorrow we ought to go too esther stutzman said either that or well wait till anna falls asleepwhich shouldnt be more than another thirty secondsbundle her into the broom closet and leave without her her daughter let out an irate sniff alicias mother and father passed out coats the friends stood gossiping on the front porch for a last couple of minutes as they chattered a brightly lit police van turned the corner and rolled up the street toward the end of the culdesac they know alicia gasped in horror they know she tried to bolt inside away from the eagle and swastika that had suddenly gone from national emblem to symbol of terror her father seized her arm alicia had never thought of him as particularly strong but he held on tight and made sure she couldnt move the van turned around and went back up the street it turned the corner it was gone there you see her father said everythings fine little one they can only find out about us if we give ourselves away do you understand ithink so father alicia said good her father let go of her nowyou can go on in and get ready for bed alicia had never been so glad to go into the house in all her life susanna and the stutzmans walked off toward the bus stop heinrich and lise gimpel went back inside the house once he closed the door he allowed himself the luxury of a long sigh of mingled relief and fear that damned police van he said i thought poor alicia would jump right out of her skinand if she had it might have ruined everything well she didnt you stopped her his wife gave him a quick kiss im going to make sure shes all right now good idea heinrich said ill start on the dishes he rolled up his sleeves turned on the water and waited for it to get hot when it did he rinsed off the plates and silverware and glasses and loaded them into the dishwasher the manufacturers kept saying the new models would be able to handle dishes that hadnt been rinsed so far theyd lied every time heinrich was still busy when alicia came out for a goodnight kiss usually that was just part of nighttime routine it felt special tonight he said you dont have to be frightened every second darling if you show youre afraid people will start wondering what you have to be afraid of keep on being your own sweet self and no one will ever suspect a thing ill try papa when alicia hugged him she clung for a few extra seconds he squeezed her and ran his hand through her hair good night she said and hurried away he let out another sigh even longer than the first finding out you were a jew in the heart of the national socialist germanic empire was not something anyone child or adult could fully take in at a moments notice a beginning of acceptance was as much as he could hope for that much alicia had given him his own father had shown him photographs smuggled out of the ostlands and other newer ones from the usa to warn him how necessary silence was he still had nightmares about those pictures after more than thirty years but he still had the photos too hidden in a file cabinet if he thought he had to he would show them to alicia he hoped the need would never come for her sake and his own lise walked into the kitchen a couple of minutes later she dragged in a chair from the dining room sat down and waited till the sink was empty and the washer full then as the machine started to churn she got up and gave him a long slow hug and so the tale gets told once more she said as he had with his daughter heinrich hung on to his wife and so we try to go on for another generation he said weve outlasted so much god willing well outlast the nazis too no matter what they teach in school i dont believe the reich can last a thousand years alevaiit doesnt lise used a word from a murdered language a word that hung on among surviving jews like the ghost of hamlets murdered father but of course now that the tale is told the risk that well get caught also goes up you did just right there keeping her from running when the police van came by couldnt have that heinrich said gravely but shell be nervous for a while now and shes so young he shook his head strange how the worst danger comes from making sure we go on no one would ever suspect you or me why else buy pork lise broke in why else have a bible with the new testament in it too because wed have to want to commit suicide if we used one that didnt thats why i know heinrich knew more intimately than that he still had his foreskin he took off his glasses wiped his forehead with his sleeve and set the spectacles back on his nose we do everything we can to seem like perfect germans i can quote from mein kampf more easily than from scripture but its not so easy for a child i remember lise nodded so do i and we still have two more to go heinrich let out yet another sigh he hugged her again im so tired i know she said it must be easier for me staying home with the kinder like a proper hausfrau but you have to wear the mask at the office every day either i pretend to others im not a jew or i pack it in and pretend the same thing to myself i cant do that dammit i know too much he thought again of the hidden yellowing blackandwhite photographs from the east and of the color prints from north america wewill go on in spite of everything his wife yawned right now im going on to bed im right behind you ohspeaking of the office on the way home today willi said he admired how content i was here and now did he good lise said at once if you must wear the mask wear it well i suppose so he also asked if we were busy tonight i said yes since we were but well be going over there one evening soon ill arrange for my sister to stay with the girls lise said lets give alicia a little more time to get over her shock before we take her out and shell realize katarinas one of us too and maybe talking with her will help sensible you usually are ha lise said darkly id better be so had you i know heinrich chuckled besides with the girls at home well be able to play more bridgewe wont have to ride herd on them thats true lise also laughed both of them by now were long used to the strangeness of having good friends who if they learned the truth might well want to send them to an extermination camp heinrichwas looking forward to getting together with willi and erika dorsch for an evening of talk and bridge within the limits of his upbringing willi was a good fellow heinrich pondered the limits of his own upbringing which were a good deal narrower than willi dorschs in one way telling alicia of her heritage was transcending those limits in another it was forcing them on her as well in still anotherhe gave up the regress before he got lost in it didnt you say something about bed youre the one whos been standing here talking lise said lets go when her mother shook her awake alicia had to swallow a scream evil dreams had filled her night dreams of being a monster in a world full of ordinary people dreams of being taken from her parents dreams of being taken from her parents to a place from which she would surely never return dreams of she didnt remember all of them she hoped she would forget the ones she did remember in the instant when her eyes came open she thought the hand on her shoulder belonged to a man from the security police the scream turned to a gasp of relief as she recognized her mother oh she said its you did you think it would be anyone else yes alicia said the one flat stark word wiped the smile from her mothers face oh little one she said and hugged alicia now get up and go eat your breakfastand remember your sisters dont know and they mustnt know how am i supposed to hide it alicia asked you have to thats all her mother said which was no help at all now get up and wash your face and eat breakfast and brush your teeth youve got to be ready when the school bus gets to the stop that scream wanted to come out again alicia couldnt imagine how shed get through the day without revealing herself to her teacher and even more appallingly to her friends but she had to try shed learned to swim when her father tossed her into a stream and she had to claw her way back to him or drown so shed thought at the time anyhow though of course he would have saved her if shed got in trouble but if she got in trouble here no one would save her no one could save her she didnt know much about being a jew but that seemed all too clear she wanted to stay in bed she wanted to stay in bed forever in fact she couldnt and she knew it her mother had already gone down the hall to wake francesca and roxane and there was francesca mumbling and grumbling she hated to get up in the morning given half a chance she would have slept till noon every day alicia got out of bed a moment before her mother reappeared in the doorway and said get moving and then oh you are yes mama being a jew meant trouble alicia could see that but being late to school meant trouble too trouble of a sort shed known about for years that trouble she could stay out of the other to alicia they both seemed about the same size just then she was ferociously bright but she was only ten she ducked into the bathroom as her sisters came out of the bedroom they shared they would camp in the hall waiting for her so she hurried when she opened the door again she pushed past them and back into her room to get dressed that meant she didnt have to say anything much to them for a little while longer like any tenyearold girl she put on the tan blouse and skirt that were the uniform of the bund deutscher madel she remembered how proud shed been when she turned ten the summer before and could join the league of german maidens like anna and her other older friends putting on the uniform with its swastika armband was a sign she was growing up as she pulled up her white socks and tied her stout brown shoes though the uniform suddenly seemed a lie a betrayalim not a german maiden she thought unhappilyim a jewish maiden she shivered though a steam radiator kept her room cozy and warm on her bookshelves stood a childrens classic from the early days of the reich julius streichers trust no fox in the green meadow and no jew on his oath like millions of german youngsters across three generations shed learned the difference between aryans and jews from the slim little volume the blond handsome muscular aryan could work and fight the pudgy swarthy hooknosed flashily dressed jew was the greatest scoundrel in the reich alicia had believed that with all her heart it was in a bookin every book how could it be wrong aryan children with blond or light brown hair jeered as homely blackhaired jewish children and a jewish teacher were ousted from their school a few pages later an aryan boy grinned and played a concertina while more ugly jews with big noses and fleshy lips trudged into exile past a sign that said oneway street the colorful pictures were so bright and cheerful they commanded belief alicia had the companion volumethe poison mushroom too she stared at the caricatures of the jews she didnt look like that nor did her sisters and parents the stutzmans and susanna weiss didnt either realizing that helped steady her if trust no fox had one lie in it maybe it had lots of lies in it with all her heart she hoped so alicia her mother called hurry up its breakfast coming she said and put the book away slowpoke said roxane who with francesca was already digging in to sausages and eggs she was the teaser in the family always looking for ways to get under her older sisters skins and usually finding one francesca asked the question alicia had been dreading well what did you do when you got to stay up late last night behind alicia her mother suddenly stopped bustling about the kitchen she stood still and quiet waiting to hear what her oldest daughter would sayand maybe to jump in and help if she had to it wasnt very exciting alicia answered as casually as she could just a lot of talk grownups she rolled her eyes if she exaggerated it wouldnt hurt not here francesca already knew what she thought of grownups her sister accepted what she said her mother started moving again as if shed only just noticed shed stopped and aliciaalicia was sunk in misery she couldnt ever remember lying to francesca before the girls got their books and went to the bus stop on the corner older girls in tan uniforms like alicias older boys in brown hitler youth togs and younger children dressed every which way waited for the school bus hello alicia said emma handrick who lived a few doors away did you get the math homework sure alicia said surprised emma needed to ask she almost always got the homework can i copy it from you on the way to school emma asked eagerly please my mother said shed clobber me if i got another lousy grade shed asked before alicia had always said no her father and mother had taught her only to do her own work they said anything else was dishonest shed gone along with that it fit the way she thought but today everything seemed up in the air if she said no would the neighbor girl denounce her as a jew whatever else happened that couldnt not just her safety rode on it so did her sisters and her parents she nodded and smiled all right emmas rather doughy face lit up in surprised delight francesca and roxane looked horrified roxane had an imgoingtotell expression on her face most of the time that would have worried alicia now she had bigger things to worry about she felt like atlas her class had done greek mythology the year before with the weight of the heavens on her shoulders the school bus stopped at the corner the doors hissed open the children got on a couple of alicias friends waved to her she waved back but found a seat with emma her sisters perched together on another pair of seats their backs were stiff with disapproval at first but then they started talking with friends of their own and forgot alicias scandalous behaviorfor the time being anyhow youre a lifesaver emma said her pencil racing over the paper she finished the last problemthey were multiplying fractionsas the bus pulled into the schoolyard i even think i see how to do them myself thats good alicia said she wasnt sure she believed it she was pretty sure shedidnt believe it in fact emma would never be one of the smartest people in the class which was putting it mildly but hearing it salved alicias conscience she put the homework back in her folder and got off the bus francesca and roxane waved as they hurried to the lines in front of their classrooms maybe theyd forgiven her sin maybe she took her own place in lineright in front of emma in alphabetical order at precisely eight oclock the classroom door opened come in children the teacher boomed jawohl herr kessler alicia and the rest of the class chorused all over the schoolyard other classes were greeting their teachers the same way they all marched into the classrooms in perfect stepwell not quite so perfect in the younger grades again with the others alicia set her books and papers on her desk and stood at attention behind her chair she faced the swastika flag that hung by the door but her eyes were on herr kessler he stood so stiff he might have turned to stone alicia thought of perseus and the gorgon suddenly the teachers right arm shot up and outheil he barked alicia and her classmates also honored the flag with the german saluteheil they said till this morning shed been proud to salute the flag why not till this morning shed been an aryan among aryans one who deserved that privilege now now everything seemed different no one else knew what she was but she did and the knowledge ate at her hadnt hitler himself called jews parasites on the nation alicia felt like an enormous cockroach for a wild frightening moment she wondered if anyone else could see her metamorphosis evidently notherr kessler got to work on grammar which prepositions took the dative which the accusative and which both and with what changes of meaning alicia had no trouble with any of that but some people didemma for instance alicia knew the handricks had the televisor on all the time shed heard her mother talk about it even so if you listened to how educated people talked if you paid any attention at all how could you make mistakes emma did and she wasnt the only oneherr kessler made notations in the roll book in red ink emmas mother was liable to clobber her in spite of the arithmetic homework shed got from alicia history and geography came next the teacher pulled down a big map of the world that hung above the blackboard the germanic empire shown in the bloodred of the flag stretched from england deep into siberia and india paler red showed lands occupied but not formally annexed france the united states canada in the empires shadow were the little realms of the allied nations swedens gold finlands pale blue the greens of hungary and portugal romanias dark blue purple for spain and bulgaria and the yellow of the italian empire around the mediterranean africa was mostly red too though portugal spain and italy kept their colonies on the dark continent and the aryandominated union of south africa was another ally not a conquest only the empire of japan with southeast asia china the islands of the pacific and indian oceans and australia all shown in yellow came anywhere close to matching the germanic empire in size the japanese were strong enough to survive for the time being not strong enough to make serious rivals for the reich and the japanese of course are not aryansherr kessler said because of this they have no true creativity of their own already they have fallen behind us in technology and they will fall further behind with each passing year our triumph may not come soon but it is sure the children nodded solemnly they knew how important being an aryan was alicia didall the more so now that she realized she wasnt one math came next they passed in their homework and did problems on the blackboard alicia got hers right emma botched hersherr kessler frowned he flipped through papers you were correct on your homework he rumbled ominously why do you fall down here i dont knowherr kessler emma said im sorryherr kessler she sounded sorry toosorry about what would happen to her when her mother found out she wasnt doing so well your paper from last night is as good as alicia gimpels the teacher said and alicias heart leaped into her mouth had he realized emma was copying but he only set the homework down and went on now you must learn to follow through as alicia has done jawohl herr kessler emma didnt seem worried about cheating how many times had she copied work before and from how many different students enough to take it for grantedthat was plain oddly emmas matteroffactness helped alicia at lunch if emma could keep the teacher from suspecting she was a cheater why couldnt alicia keep anyone from suspecting she was a jew emma left evidence if only herr kessler had looked more closely alicia didnt no hamantaschen in her lunch pail no mark of cain on her foreheadfather was right she thought with enormous reliefif i dont make a silly mistake no one will think im anything but what ive always seemed to be and one of the things shed always been was somebody who despised mistakes of any kind and especially silly ones the afternoon turned out to be a snap she was good in science and good enough at the computer keyboardlike her father she was less than graceful and couldnt type as fast as some of her classmates but she was accurate no one gave her any trouble going home either her first day knowing she was a jew and shed got away with it a three notrump contract three tricks to play heinrich gimpel needed to take all three to make it no help in the dummy lise sat across the table from him but theyd got where they were largely out of his hand he didnt needmuch help he held the ace and queen of spades and the ace of diamonds but the king of spades remained unaccounted for did willi dorsch have it on his right or did erika on his left willi had taken the last trick so it was his lead he grinned at heinrich who smiled back they both knew what was what grinning still willi flipped out the jack of spades heinrich kept smiling too as much by main force as anything else now he had to choose if he played the queen and erika had the king hed go down if he played the ace and the king didnt drop hed also go down because hed have to lead the queen for the last trick and the king would clobber it he glanced at willi who chuckled enjoying his perplexity then he looked at erika she was worth looking at heartshaped face blue blue eyes a wide generous mouth gilt hair that hung to her shoulders however much he enjoyed the excuse to studyhell to oglehis friends wife though all the study told him nothing about her hand erika took bridge seriously the ace or the queen the lady or the tiger the devil or the deep blue sea heinrich looked back at willi dorsch you like to lead away from kings he remarked and played the queen erika sluffed a heart ha heinrich said in triumph he laid down the last two aces made it dammit willi said he laid down the king of spades and the king of diamonds thats the rubber erika said sadly she wrote in the scorebook lise said willi if youd led the diamond we would have gone down heinrich would have had to take then he would have led the ace of spades and you would have dropped the jackand had the king waiting for the queen willi thought for a couple of seconds then said dammit again on a different note this time ive spent the last fifteen years trying to teach him not to do things like that and i havent had any luck erika said i dont think you will either im a stubborn goose willi remarked with a certain amount of pride he gathered up the cards and swept them into a neat pile have we got time for another rubber what timeis it heinrich looked at his watch a quarter past twelve he raised his eyes to lise what will your sister say that were pushing it she answered she turned to erika dorsch and spread her hands you know how it is you dont want to get your best babysitter mad at you because if you do youll never get out of the house again oh yes erika nodded the dorsches son and daughter were asleep in their bedroomsthey hadnt had to worry about babysitters tonight and heinrich hadnt had to worry about bringing alicia along maybe shell talk to katarina about things if her sisters give her the chance he thoughtthat will help she thinks aunt kathes interesting lise and i are justmama and papa willi got to his feet dont disappear quite yet ill fix one for the road he headed off into the kitchen oh good heavens my back teeth are already floating lise headed off too in the direction of the bathroom that left heinrich briefly alone with erika dorsch in a film he would have run a finger around the inside of his collar hed never quite figured out whether she knew how provocative she was had things been otherwise he might have been tempted to find out as they wereevery once in a while he was tempted to find out anyhow hed never yielded to temptation too much rode on it all she said was you played that well which hardly encouraged fantasies heinrich shrugged i thought it was the best chance i had to make and the four of us have been playing bridge a long time i know how willis beady little mind works he grinned to make sure erika didnt take him seriously she smiled too but only for a moment you think about things she said in musing tones and you think other peopleeven womencan think about things too she paused then added i wonder if lise has any idea how lucky she is she eyed him speculatively not knowing what to say to that he didnt say anythingand does willi have reason to worry about me he wondered the mere idea made him nervous for all sorts of reasons of which temptation was among the least important when he was tempted by a woman like erika dorsch that showed how urgent the other reasons were not saying anything proved a good idea on general principles for lise and willi both came back into the dining room at the same time willi carried a tray with four glasses of kirsch on it he couldnt resist doing a little routine with the tray as if he were one of the english butlers in such demand among wealthy german families lise laughed erika rolled her eyes up to the ceiling plainly she found her husband less than amusing tonight willi handed everyone a glass of cherry brandy then raised his own in salutesieg heil he said sieg heil the others echoed the words erika sounded subdued heinrich made sure he seemed enthusiastic so did lise if they were the good national socialists and aryans they pretended to be they had to sound that way when they hailed victorydidnt they all at once heinrich wondered erika really was an aryan and he presumed a good nazi she didnt worry about sounding indifferent but being who and what she was she could afford to slack off on small things the gimpels couldnt afford to slack off at all like caesars wife they had to be above suspicion for suspicion meant disaster thats quite a nightcap heinrich said and mimed being hit over the head with a club you can sleep late tomorrow willi dorsch said knocking back his own kirsch lise snorted you know our children too well to say anything silly like that francesca likes to sleep in but alicia and roxane will be up at the crack of dawn ghastly habit willi said our two like to lie in bed the lazy goodfornothings he stuck out a finger in heinrichs direction meant to ask you are the americans going to make their assessment this fiscal year imnot sure heinrich answered cautiously he knew the americans were unlikely to but didnt want to say so in front of lise and erika neither of whom had the security clearance to hear such things willis wave said he understood why his friend was being so cagey it also said he thought heinrich was being a wet blanket he asked are we gearing up to wallop the americans if they dont meet the assessment not that ive heard heinrich said which combined caution and truth i havent either willi said you know how i was complaining a while ago about not living in glorious times he waited for heinrich to nod then went on i didnt think we were gettingthis soft when i grumbled ill tell you that i dont think were soft heinrich said germany rules the biggest empire the world has ever seen ruling and conquering are different businesses a ruler can forgive things a conqueror would have to step on not if he wants to keep on ruling he cant willi said going red in the face no heinrichs right erika said which made lise raise an eyebrow and made willi turn even redder erika went on if you want to hold a country down without a rebellion every other year you kill the first two or three batches of rebels and everybody whos related to them willi broke in after a while the people who are leftif there are anyget the idea and settle down thats what finally worked for us in england in a way he was right england hadnt risen against the reich since the mids even soheinrich said finally is a word with a lot of bodies behind it when we can we ought to run things moremore efficiently thats the word i want it was he hoped a word that wouldnt rouse the interest let alone the anger of the security police we ought to run period lise said kathes going to be impatient with us she didnt want any sort of political argument even with friends in that she was undoubtedly wise when she rose to her feet heinrich followed suit as automatically as he would have in the bridge game ill get your coats out of the closet erika said which meant she thought the evening was at an end willi walked out to the front hall with them but he didnt say anything heinrich hoped his friend wasnt fuming about being contradicted it wouldnt have been so bad had heinrich been the only one to disagree with him but when erika did too that must have felt like a stab in the back willi managed a smile and a bad joke when the gimpels headed for the bus stop that eased heinrichs mind but after the door closed behind lise and him willis voice rose angrilyand so did erikas whats that all about lise pointed back toward the dorsches house i think willi thinks he ought to be jealous of me heinrich said unhappily jealous jealous how his wife asked he didnt answer his wife walked on for a couple of paces before stopping short jealous likethat even more unhappily heinrich nodded and does he have reason to be jealous like that lise inquired ominously not on account of me heinrich said that covered the most important part of the question not quite all of it though he felt he had to add im not so sure about erika they got to the brightly lit bus stop lise tapped her toe on the cement of the sidewalk i cant fault her taste but i did see you first you know kindly remember it i will for all sorts of reasons i will heinrich said shes pretty youd better lise said the bus rolled up just then which saved him from having to answer a small mercy but he took what he could get ii franz oppenhoff looked at susanna weiss through spectacles that grotesquely magnified his bloodshot blue eyes i fail to see the necessity for this journey he said and scratched at the bottom edge of a white muttonchop sideburn susanna looked back at the department chairman with a loathing she tried to conceal butherr doktor professor it is the annual meeting of the medieval english associationand only the third time its metin england since the war oppenhoff paused to light a cigar it was a fine havana but the smoke still put susanna who didnt use tobacco in mind of burning long johns she coughed not too ostentatiously after a puff he said manyeven mostof these meetings are a waste of time a waste of effort and a waste of our travel budget oh somehow susanna made one syllable sound dangerous is that what you said when professor lutze asked to attend i didnt professor oppenhoff paused evidently deciding he couldnt get away with the lie direct he tried again i thought the conference would enhance his professional development he being a man susanna finished for him that is not what i was going to say the chairman sounded offended susanna weisswas offended what were you going to say thenherr doktor professor that professor lutze is junior to me he is that he has published less than half of what i have he has that what hehas published is superficial compared to my work it is as any specialist will tell you she smiled with poisonous sweetness there you see we agree completely professor oppenhoff tried to draw on the cigar again but choked on the smoke susanna held the poisoned smile till his coughs subsided into wheezes he wagged a shaky forefinger at her you have not the attitude of a proper national socialist woman he said severely do i have the attitude of a proper national socialist scholar no matter how offended no matter how angry susanna was she took care to throw back the partys name as if she were returning a lob in a game of tennis dont you think that is how you ought to judge me you should be turning out babies not articles oppenhoff said that she remained unwed that she had no children was a private grief for susanna her back stiffened her private griefs were none of oppenhoffs damned business if professor lutzes work is good enough to let him deserve to go to london for the medieval english association meeting what part of mine disqualifies me from going too she didnt say lutze didnt deserve to go no matter what she thought that would have got her another enemy academic politics were nasty enough without trying to make them worse the travel budget the chairman said portentously this time susannas smile was pure carnivore ive spoken with the accountants we have plenty in fact they recommend that we spend more before the end of the fiscal year in june if we have unexpended funds people are liable to decide we dont need so much next year franz oppenhoff went gray with horror a budget cut was every department chairmans nightmare he threw his hands in the air cigar ash fluttered down onto his desk like snow go to londonfraulein doktor professor weiss go uphold the reputation of the university not quite inaudibly he added and get the devil out of my hair susanna pretended not to hear that having got what she wanted she could afford to be gracious thank you very much professor oppenhoff ill make my travel arrangements right away in fact shed already made them if she hadnt been able to browbeat oppenhoff into letting her go she would have had to cancel she could easily have afforded the plane ticket and hotel but she couldnt have gone during the semester without leave from on high now she had it is there anything else professor oppenhoff inquired she was tempted to complain that her office was smaller and had a worse view than those of male professors less senior than sheshe seldom did things by half here though she judged shed pushed the chairman about as far as she could not today thanks she said grandly like a snooty shopper declining a salesgirls assistance small straight nose tilted high she strode out of oppenhoffs office spring was in the air when she left the east wing of the university complex and walked out into the chestnut grove that lay between the wings the chestnuts were still barebranched but the first leaf buds had begun to appear soon the trees would be gloriously green with birds singing and nesting in them for now susanna could see down to the garden and the bronze statues of the great scholars there wilhelm von humboldt the founder of the university his brother alexander helmholtz treitschke mommsen and hegel towering above all the other statues was a colossal bronze of werner heisenberg arno breker hitlers favorite sculptor had commemorated the physicist at the first fuhrer s personal request susanna had seen photos of heisenberg he was tall yes but on the scrawny side almost as much so as heinrich gimpel breker had turned him into one of his countless aryan supermen broadshouldered deepchested with a narrow waist and thighs like a draft horses the usual heroic breker nude struggled to burst forth from the suit in which the sculptor had reluctantly had to drape his subject susanna sighed if heisenberg and the other german scientists hadnt been so quick to see the implications of atomic fissionshe sighed again the world would be different but who could guess how one of the things shed seen was that different didnt necessarily mean better a swarthy young man who wore a neat black beard and had a turban wrapped around his head hurried past susanna please to excuse me he said in musically accented german aber naturlichshe replied with regal politeness the beturbaned young man went up the stairs two at a time and into the east wing of the university building the department of germanic languages shared the wing with the german institute for foreigners which since had been instructing those from abroad on the german language and german culture and the more recent institute for racial studies which helped decide which foreigners deserved to survive and be instructed about the blessings of german culture the fellow whod gone past susanna in such a rush had to be from persia or india probably the latter despite their complexions folk from those lands got credit for being aryans and so lived on as subjectssometimes even privileged subjectswithin the germanic empire had the young man been born farther west had he been an arab rather than an aryanas far as the institute for racial studies was concerned antisemitism extended to arabs as well as jews some of the things the reich had done and had browbeaten the italians into doing in the middle east were on a scale to rival the destruction of the slavic untermenschen in eastern europe we arent the only onessusanna thought with a shudderwe remember better than most of the others though that is one thing we have always done we remember but so do the nazis can we really hope to outlast them heinrich and walther think so or say they do but do they believe it when a noise outside wakes them up in the middle of the night she didnt know how they kept from screaming when they heard a noise like that she had no idea at all howshe kept from screaming when she heard a noise like that even fourthgeneration nazis whod never had an ideologically impure thought in their lives started sweating at noises in the nightthey might know their thoughts were unsullied their bloodlines uncontaminated yes they might know but did the security police you never could tell and if you really had something to hide so far though all the noises susanna had heard in and around her block of flats were those of everyday life neighbors trying to go in and out quietly or sometimes too drunk to bother a tree branch scraping on her window traffic swishing by outside once in a great while the trashcanrattle of an accident no men in highcrowned caps and black trenchcoats pounding on the door and roaringjudin heraus not yet never yet but the fear never went away either with another shiver susanna hurried down toward the garden down toward the statues of the men who had advanced german scholarship and if she tried not to look at brekers bronze of heisenberg well even the security police werent going to notice that heinrich gimpel kissed lise and went up the street to the bus stop he got there five minutes before the bus did as it stopped the door hissed open in front of him he fed his account card into the fare slot then withdrew it and stuck it back in his wallet as he looked up the aisle for a seat he found one at the next stop a plump blond woman sat down next to him when willi dorsch got on a couple of stops later he and heinrich nodded to each other but that was all not sitting with willi didnt break heinrichs heart his friend had been cooler than usual since the awkward end to their evening of bridgedoes he worry that im looking for an affair with erika heinrich shook his head as willi sank into a seat near the back of the bus he enjoyed looking at erika dorsch but that wasnt the same thing at all even lise who wasnt inclined to be objective about such things understood the difference but then a new troubling thought crossed heinrichs mindor does willi think erikas looking for an affair with me even if willi didnt think heinrich wanted the affair he might not be so happy about seeing him every morning and heinrich hadnt the faintest idea what he could do about that the bus made its last few stops and pulled into the train station everyone got off almost everyone went to the platform for the berlinbound commuter train as people queued up heinrich and willi werent particularly close heinrich sighed more often than not the two of them had chatted and gossiped like a couple of hausfrau s all the way in to the city it hadnt happened the past few days and it didnt look as if it would today either it didnt when the train came into the the stahnsdorf station willi sat down on the aisle next to a taken window seat the seat on the other side of the aisle was taken too whatever willi dorsch wanted heinrichs company wasnt it willi pulled a copy of the volkischer beobachter out of his briefcase and started to read heinrich also read the nazi party newspaper one more bit of protective coloration he found a seat halfway down the car from willi got out his own copy and looked it over he did find it professionally useful every now and then what the party decided could dictate what oberkommando der wehrmacht did next reading the paper carefullyespecially reading between the linesgave clues about which way the wind was blowing at levels of the party more exalted than those in which heinrich traveled today he went to the imperialaffairs section first it still looked as if the united states was going to fall short on its occupation assessment heinrich kept waiting for someone in the foreign ministry or the fuhrer s office to comment so far no one had that in itself was interesting when he first started at oberkommando der wehrmacht the americans wouldnt have got a warning if they were late or came up short on what they owed they would simply have been punished thingswere more easygoing these days some things were anyhow a small story announced the execution of a dozen serbs for rebellion against the reich serbs had touched off the first world war almost a hundred years ago now theyd been nuisances ever since and another story told of the jailing of an ss man whod been caught taking bribes in a french town near the english channel such shameless corruptionthe volkischer beobachter declaredcannot be tolerated in an orderly wellrun state heinrich nodded to himself hed seen three or four anticorruption drives since his university days that the reich needed a new one every few years told how well they worked this one though gave signs of being more serious than some of its predecessors an ss man behind bars that was news of the manbitesdog sort heinrich wondered which german bigwigs the frenchmen whod been shaken down happened to know odds were theyd known somebody ss men seldom got into trouble for what they did even inside germany let alone in occupied territory when the train pulled into the station in berlin heinrich and willi naturally went the same way for they had to catch the same bus to the same office the story about the ss man intrigued heinrich enough to make him wave the volkischer beobachter under willi dorschs nose and ask did you see this which willi asked he sounded more distant than usual but not actively unfriendly heinrich pointed to the story oh that willi said yes i saw it politics has to be politics heinrich said it with such surprise he might never have heard the word before willi gave back an impatient nod i dont see what else could be going on i just figured somebody knew somebody heinrich said you know what i mean oh sure willi nodded again with a little more animation this time its possible i suppose but how likely is it who could a bunch of froggies know whos got the clout to land somebody with ss runes on his collar tabs in hot water pigs will fly before we see that he started walking faster come ontheres the bus just waiting for us it did wait they even found seats which they didnt manage every day during the morning rush politics heinrich repeated well i suppose youre right you bet i am willi said as the bus pulled out of the station he patted heinrich on the knee you have any other problems you cant see your way around you come to your uncle willi and hell set you right he smiled a superior smile if erika admired heinrich for anything it was his brainsit couldnt very well have been his body or his looks as he was ruefully aware and if willi felt smarter than he was then all of a sudden he didnt seem such a threat he hoped that was how things were working inside his friends head anyhow he didnt want to be a threat to anybody or anything threats were visible he couldnt afford that kind of visibility and maybe willi was right too to most of the germanic empires subjects politics had to seem simple the germans gave orders and the subjects obeyed subjects who didnt obey paid for it often with their lives sometimes subjects who did obey paid with their lives too but they seldom knew that ahead of time but seen from within the ruling bureaucracy things werent so simplewehrmacht and ss officials warily watched one another the wehrmacht and civilian administrators didnt always see eyetoeye either and the administrators and the ss quarreled over who really represented the national socialist party it wasnt just a factional split either personalities in each camp further complicated things the fuhrer kurt haldweim was supposed to keep everyone going in the same direction but haldweim had celebrated his ninetyfirst birthday just before last christmas for his age he was saidfrequently and loudly saidto be vigorous and alert but how much did that prove when the bus stopped in front of oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters willi dorsch had to nudge heinrich we get off here you know he said enjoying the tiny triumph no matter what great thoughts you think they wont do you any good if you cant find the place where youre supposed to use them youre right of course heinrich stood up feeling foolish as he hurried to get off the bus he noted that willi sounded much more like his usual selfand why because im acting like an idiot ive never heard of the power of positive stupidity but this must be it the guards at the front of the building saw the two of them five mornings a week nonetheless they held out their hands for identity cards they not only matched photos they also fed the cards one after the other into a machine reader only after a light on it glowed green twice in a row did they stand aside nice to know im me willi said sticking his card into his wallet again he pointed at heinrich or maybe im you today and youre me the machine didnt say anything about that he laughed so did heinrich relieved to see willi acting like his usual silly self but one of the guards scowled suspiciously at willi the other eyed the card reader as if wondering if it could change a mans true identity sometimes heinrich worried about the younger generations brains if any but he knew people had been doing that since the days of the pyramids so he kept quiet about it pass on the second guard barked still sending the machine a fishy stare once inside the building with willi heinrich said hes not going to trust that gadget for the next week youre a subversive you know willi drew himself up in mingled alarm and hauteur thats a fine thing to call me in this place but he was joking again and kept right on doing it did you lay down the trail of bread crumbs last night no how the devil are we going to find the way to our desks then oberkommando der wehrmachtwas something of a maze but not so bad as willi made it out to be oldtimers who remembered how things were before central berlin got rebuilt said the old headquarters building really had been a nightmare to navigate this one was just big with lots of corridors and lots of rooms along each one even strangersstrangers with security clearancesfound their way without too much trouble heinrich and willi were in their places in a couple of minutes as soon as heinrich sat down he turned on his computer and entered the password that gave him access to his files he tapped the keyboard and looked over his shoulder at willi saying these things are the biggest change since i came to work here used to be only a few specialists had them now theyre everywhere like toadstools after a rain theyre handy all right willi had his computer up and running too sometimes i wonder whos in charge though us or the machines i have a friendheinrich didnt name walther stutzmanwho says they could all be connected into one giant linked system theres a hell of a difference between could and will willi said i dont believe itll happen not in a million years can you imagine the security nightmare with that kind of system anybody could put anything on it anybody couldfind anything on it the partys got too much sense to let that sort of nonsense get started you couldnt stop it once it did itd be like unscrambling an egg youre right heinrich said it only stands to reason he knew he had more book smarts than willi but his friend was plenty shrewd and understood the way the worldespecially the part through which he movedworked you bet im right willi said now once security starts to slip everythings in trouble jaheinrich said absently he was busy typing in another password the one that gave him access to the wehrmacht s information links thanks to walther he knew a lot more passwords than he was supposed to he carried them in his memory he wasnt mad enough to write any of them down he wasnt mad enough to use any of them either except in direst emergency the one he entered hed acquired legitimately in the course of his job i want to find out whats going on with the united states yes that will be interesting willi dorsch agreed if theyre going to fall short of their assessment that will putour budget in the red further in the red heinrich said willi nodded further in the red true the powers that be wont like it the americans will scream that were trying to get blood from a turnip heinrich predicted theyve been screaming that ever since we beat them willi said so far bloods come out every time weve squeezed true but i dont suppose it can go on forever heinrich said look at france look at denmark they dont pay their way any morewe spend more both places than we take out we would in britain and norway too if they hadnt struck oil in the north sea he waited to see if willi would argue with him he could call up the budget numbers with a couple of keystrokes and use them as a club to beat his friend over the head but willi didnt argue he knew heinrich always had facts and figures at his fingertips instead willi poked through a different part of the wehrmacht network he cherished oddities the way heinrich cherished precision he got more attentionand certainly more laughswith them than heinrich did with tribute assessments too that was fine with heinrich who didnt want attention anyhow willi scrolled down scrolled down then all at once stopped short well ill be damned he said and let out a low whistle of astonishment was ist los heinrich asked as he was surely supposed to they just found three families of jews in some backwoods village in the serbian mountains willi answered probably hadnt seen german soldiers more than three or four times since the war ended can you believe it real live jews in this day and age men had their cocks clipped and everything the damned serb headman says he didnt know he was doing anything wrong harboring them likely story eh you cant trust serbs eitherlook at those bandits in the news todayand thats the gods truth his rant let heinrich pull his face straight what happened to them he asked his voice steady mildly curious as if it had nothing to do with him willi drew a thumb across his throat heinrich nodded just what they deserved he saidyisgadal vyiskadash shmay rabo the opening words of the mourners kaddish lovingly taught him by his father echoed in his mind so did another thoughtif i show my grief i am dead my family is dead my friends are dead he showed not a thing herr kessler leaned forward to alicia as to every other student in the class he seemed to be leaning straight toward her he took a deep breath his usually sallow cheeks turned red he let out the breath in a great shout jews everybody jumped half a dozen girls squealed alicias own start her own squealnearly a shriekhadnt betrayed her after all in fact no one paid any attention to her all eyes were riveted on the teacher and herr kessler was wrapped up in his own performancejews he roared again even louder than the first time our brave wehrmacht soldiers caught up with more than a dozen filthy stinking jews in the mountains of serbia otto schachtman his forefinger stabbed out at a boy otto sprang to his feet jawohl herr kessler show me immediately the location of serbia on the map immediately otto couldnt do it though the occupied country was plainly labeled the teacher paddled his backside he took the swat in stoic silence showing pain would have earned him another one he didnt get in trouble for sitting down with great care though alicia had only so much sympathy for him she could have found serbia without the label shed always been good at geography but why couldnt poor otto justread herr kessler pointed out serbia himself then he went back to his tirade you see now dear children why we must stay ever on our guard the hateful enemy still lurks within the borders of the germanic empire like a serpent the jew waits until our attention is turned elsewhere he waits and then hestrikes we must track him down and hunt him out wherever he may hide do you understand ja herr kessler the children chorused alicia made sure her voice rang as loud as any of the others she was still frightened at the idea of being a jew but it didnt throw her into blind panic any more shed had a little while to get used to it a little while even to develop an odd sort of pride in it but then the teacher pointed at her alicia gimpel she was out of her chair and at attention behind it in a heartbeat jawohl herr kessler what is a jew all she had to do was point at her own chest and sayi am a jew to ruin herself and everyone she loved she knew that knowing it came close to bringing the blind panic back it came close but didnt quite managenot least because the familiar fear at being unexpectedly called on left little room for the other she knew her lessons well no one in the class knew them better the jew is the opposite of the aryanherr kessler she recited he is and remains the typical parasite a sponger who like a noxious bacillus keeps spreading as soon as a favorable medium invites him wherever he appears the host people dies out after a shorter or longer period existence impels the jew to lie and to lie perpetually he lacks idealism in any form his development has always and at all times been the same just as that of the peoples corroded by him has also been the same she stopped she knew she had the textbook definition straight up until a little while before shed believed every word of it part of her still did the restthe rest seemed to stand outside of the self shed had before the night that turned out to be purim she felt somehow bigger than she had before that night her new self enclosed the oldand who could say how much else besides herr kessler drummed the fingers of his right hand against the side of his thigh this is correct he said as if he didnt care to admit it nowyou will tell me the meaning of the wordnoxious he spoke with a certain gloating anticipation if she were parroting the definition without grasping what went into it he would make her pay for that but she wasntjawohl she said again still at attention noxiousmeans disgusting or nasty or poisonous kesslers fingers drummed on his thigh for another few seconds then he gestured peremptorily alicia sat down from the desk beside hers emma whispered smartypants that whisper wasnt quite quiet enough emma handrick the teacher thundered emma almost knocked over her chair jumping out of it jawohl herr kessler since you enjoy talking so much you will now tell the class from what source we have the proper definition of the jew alicia could have answered emma stuttered and stammered and looked up at the ceiling paddle in hand the teacher bore down on hermein kampf she blurted in desperation it must be mein kampf kessler had already begun to swing back the paddle ever so slowly he lowered it emma might have made a lucky guess but she hadnt been wrongja the teacher said be seated and do not speak out of turn any more jawohl herr kesslerdanke schon herr kessler emma sat down in a hurry as if glad to put the nice solid chair seat between her bottom and the paddle balked of his prey kessler lobbed an easy question to the whole class and who wrote mein kampf children our beloved first fuhrer adolf hitler everyone said together thats right very good the teacher nodded if it werent for adolf hitler the jews would still be running the world and exploiting the aryans his finger shot out hans natzmer the boy leaped to his feet kessler said tell me whatexploiting means hans had red hair and freckles that showed ever more plainly as he went pale licking his lips he said i am very sorryherr kessler but i do not know whapthe paddle struck home and hans was sorrier yet kessler said exploitingmeanstaking advantage of remember it you must not merely bleat out your lessons like so many sheep you must understand them must understand the fundamental truth in them down to the depths of your souls fundamental truth alicia wondered about that till shed learned what she really was shed accepted everything her teachers taught her they all said the same things her books all said the same things didnt that mean they were all true shed thought so where shed believed everything now suddenly she doubted everything if what her teachers and the books said about jews was a lie and it had to be because they said jews were evil and she refused to believe that about her family and its friendsshe knew better did they lie about everything else too was anything they taught her the truth anything at all did the earth really go around the sun were four and four really eight she could find out about that last one she looked down at her hands four fingers on each her thumbs hidden beneath her palms yes four and four really did make eight she sighed a little regretfully she would have to keep all the arithmetic theyd rammed down her throattoo bad she thought it wasnt her favorite subject everything else thougheverything else remained up for grabs she had to make another surrender a few minutes later when herr kessler went through the days grammar lesson she didnt suppose he was lying about that people did talk the way he said they did and they did look down their noses at what he said were mistakes what she felt after that was a strange mix of exaltation and terror from now on she was going to have to figure things out for herself if she wanted to know what was so and what wasnt she would have to weigh and judge and decide she would have to try to see what her teachers werent telling her from what they did say it wouldnt be easy she realized that too beside her emma was humming to herself alicia didnt think the other girl even knew she was doing it would emma be able to handle something like this alicia laughed at the very idea emma had the imagination of a potato she had to believe everything the teachers said because she couldnt think for herself tell her one thing was true but she had to behave as if another were and shed go to pieces like a broken mechanical toy alicia laughed again perhaps a little cruelly imagining gears and springs popping out of emmas nose and ears that was funny all righttoo funny alicia gimpel the teacher shouted out of the chair at attention jawohl herr kessler perhaps you would care to tell the whole class what you find so amusing nothingherr kessler please excuse meherr kessler if he swatted herwell if she got punished for small things maybe no one would notice she deserved to be punished for something enormous be seated keep quiet ja herr kesslerdanke schon herr kessler lucky emma whispered as alicia sat down alicia nodded without a word most of her mind was far awayif being a jew isntbad why do i deserve to be punished for it the more she looked at it the more complicated it got lise gimpel was chopping cabbage when francesca came into the kitchen and waited to be noticed she didnt have to wait long her mother put down the knife and said hello little one what can i do for you can i ask you something mommy francesca said seriously of course you can dear what is it lise was especially fond of her middle daughter though she tried hard not to show it to her children or her husband alicia had a clear cool intelligence very much like heinrichs roxanelise smiled roxane was a law unto herself but francesca reminded lise of what shed been like when she was a little girl with eightyearold solemnity francesca asked whats wrong with alicia shes sure been acting funny lately has she lise said i hadnt noticed she didnt like lying to her children she didnt like it but she didnt hesitate either well she has francesca rolled her eyes at adult blindness she looked more like lise than either of the other girls too her face was broader than theirs and her hazel eyes were a compromise between lises green and the brown heinrich had passed on undiluted to alicia and roxane acting funny how lise asked though she had a pretty good idea she doesnt want to play so much francesca said and she just stays in her room looking at books and thinking about things well you know alicia lise tried to pass it off lightly she gets that way sometimes that much was true the oldest gimpel daughter had developed a series of enthusiasmscollecting seashells was the latestthat consumed her for days or weeks or sometimes months and then vanished as if theyd never been but francesca shook her head its not like that this time usually when she gets that way she wants roxane and me to get that way too sheexpects us to get that way too and she gets mad when we dont lise hid a smile francesca wasnt wrongalicia did act like that another way francesca was like her mother was that she noticed the way people behaved alicia was all too often blind to it now lise did smile a little sourly that also came straight from heinrich since francesca did notice lise would have to answer her she tried another question but not this time not this time francesca agreed i asked her what it was and she looked at me and she said nothing her mouth twisted i dont know what it is but its not nothing i hope shesi hope shes not in trouble at school and trying to hide it that was the worst thing she could think of lises heart went out to her because it was the worst thing she could think of im pretty sure you dont need to worry about that lise said herr kessler would let me know if anything were wrong hes very diligent he reminded her at least as much of a policeman as of a teacher but that was a different story shed succeeded in distracting her daughter anyhow what does diligent mean it means he takes care of everything that needs taking care of oh francesca spread her hands a gesture of pure frustration well whatis wrong with alicia then i dont know whatever it is shell probably get over it pretty soon lise saidshed better get over it pretty soon if she doesnt more people than francesca will notice no doubt her own parents had had the same worries the same fears over her and no doubt theyd had good reason to roxane bustled into the kitchen she greeted francesca oh there you are what are you doing talking with mommy francesca looked down her nose at her little sister what are you talking about roxane wouldnt have recognized a snub if it bit her in the ankle what a nuisance you are francesca said we were not lise said you apologize this instant sorry francesca sounded anything but well whatwere you talking about then roxane persisted about alicia francesca said reluctantly oh roxane nodded her hair even curlier than alicias bounced up and down shes been peculiar lately all right she fixed francesca with a baleful stare aber naturlichyoure pretty peculiar yourself roxane you stop that too not for the first time lise gimpel had the feeling of being in nomansland between forces that were going to keep sniping at each other no matter what she did sometimes the squabbles among her children were threesided which only made her feel completely surrounded she did her best to sound severe now you say youre sorry sorry roxane outdid francesca in insincerity then happily she went back to talking about alicia who wasnt there to defend herself shes been reading those funny jew books again and just a little while ago she was talking about how they were still in her room even though theyre too easy for her those funny jew books streichers poison had a candy coating that had made it seem tasty to german children for almost eighty years lise remembered thinking the same thing about his books before finding out what she was carefully she said sometimes you most want to look back at something just when youre getting too big for it to her relief francesca nodded in agreement to that i think the kindergarten rooms are a lot cuter now than i did when i was in them they arent cute said roxane who was in kindergarten now theyre justschoolrooms she laced the word with scorn but they have all those tiny little desks and chairs and things francesca said theyre sosweet she was the sentimental one in the family another way she took after lise roxane made a horrible face francesca made one back at hershe wasnt too sentimental for that cut it out both of you lise said youre behaving like a couple of hottentots she had no idea how hottentots behaved or even if the reich had left any of them alive but she liked the sound of the name instead of cutting it out francesca and roxane egged each other on that gave lise the excuse to shoo them out of the kitchen if they wanted to drive each other crazy somewhere else she didnt mind if they were driving each other crazy they werent wondering why alicia was acting strange lise hoped they werent anyway she also hoped no one outside the family had noticed anything out of the ordinary alicia was a bright child and more than either of her sisters a solitary child that ought to make any odd behavior from her stand out less and be more likely to get forgiven it ought to lise hoped it would she wondered if there was any point to praying it would did god listen to a jews prayers these days if he did why had he let the nazis do what theyd donewhat did we dowhat could we have doneto deserve thatthe question had haunted lise ever since she learned she was a jew shed never come close to finding an answer that satisfied her and how long till alicia asked the same thing not very not if lise was any judge alicia was too clevertoo clever by halfnot to wonder about that there were times when lise wished her eldest daughter were a little less clever or at least had a little more in the way of sense to go with her precocious intelligence she laughedas well wish for the moon while im at it she went back to getting supper readyand then in a couple of years well have to tell francesca and after that roxane how long can we hope to get away with it how long can we keep being what we are she was chopping an onion she told herself the tears in her eyes came from that maybe she was right maybe heinrich gimpel poked a button on the remote control the televisor in the living room came to life it was seven oclock time for the evening news the news reader horst witzleben looked like a cross between an ss man and a film star come on lise heinrich called lets see whats gone on today ill be there in a second she answered from the kitchen dishes are nearly done turn up the sound so i can hear it all right he did that made witzlebens booming greetinggood dayvolk of the greater german reich sound even more impressive than it would have otherwise he owned an almost operatic baritone heinrich wouldnt have been surprised if technicians in the studio pumped it up electronically to make it sound more impressive more believable still the ministry of propaganda didnt miss a trick and now the news and now what they want people to hearheinrich thought he had excellent good reasons not to rely completely on the propaganda ministrys trained seal it wasnt just that he was a jew and the nazis had been thundering lies about his kind since before they came to power he also worked in the oberkommando der wehrmacht things he found out about professionally sometimes showed up on the news when they did they were often distorted past recognition ordinary people thoughbutchers bakers candlestick makersgoyim had no way to know that no reason to believe it as far as they were concerned witzleben might have been spouting holy writi heard it from horst was a synonym for you can take it to the bank heinrich had a sneaking suspicion the ministry of propaganda had set out to make it one our beloved leader kurt haldweim is reported to be resting comfortably in the fuhrer s palace recovering from what his physicians describe as a stubborn cold horst witzleben intoned routine matters proceed normally should anything extraordinary arise the fuhrer is fully capable of attending to it on the instant the picture of the fuhrer on the screen behind witzleben had to be at least fifteen years old like hitler himself kurt haldweim had been born in the ostmark when it was still austria and separate from germany hed been a young officer in the second world war he was perhaps the last of that generation still in the saddleif hewas still in the saddle over the past few years hed had a long series of stubborn colds and minor illnesses that kept him out of the public eye for weeks at a time everything went on in his name how much that meantwas not the sort of thing horst witzleben discussed on the air even working where he did heinrich didnt know the full answer there along with everyone else in the germanic empire he could only wait and see if the fuhrer rallied as he had several times before lise came in then heinrich turned down the sound and slipped an arm around her as she sat down on the sofa beside him she rested her head on his shoulder you didnt miss a thing he told her horst was just going on about the fuhrer s cold he put a certain ironic twist on the word he says everything with haldweim is fine then lise asked heinrich nodded she sighed and one of these days before too long hell be deadbut hell still be fine heinrich automatically turned his head to make sure nobody not even the children could hear such a thing only when he was sure it was safe did he laugh thats how it was with himmler all right he agreed only dialysis had kept the second fuhrer going the last five years of his life but not a word of that had ever got into the news some people claimed himmler had really died in not and that a junta of ss men and generals had run the empire till they finally agreed on haldweim as a successor heinrich had never spoken with anyone in a position to know who was willing to talk about that though the televisor screen suddenly cut away from horst witzlebens aryan good looks to a shot of a city rising from a prairie of almost russian immensity omaha the capital of the united states since the destruction of washington a tight shot of german jet fighters circling overhead another shot of uniformed german officials conferring with dumpy americans who looked all the dumpier because they wore business suits discussion of payment of remaining american debts for the current fiscal year continues in a frank and forthright manner witzleben said a solution satisfactory to the reich is anticipated a stock clip showed a company of panzers rolling through the american countryside another one older showed a city disappearing in atomic fire lise shivered would the reich really do that again she whispered it can heinrich answered because it can it probably wont have to the real questions are how much of what they owe will the americans pay and how loud will the reich have to yell before they do he nodded to himself those were the questions that counted all right who persuadedor browbeatthe americans into coughing up how much could have a good deal to do with who followed kurt haldweim into the fuhrer s palace another camera cut this one to london like paris the town was more a monument to what had been than to what was nowadays parts of it remained in ruins more than sixty years after its fall to german panzers and divebombers horst witzleben said the british union of fascists will be convening for their annual congress next week their full support for all germanic programs is anticipated heinrich and lise both snorted at that the british fascists had always followed berlins line theyd always had to or the reich would clamp down on them even harder than usual but no sooner had that thought crossed heinrichs mind than a beefy redfaced englishman in buf regalia appeared on the televisor screen in cockneyaccented german he said were good fascists too we are we think weve got a proper notion of whats right for britain dryly witzleben commented whether the british union of fascists will endorse this position remains to be seen the next story was on the state visit of the poglavnik of croatia to the king of bulgaria heinrich thought he knew what they would be talking about hunting down the serb terrorists who kept the balkans bubbling he was still amazed the englishman had had the nerve to say what hed said and that the news had shown it someone in the ministry of propaganda had gone out on a limb there and the englishman had gone out on a bigger one were the security police looking for him even now lise had a different thought susanna will be in london for thisnicht wahr for it no heinrich shook his head but yes at the same time his wife sent him a severe look there are times sweetheart when youre too precise for your own good you he waved her to silence there on the screen were the poglavnik and the king each in a different fancy uniform shaking hands and the correspondent from sofia was saying lating each other on the discovery and elimination of a nest of jews deep in the serbian mountains back to you horst dankewitzleben said as his image reappeared on the screen he looked out at his vast audience the menace of world jewry never goes awaymeine damen und herren it is as true now as it was when our fuhrer served in salonica during the second world war lise shivered they dont give up do they not likely heinrich made a fist and pounded it down on his knee no not likely dammit we thought things would be easier when himmler finally kicked the bucket lise said in a soft voice no one but heinrich could possibly hear and then what did we get instead kurt haldweim she didnt try to hide her bitterness heinrich stroked her hair maybe it will be better this time the ss isnt so strong nowat least i hope it isnt ill believe it when i see it lise said and he had no answer for that the next story was about a riot at a football match in milan when the home teams goal against visiting leipzig was disallowed on a questionable offside call the crowd did more than question it they bombarded the field with rocks and bottles so that both teams and the officials had to flee for their lives one german football player was slightly injured one officialnot the one whod made the dubious callended up with a broken collarbone leaders of the german federation of sport have called upon their italian counterparts for explanation and apology witzleben said in tones of stern disapproval thus far none has been forthcoming these disgraceful scenes have grown all too common at matches on italian pitches the german federation of sport has declared it reserves the right to withdraw from further competition with teams from the italian empire unless and until the situation is corrected that would hurt the italians a lot worse than it did their german foes they depended on revenue from matches against visiting german powerhouses to keep themselves in the black and if they couldnt tour in the germanic empiresome of their teams would probably have to fold heinrich tried to look at things philosophically what can you expect from italians they get too excited about whats only a game and then lise brought him down to earth saying and who was it who whooped like a wild indian when we won the world cup four years ago i dont know what youre talking about heinrich said whereupon lise made a face at him he poked her in the ribs and found a ticklish spot she squeaked whats that funny noise francesca called from upstairs that funny noise is your mother heinrich answered why are you a funny noise mommy their middle daughter asked because your father is tickling me which hesnot supposed to do lise said she tried to tickle him back but he wasnt ticklish unfair she muttered very unfair and why is this night different from all other nights heinrich murmured the first of the four questions from the passover service reminded lise that life wasnt fair for jews never had been and probably never would bebut wesomehowgo on anyway heinrich thought his wife didnt answer him he did stop tickling her esther stutzman worked a couple of mornings a week as a receptionist at a pediatricians office it wasnt so much that the family needed the money they didnt but she was a gregarious soul and shed wanted to see people after gottlieb and anna started going to school and didnt need to be looked after all the time the doctor was a short plump man named martin dambach he wasnt a jew several of his patients were but he didnt know that good morningfrau stutzman he said when esther came in good morning doctor she answered how are you today tired he said and rubbed his eyes there was a traffic accident outside the house in the middle of the nightone of the drivers reeked like a breweryand i gave what help i could then the police wanted to talk with me which cost meanother hour of sleep would you please get the coffeemaker going how awful of course i will esther said dr dambach was a skilled and knowledgeable physician but when he tangled with the percolator he turned out either hot water faintly tinged with brown or unpalatable mud as she got the coffee started she asked was anyone badly hurt not the drunk he said sourly he was so limp and relaxed you could have dropped him from the top of the great hall and he wouldnt have got hurt when he hit the ground a woman in the other car broke her leg and im afraid the man with her had internal injuries they took him away in an ambulance what will they do to the drunk esther asked dr dambach looked less happy still that i cannot tell you he kept blithering on about what an important fellow he was in the party if he was lying hell be sorry but if he was telling the truthyou know how these things go being an aryan the pediatrician could afford to grumble about the way the world worked esther stutzman nodded but she never would have complained herself even nodding made her feel as if she was taking a chance what appointments do we have this morning dambach asked let me look she went to the register there arethree immunizations and the fischers will be bringing in their sevenyearold for you to check his scoliosis and the telephone rang interrupting her she picked it up dr dambachs office how may i help youyescan you bring her in at tenthirtyall right thank you she turned back to the doctor and lotte friedl has a sore throat probably the first of several dambach said in which he was probably right anything else yes doctor the kleins are bringing in their little boy for another checkup esther answered she tried not to change her tone of voice richard and maria klein and their son paul were jewsthough paul who was only eight months old had no idea that he was dr dambach frowned paul kleinja that baby is not thriving as he should and i do not know why he sounded personally affronted at not knowing too he was a good doctor he had that relentless itch to find out maybe youll see something this time that you didnt notice before esther said she paused and sniffed and the coffees just about ready good dambach said pour me a big cup please i have to get my brains from somewhere today the outer door to the waiting room opened in came the first patient and her mother esther started to say hello then got interrupted when the telephone rang again sure enough it was a woman whose son had a sore throat feeling harried esther made an appointment for her as if by magic a cup of coffee appeared at her elbow dr dambach had not only poured one for himself hed poured one for her too and laced it with cream and sugar imsupposed to do that she said indignantly he shrugged you were busier than i was just then i suspect it will even out as the day goes along esther had her doubts about that though she kept quiet about them dr dambachs work was more specialized than hers she knew that but the phones the patients and parents in the waiting room the billing and the medical records often made her feel like a juggler with a stream of plates and knives and balls in the air if she didnt pay attention every moment everything would come crashing down on the other hand shed felt that way ever since she found out what she was at worst an office disaster could get her fired a disaster of a different sortshe resolutely declined to think about that staying busy helped drive worry away busy she was but she was reminded of her heritage when the kleins brought in little paulsomething was wrong with him she could see as much he seemed listless and unhappy and somehow less well assembled than he should have been he didnt hold his head up the way a baby his age should have nor did he act fascinated with his hands and feet like most eightmontholds his parents especially his mother looked drawn and worried they were the last appointment before lunch dr dambach stayed in the examining room with them for a long time paul cried once he didnt sound quite right either though esther had trouble putting her finger on why it wasnt astrong cry that was as close as she could come working here shed heard plenty of unhappy babies paul klein should have raised a bigger fuss at last the kleins came out of the examining room the baby in marias arms thank you doctor richard klein said maybe this means something important i will have to do more investigating myself before i can say for certain dr dambach replied make an appointment with frau stutzman pleaseill want to see him again in another two weeks he sounded brisk and businesslike the kleins probably wouldnt know he used that demeanor to mask alarm having worked with him for two years esther did after shed made the appointment after the kleins had left she turned to the doctor and asked whats wrong with him his muscular development is not as it should be dambach said he seemed normal up until a couple of months ago but since then he shook his head if anything he has gone backwards when he should be moving ahead and i saw something peculiar when i looked in his eyes a red spot on each retina what does that mean esther asked im not sure i dont believe ive ever seen anything like it before the pediatrician said i dont know if it is connected to the other problem either can you order some food brought here please i was going to go out for lunch but i believe i will stay here and go through my books instead of course doctor esther stutzman said will one of those italian cheese pies do the shop is close and they deliver dambach nodded that will be fine i know the place you mean they promise to get it where it should go in under half an hour which is all to the good today ill take care of it esther made the call the cheese pie arrived twentyseven minutes later shed heard the owner had fired delivery boys for being late so she was glad this one showed up on time she paid for it from the cash drawer then brought it in to dr dambach just set it on the desk please he said without looking up from the medical book he was going through only his left hand and his mouth gave the food any notice the rest of his attention was riveted on the book esther thought she could have substituted a coffee cake or plain bread without his knowing the difference she was eating her own lunch ready to go home as soon as the afternoon receptionist came in when dambach exclaimed in what might as easily have been dismay as triumph what is it doctor she called i know what paul klein has dr dambach said esther still couldnt tell how he felt about knowing she asked well what is it then he came out of the office a half forgotten slice of the cheese pie still in his left hand his face said more than his voice had he looked thoroughly grim its an obscure syndrome called taysachs disease im afraid he answered along with the rest of his condition the red spots on his retinas nail down the diagnosis i never heard of it esther said i wish i hadnt now the pediatrician sounded as unhappy as he looked why she asked what is it what does it do there is an enzyme called hexosaminidase a babies with taysachs disease are born without the ability to form it without it lipids accumulate abnormally in the cells and especially in the nerve cells of the brain the disease destroys brain function a little at a time i will not speak of symptoms but eventually the child is blind mentally retarded paralyzed and unresponsive to anything around it oh my god how horrible esthers stomach did a slow lurch she wished she hadnt eaten what can you do is there a cure i can do nothing no one can do anything dr dambachs voice was hard and flat there is no cure all children who have taysachs disease will die usually before they turn five i intend to recommend to the kleins that they take the baby to a reichs mercy center to spare it this inevitable suffering then i intend to go out and get drunk he couldnt bring himself to come right out and talk about killing a baby though that was what he meant the germans whod slaughtered jews hadnt talked straight out about what they were doing either though people werent so shy about it any more here esther had more sympathy how awful for you she said and how much worse for the kleins what causes this horrible disease could they have done anything to keep the baby from getting it dr dambach shook his head no nothing its genetic if both parents carry the recessive and if the two recessives come together he spread his hands even that gesture didnt remind him of the cheese pie he was holding intent on his own thoughts he went on we dont see the disease very often these days i have never seen it before thank heaven and i hope i never see it again the books say it used to be fairly common among the jews though before we cleaned them out are you all rightfrau stutzman yes i think so this is all just soso dreadful esther made herself nod dambach nodded back accepting what shed said he couldnt know why her heart had skipped a beat a good thing too he couldnt come out and talk about killing a baby but he took the extermination of the jews for granted why not he hadnt even been born when it happened dreadfulja a very unfortunate coincidence even among the jews it was not common you understand but it was up to a hundred timesmore common among them than it is among aryans dambach thoughtfully rubbed his chin did you happen to see on the news a few days ago the story about the jews found in that village in backwoods serbia how to answer esther saw only one way casually i sure did who would have imagined such a thing in this day and age what she wanted to do was get up and run from the doctors office that that would be the worst thing she could possibly do didnt matter reason held her in her chair held a polite smile on her face behind the facade instinct screamed still thoughtful dr dambach went on taysachs disease is so rare among aryans it almost makes one wonder ice lived in esther dont be silly doctor she said keeping up the casual front none ofthem left any more not in a civilized country pretending she wasnt a jew was second nature to her shed done it almost automatically ever since she learned what she was but mocking scorning her true heritage wasnt so easy she didnt have to do that very often simply because jews were so nearly extinct i suppose youre right the pediatrician said and relief flowered like springtime in her but then he added still the door to the waiting room opened in came irma ritter who would work in the afternoon she was even rounder than dr dambach pointing to the slice of cheese pie in his hand she asked any more of that left he looked down in surprise i dont know he said sounding foolish let me go look while he did esther made her escapeand that was exactly what it felt like alicia gimpel and her sisters were playing an elaborate game with dolls part of it came from an adventure film theyd seen a few weeks before but that was only the springboard more came straight from their imaginations here roxane picked up one of the few male dolls they had he can be the nasty jew whos trying to cheat the dragons out of their cave no alicia exclaimed before remembering she wasnt supposed to say anything like that no matter what why not roxane clouded up you never like any of my ideas its not fair i think alicias right this time francesca said hes not ugly enough to be a jew that wasnt why alicia had said no of course she seized on it gratefully all the same yes that is what i meant she said she still didnt like lying to her sisters but she didnt see what she could do about it either she couldnt tell the truth she could see thattheyll find out soon enough she thought from the height of her own ten years roxane examined the doll who was indeed plastic perfection well we canpretend hes ugly she declared and made him advance on the cardboard box doing duty for a cave in a high squeaky unnatural voice she said here dragons ill give you these beans if youll move away from here and never come back they may be magic beans she laughed shrilly and whispered and they may not too francesca reached into the box and pulled out a stuffed dragon you nasty old jew youre trying to fool us youd better get out of here or ill burn your ears off roxane made the doll retreat ill figure out another way to get your gold thenyou see if i dont oh no you wont francesca retorted im an aryan dragon and im too tough for you alicia got to her feet i dont think i want to play any more why not roxane said things are just getting good she looked down at the doll arent they it respondedshe made it respondwith a thoroughly evil chuckle and a thats right in the high squeaky voice shed used before shes a wet blanket thats why francesca said shes been a wet blanket for weeks now and im tired of it wet blanket wet blanket roxane sang now in her own voice now in the one shed invented for the jew doll i am not alicia said angrily this is a stupid game thats all roxane got angry too youre just saying its stupid because im doing something i thought up all by myself she wheeled out the heavy artillery im going to tell mommy says you cant do things like that and francesca was also angry in a quieter way how can you say its a stupid game when you thought up half of it because but alicia couldnt say what she couldnt say knowing what she knew and not being able to talk about it threatened to choke her because it is thats all im going to tell roxane said againmommy you and your big mouth alicia said whereupon her little sister opened it as wide as she could and stuck out her tongue alicia was tempted to grab that tongue and give it a good yank but it was too slimy for her to do it whats going on came from the ground floor ominous footsteps on the stairs followed each one louder than the one before their mother appeared at the doorway to francesca and roxanes room cant the three of you play together nicely i didnt want to play any more thats all alicia said thats not all you didnt like my ideas thats what it is roxane said and proceeded to explain in great detail what her ideas were understanding kindled in their mothers eyes she started to say something then closed her mouth again awe trickled through aliciashe cant tell either she thoughtshes a grownup and shecant tell that spoke more clearly than anything else of how important the secret was it was important enough to constrain a grownup and grownups by the very nature of things were beyond constraint their mother tried again this time she succeeded play the game alicia she said gently go ahead and play the game its all right thats what we have to do see triumph filled roxane mommy told you to and so she had but shed told alicia something else too something that had gone by roxane and francescathats what we have to do people who werent jews were going to say things about them they were going to mock them they couldnt help it they believed all the things theyd learned in school alicia still half believed them herself which sometimes left her halfsick with confusion if you couldnt get used to that if you couldnt pretend it wasnt anything youd give yourself away all right alicia said ill play the game by the way their mother smiled shed also sneaked a message past her sisters good alicia lise gimpel said in that case ill get back to what i was doing she went down the hall she went down the stairs roxane eyed alicia expectantly francesca eyed her suspiciously as if to sayyou cant just start and stop like that but alicia could at first she felt as if she were in one of the little plays students sometimes had to put on at school as if this werent happening to her but to the person she was pretending to be the longer she did it though the more natural it got she and her sisters foiled the doll that was being a jew another doll brought animaginarysack of gold so the dragons whod been tricked out of theirs got to keep their cave then while the jew was gloating over his illgotten gains more dolls these proper aryans swooped down on him they took him away to another box roxane closed the lid and thatll be the end of him she chortled then in a more practical frame of mind she added till we need him for another game anyhow see alicia francesca said that was pretty good i suppose so alicia said for her no small admission and more than enough to satisfy her sisterbut its not all a game she thought some of the things her father had said made that very plainif you put a real person in a box and close the lid and go thatll be the end of him he wont come out again for the next game roxane wouldnt understand she was too little alicia had trouble understanding it herself one of the teachers at her school though had had the misfortune to step in front of a bus and frau zoglmann would never be back again death was permanent no matter what roxane thought yes death was permanent and so was fear iii arent you going to lunch asked walther stutzmans boss a big beefy fellow named gustav priepke walther shook his head not today im swamped you priepke scratched his head maybe we need more system designers if youve got as much as you can handle everybody else is bound to be drowning youre the one who keeps the whole section afloat thanks just at that moment stutzman would have preferred a less enviable efficiency record he said if i get a chance ill grab something at the office canteen later on his boss made a face make sure you tell your wife you may never see her again first im going down the street to a real restaurant instead off he went the belly that hung over his belt said he liked good food or at least lots of food alone in the cubicle walther typed in a security code he wasnt supposed to use because of what he did he had unusual access to the reich s electronic networks he could have wreaked untold havoc if that were what he wanted it wasnt staying invisible and helping other people stay invisible counted for much more nobody at zeiss computing should have been able to access the official genealogical records of the germanic empire but walthers father had helped transfer those records from paper to computers hed left a few highly unofficial ways to get into them those wouldnt stay safe if anyone used them too often here thoughhere stutzman judged the risk worth taking richard kleins ancestry appeared on the monitor in front of him his own father had given richards grandfather a perfect aryan pedigree at least in the database in those terrorfilled days no one had taken the least chance with blight on a family tree now though if someone suddenly suspicious because of the dreadful misfortune that had befallen richards baby should compare electronic records with whatever lingered in a dusty file drawer somewhere that would not be good walther murmured he went back seven generations in kleins family and changed the entry under religion for one of his multiplegreatgrandmothers from lutheran to unknown then he did the same thing with two of maria kleins even more distant ancestors after studying his handiwork he nodded to himself and left the genealogical records that should take care of ithe thought possible jews so far back in the woodpile were safe anyone applying for the ss had to show his ancestors had been judenfrei for longer than that but richard klein who made a good living playing the trombone was never going to apply for that service and finding distant ancestors who might have been jews in his family tree and his wifes would keep the security police from wondering if the kleins themselves carried their blood and their faith down through the generationsit had better anyhow one more danger remained a program on a machine somewhere in the zeiss works recorded every keystroke every employee made if anyone ever started wondering about one walther stutzman he could go through the record and see that walther had done things he wasnt authorized to do he couldtill walther keyed in the phrase red chalk and green cheese a dialog box appeared on his monitor he entered the time hed begun fiddling with the genealogical records and the time hed left them the hidden override on the keystroke monitor would substitute a copy of what hed been doing yesterday during that period for what hed actually done today he muttered to himself this was only the third time he could remember using the override it carried risks of its own those though were smaller than the risk of showing he was mucking about with anything connected to jews he couldnt think of any risk bigger than that one after he got back from the canteenwhere lunch gustav priepke notwithstanding wasnt half badhe called esther ive taken care of the shopping he said oh good his wife answered youll bring home something nice for me wont you walther laughed of course what else have i got to spend my money on thats why i love you you have the right attitude esther said they chatted for a couple of minutes then he hung up he assumed any line out from the office could be tapped at any time esther had understood what he was telling her though and he didnt think anyone from the security police could have his boss stuck his head into stutzmans cubicle priepke was smoking a pipe apparently charged with stinkweed everything under control he asked everything except that walther pointed at the pipe i thought they outlawed poison gas a long time ago ha priepke took it out of his mouth and blew a smoke ring if you ask me its all to the good hows that walther asked hed been kidding on the square the pipe really was vile how ill tell you how another smoke ring polluted the air if there are any jews around ill gas em out priepke threw back his head and guffawed walther laughed too a little more than dutifully how many times had he heard jokes like that more than he could count what could he do but laugh the lufthansa airliner taxied toward the terminal at heathrow airport first in german and then in english the chief steward said baggage claim and customs are to your left as you leave the aircraft you must have your baggage with you when you clear customs all bags are subject to search obey all commands from customs officials have a pleasant stay in london obey all commands have a pleasant stay susanna weiss snorted the steward saw no irony there neither did the hack whod written his script and neither did the hacks bosses whod told him what to write purpose of your visit to the united kingdom a british customs man asked in accented german i am here for the meeting of the medieval english association susanna replied in english she was more fluent in his tongue than he was in hers maybe she wastoo fluent fluent enough to get taken for a fellow national despite her german passport whatever the reason the customs man went through her baggage with painstaking care while other passengers headed out to the cab stand she fumed quietly arguing with a petty functionary while he did his job was likely to make him more thorough to cost more time at last finding nothing more incriminating than copies of anglosaxon prose and one hundred middle english lyrics the customs man stamped her passport and said pass onstill in german thank you so much susanna saidstill in english the sarcasm rolled off him like water off oilcoth she let out a sigh of relief when she saw black british taxis still waiting at the cab stand a cabby touched the brim of his cap where to maam to the silver eagle hotel please susanna answered right yare he said cheerfully and tossed her bags into what the british called the boot he held the door open for her closed it after her and got behind the wheel the cab pulled away from the curb susanna had a momentary qualm as she did whenever she came to britain then she remembered they did drive on the left here and the cabby wasnt drunk or insaneor if he was she couldnt prove it by that londons sprawl was even more vast than berlins the british capital also had a far more modern look than the centerpiece of the germanic empire after the fight churchills backers had put up trying to hold the wehrmacht out of london not much from the old days was left standing susanna had seen pictures of the old parliament building big ben and st pauls cathedral pictures were all that remained and after the war london had taken a generation to start rebuilding and still hadnt finished the job german urban planners often came here to see how their british counterparts were doing what they needed to do whizzing past one newish block of flats or industrial park after another susanna wondered why the british had worked here with a clean slate which no one ever would with a german city a graffito gone before she could read it then she saw another one painted in big blue letters on the side of a walllet us choose it said a moment later the same message appeared again whats that all about she asked the taxi driver whats what maam let us choose oh he drove on for a few seconds then asked yourenot a brit shed fooled him into thinking she was a native speaker this time unlike going through customs that pleased her enormously what praise could be higher for someone whod learned a foreign language but she had to answer no i just got here from berlin oh he said again more portentously this time thereswell theres some talk of ow to run the british union of fascists he nodded to himself yes thats what it is all right that might have been some of what it was but not all having lived so much of her life hiding things from others susanna recognized when somebody wasnt saying everything he might have she didnt push the cabby if she had he would have decided she worked for the gestapo or some other german security outfit and would have clammed up altogether even now almost the biblical threescore and ten after the conquest people on the streets here were thinner and shabbier than their german counterparts their gaze had a certain furtive quality to it it wouldnt rest on any one thing for long but flicked now here now there seldom did anyone meet anyone elses eye in germany people were careful about the security police but most of them knew they were unlikely to draw suspicion unless they stepped out of line here security agencies assumed anybody could be the enemy and everybody knew it ere you are maam the cabby said pulling up in front of a glassandsteel pile decorated if that was the word with an enormous eagle of polished aluminum it wasnt quite the germanic eagle that so often bore a swastika in its talons but it certainly made anyone who saw it think of that eagle at first glance ope you ave a pleasant stay at the silver eagle your fares four and tuppence susanna handed him a crown he pocketed the big aluminum coin stamped with the image of henry ix on one side and the lightning bolts of the british union of fascists on the other i dont need any change she said but i would like a receipt right you are i thank you very much he wrote one for the five shillings shed given him then got her bags out of the boot and set them on the sidewalk he was about to drive off when she pointed across the street to the even bigger and more garish hotel there a lot of the peoplealmost all of them mengoing in and out of that hotel were in uniforms of one sort or another is that where the british union of fascists is holding its meeting yes maam the taximan said they always gather at the crown they do a crown of aluminum anodized in gold outdid even the silver eagle on susannas hotel for gaudiness before she could find any more questions he put the cab in gear and whizzed away welcomemedieval english association the banner in the lobby of the silver eagle greeted newcomers in english german and french not all the people queuing up in front of the registration desk were tweedy professorial types though close to half were hardfaced men in those notquitemilitary uniformsoverflow from the crown susanna realized this might prove a veryinteresting meeting she remembered the convention in dusseldorf a few years before when the medievalists had shared the hotel with a group of mushroom fanciers shed had the best omelette shed ever eaten but several of her colleagues and even more of the mushroom lovers came down sick at a feast shed missed luckily no one died but she knew two or three professors whod sworn off mushrooms for good two british fascists in front of her talked as if they were alone in the hotel lobby one said nationalism and autonomy arent just catchphrases to trot out on the wireless whenever morale needs a bit of pumping up theyd bloody well better not be his friend agreed we can run our own show here by god we dont need someone from the continent to tell us how to handle the job the first man nodded so vehemently his cap almost flew off his head thats right sir oswald started banging heads almost as soon as adolf did if the germans letus choose well do fine if they dont susanna didnt find out what he thought would happen then because the pair of uniformed men reached the head of the queue and advanced on the desk clerk a moment later another clerk waved to susanna to her relief the hotel hadnt lost her reservation shed feared the fascist contingent might have had enough clout to oust the medievalists but evidently not you are a german national the clerk asked yes that is correct susanna answered to the outside world it was how a jew could feel like a german national after everything the third reich had done was a different question but one each survivor wrestled with silently and alone not in front of a registration clerk your passport please the man said he was years younger than susanna but had shiny white teeth of perfect evenness and alarmingly pink gums dentures a lot of englishmen and women needed false teeth even before it was conquered britain hadnt been able to raise all the food it needed and the people often preferred things like sweets and potato crisps to more nourishing food they paid the price in dentistry here susanna handed him the document he opened the red leatherette cover with the swastikacarrying eagle embossed in gold compared her photograph to her face and wrote the passport number in the registration book then he gave the passport back to her she put it in her purse things were looser here than they were in francelooser here than they were for foreigners in germany too for that matter she didnt have to surrender the passport to the clerk for the duration of her stay he turned the registration book toward her and held out a pen your signature please this also acknowledges your responsibility for payment you will be in room the bank of lifts is around the corner to your left here is the key he handed it to her enjoy your stay thank you she said as if by magic a bellman appeared with a wheeled cart to take charge of her bags he was a scrawny little man withalmost inevitablybad teeth and a servile smile that put them on display she gave him a reichsmark when they got up to the room the swastikabedizened banknote brought out another smile this one broad genuine and greedy a reichsmark wasnt much to her but it was worth more than a pound here ever since the war germany had pegged the exchange rate artificially high the bellman did everything but tug his forelock before bowing his way out of the room after unpacking susanna took the lift back downstairs to the lobby she shared the little car with a professor from the sorbonne whom she knew and with two hulking uniformed british fascists professor drumont read wrote and understood modern english perfectly well but did not speak it fluently susanna enjoyed the chance to practice her own rusty french the fascists disapproval stuck out like spines bloody foreigners one of them growled he was at least thirty centimeters taller than susanna since she couldnt look down her nose at him she looked up it insteadwas sagen sie she inquired with icy hauteur hearing her speak german as opposed to frencha losers languagetook the wind from his sails as shed thought it might ahnothing he said i didnt mean anything by it she switched languages again this time to english let me see your identity card he didnt ask what right she had to see it he just handed it over she acted as if she had the right as far as he was concerned that put her above doubt she studied the card nodded coldly pulled a notebook and pen from her handbag and wrote something down actually it was whan that aprill with his shoures soote but the fascist would never knowand surely wouldnt have been able to read her scrawl anyhow only then did she return the identity document trembling the englishman put it back in his wallet vous avez cranprofessor drumont remarked as both fascists dashed from the lift and hurried away guts me give me leave to doubt susanna shook her head what i have is ahow would you say it in french a low tolerance for being pushed around i think that would be it drumont shrugged a very gallic shrug it amounts to the same thing in the end now where do we register for the meeting to susannas annoyance they had to walk up a flight of stairs to find registration if i had known that we could have got out sooner she grumbled we would not have had to spend so much time in the car with thosesalauds it could be that you were too hard on them professor drumont said gently you are after all a german you may not always understand thethe strains upon other folk in the germanic empire that was a brave thing for him to say or possibly a foolish one somebody from one security organization or another was bound to be keeping an eye on the medieval english association susanna could have been that person or one of those people as easily as not the frenchmans words were also funny in an agonizing wayi dont know about the strains on other folk in the germanic empire eh well professor have you ever contemplated the strains on jews in the empire she doubted that oh yes she doubted it very much indeed and yether gaze flicked over to professor drumont what did he look like a grayhaired frenchman nothing else but suppose he were a jew how could she tell he would no more dare reveal himself to a nearstranger than would she sudden tears stung her eyes she blinked angrily as she waited to get her name badgewe might be ships passing in the night we might be but neither of us would ever know and not knowing is the worst thing of all heinrich gimpel leaned back in his swivel chair lunch he asked sounds good to me willi dorsch nodded where do you feel like eating today ive got kind of a yen for japanese food heinrich answered willi made a horrible face heinrich needed a moment to realize what hed said he held up a hasty hand i didnt do that on purpose for one thing i dont believe you willi said for another if youre telling the truth that just makes it worse unconscious punning if thats not enough to send you up before a peoples court what would be in spite of himself heinrich shivered few who appeared before the judges of a peoples court ever appeared anywhere else again he pushed the dark thought out of his mind or at least out of the front part of it welldoes japanese food suit you he asked i was going to suggest it myself till you made me lose my appetite willi said admiral yamamotos is only a couple of blocks from here hows that sound heinrich roseall but leapedfrom his chair lets go the japanese who ran admiral yamamotos had come to germany ten or fifteen years earlier to study engineering hed got his degree but hed never gone home to tokyo some of the sushi he served would have got him odd looks if he had what he called a berlin roll for instance had seaweed and rice wrapped around thinly cut spicy white radish and a piece of raw baltic herring it might not have been authentic but it was good especially washed down with beer heinrich ordered half a dozen and some sashimi as well i dont quite feel like raw fish today willi dorsch said and chose shrimp tempura instead the batter in which the shrimp were fried wasnt what it would have been on the other side of the world either but it was tasty in place of tempura sauce willi slathered the shrimp with wasabi its green not white but it cleans out your sinuses just like any other horseradish you put that much on and itll blow off the top of your head heinrich used wasabi mixed with soy sauce for his sushi and sashimi too but not nearly so much ah well what difference does it make no brains in there anyhow willi took a big bite and found out what difference it made he grabbed for his own stein to try to put out the fire when he could speak again he said imnot going to tell erika about this mm heinrich saidthe most noncommittal noise he could find anything that had anything to do with erika dorsch made him nervous he didnt want willi thinking he had designs on her he didnt want her having designs on him he didnt wanthe shook his head he couldnt say he didnt want erika he didnt want her enough to throw away what he was for her and to endanger his family and friends when i found out i was a jew i knew it meant i had to watch a lot of things i never imagined then that it would rob me of adultery too such irony appealed to him but when he laughed willi asked whats so funny he couldnt tell the truth one thing hed soon learned about being a jew was always to have a cover story handy he said the look on your face after you took that mouthful thats what oh well you cant really blame me willi dorsch said if you ask me wasabis the first step toward what goes into atomic bombs that made heinrich laugh without needing any cover story i wouldnt be surprised he said and then looking out the window whats going on everybodys stopping is there a traffic accident down the street we would have heard it wouldnt we willi sent the wasabi paste a suspicious glance unless this stuff made my ears ring too the owner of admiral yamamotos came out from the kitchen in his accented german he said meine damen und herrenplease excuse me for disturbing your meals but i have just heard important news on the radio the fuhrer of the germanic empire kurt haldweim has passed away please accept my deepest sympathies and condolences he bowed stiffly from the waist arms at his sides and then disappeared again heinrich gimpel stared down at his halfeaten lunch hed known this day might be coming yes but he hadnt thought it would come quite so soon willi took a last big bite of tempura if the wasabi bothered him this time he didnt let it show he got to his feet took out his wallet and pulled out enough money to cover his lunch and heinrichs come on he said suddenly all business wed better get back to the office youre right heinrich rose too half the diners in admiral yamamotos were finishing up in a hurry and getting out that surprised heinrich not at all given where the restaurant was most of the people who lunched here would work for the wehrmacht or the ss or the party haldweim had no obvious successor intrigue and jockeying for position had begun years earlier when he started having colds now things would come out into the open who will it be willi murmured as they hurried up the street the same thought was uppermost in heinrichs mind too when they got back to adolf hitler platz they saw horst witzlebens perfect image on the huge televisor screen on the front wall of the fuhrer s palace the square was filling up fast as people got the news already the large swastika flag above the palace had been lowered to halfstaff witzlebens almost operatic voice blared from powerful speakers even so soon messages of sorrow and mourning have begun pouring in from around the world in a moving joint tribute the king and the duce of the italian empire spoke of kurt haldweim as a man of power and a man of peace the emperor of japan has expressed his sympathy with the german people on their loss in which the emperor of manchukuo joins the caudillo of spain described our beloved fuhrer as a man of worldhistorical proportions while the peron of argentina termed him a model for all rulers aspiring to greatness someones arm slid a paper onto witzlebens desk the news reader glanced down at it and this just in the poglavnik of croatia has declared a day of mourning in his country while stating that the fuhrer s memory will live in the hearts of men forever nice willi remarked all that sympathy and a reichsmark will buy me a glass of beer well what do you expect them to say heinrich asked he knew what he would say if he had the chanceone more murderer in a line of murderers a little smoother than the last two but a murderer all the same except with lise he wouldnt get that chance even thinking such things was dangerous oh just what they are saying willi answered turning his back on the televisor but how many of them mean it if you had to mean what you said wed have an awful lot of diplomats who never opened their mouthsand the world might be a better place heinrich said his friend laughed supposing hed been joking he and willi went up the broad stairway to the entrance of the oberkommando der wehrmacht building identification cards a guard snapped heinrich dug out his wallet and produced the card the guard carefully compared the photo to his face before running the card through the machine reader only when the light glowed green did he nod for heinrich to proceed willi got the same treatment they arent usually so jumpy during the lunch break he said once they were safely inside and out of earshot of the guards did you think they wouldnt be heinrich asked nobodys going to trust anybody till we have a new fuhrer suppose the ss tried to sneak somebody in here to find out which way the wehrmacht will go theyd be fools if they did theyd be bigger fools if they didnt have spies in place here years ago and wed be fools if we didnt have spies planted over there and the partys watching us and the ss both the air and space ministrys likely got fingers in a few different pies too maybe even the navywho knows willi took to intrigue like a duck to water he eyed a secretary walking past as if he thought she was spying for the ss and the navy and the japanese all at once or he might have looked at her that way because she was a cute redhead in a skirt that rose almost to her knees just because he was melodramatic that didnt mean he was wrong the wehrmacht the ss and the party surely were all spying on one another air and space and the navy were smaller players but they could get big in a hurry if they managed to put one of their people in the fuhrer s palace once heinrich got back to his desk he checked to see what was coming over the wehrmacht computer network most of it was what hed expected the united states sent a message of condolence so did the british union of fascistswith one intriguing difference their spokesman added that he hoped the new fuhrer would be chosen according to the principles set forth in the first edition of mein kampf heinrich scratched his head why is the first edition different from all other editions he asked willi dorsch the question eerily reminded him of the one hed asked lise a few days earlierwhy is this night different from all other nights only a few people in the germanic empirea handful of hidden jews and another handful of scholars who studied dead thingshad any idea what that question meant and how it should be answered willi didnt know how heinrichs question should be answered either what are you talking about he said see for yourself heinrich pointed to his monitor willi came around to his desk to look isnt that interesting he said when hed read the british message i dont know what the difference between the first edition and the others is either i didnt think there was much difference except for cleaning up typographical errors and such neither did i heinrich said the powers that be had never forbidden any edition of mein kampf that strongly argued the differences between editions werent large but they had to be there otherwise the british union of fascists wouldnt have specifically cited the first edition like everyone else at oberkommando der wehrmacht he had a copy of mein kampf on his desk his was of course the fourth edition revised by hitler after britain and russia went under as always when he opened the book he found his way to one passage near the endif at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best german workers in the field the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain on the contrary twelve thousand scoundrels eliminated in time might have saved the lives of millions of real germans valuable for the future but that passage was plainly old for bythe war there hitler had to mean world war idamn him heinrich thought wearily hed known what he wanted to do what he intended to do long before he got the chance to do it but what did he say about choosing a new fuhrer finding out took some poking through the index in this edition it was exactly what anyone would have expectedthe young movement is in its nature and inner organization antiparliamentarian that is it rejects in general and in its own inner structure a principle of majority rule in which the leader is degraded to the level of a mere executant of other peoples will and opinion in little as well as big things the movement advocates the principle of unconditional authority of the leader coupled with the highest responsibility that was the way things had worked in the reich for as long as heinrich could remember and for years before how was the first edition of mein kampf different willi dorsch had his copy open too he read aloud the passage heinrich had just found it cant be the same in the first edition heinrich said if it were but how could it be different willi asked what other way to do things is there hed said heinrich was more content living in the world as it was but he was the one for whom that world was water to a fish he couldnt see beyond what was to what might be there has to be something heinrich answered he didnt know what it was either but he could see the possibility as a jew he necessarily perceived the reich from an outsiders viewpoint sometimes as now that proved useful but he found himself longing for willis simple certainties at least as often i think the british are just out to make trouble willi said now theyre probably plotting with the americans the damned anglosaxons have always been jealous of germany for years they tried to keep the reich from taking its rightful place in the sun now theyre paying for it and i say it serves them right hed learned those lessons in school so had heinrich gimpel but heinrich for reasons of his own had found he needed to doubt a lot of what his teachers said as far as he could tell willi never doubted does that make him a fool or the luckiest man i know theyve spent a long time paying for it heinrich said good willi dorsch declared so did we well yes heinrich couldntdidnt daredisagree with that still i do wonder whats in the first edition from his herringbone jacket to his long narrow bony face to his decaying teeth professor horace buckingham might have been a stage englishman even his own countrymen had trouble following his oxonian accent it had made the panel discussion on chaucers wife of baths tale an ordeal for susanna weiss whod had to respond again and again to points she wasnt sure she understood when the panel ended the audience applauded politely buckingham turned to susanna i thought that went off rather well he said his breath was formidable no doubt because of those mottled teeth not bad susanna still thought his interpretation naive but she wasnt inclined to arguenot at close range anyhow a paper in a learned journal would offer her a more impersonal way to stick a knife in his scholarship and would also give her something she could show her department chairman would you care to discuss things further over a drink he asked the way he smiled said scholarship wasnt the only thing on his mind i dont want to be within three meters of you let alone closer the retort hovered on the tip of susannas tongue not without regret she let it die there she said not now thanks i have no more discussions until the evening session and nothing on the program really draws me so i am going to go across the street the british union of fascists meeting has turned out to be fascinating dont you think fascinating indeed professor buckingham departed with marked haste at first susanna thought that meant he had no use for fascists which got him a point in her book despite his bad breath then she realized another explanation was more likely to him she was a german nothing else she knew otherwise but he didnt and what did a german interested in the congress of the british union of fascists add up to someone with connections to a security bureau under different circumstances that might have been funny as things weresusanna sighed buckingham would talkwhat else did academics do if the other professors at the medieval english association didnt start sidling away from her it would be a miracle and god was depressingly stingy with miracles these days she went across the street to the crown hotel anyhow shed never been able to resist political drama this was the genuine articlewhat americans called for no reason she could fathomthe real mc coy on the surface everything seemed exactly as it should have union jacks and buf flags with lightning bolts that resembled the ss runes flew at halfstaff in commemoration of kurt haldweim english and scottish fascists had praised the departed fuhrer to the skies theyd also spent at least as much time patting one another on the back as the scholars of the mea had done that was the surface underneath and sometimes not so far underneath things were different susanna hadnt even got into the crown when a parade came up the street toward her nothing out of the ordinary there british fascists were no less enamored of public display than their german counterparts but these toughlooking men in uniforms and shiny jackboots carried signs that said remember the first edition the mere idea was enough to make susanna want to hug herself with glee political action mixed with textual analysis the earnest academics at the medieval english association didnt know what they were missing to make sure their british colleagues and more to the point the national socialists in germanydid remember other paraders carried banners that stretched from one side of the street to the other with the relevant passages spelled out in english andauf deutsch the english read in little as well as big thingsthe movement advocates the principle of a germanic democracy the leader is electedbut then enjoys unconditional authority other banners declaredthe first chairman of a local group is electedbut then he is the responsible leader of the local group and the first principle applies to the next higher organization the leader is always electedand and finallythe same applies to the leadership of the whole partythe chairman is electedbut he is the exclusive leader of the movement and at the very tail of the procession another big banner proclaimed members of the movement are free to call him to account before the forum of a new electionto divest him of his office in so far as he has infringed on the principles of the movement or served its interests badly british policemen in their blue uniforms and tall helmets stood on the sidewalk watching the fascists procession they didnt seem to know what to make of it neither did the german occupation authorities ifthey had decided to come out and quash it they would have used panzers and rocketfiring fighter jets theyd done that more than a few times in the earlier years of the occupation though not so often lately as for susanna she marveled that the british union of fascists or at least one wing of the party had managed to find a way to call for democracy without immediately getting lined up in front of a wall and shot how could you give a man a cigarette and a blindfold for quoting adolf hitler whose words were close to holy writ all through the germanic empire you couldnt possibly susanna rapidly discovered the marchers represented one wing of the buf not the entire organization more men in uniform swarmed out of a side street and attacked the men in the parade with clubs and brass knuckles the marchers fought back with similar weapons other fascists rushed out of the crown to join in the melee on whose side susanna wasnt sure she had all she could do to keep from getting bowled over whistles shrilling the british bobbies waded into the fray they flailed away with their truncheons whacking brawlers on both sides with fine impartiality break it up they bawled break it up you bloody sods but nobody on either side seemed to want to break it up even as the men who extolled the first edition fought they raised a chant in english the whole world is watching the whole world is watching odd sort of battle crysusanna thought but maybe it wasnt sure as the devil televisor cameras from the bbc and the german rrg were filming the clash the marchers must have known the cameras would be there otherwise they wouldnt have quoted from mein kampf in both english and german police cars raced up sirens screeching the men inside them wore pigsnouted gas masks they shot teargas canisters into the riot where nothing else had worked that did fascists for and against the first edition fled so did susanna not quite soon enough her eyes were streaming and her stomach twisting with nausea when she made it back into the lobby of the silver eagle the academics in there were fleeing too for fresh wisps of gas came in every time the doors opened susanna repaired to the bar which seemed a popular port in the storm of course the bar was a popular port in the storm at every academic conference shed ever attended she took off her glasses and dabbed at her eyes with a tissue it didnt help much the singlemalt scotch she ordered didnt help her eyes much either but it made the rest of her feel better dear god in heaven said a british professor who also staggered in weeping like a fountain whatis going on out there susanna eyed himblurrily literary criticism she said achtung form your lines herr kessler shouted as the schoolchildren got off the bus to one side of the great hall he sounded more like a wehrmacht drill sergeant than a teacherbut then that was true a lot of the time take your partners hand hold your flag in your free hand nowforward to the end of the queue alicia gimpel took emma handricks hand the alphabet made them line partners as it made them sit close together alicia wished she were paired with someone else emma had cold sweaty palms nothing alicia could do about it she imagined complaining to herr kessler imagining the paddling she would get for trying it immediately squelched the idea the swastika flag she held in her left hand was bordered in black a token of mourning for the departed fuhrer kurt haldweim lay in state under the monstrous dome of the great hall along with other children from all over berlinfrom all over germanyalicia and her schoolmates would file past his body and then line the parade route as his funeral procession went past this way herr kessler shouted noover here a uniformed attendant said pointing in the opposite direction your group is to take its place behind those bigger children fuming his face beet red the teacher led them to the right place he doesnt know everything emma whispered and smiled maliciously for that alicia forgave her her sweaty palm the line moved forward with what the world had learned to call germanic efficiency not even herr kessler could find anything to complain about there within twenty minutes alicia and her classmates had entered the great hall the space under that unbelievable dome seemed even vaster within than without the interior appointments had a simple grandeur to them a recess clad in gold mosaic opposite the entrance broke a circle of a hundred marble columns each twentyfive meters tall in front of the recess on a marble pedestal fourteen meters high stood a german eagle with a swastika in its claws and in front of the pedestal lay the mortal remains of kurt haldweim floral decorations and shrubbery surrounded the casket of gilded bronze in which the fuhrer lay in state ss guards stood on either side of the coffin displaying the many decorations haldweim had won in his long illustrious career as a soldier and national socialists administrator yet try as they would the wizards of ceremony who had staged this scene could not overcome one basic difficulty the great hall altogether dwarfed the pale still remains of the hawkfaced man who had ruled the germanic empire for a quarter of a century haldweim had been fuhrer far longer than alicia had been alive to her then he was as one with the pyramids of egypt but the pyramids remained and now he was gone if anything his last surroundings stressed how transitory any mere man was to make any sort of show at all he would have had to be the size of a brachiosaurus alicia had always imagined the fuhrer as being more than a man but here she saw at first hand it wasnt so young mourners went by in a steady stream almost close enough to touch the nearest wreaths with a tenyearolds instinctive love of horror alicia wondered what would happen if anybody did she supposed one of those ss meneach as still now as if himself carved from stonewould suddenly spring to life and shoot the miscreant or maybe even that wouldnt be enough maybe they would drag him away to ss headquarters and take their time disposing of him then she was past the display past the coffin past the wizened corpse inside and walking quickly towards a door of simply human proportions that led out to adolf hitler platz the square was already filling with people either in uniformmilitary party and ssor in civilian mourning attire we wont be able to see emma whispered in dismay yes we will alicia whispered back they wouldnt bring us all the way here and then hide us besides theyll want people to see were here televisor cameras on platforms stood out from the throng like islands in the sea more cameras on the great hall on the fuhrer s palace to the left and on the oberkommando der wehrmacht building across the street gave broader views the building where alicias father worked seemed like an old friend she proved right too which always made her feel good officials in particularly fancy uniforms shepherded the schoolchildren into reserved spaces right next to the route of the funeral procession which was marked off by redandblack tape imprinted with swastikas there the officials arranged them roughly in order of height shortest in front so they could all be seen to best advantage told you so alicia whispered emma stuck out her tongueherr kessler coughed and glared emma turned pale he wouldnt whack her in public not on this somber occasion but he wouldnt forget either when the bus took them back to stahnsdorf i have to go to the bathroom exclaimed a little redheaded boy who couldnt have been much older than roxane one of the officials took him by the hand led him to a portable toilet and then brought him back alicia giggledbut first she made sure herr kessler was looking the other way buses and commuter trains brought more and more mourners into the adolf hitler platz until the entire immense square was full most of the people there wouldnt be able to see much although the televisor screen mounted on the front of the fuhrer s palace showed them what they were missing a lot of them had doubtless been ordered to come as alicia had but what about the others did they want to be a part of history if only a tiny part alicia looked down at the german flag with the mourning border in her hand suddenly she wondered whyshe was supposed to be sorry kurt haldweim had died hed been fuhrer of the germanic empire yes if shed been all german that would have made reason enough a few weeks earlier she would have thought it did nownow she knew what the germans had done toher folk she still felt like a german she also felt like a jewand wouldnt a jew be glad not sorry the german fuhrer was dead not for the first time lately she felt very confused funereal music poured from speakers mounted at the edge of the square everyone keep quiet and look sadherr kessler hissed next to alicia emma had a good reason for frowning she just needed to think about what would happen to her when she got back to school alicia had to work hard to make the corners of her mouth turn down she finally managed it the way she had in the game with her sisters by pretending she was in a play and had to act a part pallbearers wearing army fieldgrayluftwaffe light blue navy dark blue ss black and national socialist brown bore kurt haldweims coffin out of the great hall and set it on a wheeled bier drawn by eight black horses that had pulled up in front of the entrance every one of the men was blond and handsome and close to two meters talland every one of them was made to seem taller still by a highcrowned cap the pallbearers looked magnificent in closeup shots on the televisor screen at the front of the fuhrer s palace seen live they might have been ants in front of the inhuman overwhelming immensity of the great hall the bier set out across the adolf hitler platz towards alicia at a slow walk it was draped in black velvet against which the red in the german national flag stood out like blood the pallbearers goosestepped behind the bier their somber faces might have been stamped from the same mold behind them came visiting heads of state some in uniform others wearing dark civilian garb german military and party functionaries followed all in their distinctive costumes next came foreign ambassadors and after them elite units from the military and waffen ss from the national socialist party hierarchy and from the hitler jugend when the bier was almost directly in front of alicia one of the horses did what horses do half the sorrowful schoolchildren suddenly snorted and squealed half the teachers hastily hissed in horror the goosestepping pallbearers couldnt alter their paces not without looking bad one of them stepped in it he marched on past his expression unchanged no matter what clung to the sole of his gleaming boot most of the heads of states and other dignitaries evaded the unfortunate substance by the time the soldiers and fliers and sailors and ss men and brownshirts and hitler youths had gone by though it was quite thoroughly trodden into the concrete of the square by then the teachers had stopped hissing once haldweims coffin had passed the cameras turned away from the schoolchildren theyd served their purposeherr kessler and another teacher started talking in low voices i wonder when well have a new fuhrer the other man said i hope its soon alicias teacher answered it wasnt like this when himmler died i remember that back then everybody knew wed stay on a steady course nowadays he shook his head disapproval radiated from him theyll make a good choice whoever it finally is the other teacher said herr kessler seemed to realize he might have gone too far oh im sure they will he said quickly you never could tell who might be listening alicia had learned that long before she found out she was a jew i could report himshe thought the news always ran stories about heroic children who turned in evildoers theyd discoveredsometimes even their own parents getting rid of her badtempered teacher was tempting too but the idea died before it was fully formed for alicias next thought wasif i denounce him theyll probably investigate me too she shook her head in horror of her own how did the handful of jews at the heart of the germanic empire survive by never drawing any special notice to themselves perhaps someone else would report herr kessler but she wouldnt she couldnt she didnt dare the last unit of brownshirts left the adolf hitler platz it began to empty and did so almost as quickly and efficiently as it had filled people streamed away to the buses and trains that had brought them to the square the lines were long but they were orderly and they moved fast there was next to no pushing and shoving and shouting as alicias schoolbooks said there was in less enlightened parts of the world again she wonderedare my books telling the truth if they lied about jewsand she had to believe they didwhat else did they lie about had there ever been a roman emperor named augustus was mt everest really the tallest mountain in the world had horst wessel been a hero and a martyr were two and two truly four she muttered in annoyance shed checked her arithmetic lessons before and they held good but how could she test what the books said about mt everest which was far away and hard to get to or about horst wessel and augustus whod lived in the altogether irretrievable past she saw no simple way maybe daddy knowsshe thought as she scrambled aboard her school bus her father knew all sorts of strange things many of them useless but most of them interesting or entertaining if he didnt know these she couldnt think of anyone who would herr kessler got on the bus he counted the students to make sure nobody had been left behind then grunted in satisfaction everyone present and accounted for he told the driver before returning his attention to the class out of respect for the memory of our beloved fuhrer you will be silentcompletely silenton the return journey to stahnsdorf if you are not silent you will be very very sorry do you understand me he sounded as if he looked forward to making someone or several someones very very sorry alicia didnt expect anyone to respond to what was obviously a rhetorical question but a boy held up his hand and said herr kessler ja the teacher was taken aback too herr kessler when will we have a new beloved fuhrer kessler blinked why when we do of course he answered alicia had no trouble figuring out what that meant it meant he didnt know either heinrich gimpel suspected the highest authorities in the reich would have suppressed the first edition of mein kampf if theyd thought they could get away with it but plenty of old copies were still floating around and word of the first fuhrer s startlingly subversive statements spread too wide and too fast for suppression to have any hope of success that being so those in high places simply sat tight hoping the fuss would die down of its own accord who would have imagined hitler wrote such a thing heinrich said at work one morning he didnt like talking about hitler at all but the first edition despite official silencemaybe because of official silencewas so much on peoples minds that not talking about it would have seemed odd he didnt want to seem odd in any way i know what it must have been willi dorsch said tell me o sage of the age heinrich said he must have written the first edition before he got the party fully into his hands willi responded as soon as he did then the fuhrerprinzip took over and everything ran from the top down the way it does now thatmakes a certain amount of sense heinrich said in fact it made more than a certain amount willi was shrewd no doubt about it he was also smug you bet it does he said and if you look at things the right way it makes the first edition an antique too something thats not worth getting excited about do you think thats the line theyll take heinrich asked i think theyll try willi replied interesting to find out whether they can get away with it what do you think willis grin wasnt quite pleasant i could ask you the same question but youve never much cared for sticking out your neck have you well no heinrich tried to sound sheepish not cowardly feeling he needed to add something to his confession he said you dont have to answer if you dont want to oh i will i can always run my mouth or stick my foot in it or stick my neck out for the chopper willi sounded happy almost gay he could talk about sticking his neck out because he didnt really believe the chopper would come down on it heinrich knew full well the chopper would descend ifhe were discovered willi meanwhile went on sure ill tell you what i think i think they have a pretty good chance of getting away with it thats how things always work youre probably right heinrich made sure he didnt sigh he wouldnt have sworn his office was bugged but he wouldnt have sworn it wasnt either if anyone was listening to him he didnt want to do or say anything that could possibly be construed as disloyal to the reich if you bet that tomorrow will be just like today youll win more often than you lose willi said but you wontalways win and youll look more like a chump when you lose we wouldnt have gone to mars a few years ago if wed thought things would stay the same all the time thats true heinrich had been no less impressed than anyone else by live televisor pictures from another world men had been flying back and forth to the moon since he was a boy and the observatory there had been a going concern for fifteen years but marsfelt different even if thered been not the slightest hint of martians the ministry of air and space was talking about a manned mission to the moons of jupiter that would be something if it ever got past the talking stage so anyway willi said the people who go on about the first edition are the ones who dont have power and the people who do have power dont give a damn about the first edition thats the way it looks to me seems reasonable heinrich said and so it did again he refused to show he didnt like it no matter how reasonable it seemed instead he looked at his watch shall we head for the canteen and see what sort of experiment the cooks are serving for lunch nobody ever got in trouble for complaining about the food here not even the security police could afford to arrest that many people todays special included tongue sausage and a cabbage salad with chopped apples oranges and grapes in a mayonnaisebased dressing the sausage wasnt half bad the menu called the salad swedish after a couple of bites heinrich called it peculiar willi looked down at his foam plate his verdict was i didnt know the swedes hated us that much heinrich took another forkful after crunching away he said its probably very nutritious it would be willi said despite grumbles they both kept eating heinrich sipped coffee from a foam cup it wasnt especially good either but it was strong he could feel his eyes opening wider he wouldnt doze off at his desk this afternoon hed done that once or twice when he had a new baby in the house he hadnt got in trouble he mustnt have been the only one as he ate he listened to the lunchroom chatter now it was official the americans would fall short on this years assessment plenty of people at oberkommando der wehrmacht wondered what the reich would do about it heinrich wondered himself someone a couple of tables over said the yankees are lucky bastards if we had a fuhrer in place hed have made them knuckle under you bet willi dorsch heard that too hes right he said and got up to pour himself some more coffee heinrich nodded though he couldnt help thinking that getting devastated by nuclear weapons and then spending the next forty years under german occupation wasnt precisely the kind of luck he most wanted to have on the other hand most of the americans remained alive aside from the war casualties the conquerors had worked their usual horrors on jews and negroes even so the population of the usa was only about a third lower than it had been before the war maybe the americans as a wholewere luckyif you compared them to such untermenschen at another table not far from the one where heinrich and willi were sitting a colonel growled to hell with the first edition this is all a bunch of claptrap if anybody wants to know the truth heinrich took a bite of tongue sausage who would presume to argue with such an august personage willi looked smug as he came back with his refill he must have heard the officer too he wagged a finger at heinrich as if to sayyou see but two colonels sat at that table the second one a younger man shook his head and said im not so sure dietrich ive been a good party man for more than twenty years now if theres a way to stay in the rules and let me help choose the new fuhrer im for it thats the leaderships job the first coloneldietrichsaid well yes the other colonel answered but how do leaders get to be leaders if the people under them dont want to follow what have you got a mess thats what look at france in dietrich snorted oh go on paul if the reich ever comes to that we can all stick our heads in the showers because well be done for anyway i didnt say it would be that badwere not frenchmen after all paul replied but the principle is the same another snort from the first colonel principle whats principle something losers talk about to explain why theyve lost oh really are you saying the party has no principles pauls voice was silky with danger but dietrich wouldnt fall into that trap im saying victory is the first principle and none of the others matters much he had a fat cigar smoking in an ashtray now he picked it up and thrust it at his friend if im wrong how come we shoutsieg heil explain that to me a captain whod been siting at another table came over and said excuse me sir but how does following the partys original rules make victory any less likely he would never have had the nerve to do anything like that if paul hadnt spoken up in favor of the first edition not when dietrich outranked him by three grades as things were he had a protector the table with the two colonels quickly became the days focal point for that particular argument wehrmacht officers and civilian experts gathered around it things got more heated by the moment willis face lit up shall we join them he asked go ahead if you want to heinrich answered but what we say wont matter a pfennigs worth either wayand thats been true everywhere in the reichever since hitler took over one more good line he added to the long long list of things he couldnt say no matter how true they were sometimes a pounding on the door didnt make lise gimpel panic when it came just after half past three it made her smile it meant the children were home from school she hurried to the door and opened it hello girls she said what did you learn today klaus frick eats bugs francesca announced alicia and roxane both made disgusted noises but not big disgusted noises from this lise concluded her middle daughter was going on with things shed said on the school bus the other two girls must have had the chance to start getting used to that lovely piece of news how do you know he eats bugs lise asked remembering how schoolyard rumors could claim anybody did anything but francesca answered because i saw him do it he caught one and put it in his mouth and it went crunch and hes in your class isnt he lise said unhappily francesca nodded lise shuddered thatspretty bad eightyearold boys frequently were disgusting creatures but this klaus frick went overboard roxane giggled tell her the rest the rest theres more lise said do i want to know no alicia said quickly from that lise got a hint about whatmore might be but roxane was still snickering and francesca was laughing too at their age what was disgusting was also funny the potty jokes that had made the rounds when lise was in the lower grades still circulated alicia also laughed at a lot of them ten wasnt too old not today though francesca said klaus saidhe said he was eating just like a jew he said jews ate bugs all the time hearing it again sent roxane into gales of laughter francesca thought it was pretty funny too alicia gave her verdict in one word revolting hes probably right though jewswere revolting francesca said everybody knows that her little sister nodded alicia started to say something then very obviously didnt lise gimpel spoke up before her oldest daughter could slip jews may have been revolting but how does klaus frick know what they ate how could he nobody your age has ever seen oneand im sure they dont teach you about bugs in school im with alicia here jews may have been revolting but your classmate certainly is alicia stuck out her tongue at francesca that was a good healthy normal reaction but roxane always an agitator pointed and exclaimed eww its got a bugs leg on it enough lise said all three of you go in the kitchen right now and have your snacks she held up a warning hand im not done the first one who says anythinganythingabout bugs or jews or anything else disgusting while youre eating is in big troublebig trouble you hear me they all nodded the two younger ones hurried to the kitchen alicia hung back for a moment jews or anythingelse disgusting she asked softly thats how youve got to say it lise whispered back biting her lip you have to wear a mask remember alicia nodded though the mask had slipped lise gave her a little push go on eat your snack this was just foolishness dont let it worry you nodding again and looking a tiny bit happier alicia went lise gimpels sigh sounded amazingly like heinrichs you needed to have a hide like an elephants to hope to survive children didnt naturally come equipped with that kind of hide they had to acquire it one painful scar after another lise remembered how many tears shed shed when she was younger jokes about jews and gibes about jews went on and on lise couldnt remember the last time shed heard anything aboutlive jews before those few luckless families were found in the serbian hinterlands everyone needed someone to hate americans hadnt hated jews the way europeans had but theyd had negroes to hate instead now there were hardly any jews or negroes in the usa did people on the other side of the atlantic still tell jokes about the negroes who werent there any more lise wouldnt have been surprised people were like that however much you wished they werent back in the ancient days after david slew goliath and the hebrews triumphed in palestine had they told jokes about the philistines that wouldnt have surprised lise either she didnt think jews were the herrenvolk the master race the way germans thought about themselves she just thought they were people like any others with all the faults and foibles of any other folk was it too much to ask for other people to see them the same way evidently she sighed again the survivors remaining in the reich were well hidden ferreting them out wouldnt be easy even for the nazis for a few years lise hadnt worried much about it she hadnt even thought much about it shed just felt likebeenone more person living out her life like anybody else but then gottlieb stutzman got old enough to tell and then anna and now alicia and half of lise felt like the terrified child shed been when she first found out the truth children made mistakes making mistakes and learning from them helped children grow up but if a jewish child made the wrong kind of mistake she wouldnt grow up and what would she learn from that not to be born a jew of course mommy francesca screamed roxane echoed her even higher and shriller lise raced for the kitchen her heart in her mouth what had alicia done had she told her sisters if she couldnt keep her mouth shut how could she think theyd be able to alicia stood in the middle of the floor her face stricken francesca and roxane both dramatically pointed at her im sorry mommy she whispered her face pale as milkpale as the milk that had been in her tumbler and now splashed all over the floor along with the tumblers shards once lise started to laugh she had to work to stop all three of her daughters stared at her she took a deep breath held it let it out what did you think i was going to do she said cryover spilt milk the girls made horrible faces lise didnt care about that relief left her giddy come on lets clean up the mess she did most of the work but she made the girls help as she mopped up milk and swept up broken glass she also marveledi didnt hear the crash at all was i that lost in my own worries i guess i was im sorry alicia said again no she didnt like making any mistakes no matter how small its all right dear lise said and compared to what might have been it was iv heinrich and lise gimpel were defending against a small slam in spades doubled that willi dorsch was playing heinrich was the one whod doubled with the ace of hearts in his hand why not one more trick after that he thought ought to come from somewhere that ace had been his opening leadwhereupon hed discovered painfully that erika had a void in hearts willi had grinned like the cheshire cat when he trumped the beautiful lost ace one trick for the defenders had materialized when the clubs split evenly and heinrichs queen survived he couldnt see where they would come up with a second one the one that would set the contract his two meager trumps were gone pulled and lise had had only one willi led the queen of diamonds heinrich glumly tossed out the seven the ace lay faceup on the table in the dummys hand willi confidently didnt play it instead choosing the three lise didnt even smile as she ruined the finesse by laying her king on top of the queen down one she said sweetly oh for gods sake willi said he might have added something more pungent than that but the three gimpel girls had gone to bed only a few minutes before and could have heard if he did he sent heinrich an accusing stare you were the one who doubled i was sure you had thatmiserable king i doubled on the strength of the ace heinrich said when you ruffed it i thought we were doomed lets finish the handmaybe well come up with another trick too lise led willi handily took the rest of the tricks but he and erika still went down one his wife sighed mournfully i would have played that one the same way heinrich came to willis defense would you erika didnt sound as if she believed it sure i would he said lise didnt bid at all during the auction you have to figure what strength weve got is in my hand maybe erika still seemed dubiousand annoyed at her husband ifyoud tried that finesse heinrich it probably would have worked willi dorsch didnt say anything he did turn red though as he gathered up the cards heinrich tried to defuse things saying ha dont i wish ive had more finesses go down in flames than the russians lost planes the first day we hit them but you dont run them unless you need to erika said willi tried that one for the sake of being cute we could have made without it she spoke as if her husband werent there willi noticed too and turned redder than ever we were in trouble if ididnt try that finesse he insisted i dont think so erika said whose deal is it lise asked that might not have been the wisdom of solomon but it sufficed to forestall the argument the next hand was unexciting the gimpels bid two hearts and made three the hand after that erika dorsch made four spades and chopped off the gimpels leg she didnt say anything to willi she made such a point of not saying anything to him he turned red all over again yes youre a genius he growled there i admit it are you happy now i just played it sensibly erika said its not that you havent got brains sweetheart its just that you dont always bother using them if you ask me thats worse because you could things would have been bad enough if shed left it there but she added heinrich now he gets the most from what hes got between his ears lise gimpel sent her husband a hooded look he didnt need it to know this was several different flavors of trouble the most immediate one was between willi and erika willi took a deep breath by the nasty glint in his eyes heinrich knew with sudden appalled certainty just what he was going to say it would have been crude in a locker room at the bridge table it would have been a disaster heinrich got there first saying if im as smart as all that why arent i rich if im as smart as all that why wasnt i smart enough to pick a betterlooking face too he hoped that would help calm willi who was by anybodys standards betterlooking than he was and it might have if erika hadnt poured gasoline on the fire some things we cant choose some thingswe can she was looking straight at her husband willi had managed to get some grip on his temper his voice was thick with anger when he said well talk about this later but at least he seemed willing to talk about it later instead of having a row right there on the spot why dont i bring out the coffee and cake lise said i think maybe weve had enough bridge for the night heinrich hoped erika would hop up and help but she didnt she was he slowly realized as angry at willi as he was at her she might have realized what her husband had almost said tooor maybe she was angry for reasons that had nothing to do with bridge but came out over the game sitting there with them waiting for lise to come back heinrich felt like a man in the middle of a minefield when the minefield went up though it went up from an unexpected direction erika dorsch turned her blue gaze on him and asked what do you think of the whole business about the first edition of mein kampf few residents of the reich would have been comfortable answering that question it horrified heinrich for all sorts of reasons most of which erika knew nothing about he tried to pass it off lightly what i think doesnt matter what the powers that be think will be what counts its what i told heinrich at the office that whole business is nothing but a lot of garbage willi said nobody who counts will pay any attention to it the blue glare erika turned on him might have come from twin acetylene torches i already know what you think i ought toive heard it often enough im trying to find out what heinrich thinks wherever that anger came from it was genuine heinrich wondered whether erika really had her sights set on him or whether she was only using him to make willi angry and jealous either way it worked willi visibly steamed heinrich said like i told you i dont know what to think how about you erika he regretted the last question as soon as the words were out of his mouth which was of course too late me i think its about time somebody brought this up she said who is the reich for if its not for the people in it and if its for us shouldnt we have some say about who runs it heinrich agreed with that to the extent that he could he would never have dared to say it out loud though willi dorsch sneered my wife the democrat this iswhy hitler changed things after the first edition look what that kind of nonsense got the french look what it got the americans if you go around electing politicians theyll kiss the backsides of the people who voted them in you need men who canlead not follow at long last lise brought in the cakes and coffee she set plate and cup in front of willi here why dont you lead off on this thanks lise willi said as he cut himself a slice of cake i dont hear you going on about how wonderful the stupid first edition is youve got the sense to know its rubbish his wife said im with heinrich i cant do anything much about it one way or the other whats the point of fussing over something like that thereis a point erika dorsch insisted if the party bonzen know the people are looking over their shoulder and just waiting to throw them out if they do something stupid or feather their own nests maybe theyll watch themselves heinrich had the same hope wouldnt leaders responsible to the people they ruled be milder than leaders responsible to no one but their courtiers they could hardly be harsher no matter what he hoped though hed had keeping quiet and staying noncommittal inalterably drummed into him silence meant more than security silence meant survival and that held true for others besides the last few hidden jews as willi pointed out when all this is over when weve got ourselves a new fuhrer the security police are going to take a good long look at everybody who babbled about the first edition and how wonderful it is they may figure some people are just fools and let them off the hook but some people the agitators will win themselves noodles for their big mouths the camp slang for a bullet in the back of the neck had become part of the ordinary german language all he succeeded in doing was getting his wife angry again so what shall we do then erika snapped sit on our hands and keep quiet because were afraid pretend were nothing but a bunch of mussulmen that was camp slang too slang for prisoners whod given up and were waiting to die her question prompted only one answer from heinrichyes he thoughtwhat else is there dont you realize what youre up against maybe erika didnt shed lived a life of comfort and privilege confident she was one of the herrenvolk so had most germans in the forty years since the united states went down they were top dogs and seldom had to think about how they stayed on top sure enough erika stuck out her chin and said im just as good an aryan as any of the party big shots im just as good an aryan as kurt haldweim wasand so are you willi and heinrich and lise if youd just stand up on your hind legs about it could sheer aryan arrogance pave the way for the measures the first edition of mein kampf outlined there was a notion that hadnt occurred to heinrich up till nowwere all set about everyone else so we must be equal to one another it made a very germanic kind of sense but just because erika thought it was true would anyone else that was liable to be a different story willi said i think wed better head for home some nights theres just no reasoning with some people though he did his best to sound cheerful heinrich thought he was fuming underneath erika didnt help when she said ive been telling you that for years and you never paid any attention to me they were still sniping at each other when they left the gimpel house and headed up the street toward the bus stop heinrich closed the door behind them whew he saida long whoosh of air yes lise stretched the word to three times its usual length that was a fascinating evening wasnt it theres a good word for it heinrich could imagine several other words he might have used fascinating was the safest one he could come up with i dont think youre part of the problem between willi and erika his wife said thats good he answered most sincerely i dont think youre part of the problem lise repeated but i think erika thinks youre part of the solution youmay be right heinrich didnt want to admit even that much it felt dangerous not dangerous in the hauledofftoanexterminationcamp sense but dangerous in the simpler more normal thiscomplicatesmylife sense he was not the sort of man who cared for danger of any sort lise tapped her foot on the tile of the entry hall and if i am right what are you going to do about it me nothing he exclaimed the alarm in his voice must have got through to her because she relaxeda little good she said thats the right answer she paused pensively erikas a very goodlooking woman isnt she heinrich couldnt even say no she would have known he was lying i suppose so he mumbled maybe its not such a bad thing you have more on your mind than most husbands lise tried to eye him severely but a smile curled up the corners of her mouth in spite of herself the same thing had occurred to heinrich not so long before he was not about to admit that to lise he told himself security police torturers couldnt have torn it from him but he knew he was liable to be wrong those people were very good at what they did and got a lot of practice doing it he realized he had to say something he couldnt just keep standing there otherwise lise was liable to think he thought it was too bad he had more on his mind than most husbands which was the last thing he wanted i know when im well off he told her that turned the tentative reluctant smile wide and happy good she said youd better she paused do you know when youre well off well enough to help me clean up i suppose so he said once more as halfheartedly as he had when admitting erika dorsch was pretty lise sent him a sharp look then she figured out why hed sounded the way he had she made as if to throw something at him its a good thing ive known you for a long time she said yes i think so too heinrich said and that for once turned out to be just the right answer esther stutzman turned the key to get into dr dambachs outer office good morningfrau stutzman the pediatrician called from his inner sanctum good morning doctor she answered have you been here long a while dambach said would you please see to the coffeemaker its turning out nothing but sludge of course when esther did she discovered hed put three times as much coffee on the filter as he should have she didnt point that out to him experience had taught her that pointing such things out did no good with children he knew what he was doing with the coffeemakerno she just set things to rights and brought him a proper cup of coffee danke schonhe said i dont know what goes wrong when i put my hands on that machine but something always does i cant understand it i follow the instructions yes doctor esther replied from what irma the afternoon receptionist said she wasnt the only one whod given up arguing with dambach about the coffeemaker he sipped from the cup esther had brought him this is much better he told her i dont know how you make that miserable thing behave but you always manage to esther only smiled if the pediatrician wanted to think she was a genius when it came to coffee she wouldnt complain he tapped at the papers on his desk ive found something interestingsomething peculiar even was he trying to show that he was good for something even if he couldnt make coffee worth a damn esther already knew that she also knew she had to ask what is it dr dambach and sound interested when she did and then all of a sudden shewas interested vitally and painfully interested for he said do you remember the case of paul klein a few days ago the poor baby with that horrible disease esther said doing her best not to thinkthe poor baby whos a jew yes thats right i have found a fascinating discrepancy on his parents genealogical records dear god did walther make a mistakenone of the fear esther felt showed on her face if shed shown fear whenever she felt it she would have gone around looking panicstricken all the time when she said really she sounded intrigued but no more than a good secretary should have dr dambach nodded i dont know what to make of it either he said in the records i got from the reichs genealogical office both richard and maria klein are shown to have distant ancestors who may possibly have beenwell jews good heavens esther had had a lot of practice simulating that kind of shock as i say these were distant ancestors dambach went on hastily nothing to involve the security police believe me i dont care for that business any more than you doi doubt that esther thoughti doubt that very much the pediatrician fortunately oblivious continued but the slight jewish taint would help account for the presence of the taysachs gene on both sides of the family i see esther said what she didnt see was where the problem lay in that case dambach proceeded to spell it out for her while i was going through the kleins records i happened to come across another copy of their family tree one theyd given me when pauls older brother eduard was bornthose pedigrees show unquestioned aryan ancestry on both sides of the family as far back as can be traced howvery strange esther said through lips suddenly stiff with dread changing a computer record threw any future hounds off the scent yes but compare the change to a printout from before it was madei should have pulled those records from eduards chartesther thought but it had never crossed her mind eduard had been born before she came to work at dambachs office and shed forgotten about his files guilt made her want to sink through the floor strange indeed ive never seen another case like it dr dambach said and whats even stranger is i called the reichs genealogical office yesterday afternoon and they said their records show no signs of tampering thank heaven for thatesther thoughtwalthers safe but were richard and maria klein maybei hate to say this of people but maybe they tried to hide their jews in the woodpile and used altered documents to do it esther suggested doing her best for them even if youre not enough of a mischling to be disposed of a lot of folks dont care to have anything to do with you if youve got even a trace of jew blood altering official documents is illegal dambach said severely but then he paused a thoughtful expression on his round face still i suppose it could be it makes more sense than anything i thought of i would have hoped though that the kleins might have trusted their childrens physician i am after all a man with some experience of the world i know that a small taint of jewish ancestry may be forgiven its not as if they were half breeds or full bloods for heavens sakeas if there were such folk at the heart of the reich in this day and age of course not doctor what a ridiculous idea esther stutzman clamped down hard on a scream dr dambach thought of himself as a man of the world but he thoughthed been trained to thinkof jews as different from other people he thought of himself as tolerant for being willing to ignore some distant trace of jewish ancestry and so for the greater german reich he was the pediatrician arranged papers in a neat stack as i say i am a man with some experience of the world i have seen forged genealogical papers before you would be surprised how many people want to claim a grander ancestry than they really own most of them are crude jobs thoughaltered photocopies and such but what the kleins gave me with eduard seems perfectly authentic thats because itisperfectly authentic at least as far as the reichs genealogical office knows as long as you have the proper information now is there really any point to making a fuss esther said if dambach said no she could go out to her receptionists station and breathe a sigh of relief when he wasnt looking but dambach didnt say anything at all he just sat there eyeing the different sets of genealogical records esther knew shed pushed things as far as she could if she said another word her boss would start wondering why she was sticking up for the kleins so muchdont let anyone start wondering about you might have been the eleventh commandment for jews in the reich a smile on her face she walked out of dr dambachs private office she had plenty with which to busy herself out front filing billing preparing dunning letters for people whose payments were late she bit her lip when the pediatrician used the telephone even though she couldnt make out whom he was callinghis wife his brother his mother she thought hopefully the telephone she was in charge ofnot dambachs personal linebegan to ring too patients and their parentsmostly their mothersstarted coming in she scheduled appointments and led children and the grownups with them back to examination rooms once she made a followup appointment with a specialist for a boy whose broken arm wasnt healing as straight as dambach would have liked as noon approached the flood of people coming in slowed down and the flood of people going out picked up dr dambach sometimes worked straight through lunch but this didnt look like a day where he would have to esther relaxed a little she got the chance to look around for things she could take care of before she went home that way irma wouldnt have to worry about them this afternoon and esther herself wouldnt have to worry about them tomorrow morning the last patient had just left when the door to the waiting room opened again esther looked up in annoyancewas someone trying to bring in a child without first making an appointment unless it was an emergency she intended to send anyone that foolish away with a flea in his ear but the tall man in the unfamiliar dark brown uniform was not carrying a baby or holding a child by the hand he nodded to her this is the office of dr martin dambach he inquired his accent bavarian yes thats right esther answered and you are maximilian ebertreichs genealogical office at your service he actually clicked his heels esther tried to remember the last time shed seen anyone outside of the cinema do thattried and failed the man from the genealogical office went on dr dambach is in esther wanted to tell him no had she thought that would make him go away and never come back she would have as things were she had to hide alarm and reluctance when she nodded yes he is one moment please she went back to dr dambachs office the pediatrician was eating a liverwurst sandwich excuse me doctor but a herr ebert from the reichs genealogical office is here to see you is he dr dambach said with his mouth full he swallowed heroically esther thought of an anaconda engulfing a tapir when dambach spoke again his voice was clear i didnt expect him so soon please tell him he can come in he stuck the remains of the sandwich in a desk drawer danke schon gnadige frau ebert said when esther delivered the message and he clicked his heels againdear lady esther wondered that took politeness a long way when talking to a receptionist did he like her looks it wasnt mutual he was dark and jowly and she thought hed have a nasty temper if he werent trying to be charming she was careful to stand well away from him when she led him to the doctors private office they didnt bother closing the door esther heard bits of conversation floating out obviously genuine alsoobviously genuine dont know what to make of wouldnt bother but for the jewish aspect a puzzlement without a doubt after twenty minutes or so dr dambach and maximilian ebert emerged together the man from the genealogical office asked esther what do you know of this business about the kleins should we be talking about this with her dambach asked i dont see why not ebert said shes obviously of impeccable aryan stock wellfrau his eye picked up the little name badge at her stationahfrau stutzman only what dr dambach has told me esther answeredobviously of impeccable aryan stock she couldnt shriek laughter however much she might want to cautiously she went on i do know the kleins a little away from the office if she didnt say that they could find out better to admit it theyve always seemed like good enough people im sorry their child has this horrible disease every word of that was truemore true than maximilian ebert could know have you any idea how they could have got two different sets of genealogical records each one plainly authentic ebert asked no i dont see how its possible she answered which was anything but the truth are you really sure theyare both authentic dr dambach asked as certain as i can be without the laboratory work to prove it ebert said ill take both of them with me to get that and then if they do both turn out to be genuine well have to figure out what that means at the moment doctor i have no more idea than you do and now i must be off a pleasure to meet youfrau stutzmanguten tag he touched the brim of his cap and strode out of the office now well get to the bottom of this dr dambach sounded as if he looked forward to the prospect so we will esther hoped she sounded the same way even if it was another lie noespecially if it was another lie the medieval english association meeting was winding down in another couple of days susanna weiss would have to fly back to berlin the conference hadnt been the most exciting shed ever attended she was bringing home material for at least two articles that would keep professor oppenhoff happy but there hadnt been any really spectacular papers and there hadnt been any really juicy scandals without the one or the other the conclave itself would go down as less than memorable still there were compensations first and foremost there was london itself along with her ideas for articles susanna was also bringing home enough new booksused books actuallyto make excess baggage charges all but certain her campaign against the bookstores of london would have made general guderian sit up and take notes she always shopped as if she were a biggame hunter organizing a safari all she lacked were beaters to drive the books off the shelves and into the range of her highpowered account card she had to find the volumes and pick them out herselfbut that was part of the sport along with the books she was bringing back several pairs of shoes shed gone after them with the same effective bravado shed used on her bookstore campaign she was particularly proud of one pair which were covered all over with multicolored sequins if she wore them to a faculty meeting she might give the department chairman heart failureand if that wasnt worth trying she didnt know what would be she had one more reason for hating to leave london too no matter how stodgy the mea had been this year the british union of fascists across the street had more than made up for it susanna thought she might have spent more time at the crown than she had at the silver eagle shed got to know several buf men who thought she was a delegate totheir gathering not the sort of compliment she most wanted perhaps but a compliment all the same eres the little lydy they would roar when they spotted her and other endearments in dialects never heard among the scholars of medieval english they pressed buttons and badges and stickers on her and bought her pints till her back teeth floated she would rather have had scotch but the rankandfile fascists were a beerdrinking crowd they were also a crowd overwhelmingly in favor of doing business the way the first edition of mein kampf outlined only stands to reason dont it dearie said a baldheaded brokennosed bruiser named nick breathing beer fumes into susannas face its the buggers oove already got it made oo dont want ordinary blokes to ave their say that certainly seems reasonable to me susanna said her precise welleducated tones sent nick and his pals into gales of laughter she couldnt help liking them if there was any hope for changing the way things worked it rested on their shoulders but the way they kept laughing while they bragged of brawls and brutalities past chilled herif they knew i was a jew they would laugh like that while they stomped me to death she forgave or at least forgot their hypothetical sins when they smuggled her onto the floor for the climactic session of their assembly they didnt think of it as smuggling of course and she wore enough buf ornaments that no one not her companions and not the even nastier thugs at the doors even noticed that a membership badge was not among the gewgaws things were undoubtedly livelier here than they were at the medieval english association meeting people roared out songs in raucous choruses the tunes came from british popular music some of the words were fierce some were funny some were obscene most were either for or against the first edition here and there people for the older rules brawled with people opposing them buf guards tried without too much luck to keep the two sides apart a beer bottle smashed on the floor a couple of meters from susannas feet someone will get killed she exclaimed some of these bastards deserve killing nick answered the brute simplicity of fascism had always fascinated and repelled susanna at the same time somebody doesnt like the way youre going get rid of him and then keep on going that way anyhow if youre strong enough you can and it proves you were right all along there was of course a certain problem suppose they decide you are the ones who need killing susanna asked only goes to show theyre a pack of bloody sods eh nick said one of the ruffians pals though saw what susanna was driving at if they let counting ands stand for banging eads i expect we will too he said thats what this business is about right susanna nodded after a moment reluctantly so did nick another bottle shattered this time on somebodys head friends led the bleeding man out of the hall susanna shivered feeling as if shed been swept back through time this was how the nazis had started ninety years earlier gathering in taverns for what were as much brawls as meetings no communists would come to try to break up this conclave though another shiver if any communists were left alive they were as much in hiding as the reich s handful of jews bang bang bangto her relief that wasnt gunfire it was the chairman plying his gavel in front of the microphone on the podium that will be enough of that charlie lynton called his amplified voice booming through the hallbang bang bang settle down lynton was in his midfifties with an upperclass english accent that belied his birth in edinburgh he was smooth and smart he had to be smart hed headed the british union of fascists since the midnineties and steered as independent a line as he could without rousing german wrath which way will he go do you think susanna asked oh es with us nick said and the men around him nodded e can win a show of ands and e knows it his friends heads bobbed up and down one of them a fellow everybody called blinky bill because of his squint said its them other old fools on the platform weve got to worry about sure enough a good many of the uniformed men up there looked as if theyd been chewing lemons things had run the same way for almost seventy years ever since britain fell to the wehrmacht as old guards will the old guard here had expected them to keep on running the same way forever but whatever else charlie lynton was he was a breath of fresh air in a party that hadnt seen much for a long time he plied the gavel againbang bang bang come on lads settle down he called once more lets have some order here no call could have been better calculated to appeal to fascists putting things in ordertheir notion of orderwas fascistsraison detre but even that precious call didnt work here at the same time as nick was bellowing huzzah for the first edition another fascist with an even more impressive set of lungs roared to hell with the bloody first edition chaos broke out anew bang bang banglynton pounded so hard he might have used a gun if hed had one enough he shouted and he had the microphone working for him by the way the word resounded through the hall that might have been god shouting up thereon the assumption which susanna found unlikely that god took an interest in the internal squabbles of the british union of fascists first edition first edition this time it was an organized chant deep and rolling and thunderous the british had learned their lessons well similar shouts ofsieg heil resounded through nazi rallies in berlin and munich and nuremberg the first editions foes werent so well disciplined they had no counterchant prepared shouting out their protests as individuals they couldnt drown the cries of those who favored change first edition first edition susanna shouted with her comradesher friends she supposed she had to call them for the moment the endless chant was intoxicating it beat in her brain it beat in her blood back home she had as little to do with national socialism as she could without drawing suspicion to herself she hadnt really appreciated the power of mass rallies now that she found herself in the middle of one she understood she felt caught up in something greater than herself it wasnt a feeling she was used to having she distrusted it but oh it was heady charlie lynton let the chant build for two or three minutes then used the gavel once more enough he boomed for a second time weve got a lot to get through and we wont do it if we spend all our bloody time shouting at each other he took a piece of paper from the breast pocket of his black uniform tunic most buf men put susanna in mind of brigands a few reminded her of army officers charlie lynton somehow contrived to look like a corporate executive epaulets notwithstanding i have here he said a message from his majesty king henry ix where nothing else had that won him silence and complete attention henry was like king umberto in italy he had no real power but enormous prestige the duce and the italian fascist party didnt have to listen to umberto but they did if they were smartand most of them wanted to the same held true here for charlie lynton and the buf with respect to king henry my loyal brave and faithful subjects lynton read i am pleased and proud that so many of you should wish to return to the earliest and in my view the best traditions of the party so closely affiliated with your own wishing you wisdom in your debate i remain henrydeo gratia king of england and defender of the faith beside susanna nick erupted volcanically with a great roar of glee and delight susanna clapped her hands and whooped too like the british union of fascists king henry had found a way to praise democracy and the national socialists at the same time that wasnt easy susanna hadnt even imagined it was possible but theyd done it here and will weshe wondered wistfullyhow arewe going to go about choosing the next fuhrerno one on the rrg or the bbc had said much about that deliberations were proceeding that was as much as anybody would admit it sounded more like a criminal case than anything else susanna grimacedit probably is up on the platform someone from the old guard was inveighing against the first edition and everything it stood for the longer he talked the more loudly the rank and file booed and jeered and mocked him seeing as much charlie lynton let him go on and on and on he hurt his own cause worse than lynton could have when the old man finally stumped back to his seat on the rostrum the buf leader smiled out at the rank and file and said well i think that tells us a good deal about where we all stand doesnt it a few stubborn souls booed and hooted at lynton but their outcry seemed almost lost in the big hall for most of the foes of the first edition sat in embarrassed silence as if ashamed to admit they agreed with the disastrous speaker and disagreed with both their chairman and their king thats done it by god nick boomed and planted a beery kiss on susannas cheek part of her wanted to haul off and slap him the rest was too excited at being here even to mind very much we have a quorum charlie lynton said time to call the question shall we change our rules to give back to the members of the british union of fascists the powers that are rightfully theirs as outlined in the first edition of mein kampf or shall we go on as we have been for so long with the few dictating to the many one of the advantages of being chairman was that lynton not only got to guide the debate but also to frame its terms had he opposed the change he might have called it destroying tradition and giving in to mob rule since he didnt reform passed overwhelmingly by better than three to one this time susanna kissed nick on his bristly cheek to her astonishment the hardbitten british fascist blushed a brighter red than she ever had thank you friends lynton said when the tally was complete youve done the right thing and youve done a brave thing and now let us hope our german colleagues may profit by our example herr kesslers forefinger shot out like a striking serpent alicia gimpel alicia leaped to her feet she stood at stiff attention jawohl herr kessler what is the principle upon which the national socialist party and all fascist parties are founded the fuhrerprinzip herr kessler alicia answered the principle that the leader of the party knows best the direction in which it should go shed learned that the year before she didnt forget her lessons correct her teacher growled be seated kessler prowled in front of the blackboard that was the only word alicia could find for the way he moved he might have been a lion or a leopard hunting for something to tear to pieces she wondered what had put him in such a dreadful temper he glared at the class does anyone have any business telling the national socialist party of the greater german reich how to run its affairs anyone at all noherr kessler the children chorusedthat was obviously the answer he wanted he nodded his face still intent and angry no is correct so what should we do when the englishmen have the nerve to tell us such things what should we do a boys hand flew up in the air kessler pointed at him wolfgang priller the boy leaped to his feet punish themherr kessler his voice was loud and shrill kessler nodded again and scribbled in the roll book you have the proper german spirit priller he said i also think this would be the best course for the reich to take but what wewill do he looked most unhappy without a fuhrer who can say what we will do and if we do nothing if we allow the english to get away with their insolence is this not a sign of weakness ja herr kessler the class said dutifully what about the first editionherr kessler a girl asked trudi krebs the teacher murmured do your father and mother speak of the first edition do they he asked sharply the girl nodded he wrote in the roll book again then slammed the book shut with a dreadful finality he did not answer trudis question silencea particular kind of silencefilled the classroomshes in trouble alicia thought and thenand her mother and father are liable to be in trouble too even before shed found out she was a jew her parents had taught her not to say too much to other grownups most children in the germanic empire got similar lessons the less you showed the outside world the safer you stayed but trudi had slipped children sometimes did alicia knew that was why she couldnt tell francesca and roxane what they really were why she had to go on listening to them say horrible things about jews when they were jews themselves why shed said horrible things about jews herself till not very long beforeand why she had to go on saying horrible things about jews now just to make sure no one ever suspected herr kessler breathed out hard through his nose he knew what sort of silence that was too the first edition of mein kampf he said heavily is full of adolf hitlers earliest thoughts about the way the national socialist party should work most of these were wonderful thoughts marvelous thoughtsaber naturlich our beloved first fuhrer was a wonderful man a marvelous man a brilliant man but sometimes when he looked back at what he had written he found later that he had better ideas yet wolfgang priller raised his hand again questionherr kessler the teacher nodded wolf said is it like when you have us revise a theme yes exactly herr kesslers smile for once was broad and pleased and genuine that is exactly what it is like and if even adolf hitler saw that he could improve his work by revision i trust you will see you can do the same the children nodded alicia among them she was playing the chameleon again though for inside she sniffed scornfully she hated revising more than anything else she did at school it struck her as a waste of time if you thought a little before you settled in to work so you did it right the first time why did you need to fiddle around with it afterwards so you see the teacher went on if the great and wise first fuhrer changed mein kampf as he did the first edition must be of smaller worth than those that came later anyone who would argue otherwise must surely suffer from a lack of proper understanding when the children went out to the schoolyard to play at lunchtime no one had anything to do with trudi krebs most of her classmates pretended she wasnt there some of themmostly boystalked about her as if she werent there boy is she going to get it wolfgang priller predicted with a certain gloomy relish theyll knock on her door in the middle of the night and then he didnt say what would happen then but he didnt have to the other children shuddered in delicious horror everybody knew the kinds of things that happened when they knocked on your door in the middle of the night trudi sat all alone on a bench fighting back tears alicia wanted to go over and try to give her what comfort she could before finding out she was a jew she would have now she didnt dare being what she was made a coward of her she hated that hated herself for hanging back but she didnt move she wasnt afraid of getting in trouble herself shed been in trouble plenty of times putting her family and friends in trouble though was a different story she couldnt do that and so biting her lip she stayed where she was alicia wondered if trudi would even show up at school the next day but she did and the day after that too and on through the rest of the weekherr kessler seemed surprised alicia knew she was surprised if the knock on the door in the middle of the night hadnt comewell who could say what that meant esther stutzman liked to shop though she didnt treat expeditions to the department store like hunting trips across the veldt the way susanna weiss did for a berliner who enjoyed seeing what there was to see and spending some money there was only one place to go the kurfurstendamm back before the second world war lots of rich jews had lived therelived there openly which made esther marvel theyd got away with it for years too till kristallnacht when the broad street turned into a glittering ocean of broken glass nowadays the kurfurstendamm still glittered but with multicolored neon signs and the reflections of the sun off plateglass windows people came from all over the germanic empireand from the empire of japan and the south american countries as wellto part with their reichsmarks in style fashions on dummies in the plateglass windows ranged from coquettish to outrageous while some were both at oncebefore long esther thoughtanna will want to wear clothes like that her sigh was part horror and part mere sadness at the passage of time last years turbans she saw were out of favor hats this year looked like nothing so much as the highcrowned shinyvisored caps party and ss bigwigs wore decorated with brightly dyed plumes sprouting from improbable places esther eyed them dubiously she didnt know if she cared to look like a sturmbannfuhrer whod just mugged a peacock she paused in front of a telephone booth the man inside might well have come from south america he was certainly too swarthy to live comfortably within the greater german reich he hung up came out of the booth and tipped his fedora to esther as he hurried into the milliners shop fumbling in her handbag she pulled out a fiftypfennig coin and went into the telephone booth a man whod started towards it turned away in disappointment he would have to find another place from which to call not that there werent plenty of public telephones along the kurfurstendamm esther fed the coin into the slot and dialed the number she needed the phone rang once twice bitte a woman said in esthers ear guten tag frau klein esther answered i have an important message for you im sorry but im not inter maria klein broke off perhaps recognizing esthers voice esther hoped that was why she stopped anyhow after a moment the other woman said well go ahead as long as youve got me on the line she had the sense not to name names just as esther had had the sense not to call from her own home or from dr dambachs office if the kleins phone was tapped as it might well be after dambach had discovered the two versions of their family tree technicians could trace the call herebut how much would they gain if they did precious little because esther intended to leave as soon as she hung up thank you she said now i just wanted to let you know that there are people who know there are two sets isnt that interesting she tried to sound bright and cheerful as a telephone solicitor should this too maria said this too on top of everything with the baby im afraid so in the face of the other womans bitterness esthers good cheer collapsed like a burst balloonand its my fault she thought miserablyminenobody elses she didnt know how she was going to live with that what are we supposed to do now maria klein demanded gott im himmelwhat are we supposed to do now she wasnt really asking esther and if she was asking god hed had few answers for jews these past seventyfive years im sorry im sorry for everything esther whispered and hung up as soon as she left the booth another woman went in she hoped the other woman had happier business she also hoped the other woman and whoever used the booth afterwards would cover up all of her own fingerprints esther wanted to find another phone booth and call walther to let him know shed warned the kleins she wanted to but she didnt calls into and out of zeiss were too likely to be monitored she could have worked out some sort of code phrase to tell him what shed done but she didnt want to take the chance today such phrases were fine if nobody was likely to be paying close attention if on the other hand someone was trying to build a case with a shiver esther shook her head no she murmured a man gave her a curious look susanna would have frozen him with a glare heinrich would have walked past him without even noticing the curious look which would have confounded him just as well esthers way was to smile sweetly at him he turned red embarrassed at wondering about such an obviously normal person if only you knewesther thought but the truth no matter how little the nazis wanted to admit it was that jews were or could be normal people some good some bad some indifferent shylocks words from the merchant of venice echoed in esthers mindif you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die esther tried to imagine an ss man tickling a jew the picture was enough to set her laughing without the deedbut only for a moment the nazis had poisoned jews poisoned them by the millions and the jews had died shylock went onand if you wrong us shall we not revenge she doubted a jew was left alive who didnt dream of revenge at least once a day but dreams were only dreams survival is a kind of revengeesther thoughtjust by living on by passing our heritage to our children we beat the nazis she smiled now alicia gimpel knew what she was too pretty soon her sisters would also know and if all went welland esther with her sunny disposition still hoped it wouldeduard klein would find out one of these days too but then that smile disappeared no matter how sunny esther was she couldnt keep it the kleins had passed on some of their heritage to little paul too and he would never live to find out what he was heinrich gimpel was starting to get used to seeing long black limousines pull up to oberkommando der wehrmacht about the time he and willi got off their bus in front of the building he was getting used to watching party and ssbonzen hed seen on the televisor and read about in newspapers and magazines climbing the steps he climbed every day and he was beginning to gauge how the generals in charge of the wehrmacht liked their highranking visitors by the way the guards treated the newcomers at the entrance if they came to attention and waved the politicking bigwigs through those officials were in good odor with his bosses if they made the muckymucks wait checked identity cards against faces and fed the cards through the machine reader to get a green light those men werent so well liked one morning the machine reader showed a red light this is an outrage an ssobergruppenfuhrer shouted let me pass sorry a guard replied obviously enjoying being rude to the ss equivalent of a lieutenant general no green light you dont come in he turned to heinrich and willi next you have not heard the last of this the obergruppenfuhrer warned he stormed off his face as red as the stripe on a general staff officers trousers heinrich wondered if his identity card would pass muster but it did so did willis once they got inside willi said the generals really didnt want to see that fellow if they programmed the reader to reject his card people are starting to show where they stand heinrich replied id say so willi dorsch agreed and if that ss mans faction wins id say well see our budget cut heinrich shrugged the waffen ss has always thought it could do the wehrmacht s job the next time its right will be the first not to hear its officers tell the story willi shrugged too ah well ours is not to wonder why ours is but to do or die you so relieve my mind heinrich said willi laughed he could talk blithely about dyinghe didnt have to worry about it very much heinrich on the other hand had days when he felt he was living on borrowed time and that it was about to run out the feeling would have been bad enough had he worried about himself alone worrying about the rest of his folk left in the reich seemed twenty times worse as they sat down at their desks willi said you see though its just like i said nobody cares what the limeys did and nobodys calling a party congress to pick the next fuhrer so much for the precious first edition the big shots will do the choosing same as always it does look that way heinrich agreed and did his best not to sound too unhappy in case the room was bugged theyre taking their time too theyve got to find somebody they can all at least stand willi said which was doubtless true that weeds out the zanies and the men who only have a following in one faction so it does if heinrich thoughta party congress would do better still because then everything would be out in the open he kept it to himself willi was right no party congress would choose kurt haldweims successor that being so to go on talking about the first edition might mark a man as a dangerous dissident he settled in to work no matter what the waffen ss thought the wehrmacht was the strong right arm of the greater german reich and no matter who became fuhrer even if it turned out to be that belligerent obergruppenfuhrer s candidatethe wehrmacht had to go on it had toand it would plenty of people like heinrich gimpel though not many of themjust like heinrich gimpel made sure it kept running smoothly willi asked are we on for tonight the brains of the outfit hasnt told me anything different heinrich said by which he meant lise willi grinned he sometimes called erika the high command in the same way carefully heinrich added we might do better if we dont talk politics too much though willis grin slipped you know that and i know that but whether erika knows that well well find out that was what heinrich was afraid of but he made himself smile and nod the date for dinner and bridge alarmed him so that part of him wished hed backed out if willi and erikas marriage was blowing up he didnt want it to blow up in his face but what would erika do if he made that too obvious he didnt want to find out getting back to work was something of a relief willi didnt joke any more about erika being the one who wanted heinrich over heinrich wished he would have if he was joking about it he probably wasnt brooding over what it meant if he wasnt jokingwell who could say they got through the days work canteen rumor was full of talk about the rejected obergruppenfuhrer since heinrich and willi had seen that happen they scored points for eyewitness accounts another analyst sighed enviously saying idve paid money to watch one of those arrogant soandsos head off with a flea in his ear several other people nodded rumor also spoke of bonzen from the party and from the navy who had been admitted to oberkommando der wehrmacht heinrich tried to read tea leaves from that all he could see was that the navy like the wehrmacht was a conservative service if they were joining with one section of the party maybe with an ss faction different from that obergruppenfuhrer sthey might be trying to promote a candidate or they might be trying to block one only time would tell heinrich and willi rode home together see you a little before seven willi said as he got off the bus we can all watch horst and then get down to cards all right heinrich hoped it would be katarina came over to babysit the girls kathe was a kid sister closer in age to alicia than to lise heinrich suspected shed been a surprise to her parents he wished he could ask them even such a nosy question a drunken truck driver had broadsided their little vw a few years before and they hadnt survived the wreck a peoples court gave the truck driver summary justice but that didnt bring back the franks tante kathe fascinated the children she dyed her brown hair a yellow as artificial as oleomargarine and sometimes wore styles that looked like what ss uniforms would have been if they were designed to titillate rather than terrifyin my day youd have done a stretch in a camp for clothes like that heinrich thought he laughed at himselfand if going on about in my day doesnt make me an old fogy i dont know what would tonight katarina had on dungarees of blue american denim which were almost as scandalous as some of her other clothes she refused to be ordinary that was dangerous for a jew on the other hand a fair number of young men and women dressed the way she did so she had a crowd into which she could blend in have fun with your bridge she told heinrich and lise she might have been sayinghave fun with your warm milk and slippers kathes eyes sparkled as she turned to the girls while theyre gone well havereal fun wont we ja alicia francesca and roxane chorused entranced every so often heinrich wondered whatreal fun consisted of hed never found the girls heads spinning with hashish after tante kathe watched them so he didnt lose sleep over it but he did wonder getting out of the house felt good even if it was only for the short jaunt over to the dorsches as heinrich and lise got off the bus she said willi and erika are lucky to live so close to their bus stop heinrich nodded ive thought the same thing thinking along with your wife was supposed to be another mark of fogydom he didnt care he liked thinking along with lise when he rang the bell erika opened the door she smiled at the gimpels come on in she said horst will be on in a minute and willi wouldnt miss him for the world erika made watching the news sound like a vicefirst danger sign heinrich thought from the front room willis voice rose in excitement come quick everybody i think weve got a new fuhrer that sent heinrich and liseand erikahurrying to join him germany awake horst witzleben spoke in millions of homes as if he were a close friend after long and serious discussions senior party ss and military leaders have chosen the present minister of heavy industry heinz buckliger to guide the future of the greater german reich and the germanic empire i am proud to be among the first to say heil buckliger his arm shot out in the nazi salute behind him a new picture appeared on the screen heinrich wouldnt have known heinz buckliger from the man in the moon he proved to be a ruddyfaced man of about fifty with a thick shock of graying blond hair and a toothy smile hes so young erika dorsch said a moment later she added and handsome too heinrich didnt know about handsome young the new fuhrer certainly was younger by far than kurt haldweim had been when he began to lead the reich they passed over a lot of senior people to put him in place willi said the new generations here at last the new head of the reich was born in breslau in horst witzleben said that made buckliger more than forty years younger than haldweimcloser to two generations than one the newsreader went on he studied economics in munich graduating with highest honors from the university there before joining the ministry of heavy industry he served for seven years in the allgemeine ss rising to the rank of hauptsturmfuhrercaptain heinrich thought automatically translating to what he thought of as a real rank not bad not spectacular but not bad once in the ministryherr buckliger rapidly became known as an efficiency expert witzleben said he has promised to bring that passion for efficiency to the reich as a whole here is his first statement after his selection heinz buckliger sat at his desk in the fuhrer s palace in what was obviously a piece of videotape volk of the greater german reich i accept the role of fuhrer with pride but also with great humility he said in a pleasant if not ringing baritone mindful of the triumphs of the past i shall do all i can to lead you to a still more glorious future many things have grown slack in recent years i hope to tighten them and to make the reich and the germanic empire run more smoothly with your help i know i shall succeed he sounds all right willi said as horst witzleben reappeared and began talking about the congratulations pouring into the reich on buckligers rise to supreme power so he does heinrich agreed but hes plainly someones fairhaired boy i wonder whose his first guess for the new fuhrer s patron was lothar prutzmann head of the ss once an ss man always an ss man that wasnt a sure thing but it was the way to bet all right now we know erika said after that the rest of the news will be small potatoes shall we play some cards good idea lise said heinrich nodded willis sigh said he would have liked to stay in front of the televisor but democracy was alive and well in the dorsch household even if the big wheels in the german government had been able to ignore it in choosing heinz buckliger the very first hand they played willi bid and made a small slam in clubs heinrich and lise couldnt do a thing about it if you didnt have the cards you were stuck willi chortled heinrich said i wonder whats on the news on the next hand erika dorsch made three notrump as quick and onesided a rubber as possible lise said heinrichs right watching the news seems better and better their hosts laughed at them they played steadily with a couple of pauses when erika helped the dorsches son and daughter with their homework and one when willi broke up a squabble between the children this all looks and sounds familiar heinrich said life goes on erika said one way or another if that wasnt a hooded glance she sent toward willi heinrich had never seen one willi himself affected not to notice or maybe he really didnt notice you never could tell with willi he said whose deal is it mine i think lise answered she gather up the cards and started shuffling it is now anyway heinrich got the contract when everybody passed at two hearts playing it was routine so much so that things got sidetracked halfway through when lise and willi started arguing about a newspaper story on babylonian archaeology that theyd both seen and heinrich and erika had somehow missed willi insisted the find proved hammurabis code was years older than everyone had thought up till now lise was just as sure it proved no such thing as people will when disagreeing about something of such monumental unimportance they both got more and more certain they were right as they pointed fingers at each other they might have forgotten anyone else was in the roomor for that matter on the planet heinrich set his cards on the table face down lise hardly ever got so excited when she argued with him and he was glad she didnt if willi raised his voice and turned redwell willi was in the habit of doing such things a good thing theyre friends or theyd murder each other heinrich remarked to erika with all the noise lise and willi were making he wasnt sure she even heard him but she nodded willis as bad as the children she said like heinrich talking under the noise of the argument you now you have too much sense to waste your time with such foolishness i dont know he said lises doing it and shes got more sense than i do maybe erika waved her hand but i dont want to go to bed with lise what heinrich wanted to say wasare you out of your mind even if she did want to sleep with him which struck him as strange enough when she was married to the much handsomer willi to say so in front of her husband and his wife maybe shed known what she was doing though because neither willi nor lise leaped from a chair with a cry of fury they were too busy quarreling over cuneiform styles and treering chronology and other things about which neither of them knew a great deal which left heinrich the question of how to respond part of him knew exactly how he would like to respond the rest of him told that part to shut up and forget about it if he hadnt been happy with lise or maybe if hed just been a few years younger a few years randier a few years stupider assuming those last two werent one and the same that one part might have won the argument especially since he got the idea he could have taken erika right there on the card table without making either willi or lise notice but things being as they were yielding to temptation wasnt practical and so he answered im sorry but with all the racket these two are making i didnt hear a word you said erika dorschs sour smile told him she didnt believe a word of it whatdid she believe that he didnt want to go to bed with her or just that he didnt want to do anything about it then and thereisnt that an interesting question deciding he didnt want to know the answer heinrich reached out and waved his hand up and down between willi and lise can we get back to bridge please he asked loudly his wife and erikas husband both blinked as if they were coming back to the real world willi said i dont know why youre so impatient we just started talking and talking and talking erika broke in her voice acidedged itwas fifteen minutes ago heinrich said ohquatsch willi said then he looked at his watch and blinked again he grinned a rather sickly grin oh well maybe it was lise seemed almost as surprised as he did its your lead willi if you can think of anything besides ancient history erika said let me look at the last trick please willi said which went a long way toward proving he couldnt he examined it muttered to himself and threw out a low diamond as far as heinrich could see the lead might have come at random as readily as from reflection on what had gone before heinrich made the contract he and lise went on to win the rubber though not by nearly so much as theyd lost the first one shuffling for the first hand of the next rubber willi said well really hammer you this time tell me a new story heinrich answered ive heard this one before and i dont believe a word of it youll see willi picked up his hand arranged it in suits and said as casually as if he were asking the time three notrump what heinrich stared his own hand didnt have opening strength but he hadnt imagined willi owned that kind of powerhouse he hadnt seen a threeno opening in at least five years he passed so did erika willi yelped and sent her a wounded look visions of another slam must have danced in his head lise passed too heinrich led erika laid out her hand as dummy it was tenhighno wonder shed passed willi didnt even make the three hed bid with no strength on the board he had to play everything out of his own hand and came up one trick short the honors bonus for all four aces more than made up for that even so he let out a sorrowful sigh twentyeight highcard points i was looking at and down one ill never see another hand like that the rest of the evenings bridge was less dramatic the gimpels and dorsches ended up about even as heinrich and lise walked to the bus stop she asked what did you and erika talk about while willi and i were wrangling over babylonians oh nothing much heinrich answered he knew he would probably end up in trouble for not telling his wife what erika had said but if he did tell her hed end up in trouble toosometimes you cant win he thought and kept walking v after giving the flag the nationalsocialist salute herr kessler led alicia gimpels class in singing deutschland uber alles and the horst wessel song the german and party anthems that wasnt part of the usual morning routine but he explained this is a special day children because the reich has a new fuhrer his right arm shot out again heil buckliger heil buckliger alicia and her classmates echoed dutifully she hadnt known about the new fuhrer till breakfast this morning when her mother and father talked about him aunt kathe hadnt watched horst witzleben the way her parents did instead shed played with alicia and her sisters and sung silly songs and told stories that were not only funny but also a good deal sassier than the ones the gimpel girls heard from anybody else in the family herr kessler said the new fuhrer will do wonderful things for the reich and for the germanic empire he is very wise and very good and very strong he must be all those things or he never would have been chosen fuhrer he sounded very sure almost all the pupils in the classroom nodded without a moments hesitation alicia nodded too she was learning to be a chameleon but she couldnt help wonderinghow does he know will things be any different nowherr kessler asked a boyalicia didnt see who the teacher frowned the question was good enough that he had to answer it but for a moment he seemed unable to find a waymaybe nobody told him what to say alicia thoughthe doesnt seem very good at figuring things out for himself at last kessler said i think things will be better the new fuhrer is a young mannot too much older than i amand he is active and vigorous the old fuhrer was very old indeed he was sickly and feeble some of you may have grandparents or greatgrandparents who are like that several children nodded behind alicia emma handrick raised her hand when herr kessler called on her she said when my greatgranddad got that way my folks took him to a reichs mercy center is that what they did with the old fuhrer nogott im himmel no the teacher turned very red the question must have rocked him alicia couldnt remember him ever saying anything about god before she couldnt remember any of her teachers saying anything about god shed always had the idea that they werent supposed toherr kessler needed a moment to gather himself then he said kurt haldweim lived out his whole life he had to you see because he was serving the reich do you understand ja herr kessler emma answered she wasnt going to argue with him alicia wanted to before she found out she was a jew she might have she didnt dare stick out her neck now not being able to say what she thought sometimes made her feel as if she were choking she wanted to cheer when a boy stuck up his hand when the teacher pointed his way he asked excuse meherr kessler but if the old fuhrer was all feeble whydidnt they take him to a reichs mercy center isnt that what youre supposed to do before he becomes a burden the fuhrer is not a burden kessler said stiffly the fuhrer cannot be a burden the fuhrer is the fuhrer by the way he spoke that was supposed to settle things nobody in the class asked any more questions about the reichs mercy centers so maybe it did or maybe all the children realized asking more questions like that would only land them in trouble and maybe herr kessler realized he hadnt satisfied everybody with his answers for he quickly changed the subject and plunged into the days usual lessons no one could challenge him on those he went back to being the classroom fuhrer lord of all he surveyed for the history lesson he rolled up the usual map of the world as it was now and rolled down a different map one that showed the way things had been before the second and third world wars do you see how tiny the reich was in those days and how big our enemies were he said and yet we beat them because we were aryans and they were full of jews france england russia the united statesall full of jews and they fell into our hands one after another what does this tell you alicia gimpel she sprang to her feet that aryans are superior to jewsherr kessler very good be seated she knew her lessons she could recite them without fail reciting them when she didnt believe them though made her feel all slimy inside she wanted to know what was true she wanted to say what was true she knew she would get in trouble if she did that made going on with what she learned in school necessary it didnt make it palatable herr kessler asked the next question of someone else it was also antisemitic alicia didnt like hearing it either she wondered how herr kessler would like listening to antiaryan questions all day she suspected he would get sick of it in a hurry she sighed things had been a lot simpler before she knew what she was when lise gimpel was a girl shed grated cabbage by hand as often as not that had involved grating some fingertip or knuckle in with the cabbage her father an engineer had always found that funnythey werenthis fingertips or knuckles after all when she yelped he would say adds protein and puff on his pipe these days lise used a plastic rod to guide quartered chunks of cabbage into the maw of the food processor the push of a button a whir and the job was donenot even a tenth the time and never any need to reach for the mercurochrome but every time she did it she imagined she smelled pipe tobacco she bit her lip shed been pregnant with francesca when the damned drunk cut short her parents lives alicia had been only a toddler then she didnt remember her grandparents and theyd never got to know their other grandchildren sometimes life seemed dreadfully unfair lise laughed not that it was funnyas if a jew in the third reichshould look for fairness but somehow god seemed extra malicious in piling a personal disaster on top of the one shed been born with alicia came into the kitchen she liked to help cook so did roxane francesca didnt care one way or the other lise was glad to see her daughter hello sweetheart she said how did it go today talking with alicia would help ease her out of her gloom so she thought anyway till alicia blurted mommy do i have to be a jew i dont think i want to before lise answered she automatically looked around where are your sisters upstairs doing homework i finished mine all right good you have to be careful even saying that word lise put her hands on alicias shoulders nowwhy dont you what happened today that made you think you dont its not just today alicia answered its everything thats happened since i found out people just keep saying mean thingshorrible thingsabout jewsand everybodybelieves them its like theyre callingme names all the time oh my dear lise gave alicia a squeeze her daughters head already came up past her shoulder i remember that and i remember how much it hurt too they dont know any better thats all but if i werent a jew then it wouldnt matter any more alicia could be as painfully logical as her father though at ten she didnt always see as far as she needed to lise cocked her head to one side to make sure she didnt hear one of alicias sisters charging downstairs at the worst possible moment even after shed satisfied herself that they were busy she needed a few seconds to marshal her thoughts if you decide thats what you end up wanting pumpkin you can do it you can always pretend what we told you isnt real we said so remember alicia nodded i want to do that you can but i have to tell you it may not be quite so simple if you beat eggs together to scramble them can you separate the whites out again afterwards to make meringue of course not alicia said well you can always live as though youre not a jew pretend youre not a jew lise said but youll know even so youll have to know you cant very well forget can you i can try alicia screwed up her face lise could tell she was doing her best to pretend that that evening with the stutzmans and susanna had never happened lise could also tell by her daughters despairing expression that she was having no more luck than anyone else would have alicia pointed an accusing finger at her you and daddy didnt tell me anything about that no we didnt lise admitted we thought it would be pretty obviousand we didnt know you wouldnt want to be a jew i havent got much choice have i alicia asked bleakly you have a choice in the way you live lise picked her words with great care you havent got a choice about what youare not any more when you have children youll have a choice about telling them what they are why would i ever want to put anybody else through this alicia said were there any jews left in the reich who hadnt asked themselves that question at least once were there any who hadnt asked it a thousand times quietly lise answered because if you dont then the nazis win they say we dont deserve to live we dont deserve to be here at all and if you dont tell your children what they are who they are arent you saying you think the nazis were right all along werent they pain filled alicias voice if they thought jews were horrible ifeverybody thought jews were horrible if nobody tried to stop the ss from doing what it did maybe jewsmaybewe really were horrible maybe wedeserved what happened that was another thought that had probably crossed every surviving jews mind people saw themselves at least in part in the mirror their neighbors held up to them if the mirror showed a twisted image wouldnt they start to believe that was the way they really seemed how could they help it some people did try to stop the ss not enough though and most of them got killed but i dont think anybody deserves to be killed for what he is lise said you cant help that if youdo something bad enough maybe you deserve to die thats a whole different argument though for just trying to live and to get along as best you can she shook her head no sweetheart her daughter looked haunted that was fair enough too how many millions of ghosts crowded the germanic empire better maybe not to try to count them all that way lay despair alicia said i sure hope youre right so do ilise thoughtbut how can i know how can anybody know one thing she did know was that she had to conceal her doubts from her daughter she said of course i am what am i going to do alicia said more to herself than to lise but lise answered her with forced briskness what are you going to do since youve finished your homework and your sisters havent youre going to take a bath and make sure you rinse all the shampoo out of your hair and wash behind your ears sometimes you leave enough dirt to grow potatoes in potatoes alicia thought that was funny she was a child she couldnt stay gloomy for long she went up the stairs singing im my own vegetable garden lise envied her that ability to swing away from sadness so fasti used to be able to do that she thoughti wonder where it went wherever it went it was gone for good now she went to the cupboard and poured herself a glass of schnapps she hardly ever drank when she wasnt with other people who were drinking but today she made an exception when heinrich came through the door a few minutes later aliciawho hadnt yet started getting rid of the potatoesfrancesca and roxane all swarmed downstairs to give him hugs and kisses he needed a couple of minutes to wade through them and make his way into the kitchen he hugged lise and kissed her then noticed the glass of schnapps on the counter near the sink tough day he asked lise nodded her husband pointed to the glass must have been you dont usually do that what happened later lise nodded in the direction of the children oh heinrich nodded too he went to the cabinet for a glass of his own and also filled it full of schnapps well heres to us to us lise agreed they both drank their daughters wandered into the kitchen roxane wanted to help francesca wanted to tell her father about something that had happened at school lise couldnt tell what alicia wantedmaybe just to remind herself that they were a family alicia kept eyeing her little sisters with an expression that saidi know something you dont know by what shed said to lise a little while before she wished she didnt after a while the girls went back upstairs make sure you get clean lise reminded roxaneshed sometimes skip a bath if she saw the chance well heinrich asked lise sighed in a low weary voice she said alicia said she didnt want to be a jew she said maybe the einsatzkommandos knew what they were doing when they got rid of us oh oh hell heinrich reached for his glass of schnapps and gulped at it the laugh that burst from him was an ugly sound one that had nothing to do with mirth well god knows shes not the first one of us to feel that way i understand that lise said but still yes but still another swig and her husbands glass was empty he poured it down like that about as often as lise drank alone with another ugly laugh he said did i ever tell you i wanted to be an ss man when i was a little boy before i knew i mean no lise shook her head in astonishment theyd been married almost fifteen years but startling things still surfaced like rocks working their way up through thin soil no you never said a word about that well i did i thought the black uniform was the most wonderful thing in the world and of course this wasnt too long after we beat the united states so ss men were heroes in all the movies and televisor shows where wehrmacht men werent when my father told me i didnt want to believe him for a long time after thatalong time im telling youi thought we had it coming to us you never said anything about that never lise said instead of answering right away heinrich poured himself another glass of schnapps his back was to her as he said its not exactly something im proud of you know i think we all go through it lise said you sound like you had it worse than most of us though i probably did her husband shook his head still not looking at her no i certainly did even now there are days when working at oberkommando der wehrmacht seems like a poor second best and i ought to have the ss runes on my collar tabs could you have kept up the masquerade if you did lise asked some people do heinrich said and she nodded he sighed im gladmost of me is gladi didnt have to try though do you want me to talk with alicia is she all right maybe dont push it too hard right now lise said after a little thought you know how howoverwhelming it can be i think shell settle down she just realized shell alwaysknow what she is no matter what she decides to do about it ah yes heinrich said thats another moment we all have sure enough the curse of knowledge alicia thinks its a curse right now lise said i dont know what to do about it heinrich set about emptying that second glass of schnapps i wish i did but i dont think anybody whosin our boat does we ought to have the stutzmans over again lise said annas been coping with it for more than a year now maybe she can help aliciaand even if she cant they can play together and i was on the phone with esther this afternoon and she says susannas back from london with all sorts of wild stories sounds good to me heinrich said im going to have lunch with walther in the tiergarten tomorrow ill set something up then and you can call susanna all right lise nodded what does walther want to talk about she assumed he wanted to talk about something people met in berlins greatest park to get out in the open airand also to get away from the possibility of talking where microphones might overhear her husband answered with a shrug dont know yet ill find out fair enough lise said whats new at work not much were all waiting to see what sort of fuhrer heinz buckliger makes same as everybody else heinrich held up a hand wait i take it back there is one other interesting thing these past few days willis been very friendly with ilse for whatever that may be worth the secretary lise asked heinrich nodded her next question was obvious is she worth being friendly to well she doesnt do anything for me he answered of course im not willi and im not squabbling with my wife i hope im not anyway he leaned over and kissed her youd better not be lise said how does ilse compare to erika as far as looks go she doesnt heinrich said but shes not telling willi all the different kinds of fool he is every time he turns around either thats got to count for something wouldnt you think it would with me lise agreed but with a man who can say heinrich made a face at that but he didnt try to argue with her walther stutzman liked the tiergarten he enjoyed eating lunch there regardless of whether he needed to talk with someone in something approaching privacy if he brought a sandwich and some fruit and a vacuum flask of coffee to the large park west of the brandenburg gate he could imagine himself in the countryif the country in which he imagined himself included plenty of other people eating watching birds strolling hand in hand walking or running for exercise or lying around in the sun in any clothing or next to none the berlin police did frown on complete public nudity but more as a matter of excessive zeal than one of criminal intent and what might go on under cover of the bushesneither walther nor the police were in the habit of investigating too closely today he made a point of getting to the tiergarten early so he could stake out a bench before the noontime crowd made looking for one a hopeless chore the grass was long and green come fall a snorting harvester would mow it down and turn it into hay for animal fodder in the meantime it grew as it would he found a place to sit near the hubertus fountain and the bronze foxhunting group at the center of the park he smiled pleased with himself hed told heinrich to start looking for him by the fountain and here came his friend heinrichs gangly height and ungainly walk made him impossible to miss walther stood up and waved a couple of beats slower than he should have heinrich waved back and came toward him hello walther said nice day isnt it why so it is heinrich said in mild surprise as if hed only just realized it maybe he had there were times when walther wondered how much that went on outside his own head his friend noticed heinrich sat down beside himwas ist los you know about the kleins walther said oh yes heinrich nodded his long face set in unhappy lines i do know about that whats up with them i changed their genealogy to give them a couple of possibly jewish ancestors walther said heinrich nodded again with a sigh walther went on their pediatrician is too damned efficient though he compared the revised chart with one he had from when their first son was born and he noticed the changes he not only noticed he called in the genealogical authorities yes ive heard all this heinrich said esther told lise and lise told me its a mess one more thing for the kleinsand for all of usto worry about robert and maria are still free arent they that would be all we need if they hauled them in for questioningthat on top of the poor baby were probably lucky we havent seen more taysachs cases walther said so few of us left these days and we marry among ourselves so much but thats not what i wanted to talk about what then heinrich asked i made a mistake when i altered the kleins charts walther said anything that gets us noticed for any reason at all is a mistake the question is how do i fix it howcan you fix it its done heinrich said a very pretty blond girl in a short sun dress walked by leading a dachshund on a leash heinrich noticed herand the ridiculous little dog walther knew a certain amount of relief that some of the real world did impinge on his friend he said well thats what i wanted to ask you about i could go back into the reichs database again and change the kleins records back to the way they were before i meddled the first time or i could just leave them alone and hope the storm blows over which do you think is the better bet heinrichs eyes got a faraway expression walther wasnt the avid bridge player some of heinrichs goyishe friends were but hed sat down at the card table with him a few times he wore this look when he was figuring out whether to run a finesse he said if you leave things alone they may decide the system hiccuped or they may bring in the kleins to try to find out what they know thats how i see it walther agreed he wondered if heinrich even heard him his friend went on without even a pause for breath but if you change things a second time they may decide the system hiccuped once but now its back to normal or they may decide somebody who isnt supposed to has access to it and can fiddle with it whenever he pleases walther stutzman nodded again i see it like that too all right then heinrich said both ways if they think its a hiccup everything is fine so which is more likely and more dangerousthem questioning the kleins or them questioning the software in the database system with the kleins it goes from no jews in the woodpile to a few possible jews in the woodpile a long time ago on paper walther said the kleins were as jewish as the stutzmans or the gimpels he needed to make sure heinrich remembered that if they have a baby with taysachs disease thats a red flag about what they really are its a red flag but its not proof this diseasecan happen to gentiles too heinrich said if the genealogical authorities want to snoop theyre liable to find enough proof to satisfy them walther said and theres no law that says they cant question the kleinsand check the database programming heinrich looked astonished maybe hed been so caught up ineitheror that that hadnt occurred to him walther wished it hadnt occurred to him too unfortunately it was all too likely to occur to the authorities he said this isnt damned if i do or damned if i dont its liable to be damned if i doand damned if i dont im afraid youre right heinrich said im afraid im right too walther said and im afraid period youd better be afraid wed all better be afraid heinrich said somberly if were not afraid were dead i think our best chance is sitting tight now though theres nothing to show the kleins had any way to fiddle with the genealogical records is there hes a musician and shes a hausfrau they cant lean on them too hard not when the changes are so small he sounded as if he was trying to convince himself as well as walther theycan do anything they want walther said bluntly and his friend winced and nodded for that was undoubtedly true he went on what they choose to domay be a different story i hope youre right about that so you think we ought to wait and see what happens then dont you think thats our best bet heinrich asked walther stutzman sighed overall probably he said but its liable to be rough as hell on the kleins theyre already trying to deal with what their baby has if the genealogical authorities or the security police land on them toowell how much can one family take heinrich didnt answer walther hadnt expected him to no one could answer that question for himself till the time of testing came let alone for anyone else instead heinrich came back with a question of his own if you change the kleins records again dont you think the genealogical authorities and the security police are liable to land onyou how much can you take walther and that was the other side of the coin i dont know walther said heres hoping i dont have to find out and the kleins dont either thats interesting heinrich gimpel tapped his copy of the volkischer beobachter to show willi dorsch what was interesting willi shifted on the commutertrain seat beside heinrich which he said oh the story about the budget well what to you expect buckliger to say easy enough to promise to bring things under control doing it he shook his head dont hold your breath he sounds like he means it though heinrich read out loud for too long the greater german reich has balanced its budget only with the aid of tribute from other lands within the germanic empire if we are the greatest nation the world has known should we not be able to pay our own way hell with that willi said make the other bastards pay instead theyre the ones who lost you wait and see hes got it off his chest now the new fuhrer can talk tough but nothings going to change willi usually had good political sense heinrich reminded himself of that still he couldnt help adding hes going on about high labor costs too and how we need to be honestly competitive and not just dictate favorable exchange rates to the rest of the world we cant quite dictate to the japanese and look how their electronics have come on the past ten years are you going to tell me they stack up to zeiss willi snorted dont make me laugh a friend of mine works for zeiss and hes not laughing heinrich said youre rightwhat the japanese make isnt as good as our stuff but its good enough to work and its a lot cheaper for people who havent got a whole lot of reichsmarks to spend people who think like jews willi broke in heinrich shrugged joke all you please to willi it was just a joke too heinrich knew he should be used to gibes like that hewas used to them in the sense that his face didnt show what he thought but they still burned he went on no matter how you joke though plenty of people who cant afford our electronics can afford to buy from the japs willi twirled his finger in a gesture that had meantso what for the past two generations that hasnt really got much to do with the budget you know although heinrich didnt know any such thing he didnt argue hed been taught since childhood not to disagree too strongly with anyone instead he rustled the volkischer beobachter and changed the subject a little saying what do you make of this the fuhrer says as part of an ongoing effort to strengthen the state a thorough examination of its political underpinnings must also be undertaken whats that mean what where does he say that willi opened up his own copy of the paper again have to tell you i missed it page four third column about halfway down page four when willi finally found it he shook his head he couldnt have buried it any deeper in a graveyard could he he rubbed his chin and frowned i have to admit i dont know exactly what that means i bet nobody else does either except maybe buckliger it might just be the sort of stuff politicians use to pad out a speech but he was still frowning you wouldnt put padding there thoughnot usually he wanted to say it and he wanted to say it where not many people would notice hed said it i sure didnt you notice everything dont you me only thing i notice is were coming into the berlin station heinrich folded his newspaper and stuck it in his briefcase easier to carry just one thing when they hurried up the escalators to the level where they caught the bus to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters willi did the same a threecar accident snarled traffic to a faretheewell ambulances police vehicles and rubberneckers meant nothing could get through at a busy intersection the police were slower setting up detours than they should have been too everyone in the bus grumbled and complained that did no one any good heinrich and willi got to work half an hour late the guards at the entrance clucked sympathetically as the two of them hurried up the steps came from south station didnt you one guard said when heinrich held out his identity card things are buggered up good and proper between there and here dont i know it heinrich said i thought id be on that damned bus forever the card went through the reader the light flashed green the guard returned the card and waved him through willi joined him a moment later at least were not the only ones he said misery loves company misery doesnt love anything heinrich said thats what makes it misery jawohl herr doktor professor willi came to attention and saluted thank you so much for clearing that up for me when we work in the same room i cant even tell you to go away heinrich said sadly they navigated the maze of corridors to get to the room they shared with several other budget analysts secretaries and clerks willi promptly disappeared from his desk heinrich knew he was heading to the canteen for coffee and didnt think anything of it willi came back with two foam cups he kept one and with a flourish handed the other to the secretary he and heinrich shared ilse stammered out thanks simpering like a starstruck teenager willi preened heinrich fought not to gag he had plenty to keep him busy he always did his fingers flashed across the keys of his adding machine the number and function keys had grown smooth and shiny from long use some of the more senior men in the department were getting new adding machines half as big and half as noisy as the old ones the new machines came from japan heinrich wondered if willi knew as for himself he didnt want to give up the one hed used for so long in a lot of ways he was intensely conservative change made him suspicious it might lead to exposure as long as things went on as they had up till now his family and he stayed safe the phone on willis desk rang heinrich noticed it only peripherally he was trying to unravel by exactly how much the americans were pretending to be poorer than they really were he might not have noticed the phone on his own desk the americans used numbers the way a cuttlefish used ink to obscure to conceal to confuse figuring out what lay behind their smokescreen took not only patience but imagination but in spite of his best effort to focus on the columns of numbers in front of him willis loud angry voice eventually pierced his concentration dammit erika dont call me here for crap like that i havent got time to worry about it and i sure as hell havent got time to deal with it heinrich looked up he couldnt help himself he saw he wasnt the only one nor of course was willi the only one whod ever had his personal life intrude on work but he was the one with problems at the moment which meant he was the one everybody else was pretending not to listen to now that he was one of the more flamboyant men in the office only made his troubles more fascinating erika said something heinrich couldnt make out what it was but she sounded angry too he wouldnt have wanted to talk to her the way willi just had whatever she said it struck a nerve willi went red from the base of his neck all the way up to his forehead and ears thats a lie too he growled im just being friendly you wouldnt know about friendly would you someone must have told erika about ilseor maybe willi was being friendly or more than friendly with some woman heinrich knew nothing about he looked back to the numbers the americans had submitted to the reich before he could do anything but look erika said something else me willi exclaimed meyouve got your nerve what about you and he didnt go on instead he slammed the receiver into its cradle hard enough to start a young earthquake had be been about to saywhat about you and heinrich erika hadnt been subtle shed done everything but send up a flare in fact up till now willi hadnt paid much attentionor so it seemed but maybe he could see what was right under his nose after all or then again maybe he couldnt his color faded as quickly as it had risen he managed a smile of sorts as he swung his swivel chair toward heinrich women are strange creaturesyou know that he might have been imparting some great philosophical truth we cant live with them and we cant live without them either fourteen placid happy years of marriage with lise looked better and better to heinrich i hope everything turns out all right for you he said so do i willi said sometimes though what can you do he sounded as happygolucky as usual he meantyou cant do anythingthings will either work out or else they wont if heinrichs marriage were in trouble when he wanted to keep it going he would have tried everything under the sunand looked in the dark too in case it was hiding something the sun didnt show did that mean willi didnt want to keep his marriage going or did it mean he didnt want to try heinrich didnt know he couldnt tell he wondered if willi knew when lunchtime came heinrich said shall we go to admiral yamamotos willi nodded why not we havent been there since the day old haldweim kicked the bucket uh right true the old fuhrer was dead even so heinrich couldnt have made himself talk about the ruler of the germanic empire so casuallyso callously even willi confident in his perfect aryanness could be more expansiveor maybe he doesnt think about it at all maybe he just says the first thing that comes out of his mouth heinrich found that hard to imagine let alone believe but willi was a law unto himself he had been for as long as heinrich had known him and no doubt for years before that sitting in the japanese restaurant eating berlin rolls and sashimi and rice and washing them down with a seidel of beer german beer not japanesejapanese electronics were fine but japanese beer couldnt measure up to the reinheitsgebot the medieval purity law and was barred from the greater german reich heinrich tried not to worry about anything except the havoc the wasabi was playing with his sinuses but admiral yamamotos got customers from a lot of ministries and the ss men at the next table were too loud to ignore did you read the volkischer beobachter this morning one of them demanded of his pals didyou can ss men read willi saidin heinrichs opinion not nearly quietly enough i saw it all right another blackshirta bruiseranswered that goddamn son of a bitch takes one to know one willi saidagain much too loud ohwilli heinrich murmured the other table held five ss men if they got mad it wouldnt even be a brawl it would be a slaughter but getting willi to pay attentionwas like getting him not to lead away from kings you could wish and much good wishing would do you then the first ss man a sturmbannfuhrer said hes going to bring it in by the back door you wait and see if he doesnt before willi could make yet another rude commentand heinrich knew just what sort of rude comment he would make about thatthe bruiser nodded and said bet your ass he is a thorough examination of its political underpinnings he made a loud retching noise and willi dorsch canny political creature that he was suddenly became quiet as a mouse if he could have wiggled his ears he would have swung them toward the table full of ss men heinrich felt the same way the blackshirts werent talking about just any goddamn son of a bitch they were talking about heinz buckliger newly chosen fuhrer and the most powerful man on the planet sure as hell well hear more crap about the first edition another ss man predicted gloomily if wed hadour way wedve knocked that stinking nonsense over the head once and for all thats about the size of it the sturmbannfuhrer the most senior man at the tableagreed but the wehrmacht wouldnt play ball with us and so we got stuck with this asshole a fragment of latin went through heinrichs headquis custodiet ipsos custodes whowould watch the watchmen the ss was and always had been a law unto itself maybe between them the rest of the party and the wehrmacht could keep it in check and by all the signs the ss itself had split on a candidate to replace kurt haldweim that seemed promising if no one else could maybe some of the watchmen would keep an eye on the rest hes young too the bruiser sounded depressed at the prospect well maybe but the sturmbannfuhrer broke off whathad he been about to saymaybe he wont live to get old no that wasnt the sort of thing to blurt out in a crowded restaurant had heinrich wanted to say it he couldnt imagine anyone but lise whom he trusted enough to hear it even as things were the blackshirts had run their mouths far more than he thought wise he looked at his watch getting on towards one oclock he said wed better head back to the office willi looked at him as if hed lost his mind or possibly started speaking chinese he wanted to hang around and listen to the ss men that was exactly why heinrich wanted to leave he kicked his friend in the ankle under the table reluctantly willi left his chair heinrich paid the bill they left the restaurant together once out on the sidewalk willi practically exploded with excitement did you hear them he demanded did youhear them practically talking treason right there in admiral yamamotos dont be silly how can ss men talk treason heinrich said what they want is what the state wants and if you dont believe me just ask them ha willi said i didnt know you were such a funny fellow i wasnt joking i know that only makes it funnier but you have to look at it the right way to see it willi walked along for a while whistling a tune from the new show about a theater owner who wanted an excuse to close down his firetrap of a house booked a dreadful play about the evil machinations of churchill and stalin and found to his horror that it was bad enough to become a comedy smash the show itself was a comedy smash in berlin too and had already spawned several companies touring the rest of the reich after a block or so willi stopped whistlinga mercy because he was flat he said well i hate to admit it but you were right about what getting out of yamamotos you bet i was no no no willi impatiently shook his head about that piece in the beobachter this morning if those bastards dont like it theres got to be more to it than i thought buckliger does need to take a good long look at our underpinnings after all a girl with nice legs came toward them willi said not a word about her underpinnings heinrich knew then that his friend was serious after a few more steps willi added you may have been right about something else too what twice in one day heinrich said such compliments you pay me ive caught up with a stopped clock no you havent because this other one was a while ago willi waited to make sure heinrich was suitably chastened then went on if our lovely luncheon companions dont care for the first edition its probably got something going for it too you never said anything like that before heinrich didnt try to hide his surprise thats because i thought it was a load of garbage before willi answered but if those schweinehunde think the same thingthen theyre wrong and that means i must be wrong too heinrich made as if to feel his forehead you must be feverish is what you must be saying im right saying youre wrong delirium if you ask me get away from me willi sidestepped to escape heinrich and almost bumped into a man wearing the light blue of a luftwaffe official they made mutual apologies the luftwaffe man kept going up the street towards admiral yamamotos willi looked back over his shoulder iam in a state i cant help wondering if that fellows on his way to plot with the thugs in black shirts that hadnt even occurred to heinrich if you see plotters behind every potted plant theyre going to put you in a rubber room you know not if the plotters are really there willi said was hitler wrong when he said everybody ganged up on germany after the first world war no because everybody really did you only get in trouble when you see things that arent there right heinrich knew when arguing with willi was more trouble than it was worth this looked to be one of those times when they got back to oberkommando der wehrmacht ilse came up to them and said excuse me willi but you got another call from your wife she rolled her eyes to show what she thought of that the secretary was supposed to call willi herr dorsch that she didnt made heinrich gimpel want to roll his eyes she did address willi as sie rather than using the intimatedu but she sounded as if she were usingdu even when she wasnt what did erika want willi asked do i want to know ilse pouted willis eyes lit up the berlin rolls roiled in heinrichs stomach ilse said she wouldnt leave a messagejust told me to tell you to call her back and she said she wondered why i was there when you werent that wasnt very nice scowling willi said ill call her i dont know what ill call her but ill call her ilse thought that was very funny heinrich retreated to his desk hed never seen financial statements look so alluring but however much the numbers beckoned he couldnt avoid hearing willis side of the conversationif a shouting match could be dignified by the term the longer it went on the louder and angrier willi got at last he slammed down the phonescheisse he muttered heinrich felt like saying the same thing if willi and erika were fighting shed be looking for a shoulder to cry on and the first shoulder she was likely to look for was his his shoulder wouldnt be the only thing she was looking for either he stared up to the heavensor at least to the sounddeadening tiles and fluorescent panels of the ceiling what redblooded man wouldnt want a beautiful blonde in hot pursuit of him heinrich didnt and he had one most of the men who would have liked nothing better had to do without if that wasnt unfair he couldnt imagine what would be guten morgendr dambach esther stutzman called as she walked into the pediatricians office guten morgen frau stutzman dambachs voice floated out from the back how are you today im fine thanks how are you esther answered he didnt ask her to help him set the coffeemaker to rights which had to mean he hadnt tried messing with it before she got there she took a look sure enough it wasnt even plugged in she loaded it with water and ground coffee and put in a filter im making coffee dr dambach she called would you like some when its ready ja bittehe said somehow you always get it just right im glad you like it she said in lieu of calling him a thumbfingered idiot he wasnt an idiot and she knew it he was a very sharp man she could wish he were less so but whenever he got near a coffeemaker thumbfingered he definitely was before long she brought him a steaming foam cup here you are doctor danke schondambach sipped yes thats very good and you know just how much sugar i take too i should by now esther lingered for a moment wondering if he felt like making small talk sometimes he did more often he didnt when he picked up the coffee cup again she slipped back to her station and looked at the mornings appointments when she saw paul kleins name on the list she grimaced if only shed thought to look in eduards chart she tried not to think about that as she checked the computer to see whose bills were overdue she printed out polite dunning letters for those whose first notice this was sterner ones for people getting a second reminder and letters threatening legal action for two dedicated deadbeats she happened to know dr dambach had never sued anybody but with a little luck the people who hadnt paid him wouldnt she took the letters in to him for his signature she could have made the squiggle that passed for that signature at least as well herself but that wasnt how things were done oh the schmidts dambach muttered when he came to one of the strongest letters i just heard they bought themselves a new mercedesand they paid cash oh dear esther said maybe you really ought to talk to your lawyer then the pediatrician shook his head i dont want to have anything to do with the courts not if i can help it whether youre right or youre wrong you go into court a pig and you come out a sausage id rather do without the fee but seeing the schmidts spend their money on everything but their bills does sometimes tempt me to prescribe ipecac for their brat esther laughed she knew he was even less likely to do something like that than he was to sue take his anger out on a child impossible unthinkable but what if he found out a child he treated was a jew she had no doubt he would call the authorities and never lose a moments sleep afterwards worrying about what happened to it or to its family he was conscientious lawabidinga good german she took the signed letters and made envelopes for them the stamps she used were blackandwhite mourning issues for kurt haldweim as she put them on one by one she wondered about the folk among whom she livedsomething else shed done many times before germans were the sort of people who would stay on the path and off the grass in a park even if someone was shooting a machine gun at them and yeta lot of the jews surviving in berlin were there because germans had helped their parents or grandparents get false papers during the war without the right papers life in the reich had been impossible even so long ago theyd been easier to get then when enemy bombs sent records up in smoke and replacements were issued without many awkward questions more than a few friends and neighbors had vouched for jews and some of them discovered had paid for their kindness with years in prison or with life itself and some jews in nazi hands had kept themselves alivefor a whileby going out onto the streets of berlin and capturing other jews still free set them in the scales against the brave germans and it taught youwhat esther sighed only what anyone with a gram of sense already knew that there were good jews and bad jews in proportions not much different from those of any other folk the door to the outer office opened esther looked at the clock in surprise was it nine already it really was in came a squat heavyset woman with jowls and protruding eyes she looked like nothing so much as a bulldog and her sevenyearold daughter poor thing might have been her in miniature good morningfrau bauriedl esther said and how is wilhelmina today well thats what i want the doctor to seefrau bauriedl answered she brought wilhelmina in every couple of weeks regardless of whether anything was really wrong with the little girl dr dambach tried to discourage her but he hadnt had much luck she did pay her bills on time neither esther nor any of the other receptionists had ever had to send her even the most polite letter the telephone rang excuse me esther said glad for an excuse not to have to talk to frau bauriedl she picked up the handset dr dambachs office frau stutzman the woman on the other end of the line waited for esther to agree that she was herself then went on this is maria kleinfrau stutzman imim afraid im going to have to cancel pauls appointment this morning you see we are under investigation for somethingsomething of which we are certainly not guilty goodbye she hung up she hadnt let on that she knew esther in any way except as the pediatricians receptionist there in the warm bright sterile calm of dambachs office esther shivered as if caught in a lapland blizzard was maximilian ebert or some other hardfaced nazi in the uniform of the reichs genealogical office or the security police standing next to maria listening to every word she said and how she said it or was she just afraid her line was tapped under investigation how long had it been since the germans caught a jew in berlin it must have been some time not long after esther found out she was one there had been a great hue and cry then how much more strident would it be now when the whole reich was thought to be judenfrei for years and if the kleins were found guilty of such a heinous crime what else would the investigators be able to tear out of them when esther got to her feet her legs didnt want to hold her up she held on to the top of the desk for a moment till she steadied she made the trip back to dr dambachs personal office more by main force of will than any other way he looked up from a medical journal a question on his face that telephone call was from frau klein esther said carefully she had to watch every word too in case her turn came up next she wont be bringing paul in this morning after all no dambach said have she and her husband decided to take him to the reichs mercy center then its the only sensible thing to do im afraid was it for someone old and in torment from say cancer it might be for a baby but on the other hand for a baby doomed to a lingering horrible certain death esther just didnt know that was beside the point now though shaking her head she answered no because she and her husband areunder investigation she said are they dr dambach didnt need to ask why they were being investigated he was the one to whom the possibility had first occurred well im sure the authorities will get to the bottom of it if they do turn out to be jews who could have imagined such a thing in berlin in the twentyfirst century yes who esther hoped she matched his tone feeling spiteful she added and frau bauriedl is here with wilhelmina is she the pediatrician scowled its a shame the powers that be arent investigating her the kleins have always seemed like nice people but appearances can be deceiving if theyre jews he shook his head we certainly cant let that sort of thing go on can we before esther had to come up with a response to that the telephone rang again excuse me doctor she said and hurried out to answer it a worried mother had a threeyearold who was throwing up esther fit her into the slot the kleins had vacated even that made her want to cry the worst of it was she didnt dare call people to warn them if the kleins were under suspicion she and walther might be too her warnings could turn into betrayals she wouldnt risk that even if she called to say she would be dropping by to pass on some newseven that might be too much she had to assume she was being watched being listened to maybe she wasnt she hopedshe prayedshe wasnt but she couldnt take the chance she had to act as if she were and whats the use of praying to a god who has made us fair game all over the world for a lifetime that question and others of the same sort floated to the surface like rotting corpses whenever times turned black only one answer had ever occurred to esther she fell back on it nowif i dont believe if i turn my back and walk away then arent i saying the nazis were right all along and we shouldnt go on usually that was enough to keep her on her course she could be very stubborn a jew who wasnt stubborn these days didnt stay a jew when times got uncommonly black though she couldnt help wonderingdid i stay on course for so longfor this if god couldnt forgive her for wonderingtoo bad for himshe thought come right infrau bauriedl wilhelmina she said im sure dr dambach will be so glad to see you again if dambach couldnt forgive her for lyingtoo bad for him a woman brought in a wailing toddler who was tugging at his ear she looked harried i hope the doctor can see me soon she said rudolf started this at ten last night and hes been going ever since my husband and i havent had much sleep theres only one patient in front of youfrau stransky esther said im sure it wont be too long would you like some coffee while youre waiting oh please frau stransky said as if esther had offered her the holy grail esther gave her a cup by the way she gulped it down she wished she had an intravenous caffeine drip hooked up instead esther had had mornings like that too even if her children hadnt had to go through many earaches more women came in with children in tow in the examination roomfrau bauriedl droned on and on about wilhelminas imaginary afflictions the only thing really wrong with wilhelmina was that she looked like her mother at last after too long dr dambach must have got a little more abrupt than he was in the habit of doing frau bauriedls tones grew shriller and more indignant the nerve she said as she swept her daughter past esther i think well see someone else the next time shed made that threat before esther wished she would do it but she hadnt yet whenever the door to the waiting room opened esther had to fight against a flinch would it be someone in the somber uniform of the security police whenever the phone rang her hand wanted to shake as she reached for it would someone be warning her of a new disaster if the security police had operatives in dr dambachs office they were disguised as worried mothersone of the most effective disguises esther could imagine and also one of the most unnecessary all the phone calls featured more worried mothers except one that one had a worried father a cartoonist who worked out of his house ja herr wasserstein you can bring luther in at half past two this afternoon esther told him as soon as irma came in during the lunch hour esther left she had one more anxious moment walking out of the building would they bundle her into a car and take her away to god only knew where they didnt she walked to the bus stop no one bothered her at all but the fear didnt go away it never would susanna weiss had lived in fear ever since she was ten years old fear made her angry it always had shed been living with rage since she was ten too most of the time she lived with it by making everyone around her live with it that had made her more respectedand certainly more fearedthan any of the other handful of female professors in the department of germanic languages dont mess with herits more trouble than its worth was the watchword these days at friedrich wilhelm university not just in the department but also in the administration some things though were too big and too strong to fight jews didntcouldntfight the apparatus of the nazi party that was as much an article of faith these days as hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one the reich bestrode the world like a colossus and we petty jews walk under its huge legs and peep about to escape our dishonorable graves susanna knew that was a misquotation no matter how true it was shakespeare these days was more vitally alive in germany than in his native land a series of splendid nineteenthcentury translations left his words much closer to modern german than his original language was to modern english which made him easier for people here to follow if the reichs genealogical office was going to start asking questions of the kleinsher heart turned to a lump of ice within her she couldnt help it any more than a bird was supposed to be able to keep from letting a snake mesmerize it do you want to talk here she asked esther stutzman or would you rather go over to the tiergarten its only a couple of blocks her apartment was small and cramped and full of books and even closer to the university than to the park it ate up an inordinately large chunk of her salary but she couldnt think of anything on which she would rather have spent her money esther set a teacup down on a table crowded with illinformed essays on the canterbury tales well that depends she said carefully and waited it depends on whether you think someone has planted a microphone here that was what she meant all right susanna looked around the place she had books in german and english and dutch and all the scandinavian languages including old icelandic paintings and prints filled the wall space bookshelves didnt an alarmingly authentic reproduction of the helmet from the sutton hoo ship stared from an end table she was not the neatest of housekeepers if the security police had sneaked in to bug the place she would never know it till too late why dont we walk she said the park is very nice in the afternoon then lets go esther got to her feet and the tiergartenwas very nice in the afternoon too the sun was bright and warm sparrows hopped here and there trying to steal bread crumbs from the pigeons that pensioners fedgermans are a strange folk susanna thoughttheyre very kind to animals they save their savagery for people where it really counts all right she said tell me how this happened esther did flaying herself in the process to make matters worse she had to flay herself in a bright cheerful voice so people walking or cycling past wouldnt wonder what the two women were talking about so intently if only id found eduard kleins old genealogy chart none of this would have happened she said a wide false smile on her face but i didnt think to look and so the kleinshave a problem she could say that safely enough anyone might have a problem the problemsgoyimhave arent so likely to be fatal susanna bit her lip the kleins would have had a fatal problem even if esther had purloined the chart susanna had never heard of taysachs disease till a few weeks before but that kind of problem didnt care whether youd heard of it it came right in introduced itself and settled down to stay too late to fret about it now she told esther its done well go on easy for you to say esther replied you didnt do it you dont wake up in the middle of the night wishing you had it to do over again susanna shrugged if it goes wrong it goes wrong for me too if they squeeze the kleins tight enough to get them to name you and walther do you think they wont name me they walked past a fountain esther said i want to jump in and drown myself dont be foolish if youre foolish youre liable to give yourself away susanna paused to think fighting her way up through the maledominated hierarchies at friedrich wilhelm university had taught her one thing the system was there to be manipulated if only you could find the lever she thought she saw one here you say maria told you they were being investigated thats right esther nodded miserably and she was at home susanna persisted yes esther nodded again then they arent sure they cant be sure susanna said if they were sure theyd haul her and her husbandand eduard too damn themoff to the genealogical office or to the closest police headquarters and go to work on them thank god eduards too little to know what he is esther remained distraught who says they wont nobody says they wont but if they werereally suspicious they would have done it already susanna said that means theyre trying to panic people into doing something foolish so they get more to work with theyre doing a pretty good job too esther exclaimed but susanna shook her head as it did with her fear began to give way to anger not yet not if the kleins can sit tight and keep saying we have no idea how any of this happened they ought to find a lawyer too a big noisy one as if a lawyer will do them any good esther said what lawyer in his right mind would want anything to do with somebody who might have jewish blood the first case he lost hed go to the camp along with his clients youd think so wouldnt you but youd be wrong there are lawyers who deal with mischlingsrechts susanna said one of the games they play in the party is accusing somebody they dont like of having jewish blood most of the time its a big fat lie which is why the attorneys who specialize in mixedblood lawdont go to camps it happened at the university a few years ago too which is how i happen to know about it she made a face as if shed smelled something foul you wouldnt believe how nasty academic politics can get after all the horror stories youve told maybe i would esther said susanna had her doubts her friend was simply too nice to imagine the depths to which people could sink and if that wasnt an aid to survival in the greater german reich susanna didnt know what would be she said they ought to threaten to sue too behind her glasses esthers eyes got big sue the government theyd get shot for even thinking about it susanna shook her head again no theyd just lose or have their suit quashed before it ever came to trial but if they talk big if they hit back hard people will think they must be innocent because nobody whos guilty acts like that there was or had been a saying in englishthe hun is either at your throat or at your feet that was how it went it held some truth too germans who thought they had the whip hand acted like it and those who didnt groveled esther was a quiet and quietly orderly person herself susanna wasnt and never had been she hit back whenever she could sometimes in small ways sometimes not up till now shed never had the chance to hit back at the reich itself shed imagined itwhat jew didnt but dreams of vengeance remained only dreams she wasnt crazy she knew theyd never be anything else still even the prospect of tying the system up in knots looked good to her do you really think i ought to tell this to the kleins esther asked doubtfully wont it just land them in worse trouble susanna looked around nobody was particularly close to the two of them no one was paying them any special heed either she could speak freely or as freely as anyone could ever speak in the greater german reich theyre under suspicion of being jews she said how can they get in worse trouble than that to her surprise esther actually thought it over maybe if they were homosexual gypsiesbut then they wouldnt have a baby would they no susanna fought laughter though it was only blackly funny the reich had been at least as thorough about getting rid of gypsies as it had with jews she didnt know whether any survived if so they too were in hiding as for homosexuals the few high up in the party hierarchy and those who traveled in certain circles of the ss did as they pleased others still faced savage persecution unlike jews and gypsies they couldnt be rooted out all at once for they kept springing up like new weeds every year if nothing else they gave the authorities something to do weve come all the way to the zoo esther said in amazement shall we go in and look at the animals no susanna startled even herself with the force of her reaction she had to stop and think to figure out why she felt the way she did i dont want to look at lions and elephants and ostriches in cages not when im in a cage myself oh esther thought that over too after a little while she said but people like the animals berliners have always liked animals as if to prove her point a man perhaps old enough to have served in the second world war sat on a park bench scattering tornup bits of bread for birds and squirrels youre right but i dont care susanna stuck out her chin and looked stubborn that was the expression herr doktor professor oppenhoff had come to dread theyre still trapped in there and i dont want anything to do with them esther didnt argue shed known susanna long enough to know how impractical arguing with her could be she just shrugged and said in that case lets head back to your apartment all right susanna was glad enough to turn around she sighed i never thought id wish i were living in england why would you esther asked over there they have their own people watching them and they have us too but they have a party thats serious about turning over a new leaf susanna answered we dont oh people say the new fuhrer will be something different but ill believe it when i see it i hope its true esther said maybe itll mean easier times foreverybody she chose the innocuous word because a man in a brown party uniform came past them he looked intent on his own business but susanna would have used an innocuous word anyplace where he could hear too easier times susanna said wistfully ill believe that when i see it too especially with whats going on now she wished she hadnt said that as soon as she did esther looked on the point of tears susanna often talked first and worried about consequences later when she was younger shed thought she would outgrow it but it seemed to be a part of her sometimes that landed her in trouble sometimes it proved very valuable every so often it managed both at once she knew she had to repair the damage here and did her best one way or another everything will turn out all right i hope so esther said but im sure i dont see how as long as we act the way any other citizens of the reich would if their rights were being violated i think well do all right susanna said if we were any other citizens of the reich our rights wouldnt be violated esther said not like this anyhow not like this no susanna admitted but they still would be thats what the reich is all about the government can do whatever it wants and everybody else has to hold still for it but people dont germans dont anyway if it bumps up against them they bump back or they get bumped off esther said susanna wished she hadnt put it like that not because she was wrong but because she was rightor they get bumped off that had always been the reich s answer for everythingand judging by the past seventy years a very effective answer it was too vi heinrich gimpel kissed lise grabbed his attache case and headed out the door it was a fine bright summer morning the sun already high in the sky the orbiting weather platforms predicted that this heat wave would last for the rest of the week a heat wave in berlin would have been nothing in algiers or even in rome but it was better than the week of rain and mist that could come even in the middle of july volkswagens and the occasional mercedes zoomed past heinrich as he stood at the corner and waited for the commuter bus hed never seen much point to owning a motorcar to him they were just swank and more expensive than they were worth with the buses and trains you could get anywhere you needed to go as if to prove as much the commuter bus pulled up a minute later he got on fed his account card into the slot reclaimed it and found a seat a few stops later willi dorsch got on too he plopped himself down beside heinrich with a gruntedguten morgen guten morgenheinrich saidwie gehts well ill tell you it could be better willi answered hows it going with you im doing all right heinrich couldnt tell willi how worried he was about the kleins that would have required too much in the way of explanation but he could sound sympathetic when he asked what now unlike him willi wasnt inclined to suffer in silence when willi felt wronged the whole world heard about it and so all the way to the train station heinrich got a blowbyblow account of his friends latest tiff with his wife whod said what whod thrown what and how willi had had to sleep on the sofa in the front room why is it willi asked that when you have a row with your woman youre always the one who sleeps on the couch she stays in bed and she stays comfortable my back is killing me i dont know i never really thought about it heinrich said except when lise was in the hospital after giving birth to one of their girls the two of them had never slept apart i never thought about it either not till this morning willi said erika acts like its a law of natureshe isnt happy so i have to go somewhere else you call that fair do you the bus came up to stahnsdorfs train station just then heinrich didnt need to answer which was probably just as well as far as he could remember hed never heard of a woman sleeping on the sofa while a man stayed in bed it didnt seem fair it wasnt anything hed ever had to worry about himself but it didnt in the station he put fifteen pfennigs into a vending machine and pulled out a copy of the volkischer beobachter even in buying a newspaper he fed the partys coffers were he the good german he pretended to be he supposed that would have made him feel proud or at least patriotic as things were it left him mildlyperhaps a little more than mildlyirked he couldnt even find out what was going on in the world without helping to finance his own destruction willi put coins in the machine and got a paper too along with the other people whod ridden the bus to the station they went to the platform to wait for the train to downtown berlin heinrich glanced at his watch they wouldnt have to wait long when the train pulled up a very few minutes later the commuters fed their account cards into the slot one after another willi was in front of heinrich in the queue he sat down by a window and thumped the seat next to him to show heinrich was welcome they both started reading the papers buckligers going to talk to a bunch of big shots in nuremberg tomorrow heinrich remarked i wonder what hell have to say whatever the bonzen want to hear willi predicted what other point is there in going to nuremberg he spoke with a berliners cynicism and a berliners certainty that no other place in the reich really mattered maybe heinrich said but maybe not too he didnt say what everybody expected him to the last time you know he waited to see what willi would make of that willi started to tell him he didnt know what he was talking aboutstarted to and then very visibly stopped thats true his friend said he didnt but why would you go to nuremberg to say anything thats out of the ordinary out of the ordinary isnt what nuremberg is for who knows heinrich shrugged if were confused after he makes his speech horst will tell us what to think about it well of course he will willi dorsch said with no irony heinrich could hear telling us what to think is what horst witzleben is for hes good at it too heinrich said not much point to having a propaganda ministry where the people arent good at what they do is there willi said oh i dont know look at the croats heinrich said the croatian ustasha did their jobs with an enthusiasm even the gestapo found frightening the german secret police weremostlyprofessionals the croats were zealots and proud of being zealots but willi shook his head they want to show how frightful they are and so they do the national sport down there is hunting serbs and if the serbs had been on the winning side their national sport would have been hunting croats and do you know what else they would have bragged about it too tell me im wrong he waited heinrich thought it over i cant he said not when youre right to his surprise willi looked angry youd be more fun to argue with if you didnt admit you were wrong when youre wrong he complained with mock severity no i wouldnt heinrich answered yes you willi broke off and sent him a reproachful stare oh no you dont youre a devil is what you are danke schon i do appreciate that you would willi said they both laughed the train pulled into the berlin station everything seemed the way it had in happier less nervous times then willi asked when are we going to play some more bridge its been too long airraid sirens started howling inside heinrichs head he couldnt show them though any more than he could show so much of what he felt he couldnt even show this particular alarm in front of lise hed dug that trap for himself and now hed fallen into it knowing he had he said why dont you and erika come over friday of next week after work sounds good willi said did it heinrich was anything but sure he did thinkhe certainly hopederika was less likely to say or do anything drastic at his house than at hers if he turned out to be wrongif i turn out to be wrong lise will clout me one and ill deserve it still next to some of the other things that could happen even a clout from his wife didnt seem too bad then he had no more time for such worries he stuffed the volkischer beobachter into his briefcase and performed the elaborate dance that took him from the downstairs train platform to the upstairs bus queue as with any dance if you had to think about what you were doing you didnt do it so well willi matched his movements as smoothly as one ballerina in an ensemble conforming to another their reward for such a performance was not an ovation but standing room on the bus that would take them to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters someone on the bus hadnt seen soap anywhere near recently enough heinrich took in small shallow sips of air which might have helped a little then willi muttered who brought along his polecat you couldnt take small shallow sips of air when you were laughing like a loon once they got to the office heinrich phoned home and let lise know about the invitation he was a welltrained husband that sounds like fun she said which proved she didnt know everything that was going on heinrich couldnt tell her either and not just because willis desk was only a couple of meters away willi for that matter might not have heard a word he said willi was busy flirting with ilse by the way she laughed and teased him back his plot was thickening nicely shall we go out to lunch he asked her why not she said heinrich could have thought of any number of reasons why not but nobodyd asked him he went to lunch at the canteen by himself the meatloaf was grayish with slices of what he hoped was hardcooked egg scattered through it he made the mistake of wondering what sort of meat had gone into the loaf then he wondered why he was eating it if he couldnt tell a couple of tables over an officer looked at lunch and said they dont waste anything at those camps do they after that heinrich finished the boiled beans that came on the side but he didnt touch the meatloaf again he was sure the officer had to be joking he was sure but still willi and ilse were a long time coming back from lunch heinrich wondered what they were eating then hastily he wondered where they were eating that seemed safer he eyed them when at last they did come back willi didnt look particularly smug ilse didnt look rumpled that proved nothing one way or the other heinrich knew as much he eyed them anyhow curiositynosiness to be less polite about itwouldnt leave him alone would willi brag on the way back to stahnsdorf the answer turned out to be no if there was anything to brag about willi concealed it instead he went on and on about the havoc he intended to wreak at the bridge table in your dreams heinrich said sweetly sometimes dreams are better than the way things really work out willi said sometimes and that oracular in its ambiguity was as close as he came to saying anything about whatever he had or hadnt done with ilseor perhaps about the way things had gone for him and erika heinrich thought about asking him to explain thought about it and then lost his nerve the next days volkischer beobachter said not a word about the new fuhrer s speech in nuremberg neither did the paper from the day after that had buckliger made it if he had what had he said the beobachter the chief party newspaper wasnt talking nor was anyone else no one heinrich knew anyhow he scratched his head wondering what the devil that meant alicia gimpel had been helping her younger sisters with their homework ever since francesca started going to school why not she was bright she remembered her lessons and shed had them only a couple of years before sometimes she got impatient when the younger girls didnt catch on right away that had made francesca angry more than once now francesca helped roxane tooand sometimes got impatient when she didnt catch on right away for reasons alicia couldnt quite follow her father and mother thought that was funny though theyd yelled at her when she showed impatience she was slogging her way through reducing a page of fractions to lowest terms when francesca came into her bedroom and said im stuck with what alicia was sick of fractions and the one she was about to tackledidnt look as if it would ever turn into anything reasonable whatever francesca was working on had to be more interesting than arithmetic im supposed to write a poem about jews and i cant think of anything that rhymes francesca said anxiously how long does it have to be alicia askedthe automatic first question when confronting schoolwork eight lines by the way francesca said it her teacher was expecting her to turn in both parts of faust tomorrow morning what have you done so far alicia asked sometimes her sister got brain cramps and wanted her to do all the work instead of just helping she didnt like that but francesca had a beginning jews are nasty jews are badthey hurt aryans and make them sad she recited in the singsong way children have with rhymes thats a start all right alicia said encouragingly only six lines to go but i cant think of anything else francesca wailed besides once ive said that what else do i need to say what would happen if i told you you were writing a poem about yourselfalicia wondered trouble was she had a pretty good notion of the answeryoud have hysterics thats what shed learned the word not long before and fallen in love with it it sounded much grander than pitching a fit she took a deep breath willing herself to forget what shed found out earlier in the year if she imagined she still was the way she had been then helping with assignments like this one came easier she said maybe you can say the same thing over again in a different way like how francesca asked interested but doubtful alicia flogged her muse and came up with a line jews were germanys bad luck she eyed her sister now you find something that rhymes francesca screwed up her face as she thought her sudden smile was like the sun coming out from behind a cloud thats why we made them a dead duck she exclaimed it wasnt very good poetry it rhymed but the rhythm was off alicia started to say so but then for a wonder held her tongue for somebody in francescas grade it would do and criticizing it would only get alicia more deeply involved in shaping the poem which was the last thing she wanted pretending she wasnt something she was came hard enough around strangers it was harder still with her sisters francesca inevitably wanted more help give me another line she said no alicia said come on you can do it yourself her sister hauled out the heavy artillery ill tell mommy it didnt work go ahead alicia answered youre supposed to do your own homework and you know it youre mean francesca said ive got my work to do too alicia said compared to writing rude verses about jews even reducing to lowest terms didnt look so bad youre so mean you lie and cheat when francesca got angry she didnt care what she said she just wanted to wound but she didnt not here thats good alicia said her sister gaped at her thats good she repeated that will do for another line if you change you into they oh francesca thought about it the sun came out from behind the clouds once more youre right it will she thought a little more they are so mean they lie and cheatand take away the food we eat she looked toward alicia who was suddenly a respected literary analyst again for her reaction and alicia nodded she didnt think it was wonderful poetry but she also didnt think francescas teacher was expecting wonderful poetry the lesson was more about hating jews than about writing poetry wonderful or not alicia stared suspiciously at to encourage francescaand to encourage her to go awayshe said see just two lines left uhhuh francesca didnt go away but she didnt nag alicia any more either now that shed come up with more than two lines mostly on her own she could make others were glad they arent here any longerwithout them the reich grows ever stronger she beamed im done write them all down before you forget them alicia advised francesca hurried off to do just that a couple of minutes later she cried out in despair i forgot alicia remembered the deathless verses she recited them for her sisterslowly so francesca could get them down on paper francesca even said thank you which would do for a miracle till a bigger one came along back to arithmetic now went into evenly but did it go into noshe could see that at a glancetheyre trying to trick me she thoughtthis is going to be one of those stupid fractions that doesntreduce thats already in lowest terms then remembering that made she idly tried dividing into to her surprise she discovered she could she wrote on the answer sheet francesca sounded like a stampeding elephant going downstairs roxane who was smaller somehow contrived to sound like an earthquake listen mommy she said from down below listen to what the gimpel girls mother asked im fixing supper listen to this poem i wrote francesca said proudly she didnt mention anything about help from her big sister in most circumstances that would have infuriated alicia more because of its inaccuracy than for any other reason here she didnt much mind her mothers voice floated up the stairs all right go ahead and francesca did either shed already memorized it or she had her paper along with her what do you think she asked when she was done if francesca had written the poem all by herself and then read it to her alicia knew she would have been speechless at least for a moment her mother didnt hesitate even for a heartbeat thats very good dear she said and sounded as if she meant it are you playing a game with alicia and roxane or is it for school for school francesca answered well im sure youll get a good grade now go on back upstairs and let me finish dealing with the tongue here i want to be sure your father doesnt have to wait too long to eat before he gets home from work francesca thundered up the stairs again to alicias relief she didnt stop to talk any more but went straight into her room that left alicia alone to wonder about something more complicated than fractions she knew she was smarter than most grownups they sometimes knew more things than she did but that was only because theyd been around longer which often struck her as most unfair up till now shed never had any trouble learning whatever she set out to learn but what her mother had just done was beyond her and she knew it how had mommy managed to sound so natural with no warning at all alicia knew jews had to if they wanted to survive shed already slipped more times than she could count though she hadnt got caught yet but she knew shed slipped as far as she could tell her mother and father never slipped not like that she sighed up till now shed been sure adults ruled the roost for no better reason than that they were bigger than children and could shout louder that had always struck her as most unfair but now after listening to her mother perform she thought she might be willing to admit that maybe just maybe there was something to this business of growing up after all no word in the volkischer beobachter day followed day and the party newspaper said not a thing about heinz buckligers speech to the bonzen in nuremberg the longer the silence lasted the more puzzling it got for heinrich gimpel no matter how much curiosity gnawed at him though he couldnt do anything about satisfying it he couldnt even show he was curious not after the first day or two that curtain of silence had to have fallen for a reason even if he had no idea what the reason was asking too many questions under circumstances like that was dangerous willi dorsch plainly felt the same way he kept his head down and his mouth shut if his ears were openwell then they were that was all open ears were safe enough because they didnt show but heinrich was the one who caught the first break the friday willi and erika were going to come over for bridge in the evening willi took ilse out to lunch again heinrich was curious about that too and couldnt show he was curious either he went to the canteen ordered the days speciala chicken stew with heavy gravy and too many onionsand sat down at a small corner table to eat hed got there early the place wasnt very full over the next half hour more officers and analysts technicians and clerks sweepers and secretaries came in sometimes by themselves sometimes in pairs most often in groups the loners and pairs took the tables at the edges while the groups mostly used the bigger tables in the middle of the room things got loud in a hurry heinrich did his best to listen without seeming to even if separating signal from noise wasnt easy when he heard the word nuremberg from the table behind him he wished he could prick up his ears as things were he could only sit there slowly eat the unappetizing stew and try to hear what the two officershe thought two officers had walked past him and sat down at that table although he wasnt a hundred percent surewho were also eating lunch were saying he stuck his foot in it if you ask me one of the men declared the other fellow grunted the cook stuck his foot in this stew if you ask me troops in the field would mutiny if it came in a ration tin for people at headquarters though its plenty good enough dammit im serious the first man said so am i his friend replied and if i have to finish this ill be critical he made a gagging noise heinrich almost stopped paying attention everybody groused about the food at the canteen which didnt stop people from coming but then the first officer said he had no business saying things like that to the bigwigsnone i tell you no the second officer said for one thing we dont know justwhat he said because nobodys talking on the record oh we know all right the first man said and its because he said that kind of rubbish that nobodyis talking a longish pause followed as if the second officer was deciding how to respond to that and whether to respond at all at last he said i dont know if what we hear is what really happened some of what he said at nuremberg has needed saying for a long time what did he say that wasnt true answer me that if you please who cares whether it was true the first man retorted it wasundignified thats what it was who cares whether it was trueif that didnt sum up the way things had gone all through the history of the reich heinrich couldnt imagine what would he was in a better position to know than the vast majority of his countrymen another pause at the table in back of him then slowly the second officer said doing things like going in the red when were the strongest country in the worldthatsundignified if you ask me telling the truth about lies we told and mistakes we made a long time agowhats undignified about that how do we get better if we dont even know where we were what has raking up all that old stuff got to do with whether the budgets balanced or not the first officer said if my watch has run two hours slow for weeks i wont get the right time when i look at it will i the other man said if your watch has run slow for weeks youre a dummkopf the first officer said you go out and buy a new batteryor else a new watch thats what the truth isa new battery and weve needed one for a lot longer than weeks its just that nobody had the nerve to say so the first officer came back with something in broad bavarian dialect it sounded pungent but heinrich couldnt quite make out what it meantto him broad bavarian was hardly german and he couldnt sit there much longer without making people realize he was eavesdropping he got to his feet dumped the foam plate and plastic utensils in the trash and headed back to his desk whathad heinz buckliger said down in nuremberg whatever it was he had a notion why the beobachter hadnt printed it he wondered whether willi had heard anything interesting at lunch if rumors about whatever had happened in nuremberg were starting to circulate here at oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters they were bound to be bubbling with ss men and party officials too and people liked to blab but when willi and ilse got back it was obvious they hadnt been paying attention to anything but each other he didnt have lipstick on his collar but his hair went every which way and his tie was yanked askew ilses blouse was buttoned wrong when she realized that and fixed it she got a fit of the giggles well wellor maybe not so wellheinrich thoughtbridge tonight is liable to be even more interesting than it has been lately susanna weiss got her first hint of something out of the ordinary that same afternoon when the telephone in her office rang she muttered an unpleasantry she had neither classes nor students on friday afternoons if she couldnt do her research and writing then when would she ever get the chance never maybe she picked up the phone bitte guten tagsusanna this is rosaherr doktor professor oppenhoffs secretary the herr doktor professor would like to see you in his office immediately would he susanna muttered rosa was a withered old crone susanna often thought of her as grendels mother straight out of beowulf she was also studiedly rude to susanna she would never have presumed to call a male professor in the department of germanic literature by his first name he would have been herr doktor professor soandso susanna rosa implied was no better than hired help herself but rosa was professor oppenhoffs right hand and two or three fingers of his left with a sigh susanna made herself say im coming despite thatimmediately when susanna got to the department chairmans office she had to cool her heels for almost fifteen minutes before rosa ushered her into the exalted presence another way of putting her in her place it didnt work shed expected nothing else shed brought an article with her and took notes while she waited rosa couldnt even complain about that at last rosa said professor oppenhoff will see you now how did she know she hadnt gone in to ask thank you so muchdear susanna said and scribbled a last deliberate note before entering the chairmans malodorous sanctum franz oppenhoff wasnt actually smoking a cigar when she came in but sour smoke and the stubbedout corpses of several in the ashtray served as alltoovivid reminders of his habit unlike his secretary he was scrupulously polite saying and how are you todayfraulein doktor professor well enough thank you susanna answered what can i do for you today sir professor lutze has had severalinteresting things to say about the recent meeting of the medieval english association in london oppenhoff said oh yesthe meeting you were reluctant to let me attend susanna didnt believe in letting anyone off the hook professor oppenhoff coughed and scratched at the bottom edge of his left muttonchop the gesture and the flamboyant whiskers made susanna think of emperor franz joseph and the dying days of austriahungary hmmahhmm oppenhoff said he needed to pause and gather himself before he could come out with actual words be that as it may were you not intimate with the british union of fascists during your stay in england intimate i should hope not the department chairman went red with their deliberations i should say oh with their deliberations susanna sounded as if that were occurring to her for the first time franz oppenhoff turned redder she grudged him a nod yes i suppose so and they had something to do withwith matters pertaining to the first edition of mein kampf professor oppenhoff chose his words with uncommon care which only made him more opaque than ever susanna nodded again thats right they did excuse meherr doktor professor but what does this have to do with the department of germanic languages perhaps nothing perhaps very much indeed oppenhoff who was usually fussy and precise was fussy and imprecise today he scratched at his sidewhiskers again you are not familiar with the fuhrer s recent remarks in nuremberg im sorry professor but herr buckliger is not in the habit of confiding in me oppenhoff stared at her irony was a weapon he seldom encountered and he seemed to have no idea how to cope with it eryes he managed what did the fuhrer say susanna asked thats important for every germanand even more important for every jew well the chairman hesitatedhe doesnt know himself or doesnt know much susanna realized isnt that interesting oppenhoff as much as confirmed her thought when he broke out of his hesitation i do not have this at first hand but i am given to understand that he addressed the principles underlying national socialist rule in the reich and the germanic empire did he susanna saidas neutral a remark as she could find im sorry but i dont see what thats got to do with anything in the department no professor oppenhoff looked at her in surprise if national socialist doctrine changes why then naturally our presentation must also change in accordance with it he worried more about what was ideologically appropriate than about what was true susanna had known that before but hadnt had her nose rubbed in it like this up till now she could add two and two though did the fuhrer talk about the first edition of mein kampf i believe so and about other matters related to that topic oppenhoff answered since you saw developments in england i thought you would be able to contribute some insight into what is likely to follow here in the reich what couldcontribute some insight mean buttell me how to think as far as susanna could remember the last original idea franz oppenhoff had had was to use staples rather than paper clips to hold multipage documents together such things were his province he made a better bureaucrat than he did an academic she would have pitied him more if he hadnt been proud of that im sorryherr doktor professor but i really couldnt tell you she said well have to wait and find out what the people think wont we whatthe people think by the way the department chairman brought out the phrase susanna might have said it in gothicit plainly meant nothing to him she nodded yes sir thats how the british fascists interpret that passage of the first edition anyhow herr lynton put considerable weight on it what else could our new fuhrer mean i dont know oppenhoff made a production of taking a havana from his goldplated cigar case getting it going and blowing noxious fumes in susannas direction things seemed satisfactory as they were he said plaintively this being so what point to changing them had susanna been only another german she might have had more sympathyperhaps even pityfor franz oppenhoff since she was what she was though she didnt think everything had been fine before change comesherr doktor professor she said trying to sound gentle and not scornful it comes and we have to be ready for it this is true but the department chairman still looked like a large whitehaired wrinkled cigarsmoking little boy on the edge of a tantrum no matter how true it is i dont like it he burst out im sorry said susanna who if shed ever prayed for anything in her life prayed for change now the doorbell rang there they are heinrich gimpel said well let them in lise answered the house isnt as clean as it ought to be but no house with children in it is ever as clean as it ought to be they have two of their own at least theyll understand heinrich opened the door willi dorsch thrust a big jug of rhine wine at him here willi said if i get you drunk enough maybe you wont remember to count the cards while were playing thanks heinrich took the wine you seem to be forgetting something though whats that if we all get drunk if we all get drunk who knows what will happen erika dorsch said from behind willi she looked at heinrich willi didnt see that he laughed saying if we all get drunk we wont remember so whatever happens it wont count is that how you explained things to ilse at lunchheinrich wondered one more question he couldnt ask he hefted the jug saying come on in well drink some of this anyhow and well see how bad the bridge gets not to worry willi laughed again we can play bad bridge drunk or sober some of us certainly can erika murmured the smile fell off her husbands face she pointed to alicia who was reading on the sofa my goodness shes getting big isnt she they do that heinrich said maybe if we stopped feeding her she wouldnt weve talked about it but we havent done it yet alicia looked up from her book ive heard that one before daddy jab delivered she went back to reading willi dorsch winced again they get dangerous awfully early dont they he wasnt looking at alicia though he was looking at erika this time luckily she was the one who didnt notice lise came out to the front room hello hello she said and then caught sight of the jug of wine gott im himmelif we drink all that well pass out under the table like a bunch of russians i think thats part of willis evil plot heinrich said except that he was going to pour all of the wine downmy throat oh he was was he lise sent willi a mockferocious glare he doesnt think he needs to get me drunk too im insulted alicia closed her book im going upstairs she announced how is a person supposed to hear herself think around here except for the pronoun she was quoting her father the indignant flounce however was all her own that ones going to be trouble erika dorschs voice held nothing but admiration that ones already trouble heinrich replied well lets see how the cards go and lets see what weve got here he handed lise the jug of rhine wine she made as if to stagger under the weight but then took the wine back into the kitchen to use the corkscrew when everybody was at the table with a glass of wine heinrich said i heard something interesting at lunch today and told of what the officers had to say about heinz buckligers speech the longer he went on the unhappier willi looked heinrich wondered why willis politics werent nearly so reactionary as say those of the ss men in admiral yamamotos but then erika turned to willi and said you didnt tell me anything about this you said you had lunch with heinrich today didnt you well yes willi saidwell no heinrich thoughtif you tell your wife lies you cant expect me to know about them but willi recovered brilliantly old man kallmeyer came over to the table and started bending my ear about depreciation i couldnt pay any attention to the juicy stuff erika didnt buy that or not right away why wasnt he bending heinrichs ear too dont be silly willi said heinrich already knows everything there is to know about depreciation that wasnt true but it was plausible erika eyed her husband eyed heinrich and slowly nodded well maybe she admitted but i wish youd been paying attention to what really matters i was willi said if kallmeyer gets mad at me my job turns into hell on earth erika hardly paid any attention to him she was thinking about what heinrich had said if the government is going to admit it made mistakes and told liesits like the end of the world who knows where it will end not at the bridge table lise said shall we play with some people getting together to play bridge was just an excuse to sit around and talk and drink for the gimpels and the dorsches it was an excuse to sit around and talk and drink but it wasntjust an excuse they all took the cards seriously willi took them as seriously as he took anything anyhow the wine and the snacks and the chatter were all very well but the evenings revolved around the bridge game as they cut the cards to see who would deal lise glanced at heinrich for a split second he answered just as quickly with an eyebrow raised and lowered hed already told her what hed heard in the canteen and he hadnt said a word about willis being there the eyebrow said there were good reasons why he hadnt willi won the cut and dealt like a machinea machine that desperately needed repair and oiling he tossed out cards seemingly at random he would do that every once in a while for comic effect sometimes he would misdeal doing it too when everyone ended up with thirteen cards heinrich breathed a silent sigh of relief he arranged his hand it was nothing special but he could open up at one heart and see what lise had four diamonds willi announced sounding proud of himself oh dear heinrich said he knew what a preempt like that meantwilli had a diamond suit as long as his arm and not much else seeing that he had a singleton six of diamonds himself that didnt much surprise heinrichdo i want to jump in at the four level myself he looked at his hand again he knew he couldnt pass erika and lise also passed willi went down two but he had a hundred honors points in diamonds so he broke even on the hand and hed kept heinrich and lise from finding out they could easily have made two hearts which meant the preempt worked if youd made that hand i would have figured you cooked the deal on purpose heinrich said as he shuffled for the next one who me willi looked innocent one of his less convincing expressions im not smart enough to do anything like that how right you are erika murmured willis smile seemed cheerful enough you can be replaced he said it might have been one of their usual gibes it might have beenif ilse hadnt come back from lunch with her buttons misaligned heinrich looked down at the table till he was sure his face wouldnt give anything away he and lise got to five clubs shed bid them first so she played the hand she went down one when the trumps split badly against her looks like everythings going to be above the line tonight heinrich said nobody went down on the next hand because nobody had cards good enough for an opening bid they tossed that one in and tried again when erika dorsch bid three diamonds on the hand after that and not only made the contract but added an overtrick she got a round of applause erika and willi won the first rubber a long inartistic affair after the clinching hand lise said lets take a break ill get a little something to eat she went into the kitchen willi got up too rhine wines revenge he said and headed in the other direction that left heinrich alone at the table with erika exactly where he didnt want to be im going to give lise a hand he said and started to rise but when erika said wait he didnt see what else he could do she asked was willi at lunch with you today he didnt want to lie he didnt want to tell the truth either in the end he didnt say anything that was also unlikely to help as he knew only too well and it didnt erikas eyes narrowed uhhuh she said packing a world of meaning into two wordless syllables well where was he then i dont know heinrich could tell the literal truth there and did gladly by then telling the truth didnt help either erika asked the next question he dreaded wherever he was who was with him how am i supposed to know that if i dont know where he was heinrich hoped he sounded reasonable but feared he sounded desperate erika sent him the sort of look he hadnt got since the last time hed tried explaining to a teacher why he didnt have his homework but before she could call him a liar to his face or ask another question he didnt want to answer the toilet down the hall flushed out came willi whistlingsaved bywell no not the bell heinrich thought thatsbetter willi said lise brought in a tray of cold cuts and crackers and cheese here she said we dont have to think about this i didnt have to think about what i was doing before willi said are you sure erika asked in tones that would have given him credit for any disgusting habit heinrich built himself a snack that was probably the safest thing he could do even scratching his head struck him as dangerous erika had come right out and propositioned him or as near as made no difference and she didnt see anything wrong with that the only place where she saw anything wrong was with what willi did willi had had some sort of interesting time with ilse but if he ever found out what erika had said to heinrich it sounded like one of the televisor dramas that ran on weekday afternoons unfortunately it was realif willi finds out will he try to knock erikas block off or mine heinrich got up and poured himself another glass of wine that was a more interesting question than he really wanted to contemplate in the kitchen lise had missed the byplay were all cheerful tonight arent we she remarked iam willi said piling a wobbly mountain of meat and cheese on a cracker why wouldnt i be when he devoured his creation he looked like a hamster stuffing sunflower seeds into its cheek pouches heinrich wouldnt have believed all that would fit in a mans mouth but it did yes why wouldnt you be bombers were taking off in erikas voice panzers were rolling for the borderwhy wouldnt you be when you were out screwing around she didnt say it but it hung in the air somehow willi seemed not to hear it heinrich didnt know whether to be appalled or jealous willi assembled another monster snack he managed to eat this one too and smacked his lips in triumphdid you do the same thing after you ate heinrich made himself stop not quite soon enough now lise realized something was wrong she didnt know what but she did find a solution of sorts reaching for the cards she asked whose deal is it anyway mine willi said with his mouth full he took the deck from lise and started shuffling ill deal them off the bottom this time only way to make sure i get myself some decent cards wouldnt you rather have indecent ones erika asked again willi only gave back a vague smile he went on dealing heinrich arranged his hand this looks like you dealt it off the bottom all right he told willi i told you i was going to willi took a look at his own cards one heart pass heinrich said gloomily one notrump erika said which meant she had some help for willi but not much heinrich told himself not to look at bridge bids as a metaphor for life as often happened telling himself was easier than making himself listen two diamonds lise said that made heinrich look at his hand in a new way he had five diamonds to the queen not really a biddable suit not with the rest of the junk that accompanied them but pretty decent support his singleton heart looked better too two hearts willi said three diamonds heinrich said erika passed so did lise willi muttered to himself three hearts he said now heinrich passed his wife had the stronger hand she was the one whod have to decide whether to go up after erika passed lise did too willi made gloating noises mine all mine heinrich led a diamond erika laid out the dummy which was about what heinrich had expected not much she did have two little diamonds in it willi put one of those on the lead lise played the ace and took the trick then she threw out the king saying maybe this will go and maybe it wont heinrich didnt think it would he had five diamonds he figured lise for five the dummy showed twoand that left only one for willi but willi had two after all which meant lise had had only four no wonder she hadnt rebid them willi looked disgusted at setting his second and surely last diamond on the trick lise led the eight of spades willi took the trick with the ace from his hand he looked put upon he didnt want to be there but he didnt have much in the way of entries to the board he played the hand about as well as he could and ended up going down two anyhow lise had stronger cards than he did i was going to open at one notrump she said but i couldnt not when it got to me and i had even distribution and no rebiddable suit soshe shruggedi played defense instead and ran over me willi said sadly you were the one who overbid the hand erika said the hell i did willi retorted that got to him where the other sneers hadnt heinrich grabbed the cards and started shuffling weve all butchered a hand or twoor twentytwo he said and some of usim not sure now but i think its just barely possiblesome of us may even have made some other mistakes too he started to deal youve got good sense heinrich willi said gratefully erika also nodded neither dorsch looked happy about agreeing with the other heinrich wasnt happy about having erika praise him in any way it might give her more ideas than she had alreadyideas about which heinrich couldnt and wouldnt do anything the second rubber turned out even longer and sloppier than the first one had heinrich and lise took two games out of three but they went set three times while they were vulnerable and the dorsches had a couple of hands with honors bonuses so in spite of winning the rubber they came out points in the hole well no one will send any of those hands to the bridge magazines heinrich said ruefully oh i dont know willi said if theyre looking for lessons on how not to do it i think we just wrote the book another rubber lise asked willi nodded why not the night is young and i am beautiful even erika laughed and shed been sniping at her husband all evening she still had the tricks theyd taken during the last hand in front of her she tossed them across the table to willi shut up and deal always a good idea he said and did when he picked up his hand and arranged it he solemnly shook his head nothings going to go right tonight though i pass everybodypassed heinrich took the cards and shuffled them extra hard trying to get rid of the mediocre hands people had been having he looked at what hed dealt himself no such luck not as far as he was concerned pass they all passed again at this rate well be here forever willi said which proved economic planners in the usa werent the only ones given to extrapolating too far from not enough data give me the cards erika said as she shuffled she sent the deck a severe look have to be some playable hands in here somewhere by the way she said it the cards would go to bed without supper if there werent she nodded briskly once she saw her own hand one heart she won the contract at four hearts and made it without much trouble even lise murmured about time as she shuffled for the next deal she and heinrich made three diamonds and then made two hearts so they were vulnerable too that sent the deal to heinrich he liked the face cards that looked back at him when he picked up his hand he put things together and one notrump erika passed lise made it two notrump willi opened his mouth and then closed it again as if he wanted to jump in but couldnt not at the three level heinrich said three notrump lets see if we can steal this rubber everyone passed erika led lise set out the dummy heinrich looked at what she had and added it in his head to what he had he saw eight sure tricks one more with a spade finesseand he knew which way he intended to try it because of willis wigglingand maybe a couple of overtricks if he could set up her clubs and run them everything turned out the way he thought it would he ran the spade finesse past willi the first chance he got while he still had the other suits stoppedvital in notrumpand it worked after that everything else flew on automatic pilot he ended up making five very neat willi said nothing we could do about that one i dont know erika said why didnt you hold up a sign that saidive got the strength willi bridled as he had in the auction he started to say something this time erika forestalled him and who did you really have lunch with today i told youwith heinrich willi answered yes you told me now try telling the truth because i know crap when i hear it erika snarled lise looked at heinrich in surpriseshed known something was going on all right but she hadnt realized willi was outandout lying heinrich did his best to keep all expression off his face anything he did or said now was only liable to throw gasoline on the fire willi got to his feet with ponderous dignity i dont have to take these kinds of questions he declared youre not the security police even if you think you are he left the table and walked down the hall again erika looked daggers at his back bastard she said just as the bathroom door closed she turned back to heinrich and lise her eyes going from one of them to the other and then returning i swear there are times when id like to sleep with the first man i happen to see just to pay him back she was staring squarely at heinrich when she said that he tried to look at the floor at the ceiling out the windowanywhere but at either willis wife or his own he kept waiting for willi to flush the toilet again but willi this time was using the bathroom as a bomb shelter and odds were he wouldnt come out any time soon silence stretched at last warily lise said dont you think thats a littledrastic why erika didnt keep her voice down if anything she pitched it to carry if hes fooling around on me why shouldnt i fool around on him more silence heinrich decided hed better say something if he didnt lise was liable to get the idea he wanted erika thinking about him like that he chose his words with even more caution than lise had if youre going to stay married its probably a good idea that neither one of you fool around on the other ha erika said a onesyllable demolition of the very idea lise had started to nod in agreement with her husband that scornful laugh froze her for a moment with her chin in the air she looked as if she needed a distinct effort to bring her head back down to a normal posture after what seemed like forever water ran in the pipes at the far end of the hall willi came back to the bridge table looking grim wed better go he said to erika its getting late it certainly isin a lot of ways she answered and we have a few things to talk about dont we yes just a few willi said the dorsches headed up the street for the bus stop after the most perfunctory goodbyes they were shouting at each other long before they got there well lise said that was another interesting evening interesting heinrich considered mm yes thats one word for it anyhow it was the politest word i could think of his wife replied what exactly did erika mean there and whowas willi at lunch with answering the second question seemed safer so heinrich did that first ilseagainif lunch is where they went lises eyes widened her mouth shaped a silentoh but her expression said she hadnt forgotten the other question either unhappily he told her erika probably meant just what she said she usually does i know she does thats why i wondered lise frowned but she was looking at you when she said it i didnt much care for that what did you think about it now there was a question to make a man want to pretend hed suddenly gone deaf its a compliment of sorts said heinrich whose ears still worked however much he wished they didnt his wife coughed dangerously will you let me finish he exclaimed lise gave back a pace in surprise he didnt raise his voice very often he went on its notmuch of a compliment not when she would have said the same thing to any man who happened to be in the neighborhood he didnt mention that erika had already said the same thing about him in particular he did add and ive told you beforei know when im well off oh you do do you lise sent him a challenging stare how am i supposed to be sure of that he took her in his arms he kissed her his hands wandered ill think of something he said before adding the fathers usual caveat if the children stay quiet anyhow he was lucky they did children in the united states alicia gimpel had learned got long summer vacations from school her teachers said that scornfully they offered it as one of the reasons germany had beaten the usa americans didnt study enough and had been too ignorant to take full advantage of their countrys riches no matter what her teachers said though the idea sounded wonderful to alicia here it was the middle of august and she remained in school the only real breaks she got were two weeks around christmas and new years and another week at easter time the rest of the year was school punctuated by muchtoooccasional holidays herr kessler said many important things have happened in our country the fuhrer is setting us on a new course and that is the way we shall go matthias walbeck the boy jumped up and came to attention jawohl herr kessler tell me how the fuhrer is changing the reich poor matthias couldnt do it he was a big strong boy but goodnaturednot a bully at all unfortunately he also was not a scholar at all he stayed at attention his face a mask of misery im very sorryherr kessler he whispered please excuse me kessler took the paddle off the nail where it hung matthias turned and bent over the teacher delivered a swat that made the boy hop forward but matthias let out not a peep showing weakness would only have earned him more you must study matthias the teacher said you must pay attention i willherr kessler i promiseherr kessler matthias said everyone in the classroomprobably including himknew the promise would be broken the teachers glower raked the room alicia knew the answer she didnt throw up her hand though volunteering too often got you a reputation as a teachers pet she already had more of that reputation than she wanted herr kessler picked another hapless student this one a girl she couldnt answer either he swatted her too when he was in a bad mood he would choose children who werent likely to know what he wanted just so he could hand out swat after swat he wasnt the only teacher in the school who did that eitherfrau koch was universally known as the beast to her students and had been for yearsbut not a teacher ever heard the nickname after dealing out yet another whack on the bottomherr kessler put the paddle back in its place i dont know what the younger generation is coming to he said sadly when the fuhrer speaks you must listen and what is his name class heinz buckligerherr kessler the children chorused very good youve learned that anyway the teacher said and heinz buckliger has said that not everything we did in days gone by was perfect so some things must change and why must things change because the fuhrer is always rightherr kessler the whole class said together that was the right answer alicia knew it was teachers had been drilling it into students since kindergarten she sang out as confidently as her classmates so she was amazed when herr kessler shook his head no what did i just say they were trained to repeat his words back to him they did now and heinz buckliger has said that not everything we did in days gone by was perfect so some things must change yes kessler nodded so why must things change then because the fuhrer says so again all the children were sure they had it right again alicia was as sure as any of the others but the teacher shook his head once more no you are wrong what did the new fuhrer say that not everything we did in days gone by was perfect and stop herr kessler held up his hand there is the answer we must change because not everything we did in days gone by was perfect he paused to let that sink in the children murmured among themselvesherr kessler didnt correct them which was at least as astonishing as the lesson he was teaching alicia wanted to ask several questions she didnt think she ought to ask any of them but wolfgang prillers hand rose question herr kessler go ahead priller the teacher braced as if expecting bad news wolf stood up and came to attention sir if the fuhrer is always right the way we know he is how is it that not everything we did in days gone by was perfect sure enough that was one of the questions alicia had wanted to ask it had occurred to her because of the logical inconsistency she suspected it had occurred to wolf priller because he remained convinced the fuhrer was always right he took to indoctrination the way a duck took to water herr kessler said heinz buckliger is the fuhrer now if he says not everything we did in days gone by was perfect is he not right to say so wolfgang priller frowned as he tried to work that out alicia frowned too again she thought herr kesslers logic was that of a dog chasing its own tail the teacher gestured be seated priller wolf sat down he looked as if a dog were chasing its tail inside his head too what did we do in days gone by that wasnt perfectherr kessler another boy called without raising his hand alicia didnt see who it was kessler didnt see who it was either which had to be lucky for whoever had spoken out of turn the teacher growled i dont have to respond to questions not put in proper form i dont have to and i dont intend to let us continue with the lesson does that mean you dont know the answeralicia wondered which would have been unimaginable not so long before when she thought her teachers knew everythingor does it mean the new fuhrerhasnt said what the answer is so there isnt any answer yet she could see kessler was parroting what heinz buckliger had said the same way students parroted what the teacher said at lunch wolf priller declared i dont like these changes i think theyre stupid nobody disagreed with him not out loud he could beat up any of the other boys in the class alicia wondered if anything would really change if anything could really change or if everything that was going on was just a lot of talk sometimes people said this or that without meaning a word of it if the men who ran things wanted to do something like that they could easily enough but there was trudi krebs skipping rope with some other girls and as happy as any of themherr kessler had taken down her name for speaking well of the first edition of mein kampf wolf priller had gloated about how the knock on her door would come in the middle of the night everybodyincluding aliciahad been sure it would happen it hadnt if kurt haldweim were still fuhrer it would have alicia remembered the beaky waxy face shed seen in the great hall when haldweim lay in state no man with a face like that would have let anybody get away with anything but trudi and her parentshad got away with it therefore thingshad changed at least some there was logic that didnt chase its own tail and if wolf priller didnt like it so much the better alicia threw her orange peel in the trash and ran to join the girls with the jump rope because of who he was because of what he did and because of what he was walther stutzman had access to far more of the reich s computer records than anyone else knew about the problem was being able to use the access codes he had if anyone spotted strange things on his monitor he would lose his access privileges in a hurryand also very likely his freedom and also quite possibly his life lunch was a good time to poke around most people in walthers office at the zeiss works went out to eat that helped as usual he kept his monitor turned so it wasnt easy to see unless you came right into his cubicle that helped too all the same especially after things had gone so badly wrong fixing the kleins genealogy he got extra nervous whenever he went looking where he wasnt supposed to he had to keep doing it even if it was dangerous he knew that finding out more than he could through ordinary channels might help keep him and all the jews left in the reich safe and he couldnt help being curious either his boss said theres a gang of us going over to this new place that serves american hamburgers and hot dogs and fried chicken want to come along guaranteed heartburn or your money back cant do it walther pointed to his desk it was as neat as usual but did have more stacks of paper on it than people were used to seeing there this changeover to the new operating system is tougher than we ever thought it would be i dont know if we can meet the schedule theyve set us gustav priepke grimaced lord help us if we dont weve already had three false starts if we botch it this time theyre liable to throw us out on our ear and hire a bunch of programmers from japan priepke was kidding on the square and walther knew it the reich had pioneered in electronic computersand the core operating system still showed as much for it lacked protected memory and preemptive multitasking the japanese had got off to a later start and had had the advantage of seeing the mistakes german programmers made japanese systems were more robust and often more reliable even if they werent so elegant i think we can make it happen but its going to take a lot of work walther said and so he apologetically spread his hands his boss nodded if youre on the trail of something keep after it ill have an extra hot dog for you off he wentand knowing him hed probably have two walther waited till more people went off to lunch whether at the american placeit was called for no reason he could see the greasy spoonor somewhere else when the big room that held his cubicle had quieted down he used one of those access codes he wasnt supposed to have this one took him to an archive of the fuhrer s speeches he wanted toand he was convinced he needed tofind out just what heinz buckliger had said at nuremberg because it had so many people hopping the nuremberg speech was there in the menu sure enough when he tried to call it up though it demanded another authorization code from him one with a much higher security level he blinked hed never seen anything like that before not for a speech he knew the second code but hadnt imagined he would have to use it whathad buckliger been talking about nuclear bombs and missile design even after he entered the authorization code the system hesitated before it coughed up the text of the fuhrer s speech he got ready to bail out in a hurry and cover his tracks but then the speech did come up if someoneor something electronicwas making special note of his presence none of his own tools for detecting such things sensed it he quickly scrolled through the speech to see how long it was when he did he got another surprise it seemed to go on forever the fuhrer had the privilege of length of course had any ruler of the third reich ever used it so extravagantly as heinz buckliger had here though maybe the volkischer beobachter hadnt published it because it would have filled two days editions walther started to read he couldnt go through the whole speech in detail as hed intended it was just too damned long he wouldnt have been halfway through by the time his boss got back from the greasy spoon so he skimmedand even skimming was plenty to make him sit up and take notice buckliger came right out and said things that everybody knew but that nobodycertainly not the fuhrer ever talked about what had lothar prutzmann and the rest of the leaders of the ss thought when he declared for far too long this state has been founded on one thing and one thing only terror if that didnt infuriate them if that didnt infuriate them the speech had plenty of other things to do the job the new fuhrer said that all his predecessors from hitler on had received reverence as if they were gods but they are only men with all the failings to which men are heir walther found himself nodding that seemed obvious when you came out and said itbut who in the nearly eighty years of the reich s historyhad come out and said it nobodyand a ruling fuhrer least of all and heinz buckliger had also said force can win victories but force alone cannot maintain them forever without more expense than germany can readily afford if that didnt fly in the face of everything the reich had stood for since the early days what did with each new bombshell walther wanted to slow down and read more carefully he knew he couldnt not with his boss and his colleagues coming back soon not if he wanted to see as much of what was there as possible but he wanted to if he had slowed down he wouldnt have come to the question the new fuhrer asked near the end of the speech if everything we say about aryan descent is true how do we explain the recent rapid progress of the japanese who have not mingled their blood with aryan stock any time recently how buckliger answered that question walther didnt find out he had to get the speech off his monitor because the room started filling up again but that the fuhrer thought to ask it said more than any answer could no they couldnt very well publish this speech the country wasnt ready and walther would have bet anything he owned that the party and ssbonzen whod listened to it at nuremberg hadnt been either vii heinrich gimpel had tried the greasy spoon before and hadnt been much impressed no matter how trendy the american place was he didnt like the food all that much but if richard and maria klein wanted to go there to celebrate he and lise werent about to tell them no the kleins had reason to celebrate the security police didnt call off an investigation every day not when they were trying to find out if you were a jew i wish we could throw a proper party at home maria said shed been thin and pale to begin with and the troubles of the past few months had only made her thinner and paler she had a very nice smile though even when she shrugged and said you know how things are liable to be oh yes heinrich nodded so did lise if the authorities were still looking for evidence what better way to get it than to fill the kleins house with microphones and listen to everything they saidand if they did throw a party to everything their friends said too richard took a big bite out of his cheeseburger he had a musicians hands all right long clever fingers the tips slightly spatulate from endless hours of practice he said i dont have any idea what finally made them quit they just said all right were done go on about your business doesnt look like you are what we thought you were he had too much sense to say jew where anyone who wasnt might hear grinning with relief he sipped from a mug of beer was it your lawyer lise asked from what susanna says hes a tiger the kleins shrugged in unison he made a lot of noise ill say that for him maria answered i dont know how much real good he did though a girl in what was supposed to be an american waitresss outfit from before the third world war came up to the table hi she saidthe standard servers greeting at the greasy spoon she returned to german to ask would you like some dessert cherry pie maybe or brownies were not quite ready yet heinrich said okay she said brightly doing her best to project oldtime american enthusiasm ill come back later then away she went heinrich wondered whether waitresses in the united states had really worn clothes like that wouldnt the customers have been too distracted to order i think maybe the lawyer helped richard said it helped that we had the nerve to hire one that told them that we really hadnt done what they said we had good heinrich said danken gott dafur he still wondered what the authorities had been thinking a lot of times they arrested people just because they felt like arresting them not because the people had actually done something things did seem looser under buckliger than they had under kurt haldweim but were they loose enough for the powers that be to let jews slip through their fingers heinrich had his doubts but the kleins were here maria nodded thank god for that is right she said softly and if she thought about god in a way different from that of most citizens of the reich well who could know by the way she looked or what she said when strangers might hear nobody nobody at all lise also spoke quietly how is paul hes no better hes not going to get better richard klein spoke through clenched teeth they brought in specialists who know a lot more about this disease than dr dambach does they all say the same thing when he gets worse the mercy center will be aa kindness hes still happy though maria said hes not too bad and hes too little to know somethings wrong with him thats the one mercy we have richard agreed he doesnt know anything is wrong but we do he lifted the seidel of beer drained it and waved for a refill the waitress brought it to him then swayed off to get something for someone else heinrich watched her he would have needed to be blind not to watch her lise watched him watching her come here often for lunch she asked me no its not close enough to where i work heinrich enjoyed sounding virtuous as a matter of fact walther stutzman told me about this place but lise and maria klein stared at him walther his wife said in astonishment he and lise were happily married by all appearances richard and maria got on well too but the stutzmans were like two sides of one coin lise plainly had trouble imagining walther coming to a restaurant where the waitresses were as big a part of the attraction as the food taking pity on her heinrich said his boss has brought him here sometimes you cant say no he ate some french fries they were hot and salty and certainly lived up to the name of the place he says thats how he got here anyway richard klein said his voice sly i bet he was just kicking and screaming when his boss dragged him in he was waitresswatching too maria looked at lise what are we going to do with them well weve had them for a while by now lise answered i dont suppose theyd bring much if we traded them in on new models mmmaybe not by the way maria said it it was one of those unfortunate inconvenient facts you just couldnt get around heinrich finished his burger and fries if americans eat like this all the time why dont they all weigh two hundred kilos he said i feel like i swallowed a boulder richard nodded me too he said but when the waitress came back and asked about dessert again they both ordered cherry pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream slapped on top so did their wives away went the waitress cheerful as could be now i get it lise said they wear what theyre almost wearing to get the men to order more heinrich wouldnt have been surprised if she was right no matter what hed thought a little while earlier about distractions he hadnt been too distracted to lay out some extra reichsmarks had he he found the only defense he could you wanted dessert too sweetheart and i dont suppose the girls clothes had anything to do with that richard klein clapped his hands thats good i wish i could come up with snappy comebacks like that dont heinrich told him they usually just get you in trouble listen to him maria said this is a man whos been married longer than you have he knows whats what the waitress came back with a tray heavy with desserts the two couples dug in sure enough heinrich made his pie disappear nor was he the only one facing an empty dessert plate with an expression of disbelief you dont need to put me on the train tonight he said you can just roll me home me too lise said did i really do that tell me i didnt if you didnt then we didnt either richard said lets pretend the whole thing never happened everybody laughed heinrich put money on the table including an extra reichsmark or two in appreciation of the waitresss outfit as he walked out of the greasy spoon he said im glad everything turned out all right from the bottom of his heart then because he was who and what he was he added i wonder why it did lise sent him the sort of look she always did when he came out with something like that the look that said she wished he had better sense than to open his big mouth that way but richard klein only laughed and clapped him on the back hell heinrich he said so do i alicia gimpel repeated the nonsensesounding syllables that her father had had her memorize shma yisroayl adonoi elohaynu adonoi ekhod thats right thats just right her father nodded youve got the shma down very well and do you remember what the words mean hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one alicia said thats right too her father said thats the most important prayer we have it should be the last thing you ever say if god forbid theres a time when you have to say a last thing we few are all thats left of israel these days we have to keep it going i know alicia liked learning things in the secret language the nearly dead language it strengthened the feeling of belonging to a special club show me the other thing again she urged her father frowned which made him look even more serious than he usually did all right he said but youve got to be especially careful with this you cant let your sisters see it not ever and youve always got to scratch over it or tear it up into little pieces before you throw it out thats because it says just what we are if anybody recognizes it i understand i promise alicia started to cross her heart but then checked herself with the motion only half done if she was a jew the cross didnt count for anything did it so many things to think about with careful attention her father drewwrotefour curious characters on a piece of paper this says adonoi its the name of god now you do it he handed her the pen she started to he set his hand on hers stopping her no thats not right remember what i told you what do you mean they look just like the ones you made but then alicia did remember oh im sorry i started from the wrong end again didnt i her father lifted up his hand she began again writing a a a and then another why does it go from right to left instead of from left to right daddy i dont know why hebrew does that he answered unhappily i just knowthat it does my father knew more about being a jew than i do andhis father knew much more than he did because his father had grown up in the days when jews in germany were free to be what they were ill teach you as much as i can and you need to remember it so you can teach it to your children if we keep learning less and less every time will a time come when we dont know enough alicia asked her father looked more unhappy still i dont know that either sweetheart all i know is that i hope not we have to try to pass it along and thats what im doing alicia looked down at the curious set of characters shed written which letter says what which one saysah and which one saysdo and which one saysnoi its not that simple her father said why not what do you mean this is confusing alicia said because it doesnt really sayadonoi it says jahweh more or lessits the word jehovah comes from but thats the name of god and jews arent supposed to speak the name of god so we sayadonoi instead that means lord oh alicia eyed those four formidable letters once more thisis confusing are there books where i can find out more about it yes there are and you cant have any of them her father answered alicia stared at him in something close to shock their family loved books the shelves in the front room and in her parents bedroom held everything from mystery novels to books about the theater to birdwatching guides to studies of ancient greece but there were she realized no books about jews except the streicher childrens classics in her own room her father went on you wont find those books in any jews house its not safe for us to have them people might wonder why we do and the last thing we want is people wondering about us not having those books is part of the disguise we wear do you see i suppose so alicia said unwillingly but it seems a shame that we cant learn more if the books are there one of the things we could learn is what gives the security police an excuse to arrest us her father said when youre a grownup you can decide for yourself what you think is safe for now were not going to take any chances he didnt use that tone of voice very often when he did it meant his mind was made up and he wouldnt change it no matter what alicia sighed it didnt seem fair he usually pushed her toward learning as hard as he could here he was pushing her away instead but when he sounded like this she would only waste her breath arguing with him he picked up the paper where theyd written the name of god the name too holy to be spoken and methodically began tearing it into little pieces most of what we know we have to pass on by word of mouth he said thats not so dangerous its there and then its gone paper now paper lasts paper is what gets you into trouble because it stays there even if youve forgotten about it it stays thats what got the kleins into troublea piece of paper that stayed in a file the kleinsare jews alicia asked excitement flared in her when her father nodded the more people she knew who shared this burden with her the less heavy it seemed and the less alone she felt her father said because of this paper the reichs genealogical office thought they were too but nobody could prove anything and they had to let them go and one of the reasons nobody could prove anything is that the kleins are careful about what they keep at home they didnt have anything where people could point and say ha they have that so they must be jews from everything alicia had heard people didnt need to be sure to settle with jews she said as much to her father finishing why didnt they take them away and do things to them anyhow that made her father frown i dont quite know he admitted he sounded grumpy like her he was someone with a restless relentless itch to find things out there has to be a reason i just hope its not a bad one what do you mean alicia asked well they could have let them go so they could help catch other jews he said her mouth fell open that hadnt occurred to her he nodded grimly yes they do things like that they may but would the kleins alicia asked her father let out a long sad sigh sweetheart i just dont know how can you tell what anybody will do when someone says to him do this or else well kill you you cant know that about anyone else ahead of time you cant even know about yourself ahead of time i would never do anything like that alicia declared her father only sighed againhe doesnt believe me she realized she started to get angry then she wondered what would happen if the security police told her they would do something horrible to him or to her mother or to one of her sisters if she didnt do what they told her wouldnt she do anything to keep them from hurting people she loved maybe she would her thought must have shown on her face for her father reached out and tousled her hair you see he asked gently alicia gave back a reluctant nod i guess i do then a really nasty thought occurred to her one that made her gasp with fright what if the kleinsare doing that now what if theyre helping to catchus its possible her father admitted all the terror alicia had felt when she first found out she was a jew terror that had eased a little with the passage of time came flooding back but he went on its possible but i dont think its true if they were only pretending everything was all right last night they could have been movie actors they were doing such a good job and besides if the security police squeezed our names out of them they wouldnt need to play games theyd just break down the door in the middle of the night and take us away jaalicia said more than a little relieved that was what the security police did all right everybody knew it her heart stopped thumping quite so hard her father laughed funny isnt it that theyre always such bastards that knowing they havent been mean shows they really did let the kleins go free thats just what i was thinking alicia exclaimed how did you know because i was thinking the same thing he answered and im just as happy about it as you are believe me alicia did esther stutzman was trying to juggle three phone calls two mothers who needed to make return appointments and another mother who was arguing about her bill when the door to dr dambachs waiting room opened instantly all the women with squalling children in the waiting room tried to shush them the sight of a sternfaced man in a uniform did that to people even if the dark brown outfit wasnt one most men and women in the reich recognized at sight who wanted to take a chance maximilian ebert strode up to the receptionists station ignoring mothers and children the man from the reichs genealogical office clicked his heels as he had the first time he visited the pediatricians office guten tag frau stutzman he said i need to see dr dambach right away esther wished he hadnt remembered her name there were several reasons he might have and she liked none of them she took what revenge she could by answering im very sorry but hes with a patient at the moment if you care to sit down and wait im sure it wont be too long by the way she said it she might have been sure hed wait for weeks but ebert wasnt about to inconvenience himself like an ordinary person please tell him i am here he said im sure he will see me immediately the nerve said a woman from behind his back he stiffened but did not turn one moment please esther told him the request was too reasonable for her to refuse outright when she went back to talk to dr dambach she found him poised with a hypodermic needle above a babys round bare bottom she waited till he gave the shot and the baby yowled then she said excuse me doctor but herr ebert is here he needs to see you right away he says herr ebert dambach looked blank from the reichs genealogical office esther said wishing ebert had never had any reason to visit the pediatrician oh him memory jogged dr dambach nodded what the devil does he want now esther only shrugged dr dambach muttered before answering her dambach turned to the babys mother dora may be cranky and run a small fever for a day or two acetaminophen syrup should relieve most of the symptoms if shes in more distress than thatwhich is very unlikelybring her back in thank you doctor i will the woman said still muttering dambach gave his attention back to esther i suppose id better see him bring him to my private office and ill be there in a few minutes i have another patient to see first all right doctor esther went out and delivered the word to maximilian ebert thank you very much he said and then once shed taken him into the office have you got a telephone number my sweet shed thought he was unduly attentive the last time he came in thiswhat i haveherr ebert are two children and a husband he stared at her in what looked like honest bewilderment and asked whats that got to do with anything im fond of all of them thank you very much she said and now if youll excuse me she went back out to the receptionists station where she announced dr dambach has a visitor hell be with you as soon as he can i promise she nodded to the woman whod questioned her bill im sorry for the delayfrau mommsen what were you saying frau mommsen poured out a history of her troubles most of which had little to do with the twentyfive reichsmarks she owed dr dambach esther listened with half an ear most of her attention was on the pediatricians private office she hoped dambach would tell maximilian ebert where to go and how to get there she knew it was a forlorn hope but she cherished it just the same dr dambach didnt even get in there for another ten minutes esther could hear the functionary from the genealogical office drumming his fingers on dambachs desk about time ebert said when the doctor finally did appear youre the one whos interrupting my work dambach replied his voice chilly what do you want before she could find out what he wanted someone new to the practicea woman with a squalling toddler in her armscame up and had to be guided through dr dambachs paperwork because the little boy cried all through the process esther caught only brief snatches of conversation from the doctors office got a lot of nerve blaming me for put all of us in hot my fault when i was only trying to but this is how it turned dr dambach said something else in response to that a moment later maximilian ebert stormed out of his office and out of the waiting room fury on his face he tried to slam the door that led to the hall but the shockabsorbing arm at the top of the door thwarted him the slowly closing door cut off his curses when at last it did swing shut goodness said the woman with the toddler what got underhis skin i dont know esther answered whatever it is i hope its nothing trivial the woman gave her a strange look then decided she couldnt have meant what she said and forgot about it but esther had meant every word she stayed busy till noon dealing with mothers children and the occasional father when the office closed for lunch she went back to bring dr dambach a fresh cup of coffee in the hopes that he might feel like talking oh thank you he said around a mouthful of sandwich i was just going to get up and pour myself one when he said no more esther took the bull by the horns why did that ebert fellow storm out of here as though he had a messerschmitt on his tail him dambach gave forth with a dismissive grunt i think weve seen the last of him and i cant say im sorry either what he basically told me was that i had done my job too well im sorryfrau stutzman but the only way i know how to do it is as well as i can well i should say so esther said still wishing hed been less conscientious what on earth was he talking about when the kleins had the taysachs baby and the altered genealogical chart they were suspected of being jews the pediatrician answered you know about that oh yes esther nodded i know about that what has it got to do with you doing your job too well everyone in the reichs genealogical office and for all i know the security police too was all set to make an enormous hue and cry over it and why not its been years since any jews turned up in berlin for heavens sake esther nodded again thats true she said casually hiding her fear why didnt they make their big hue and cry then because it turns out that lothar prutzmanns niece poor woman has a baby with taysachs whos three weeks older than paul klein dambach said if they accused the kleins of being jews on account of this how could they keep from tarring the head of the ss with the same brush they couldnt and they knew it and so they had to drop the charges against the kleins good lord esther didnt care to think about what a narrow and dreadful escape that was she also couldnt help sympathizing with the ss chief of the greater german reich something she hadnt thought she would ever do she said but how does reichsfuhrer ss prutzmanns misfortune reflect on you its simple for someone with the sort of mind herr ebert has dr dambach scowled if i hadnt brought the one taysachs case to his notice his office wouldnt have got in trouble with prutzmann for pushing too hard and what does ebert do as a result of that he blames me of course i see and esther did too well the other choice would be blaming himself and thats not likely is it the pediatrician grunted again some miracles demand too much of god but i gave him a piece of my mind before he left you may be very sure of that good for you dr dambach esther said he was a good doctorand within the limits of his education a pretty good man im sick and tired of getting pushed around by little tin gods in fancy uniforms justbecause they wear fancy uniforms dambach said i think everybody is dont you if the new fuhrer is serious about calling some of those people to account hell have a lot of folks on his side i think how about you me i never worry about politics esther lied she had trouble hiding her amazement her boss was solid reliable conservative if he said things like that a lot of people had to be thinking them i try never to worry about politics either he said now who with his head on straight needs to most of the time but sometimes politics worry about me the way they did here this morning and ill tell you frau stutzman i dont care for it i dont care for it at all well for heavens sake dr dambach who could blame you esther said who needed to worry about politics most of the time people like her people whom politics constantly affected did and the very foundations of nazi party politics were built on worrying about jews would heinz buckliger think about changing that could he think about changing that and hope to survive some of the things walther said hed talked about in nuremburg were remarkable but changing the way nazis saw jews would be more than remarkable it would be miraculous when esther saw a miracle she would believe in it till then no why dont you go on homefrau stutzman dambach said i dont mind answering the telephone till irma gets here it should be only a few more minutes anyway thank you very much esther said let me start a fresh pot of coffee before i leave though that should last the two of you most of the afternoon if she didnt hed fiddle with the coffeemaker while he was in the office by himself she wanted to do something nice for him in return for his letting her go earlyand for the news hed given her keeping him away from the coffeemaker was the nicest thing she could think of when willi dorsch got on the commuter bus he wore his uniform as if hed slept in it hed shaved erratically his hair stuck out from under his cap in all directions like the hay in a stack made by somebody who didnt know how to stack hay good heavens heinrich gimpel exclaimed what happened to you another lovely night on the sofa willi answered plopping his posterior down beside heinrich his breath was highoctane as if to explain that he went on i took a bottle with me for company last night it was more fun than erikas been lately thats for damn sure will you be able to think straight when we get to headquarters heinrich asked maybe you should have called in sick instead of letting people see you like this coffee and aspirins will make a new man of me willi assured him that wouldnt be so bad id say the old ones worth about thirty pfennigs tops besides if i called in sick id have to spend more time with the blond bitch and im notquite up for that he belched softly heinrich wondered if he ought to leave it there but he and willi had been friends for a long time he felt he had to ask the next question if youre so unhappy why are you still there the kids willi answered simply joseph and magda mean everything to me if i walk out erika will fill their heads full of lies about me things are bad enough as is he glanced over at heinrich youre a lucky bastard you know that things go so smooth for you as far as i can see you havent got a single worry in the whole goddamn world that would have been funny if only it were funny instead of shrieking mad laughter which was what he wanted to do heinrich answered well i would have said the same about you and erika till a few months ago only goes to show you cant tell from the outside willi said that was truer than he knew but heinrich didnt say so his friend pointed ahead were just about to the station so we are heinrich got ready to hurry to the platform where theyd catch the train from stahnsdorf up to berlins south station willi groaned when he had to get up my heads going to fall off he said i almost wish it would you can probably get aspirins in the station if you need them that badly heinrich said well so i can and so i will and i can get coffee too even if its shitty coffee i was going to wait till i made it to the office and buy them at the canteen but to hell with that i feel too lousy willi sounded as haggard as he looked when they got to the station he made a beeline for the little concession stand at the back heinrich meanwhile bought a volkischer beobachter from a vending machine willi joined him on the platform a couple of minutes later he too had a paper under his arm he peeled two aspirin tablets from a foil packet and used a gulp of coffee to wash them down heinrich said thats got to be hell on your stomach especially if you drank too much last night now ask me if i care willi answered the way my heads banging im not going to worry about anything farther south he winced when the train came up even though it was powered by electricity and not nearly so noisy or smelly as a steam engine or a diesel locomotive would have been he let heinrich sit by the window and pulled his cap down low on his forehead to keep as much light as he could out of his eyes when the train got moving he pretended to read the volkischer beobachter but his yawns and his glazed expression said it was just pretense heinrich by contrast went through the paper with his usual care he tapped a story on page three the fuhrer s going to speak on the televisor tomorrow night be still my beating heart willi was indifference personified ive heard a speech or twothousandin my time i know i know most of the time id say the same thing heinrich tapped the beobachter again but dont you think this particular speech might be interesting after what he said in nuremburg nobody knows what he said in nuremburgnobody except the bonzen and they arent talking much willi replied but hed heard the same rumors heinrich had hed heard some of themfrom heinrich and maybe the aspirins and coffee were starting to work for he did perk up a little all right maybe it will be interesting he admitted you never can tell if hes serious about some of the things he said there the things people say he said there willi broke in yes the things people say he said there heinrich nodded if he said them and if he meant them willi interrupted again half the peoplemore than half the peoplewill watch the football game anyhow or the cooking show or the one about the ss man where the american spys always right on the edge of falling out of her dress i swear she will one of these days heinrich was damned if hed let his friend outdo him for cynicism she wont when shes on opposite the fuhrer s speech he answered the programming directors head would roll if she ended up stealing that much of the audience mm youve got a point there willi said too bad he managed a bloodshot leer south station came the call as the train glided to a halt all out for south station heinrich hurried up the escalators to catch the bus to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters willi shambled along after him like something created in a mad scientists experiment that hadnt quite worked as soon as they got to the office willi headed off to the canteen he returned with a large foam cup of coffee in each hand and poured them both down in record time not surprisingly he went to the mens room shortly thereafter and then again a few minutes later vitamin p he said sheepishly when he came back after the second trip and speaking of vitamin p why didnt you tell me my eyes looked like two pissholes in the snow what could you have done if i had heinrich asked well nothing but even so willi opened those veintracked eyes very wide now im awake i may live i may even decide i want to ilse came up to set some papers on his desk she started to turn away then stopped and did one of the better double takes heinrich had seen good god what happened to you she said almost exactly echoing his words of an hour earlier erika and i had a small disagreement last night willi answered yes thats about right just a small disagreement you poor dear ilse was the very picture of sympathy fussing over him straightening his collar and generally making him feel three meters tall he lapped it up like a cat in front of a bowl of cream heinrich had to suppress a strong impulse to retch on the other hand he wondered how long it had been since erika buttered willi up like that such artful dodges werent her style later that morning willi said im going to lunch with ilse today why am i not surprised the tart retort came out of heinrichs mouth before he could stop it his friend turned red i dont know why arent you youve got things going good for you now so you get all sanctimonious if you were the one with troubles i wouldnt look down my nose at you you wouldnt whats the fun in having a nose if you dont look down it heinrich replied even more deadpan than usual willi looked at him started to say something and then started to laugh instead dammit how am i supposed to stay angry at you when you come back with things like that if you work at it i expect youll manage heinrich said again with next to no inflection in his voice he got another laugh from willi too although he hadnt been joking ilse snuggled up to willi as they walked toward the door willi slipped his arm around her waist heinrich went back to his paperworkwould i do something like that if i were having trouble with lise he wonderedwho knows maybe i would but he had trouble imagining trouble with lisemaybe i dont understand how lucky i am the telephone on willis desk rang heinrich was going to let it keep ringing till whoever was on the other end got sick of it and hung up but what if it turned out to be somebody with important business he picked up his own phone and dialed willis extension to transfer the call analysisthis is heinrich gimpel oh hello heinrichi wanted to talk to willi that was erika dorschs voice heinrich winced he wished hed let the phone ring when he didnt answer right away she asked where is he in a way he didnt like at all he responded with the exact and literal truth you missed him by two minuteshe just went to lunch and he didnt go with you obviously erika said heinrichreally wished he hadnt answered the telephone willis wife went on did he go with the lovely and talented ilse instead i ah didnt see him leave heinrich said which was true in the highly technical sense that hed looked down at the papers on his desk before willi actually opened the door now tell me another one heinrich you arent much of a liar you know erika said the way she meant it that might have been true in several ways she knew nothing about it couldnt have been more wrong that she knew nothing about those several ways proved how wrong it was he said erika im not his father im not his watchdog either i dont keep an eye on him every minute somebody ought to erika dorsch said bitterly is something wrong with me heinrich am i ugly am i unattractive you ought to know better than that he said too surprised at the question not to give her an honest answer should i she said if something isnt wrong with me why have we only made love six or seven times this year why is willi going around with that roundheeled little chippie instead of me i dont know heinrich answered which was also certainly true if hed had a choice betweenbut he didnt have choices like that so what was the point of imagining he did he said dont you think youd do better asking willi he might actually tell you hed tell me a load of garbage thats what hes been telling me all along erika said whats he been telling you thats probably more garbage heinrich pretended not to hear her bad enough to have to listen to both sides in a dissolving marriage to tell tales from one to the otherhe shook his head no he didnt know much about such things but he knew better than that can you get a little time off she asked if you come over here i can tell you how things really are what was that supposed to mean what it sounded like if it did would he kick himself for the rest of his days if he said no most redblooded males would he could arrange things so lise never knew and erika he said gently i dont think that would be a good idea right now no she sounded tragic you mean you dont want me either i he stopped one more question for which there was no safe answer he did his best im married to lise remember i like being married to lise i want to stay married to her he looked around to make sure nobody in the big room was paying too much attention to him he couldnt do anything about anyone who might monitor the call it wouldnt land him in trouble anyhow he consoled himself with that a long long silence followed at last erika said i didnt know people talked that way any more well another silence shes luckier than she knowsor else you cant get it up either the line went dead heinrich stared at the telephone then slowly replaced the handset in the cradle hed been ready to sympathize with erikaeven if he wasnt ready to go to bed with herand to think willi was a louse and a fool for not giving her more of what she obviously wanted but if she kept making cracks like that he didnt see how he could sympathize with either one of themexcept they were both his friends he muttered something that didnt help and trudged off to the canteen susanna weiss loved good food what she didnt love was cooking she should have learning to cook and to be happy cooking was drummed into girls in the greater german reich in school and in the bund deutscher madel with susanna it hadnt taken with susanna the more something was drummed into her the less likely to take it was frozen and freezedried food had come a long way since she was a girl a lot of the advances had been military first nothing was too good for the reich s soldiers and sailors little by little things had trickled out to the civilian world as well a faint stigma still clung to eating such food too often it said you were lazy or you didnt care enough about your family to take care of them yourself being a jew susanna didnt worry about stigmas that were merely faint and she was convinced she had better things to do with her time than stand in front of a stove when she ate in her flat she had frozen or freezedried food most of the time she was eating beef stroganoff that had started life in a plastic pouch when heinz buckliger came on the televisor screen the russians those who were left alive had been pushed east far past the urals some of their recipes lingered on in the germany they couldnt hope to threaten for generations recorded abridged versions of deutschland uber alles and the horst wessel song prefaced the fuhrer s appearance the screen cut to an image of the germanic eagle with a swastika in its claws to the fuhrer s study like so much nazi architecture the room was on a heroic scale that did its best to dwarf the man who occupied it the walls of red marble with ebony wainscoting rose nearly ten meters to the cofferwork ceiling of rosewood the televisor camera panned slowly lovingly along those walls along with gilded party symbols they held portraits of bismarck hitler himmler and a new oneover which the camera lingeredof kurt haldweim looking viennese and aristocratic and more than a little snooty the picture cut away to the fuhrer s desk the cabinetmakers whod created insanely ornate inlaid furniture for french noblemen during the old regime would have owned theyd met their match in the craftsmen who made that desk on the wall behind it hung a genuine gobelin tapestry from the seventeenth century next to the tapestry a german flag hung limply from a pole another gilded swastikabearing eagle topped that pole as the camera shot tightened to the tawny leather chair in which heinz buckliger sat the flag remained at the edge of the picture susanna had seen that whenever she watched a speech from the fuhrer tonight she really noticed it which was not the same thing she gave a grudging nod of approval party propagandists didnt miss a trick of course they associated the head of state with the state itself that they did it so shedidnt consciously notice most of the time was a testimony to their skill then she noticed something else and her eyes widened heinz buckliger was wearing a plain gray suit not a party uniform she couldnt remember the last time shed seen any fuhrer in civilian clothes she wondered if she ever had she didnt think so buckligers necktie was of a red that perfectly matched the flag after a moment she saw it bore a pattern small black swastikas any menswear store might have sold it what did that say what did it mean anyone alert who watched the televisor looked for meanings behind meanings for what was said without a word being spoken what was buckliger trying to get across here all susanna could think of wasim as patriotic as the next fellow but im transposing the tune into a new key good evening citizens of the greater german reich the fuhrer said not long ago in nuremberg i spoke to officials of the national socialist party about some of the problems i see facing the reich and the germanic empire you also need to know some of the things i told them as who in the reich had not susanna had seen films of hitler hed dominated whether screaming for war or vengeance pleading for greater effort or cajoling people into sacrifice himmler whod led greater germany and the empire when she was a child had dominated in a different way his style was flatter than hitlers but you could sense the iron underneath if you caused trouble you would get itin the neck kurt haldweim had talked down to people as if convinced he knew things no one else did if he happened to be wrong who was going to tell him and if he happened to be wrong would he ever admit it not likely heinz buckliger simplyspoke for a good many years now we have been living off the great deeds of our ancestors he said and our ancestorswere great men who did great things but we are like a family that lives off an inheritance from grandpa doesnt take care of its money very well and doesnt have enough people in it who have gone out and looked for work on their own after a while the inheritance runs dry and they have to figure out what to do next i want to try to figure out what to do nextbefore we run dry we have plundered much of the world but how long can that go on many of the folk of western europe and north america are as aryan as we are how long can we justify in racial terms their continued exploitation charlie lynton had said things like that at the gathering of the british union of fascists susanna hadnt expected to hear them from him hearing them from the fuhrer was like a thunderclap like lynton buckliger was using fascist ideology to cloak doing things that would have appalled his predecessors further conquest is not an option for us as it was for hitler and himmler he continued forty years ago we were lucky the united states didnt do us more damage we could bring the empire of japan to its knees tomorrowbut if we did japan would bring us to our knees too both we and the japanese have too many rockets to make war anything but mutual suicide so what are we to do things arent the way they were in our fathers time and they certainly arent the way they were in our grandfathers time do we go on looking at our troubles in the same old way this it seems to me is foolishness when hitler saw the reich with troubles that were new in his time did he answer them the way his parents and grandparents had of course not he changed with the times we must always change with the times or the times will change without us hes doing it again susanna exclaimed too excited to keep quiet fascist ideology didnt lend itself to change what was fascism after all but reaction on the march but like charlie lynton heinz buckliger had seen that if he appealed to wellestablished authority to justify the changes he was making he might have a chance of getting away with them the party bonzen and the party rank and filewere surely listening to him along with everybody else what did they think did they understand what they were hearing or am i the one whos wrongsusanna wonderedam i hearing what i want to hear listening with my heart and not my head the last time shed done that was with the boyfriend whod turned out to be a lush the one heinrich still teased her about every now and then she cursed softly lost in her own thoughts shed missed a few sentences of what buckliger was saying greater responsiveness to the needs and desires of the volk as a whole was where she started paying attention again of course we cannot and will not challenge the primacy of the party and of national socialist ideals but are we not all aryans together when he saidof course he sometimes meant anything but how many people would see that instead of going into detail as shed hoped he would he continued this is a topic i will return to in times to come staying on old ground is always safe and certain that is the reason so many of us like it so well finding a new way is harder we may make mistakes we probably will but if we keep going long enough we will find ourselves in a place we never could have reached by sticking with the tried and true let us make the journey together good night the fuhrer s study vanished from susannas televisor screenfrom televisor screens all over the reich horst witzlebens familiar newsroom replaced it the broadcaster said that was of course heinz buckligerfuhrer of the greater german reich and the germanic empire when witzleben saidof course he meant it he blinked a couple of times before going on an extraordinary address a memorable address the fuhrer set his mark on the reich as he leads us as he guides us so we shall go that is our only properindeed our only possiblecourse a new era is upon us and in times to come as the fuhrer said we shall learn exactly what this means for now good night and i return you to your regularly scheduled programming regularly scheduled programming was a vacuous quiz show to susanna the hardest question was why anyone would watch it people did though she heard them talking about it whatshe wanted to talk about was buckligers speech she hurried to the telephonethe gimpels or the stutzmans she wondered as she picked it up after a moments hesitation though she replaced the handset in the cradle without calling anyone after a speech like that werent the phone lines too likely to be monitored and wasnt she likely to be under some suspicion anyhow as someone who knew the kleins better safe than sorry that wasnt heroic but it was probably smart no one called her that night either heinz buckliger talked about abandoning old ground and striking out in new directions the people living in the greater german reich were only too familiar with the old ground and with its minefields buckliger might lead after so long making such careful calculations could the people follow at the bus stop emma handrick sniffed i saw a little of the speech last night she told alicia gimpel only a little though he didnt look like a fuhrer to me how could he be a fuhrer if he wasnt wearing a uniform seeing heinz buckliger in an ordinary suit had also startled alicia still she said hes the fuhrer all right who else could he be he spoke from the fuhrer s study weve seen it a million times who else could do that what would they do to somebody who tried she didnt quite know whothey might be but there was always athey for such things she had no doubt of that emma sniffed he didnt look like it she had a onetrack mind he looked like a businessman or a salesman in the regimented reich there werent too many groups that didnt wear uniforms of one sort or another he does seem to be something different alicia said her parents had warned her not to talk too much about buckligers speech people might pay unusual attention to what she said since she wasnt sure how much was too much she changed the subject new school year coming up in a couple of weeks thank heavens emma exclaimed i dont care who i get next timeherr kessler thinks hes a concentrationcamp guard not a teacher emma didnt care what she said or who heard it alicia envied her some of the others are just as bad she said theyre pretty bad all right i think you have to be mean to want to be a teacherlook at beast koch emma said i never had her but still kesslers the worst i ever had hes not very good alicia agreed she hadnt had frau koch either and thanked heaven she hadnt she pointed down the street here comes the bus when they got to school they played in the yard till it was time to line up in front of their classroom less than half a minute before the bell rang emma let out a gasp of horror i was going to ask you for your arithmetic homework she said in stricken tones i couldnt do it last night too late now alicia said the clang of the bell confirmed her words herr kessler opened the door guten morgen herr kessler the children chorused hes going to skin me emma whimpered under that chorus alicia could only stand there her friend was all too likely to be right good morning children the teacher said come in now and no talking out of turn in they filed if anybody talked alicia didnt hear it neither did kessler he led them in the salute to the flag their arms shot out alicia remembered how up till this past spring shed been proud to be a german like everybody else part of her still was the rest recoiled in horror from the very idea there were times when she wondered if shed been torn in two inside but she didnt have time to stay torn in two not when herr kessler prowled to the front of the classroom all of her had to pay attention to him how many of you saw the fuhrer s speech last night he asked most of the students hands went up kessler pointed to a boy who hadnt raised his hans dirlewanger jawohl herr kessler hans jumped from his seat and stood stiff and straight why didnt you watch that speech menace lurked in the teachers voice his eyes went to the paddle on the wall sir my father is a captain in the wehrmacht hans answered he came home on leave from occupation duty in the united states we all went out to supper and then to the cinema we didnt get home till late ohherr kessler considered reluctantly he nodded this is acceptable be seated as hans sat down alicia wondered if the teacher would pick on somebody else so he could give out a swat not this morning though kessler paused then found a question what is the most important thing the fuhrer said last night had he asked about arithmetic or history or grammar alicias hand would have shot into the air had he asked about this before she knew what she was she would also have been eager to answer now she hesitated she couldnt help worrying that a mistake would endanger not only her but all the other jews in berlin even the ones of whose existence she was ignorant others werent so shyand had less to worry about the teacher pointed to a girl trudi krebs thats interestingalicia thoughtshe probably hasnt had less to worry about than i do but now that new ways of doing things seemed importantherr kessler thought trudi had the answers before hed wanted to see her and her family in trouble trudi said the fuhrer told us the reich needs to change so it can work better when she put it like that it seemed safe enough the teacher noddedsehr gut he said yes that is exactly what the fuhrer said and so as he leads us we shall change and we shall be better for it do you understand ja herr kessler the children sang out sehr gutkessler said again then let us go on with the days lesson he spoke with a certain amount of relief or so it seemed to alicia did he sometimes think as she did that too much talk of politics might be dangerous if students got answers wrong they got paddled what happened to teachers who got answers about politics wrong maybe herr kessler didnt want to find out he nodded arithmetic then pass in your homework at once no talking behind alicia emma handrick let out a soft gasp of dismay kesslers head swung toward her but he couldnt decide who had made the sound sometimes he punished everyone in the neighborhood if he didnt know just who had got out of line maybe he still felt on unsafe ground today for he looked away but then he said we will do some of the problems at the blackboard he called on alicia and several children who sat near her she knew what he was doing if one of them had no idea what to do he would decide that was the person whod made a noise it wasnt a bad ploy in the unending war between teachers and studentsexcept that he didnt summon emma to the board alicia got her problem right she stood in front of the blackboard till kessler nodded and sent her back to her seat one boy made a mistake but it was a careless obvious kind of mistake he multiplied seven by four and got thirtyfive early in the problem which naturally made his answer wrong other than that he knew what he was doingherr kessler corrected him but didnt haul out the paddle balked the teacher went on with the lesson alicia hated these problems if the german fighter plane flew forty kilometers an hour faster than the american one started from a base sixty kilometers behind it and took off fifteen minutes later how far would it have to go to catch up you had to keep track of everything at once she was good at that kind of thing but even she found it hard she wondered how poor emma who wasnt any too bright was faring after arithmetic came grammarherr kessler passed out worksheets where the student had to identify parts of speech and the cases of nouns and adjectives while they slaved away on those he graded their arithmetic papers alicia was good at arithmetic but she was very very good at grammar she zipped through the paper and finished well ahead of anybody else of course all that got her was the chance to sit quietly till the other children finished too she watched the teacher correcting papers every so often he would look up to see if anyone was getting into mischief and she would have to look away but then he would go back to arithmetic and she would go back to watching him she knew when he got to emmas homework shed got a glimpse of it as they passed papers forward and it was truly hopelessherr kesslers head came up he stared towards emma he might have been a cat spotting a juicy mouse emma handrick he roared emma squeaked in terror shed been intent on her worksheet and hadnt paid attention to what the teacher was doing jawohl herr kessler she said springing to her feet what is the meaning of thisthis dreck you turned in kessler waved the offending paper for everyone to see im very sorryherr kessler emma babbled i tried as hard as i could but i really didnt understand please excuse me please a jew could have done better work than this jews were vile and wicked but they were supposed to be clever you on the other hand the teacher let that hang in the air then added two more words come here he applied the paddle with vigor emma came back to her desk biting back the tears that would have landed her in more trouble she sat down gingerly no one said anything at all at lunchtime trudi krebs sidled up to alicia and whispered when the new fuhrer changes things do you think hell change school too gott im himmeli hope so alicia exclaimed its probably too much to ask for though she hoped trudi would argue with her but the other girl only nodded when the bus out of the stahnsdorf train station pulled up to willi dorschs stop heinrich gimpel got off too what are you doing willi said you dont live hereor if you do erika hasnt told me heh heinrich smiled what he was sure was a sickly smile lise wanted me to pick up some onions and a head of cabbage at tinnachers grocery he pointed toward the store which fortunately lay in the direction opposite willis house a likely story willi said but he didnt sound as if he meant anything by it with a sour laugh he went on hell the way things are why would i care if you were living there instead of me he didnt wait for an answer but headed up the sidewalk toward his house shaking his head heinrich walked over to the corner grocery he was glad lise hadnt sent him after potatoes she inspected every spud he bought and didnt seem to like about half of them harder for him to go wrong with onions and cabbageid never make a hausfraunot in a million years he thought best vegetables in town boasted the sign in tinnachers window guten tag herr gimpel the grocer said as heinrich came in he did have the best vegetables for several kilometers around and he gave unmatched personal service lower prices at bigger stores that sold more kinds of things made staying in business hard for him even so with a certain amount of relief heinrich skirted the bins of potatoes and headed for the onions lise had said she wanted the mild purple ones not the stronger ones with the yellowbrown outer layer intent on the onions heinrich almost bumped into erika dorsch before he noticed she was there if he had noticed her he might have tried to sneak out of the grocery and buy his vegetables somewhere else too late for that now hello erika i didnt mean to run over you there he said fearing his smile here was even sicklier than the one hed given willi hers on the other hand dazzled she had a stringbag full of mushrooms and garlic and scallions and potatoes and a couple of enormous turnips its all right she said any attention is better than none eryes he said feeling as if he were walking into a hornets nest but unable to escape he did his best excuse me please i need some of those purple onions erika didnt step aside heinrich why dont you like me she asked hornets all around sure as hell i like you fine he said i still need onions though you dont act like you like me erika said she said it most pointedlytoo pointedly for him to ignore i like you fine he repeated i also like your husband i also like my wife i like your wife too erika said so what as for my husband youre welcome to him and if you like him the way you like me the security police will sew a pink triangle on your camp uniform for you if he got a camp uniform it would have a yellow star of david not a pink triangle would they bother or if they found out what he was would they just dispose of him like a crumpledup tissue he suspected the latter but he didnt want to find out he said i really do need those onions he supposed he should have said something about not liking erika that way but she would have known he was lying ive never chased a man in my life erika said wonder in her voice up till now i never had to heinrich believed that she eyed him with genuine curiosity what makes you so stubborn im a jewhe thoughtof course im stubborn i have to be if i werent stubborn would i have clung to this he also had to be stubborn about not revealing what he was to anyone who could harm him with the knowledge no matter how decorative erika was she fell into that group she wanted him now or thought she did odds were the challenge he represented interested her more than his skinny body did but if she knew and she decided she didnt want him any morein that case he was one telephone call from disaster since he couldnt tell her his first reason he fell back on the second one i told youi like lise weve been happy together for a long time why do i want to complicate my life life is complicated enough already you make everything sound so sensible so logical erika shook her head it isnt not really part of him knew she was right but he clung to rationality anyhowclung to it all the harder perhaps because it offered something of a shield against the horrors the german regime had perpetrated i try to make it that way for me anyhow he said she eyed him for a moment then shook her head youll find out she said and pushed past him to give her money to herr tinnacher heinrich didnt like the sound of that he also didnt like her going home with a stringbag full of vegetables willi was liable to think theyd arranged a meeting at the grocers heinrich sighed he couldnt do anything about that he could get the onions and the cabbage he took them up to tinnacher the grocer weighed them told him what they cost took his fivereichsmark note and handed him change since heinrich didnt have a sack of his own tinnacher grudgingly pulled one out from under the counter finelooking womanfrau dorsch he remarked as he put the purple onions in on top of the cabbage cant argue with you there heinrich said if she set her sights on me i wouldnt complainherr tinnacher chuckled rheumily he was in his midsixties and looked like a wizened frog the chance that erika would set her sights on him was better than the chance that he would win the state lottery but it wasnt much better of course without evidence to the contrary heinrich would have said the same about the chance of her setting her sights on him but he had that evidence even if he didnt want it he also had to answer the grocer were just friends he said tinnacher chuckled again that knowing little croak was one of the most obscene sounds heinrich had ever heard it said tinnacher didnt believe a word of it heinrich got out of the grocery so fast he almost left the sack with the cabbage and onions on the counter when he came home he thrust the sack at lise heres your damned vegetables he snarled im sorry she said in surprise if youd told me it would be a problem i would have gone and bought them myself its not the vegetables he said i ran into erika at the grocers oh his wife packed a lot of meaning into one word and she packed a lot of meaning into two words too shes not happy with willi shes not happy with anything heinrich said would she be happy with you lise asked it doesnt matter i wouldnt be happy with her he answerednot for more than half an hour anyway the animal part of him was harder to extinguish than he wished it were uhhuh the look in lises eye said she knew all about that part and would you say the same thing if you were agoy she dropped her voice at the last word which was one jews could safely use only around other jews heinrich winced it was a much better question than he wished it were instead of answering directly he took two bottles of beer out of the refrigerator opened them and gave lise one here he said raising the bottle he still held heres to us i know when im well off youd better she told him she knew he hadnt really answered her he could tell she undoubtedly knew why too but she drank with him even so if that wasnt love he had no idea what to call it she said i cant be too annoyed at you sheis pretty and you do seem to have some idea where you belong some i should hope so heinrich said fervently too fervently so it seemed because his wife started to laugh you also overact she told him and swigged from the beer who me he saidoveracting lise laughed louder changing the subject looked like a good idea so he did how are the children he waited to see if lise would let him get away with it she did answering theyre fine alicia isso glad shes getting out of herr kesslers class soon i dont blame her a bit either ive talked with the man a few times he wishes he belonged in the ss do you know what i mean oh yes heinrich nodded i had a couple like that myself theyre the lords of the classroom and dont they know it alicia asked if the new fuhrer s changes would have anything to do with schools lise said how do you answer a question like that i dont know usually works pretty well he said she made a face at him he held up a hand im serious sweetheart who can tell which way buckligers going to go with this stuff hes already talked more about changing things than anybody who came before him will he do more than talk can he get away with more his wife shrugged who knows well find out and how are erikas children she brought the question out casually which only made it more dangerous i dont know heinrich said which was the truth she didnt talk about them uhhuh lise said again not quite mene mene tekel upharsin but a judgment just the same viii like the rest of the jews in the greater german reich lise gimpel had never been to never even seen high holy days services shed heard about going to a synagogue to celebrate the new year and the day of atonement from her grandfather being able to worship openly struck her as even more amazing than the holidays themselves she couldnt so much as fast on yom kippurdont do anything to get yourself noticed was a jews unbreakable rule if say roxane askedwhy arent you eating mommy how could she answer whatever she said her daughter might tell a school friend shed stayed hungry all day long if that reached the wrong earseven so small a thing could mean disaster and so she ate breakfast with everybody else and silently apologized to god heinrich no doubt was doing the same thing by the somber expression on alicias face so was she lise had told her what the holidays were and what they meant and how they were supposed to be celebrated if only that were possible francesca and roxane ate pancakes and sausage without the slightest idea that today was different from any other day heinrich got to his feet and grabbed his attache case im off he said ill see you all tonight collecting kisses all around he hurried out the door it closed behind him lise sighed and smiled at the same time she didnt worry about him running off with erika dorsch or anybody else even if she teased him he wasnt the sort to leave unfinished anything he started if his eyes sometimes wanderedwell he was a man his hands and more to the point his heart didnt come on eat up lise told the girls then get out of your nightgowns and into school clothes i know you dont have to leave as early as daddy does but you cant lie around eating grapes all day either she got giggles from the younger two girls and a disdainful sniff from alicia who said youve used that one before mommy lise wasnt about to put up with literary criticism before eight in the morning especially when she hadnt finished her coffee the biggest advantage she saw to not fasting on yom kippur was that she didnt have to miss it she said i dont care whether i have or not its still true get moving alicia was the one she had to bully the one a bird or a book or anything else might distract from the business at hand francesca could barely grunt before ten but she did what she had to do on automatic pilot roxane liked mornings probably because her sisters didnt lise got them out the door in good time she always did and she always breathed a sigh of relief once they were gone tooespecially today she thought the day of atonement she wanted to herself had things been different gathering with her fellow jews would have been sweet but though they got together on minor holidays like purim they didnt dare meet on the big ones someone might be watching might be listening might be wondering you never could tell she sat down in front of the televisor it was off she left it off too she didnt want any distractions not while she was doing her best to forgive the people whod troubled her during the past year in spite of her earlier forgiving thoughts about heinrich she wasnt surprised when erika rose to the top of the list lises smile was slightly sour erika couldnt help being what she was any more than a tiger could things around a tiger had a way of ending up dead things around erika methodically lise went through the rest of the list starting with herr kessler whod vexed her because he vexed alicia and ending with the cleaner who had returned a linen blouse with a scorch mark and without two buttons then she took on the hard one she attempted every yom kippur to forgive the german people shed never done it not in her heart shed never even come close and she knew it that wasnt only because their crimes were so enormous either worse they had no idea theyd committed crimes they were convinced they walked the path of truth and justice and righteousness if they didnt see they had anything to atone for what was the point to forgiving them was there any not that shed ever been able to see this yearthis year for the first time since she was a girl she wondered heinz buckliger seemed to have some idea that the reich and the volk of the reich didnt come to their dominant position in the world with hands perfectly clean if the fuhrer thought the german people stood in need of atonement for some thingswell how much did that mean buckliger hadnt said a word about jews not in his speech on the televisor and not in anything else heinrich and walther had been able to uncover but he had cast some doubt on the overwhelming importance of aryan blood and how much didthat mean i want to hope lise murmured to herself and possibly to god its been so long iwant to hope willi dorsch glowered in mock severityheinrich gimpel hoped the severity was mock anywayas he climbed aboard the bus that would carry heinrich and him to the stahnsdorf train station he sat down next to heinrich and demanded well what have you got to say for yourself did he know had erika been as forthright as she often was or had he just added two and two and come up withsurprise four if he did know he was going to have to come out and say so well how does good morning sound heinrich answered itll do with a grin willi thumped him on the back better than a lot of things you could have told me im so glad heinrich hoped irony would keep willi from noticing he was telling the exact and literal truth having got away with one question he tried another and how are you today i could be worse i have been worse i probably will be worse again before too long willi answered heinrich concluded he and erika hadnt fought during the night the way things had been going with them that was indeed something his friend went on how about yourself me i just go on from day to day heinrich said that was true enough getting through the high holy days every year reminded him of just how true it was just go on from day to day willi repeated and sighed gustily christ i wish i could say the same i never know if tomorrow will blow up in my face neither do iheinrich thoughtand youre talking about your marriage im talking about my life hed grown very used to thinking things he couldnt say what he could say was i hope everything turns out all right youre a good fellow you know that willi sounded a little maudlin or maybe more than a little as he might have after too much to drink but this morning he didnt smell like a distillery and he didnt wince at every noise and every sunbeam like a man with a hangover maybe he really was just glad to have a friend and how glad would he be after a few illchosen words from erika those words evidently hadnt come maybe they wouldnt heinrich dared hope in the reich the mere act of hoping washad to bean act of courage for a jew with a shrug heinrich said all i know is ive got too much work waiting for me at the office ha who doesnt willi said our section could have twice as many people in it and wed still be behind of course if the new fuhrer cuts the assessments in the empire the way hes been talking about well all end up out of work do you think he will heinrich asked with even more genuine curiosity than he dared show me im not going to try and guess along with him any more no sir willi said i was wrong a couple of times and all that proves is i shouldnt do it the bus pulled into the train station heinrich and willi hurried off they both paused to buy copies of the volkischer beobachter from a vending machine then went to the platform to catch the commuter train into berlin they sat side by side reading the paper heinrich as usual went through it methodically willi was a butterfly flitting from story to story he found as many interesting tidbits as heinrich did and sometimes found them faster americans question assessment he said pointing to a piece on page five heinrich who hadnt got there on his own yet flipped to the story he read it then shook his head they can question but it wont do them much good he said the occupying authorities will collect their pound of flesh one way or another ah a pound of flesh willi laughed wistfully i remember how much fun that used to be heinrich winced at the pun maybe that wince was what made him ask what about ilse normally he would think such a thing but he wouldnt say it the wry joke had made him drop some of his defenses he didnt like that he couldnt afford to drop them even for an instant willi blinked he hadnt expected the question any more than heinrich had expected to ask it after a pause when heinrich wondered if he would answer at all he said ilses sweet and shes good in bed but its not the same you know what i mean ithink so heinrich said he thought about making love with a nearstranger after so long with lise and nobody else yes that would be very odd especially the first few times then he thought about making love with erika who was after all anything but a stranger what wouldthat be likecut it out he told himself sternly most of him listened youre lucky being happy where you are willi said and dove back into the newspaper yes i suppose i am heinrich said which was certainly the truth for he would have been stuck where he was whether he was happy or not divorce drew notice to a couple even these days jews mostly stayed married no matter how badly they got along a lot ofgoyim did the same thing willi said if it werent for the kids and if it werent for the way people look at you funny afterwards erika and i would have split up by now hell we may yet in spite of all that stuff i hope not heinrich said which was true for all kinds of reasons his friend didnt understand he chose one willi would if you guys broke up wed have to find somebody else to beat at bridge ha whathave you been smoking that touched willis pride where a lot of other gibes wouldnt have and if he thought of heinrich as a rival at the card table maybe he wouldnt worry about him any other way the train pulled into south station heinrich and willi rode the escalators to the upper level where they caught the bus to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters heinrich went to his desk with more than a little apprehensionnot only because now he knew willi was sleeping with ilse but also because the americans were acting up when they did that they made his job harder he had enough other things to worry about without trouble from the far side of the atlantic but sure as hell four people came up to him in the first hour he was there all of them with the beobachter in their hands they all wanted to know what the yankees would do and what the reich would do to them after they did it well have to wait and see heinrich said again and again which satisfied no one he said the same thing to two more men on the telephone one was a lieutenant general a man who disliked ambiguity of any sort dammit i need to know if were going to move or not the officer growled so do i sir heinrich answered the general swore and hung up when the telephone rang again heinrich felt like swearing too budget analysisgimpel speaking he said good morning to youherr gimpel this is charlie cox calling from omaha the americans german was fluent but had the flat accent englishspeakers gave the language i know your nameherr cox you are in the department of the treasurynicht wahr what can i do for you today you can tell me how serious herr buckliger is about a new deal for the different parts of the germanic empire cox didnt beat around the bush and that of course would bethe question in the eyes of any american administrator it was alsothe question or at least closely related tothe question in heinrichs eyes it happened to be one he couldnt answer either for charlie cox or for himself im very sorryherr cox he said and meant it i dont make policy i just implement it when someone else has made it cox grunted well i dont suppose i really could have expected you to say anything else but youve got to have some kind of idea about how things will work out youre a hell of a lot closer there than we are here if i knew i would tell you heinrich answered and he might even have meant that but im afraid i dont the person who sets policy whom i mentioned a moment ago is the fuhrer no one else when he decides what he wants to do we will do it do it to us cox muttered in english heinrich was less fluent in that language than say susanna weiss but he spoke it well enough even though the empire ran on german english came in handy for dealing with americans charlie cox had just put his life in heinrichs hands sooner or later we will all see what the fuhrer has in mind heinrich said while true that was unlikely to be comforting in the meantime i suggest you pay your assessments promptly that way there wont be any unfortunate incidents both sides might regret incidents we would regret a hell of a lot more than the reich does cox dared say that in german probably heinrich agreed the losing side does have a way of regretting incidents more than the winners if we didnt know that alreadyherr gimpel the past forty years would have proved it to us cox said auf wiedersehen he hung up from his desk a couple of meters away willi dorsch asked the americans heinrich nodded oh yes did you expect anything else they want to see how much they can get away with too who doesnt these days willi said if we had any jews left theyd be trying to persuade us they were good aryans too he laughed at the absurdity of the notion heinrich laughed too but the shriek inside didnt go away one of these days he would have an ulceror a stroke a stroke had killed his father things came back to haunt you one way or another ilse set some envelopes and a small package on his desk morning mail deliveryherr gimpel she said thank you he answered hardly looking up she went over to willis desk and gave him the same sort of stuff heres yours willi she purred in a bedroom voice thanks sweetie he made as if to grab her laughing she spun away heinrich punched keys on his calculator with altogether needless violenceif youre going to have an office romance cant you at least pretend youre not he wonderedit makes life easier for everyone around youespecially people who know your wife a moment later another question crossed his mindam i angry at willi or am i just jealous he shook his head he didnt want ilse but the idea of having his choice between two women he did wanthe shook his head again annoyed at himself for poking beneath the surface purely in the abstractor so most of him insistedhe liked that idea pretty wellmaybe i am jealous of willi after all alicia gimpel liked the idea of a new year that began around the end of summer a new year that corresponded to the beginning of the new school year she liked it so well she wished she could talk about it with her sisters and her friends but her mother and father had both warned against that you never can tell who might be listening or what they might know her father had said she could see how that made sense but she didnt like it on the day the new school year started she and everybody else whod put up with herr kessler seemed happy enough even without a real new years celebration at the bus stop emma handrick said i feel like they just let me out of a camp whatever happens now it cant be worse he was awful all right alicia agreed she turned to francesca who stood close by with a bigsisterly combination of concern and sadism she said maybeyoull have him next year youre mean francesca said shrilly ive got frau koch this year isnt that bad enough getting stuck with the beast is pretty bad all right alicia spoke with sincere but detached sympathy she hadnt been unlucky enough to have frau koch herself emma said i wonder what this herr peukert is like hes new nobody knows anything about him yet the noise of a motor made her look down the street she nodded to herselfthe bus was coming whatever hes like he cant be worse than kessler she spoke with the conviction of someone whod been paddled more often than she thought she should have the schoolyard held more confusion than usual that morning with students lining up in front of unfamiliar roomsand with new kindergartners not sure they should line up at all their teachers came out early and shouted them into place alicia smiled at the little kids from the height of justturnedeleven it had of course been a million years ago whenshe had so little idea of what to do even roxane was starting first grade now guten morgen kindera mans voice close by made alicia forget the kindergartners and her little sister too guten morgen herr peukert she said along with the rest of the fifthgraders in her line somebodyshe couldnt see whosaid guten morgen herr kessler out of habit that drew a few giggles from children close by but the chorus must have drowned it out for the new teacher since he didnt react alicia sized him up he was very tallwithin a couple of centimeters of two meters was he taller than her father she thought so the resemblance ended with heightherr peukert was blond and bronzed and broadshouldered he held himself so straight he might have had a ramrod in place of his spine behind alicia emma breathed oh isnt he gorgeous under the new teachers iceblue stare several of the boys in line tried to stand straighter themselves before taking the class inside peukert called off names from the roll book he carried he looked at the students as they answered matching faces to names alicia looked back steadily when he came to hers she wasnt thinking of herself as a jew just then only as somebody wondering what the next yeara very long time for a fifthgraderwould be like here emma said when herr peukert called her name next her voice held a funny catch alicia had never heard in it before she looked back over her shoulder emma was gazing at the new teacher with what could only be adoration alicia had never before found a recognizable thing to go with the word now she did when herr peukert finished calling the roll he led the class into the room the children sat down in the same alphabetical order theyd used to take their places in line then they rose to give the flag the party salute and to call out heil buckliger daily rituals accomplished they sat down again alicia didnt expect much to happen on the first day of the new school year and she proved rightherr peukert talked a little about what he expected them to learn in the upcoming term ask questions he urged them things are changing what we used to think we were sure of isnt always so clear any more some people think this is exciting it frightens others however you feel though it wont go away any time soon youd better get used to it he passed out arithmetic books grammar books books of stories and geography books to the students alicia filled out a white card and a blue card for each textbook giving her name her teachers name the title of the book and the condition of the copy she had the cards warned her that her parents would have to pay if she damaged the book questionherr peukert trudi krebs raised her hand go ahead trudi the teacher said alicia nodded impressed in spite of herself one way students judged teachers was by how fast they learned the names of the children in their class peukert was doing well sir where are our history books trudi asked that flabbergasted alicia shed been so busy filling out cards and sneaking glances at the books she had got she hadnt noticed one was missing she made a facenot quite what her parents annoyed her by calling her angry face but close she didnt like missing things not one bit herr peukert took the question in stride i told you things are changing theyre writing a new history book but it isnt done yet so i cant give you that one theyve decided the old one isnt so good so i cant give you that one either for a while well make do without one how could things in history change that flummoxed alicia all over again either theyd happened or not right so it seemed to her or did the teacher mean the new history book would get rid of some lies in the old one that would be good if it happened she didnt suppose she could ask him if the old book was full of lies too bad questionherr peukert that was emma handrick alicia wanted to poke a finger in her ear emma never asked questions she didnt care enough about schoolexcept when it came to avoiding the paddleto bother with them and then alicia understood emma still didnt care about school she cared about herr peukert go ahead the teacher said he didnt remember emmas name right away as he had with trudis emma must have noticed she was noticing everything about him but she plowed ahead anyway herr peukert is the fuhrer always right there was a question to make politically alert people sit up and take notice trudi krebs stared at emma so did wolfgang priller who liked the way things always had been much better than trudi seemed to emma was oblivious all shed wanted was to make the teacher pay attention to her shed done thatherr kessler would have said yes and gone about his businessherr peukert looked thoughtful by emmas soft sigh that made him seem more intriguing slowly he said when he speaks as the head of the reich or the head of the party he tells us which way we need to go and we need to follow him when hes just talking as a manwell any man can be wrong even youalicia thoughtherr kessler never would have admitted anything like that not in a million years alicia had always liked school she soaked up learning the way a sponge soaked up water but the days ahead looked a lot more interesting than the ones with herr kessler that shed just suffered through when they went out for lunch emma sighed and looked back over her shoulder toward the classroom isnt he wonderful she said hesnot bad alicia answered the one was higher praise from her than the other was from emma susanna weiss had always watched the evening news with interest if she wanted to know what was going on in the reich and the world or what the powers that be wanted people to think was going onnot always the same thing or even close to it that was the place to start since kurt haldweims death shed watched the news with fascination which also wasnt the same thing good evening horst witzleben said from her televisor screen the set from which he spoke hadnt changed neither had his uniform but something about him had susanna had needed a while to notice it let alone figure out what it was before heinz buckliger became fuhrer witzleben had talked to the people of the greater german reich now he talkedwith them the difference was subtle but she was convinced it was real she glanced down at the quiz she was grading most of her undergraduates wouldnt have recognized a subtlety if it walked up and bit them in the legwould i when i was twenty she wondered without false modesty she thought she would have done better than they could of course she was a jew spotting subtleties helped keep her alive she scrawled not necessarily in red beside a sweeping generalization then paused with her pen frozen a couple of centimeters above the page how did she know none of her students was a jew she didnt all she knew was none of them came from a family she was acquainted with given how secretive jews had to be that didnt prove a thing there could be another little jewish community in berlin parallel to hers but unaware it existed if that went on for a few hundred years and then they got to come out into the light of day once more would one group recognize the other as jews or would their beliefs have changed so much in isolation that one saw the other as nothing but a pack of heretics susanna laughed at herself talk about building castles in the air shed not only lost the thread of the students argument such as it was shed also lost track of what horst was saying pretty impressive woolgathering especially when what shed wondered about was so completely unprovableto say nothing of unlikely the picture cut away to an advertisement for volkswagens and she realized the whole lead story had gone in one ear and out the other it had beensomething to do with banditry in the caucasus she thought she wouldnt have sworn to it in one ear and out the other all right mercifully the singing advertisement ended horst witzlebens handsome regular features returned to the screen he said the fuhrer announced today that a division of occupation troops will soon return to the reich from the united statesherr buckliger said the situation no longer calls for so large a force in a country nearly as aryan as our own susanna frowned not very long before buckliger had questioned whether aryan blood really mattered as much as party doctrine said it did now he was using it as an excuse to pull soldiers back from the usa what did he really think about it did he have any consistent beliefs or was he just grabbing whatever tools came to hand for a given job before susanna could decide what she thought about that witzleben went on in london charles lynton the recently chosen head of the british union of fascists applauded the fuhrer s move the newsreaders face disappeared again to be replaced by charlie lyntons boyish visage in pretty good german lynton said this important step can only lead to better relations between the reich and the states that make up the germanic empire recognizing the proud history of many of these statesherr buckliger begins to give them some say in their internal affairs for which i applaud him instead of returning to witzleben the camera cut away to an advertisement for agfa cameras and film that gave susanna a moment to scratch her head and think was buckliger really giving the usa any say in its internal affairs shed taken the troop transfer as a costcutting measure thered been a lot of those lately but maybe lynton had a point with fewer wehrmacht soldiers around to point guns at their heads the americans would be able to do more as they pleased with less fear of having their actions forcibly overruled when the advertisement ended horst witzleben came back on camera the leaders of france denmark and finland were also quick to express their unreserved approval for herr buckligers order their photos came up on the screen but they didnt get quoted as charlie lynton had witzleben continued and the king of italy and the duce both termed the fuhrer s move a positive step in other news that chorus of approval and applause didnt sound as if it had sprung from nowhere it sounded as if heinz buckliger had carefully orchestrated it ahead of time while witzleben showed horrific footage of a train wreck in hungary susanna wondered what that meant if it was true it struck her that buckliger was a politician of a sort that no previous fuhrer except maybe hitler in his early days had ever needed to be she took that for a good sign but then she frowned again why did buckliger need to be that kind of politician where hitler through most of his career himmler and haldweim hadnt the only answer that occurred to her was that buckliger was facing opposition of a sort his predecessors had never met theyd ordered and been obeyed he was ordering too but it also seemed he was cajoling and maneuvering in ways they hadnt had to hitler invented party doctrine or most of itsusanna thoughthimmler and haldweim believed in it they didnt rock the boatthough there were long stretches when haldweim didnt do much of anything buckligers different buckliger isrocking it sure as hell no wonder the old guards unhappy and no wonder he has towhats the english phrase to wheel and deal thats it if he doesnt hes in trouble witzlebens next story was a tribute to the gauleiter of bavaria a paunchy jowly whitehaired man in a gorgeous uniform who was finally retiring after leading the party organization in his state for more than forty years and there was heinz buckliger shaking his hand as he stepped down herr strauss contributions cannot be overestimated the fuhrer said graciously he served the reich and the party long and well new blood comes though such is the way of nature buckliger said no more than that he let pictures do the rest of the work for him there he stood strong and vigorous next to the doddering official whod been in charge for so longwhich would you rather see over you the image asked without words doing something like that would never have occurred to gray astringent kurt haldweim for one thing hed been even older than strauss old enough to have fought in the second world war for another all through his long rule hed never believed in putting anybody out to pasture and for a third he like himmler had taken the televisor largely for granted buckliger didnt like hitler long before him he understood exactly how much pictures could do susanna wished she hadnt thought of it that way she wanted to like buckliger wanted to trust him wanted to believe him wanted to reckon him a new star in the nazi firmament he was different from anything shed ever known but did that make himreally different did it make himbetter hitler after all had been dead for years before she was born she shook her head the longer hitler stayed in charge of things the more power hed gathered into his own hands buckliger seemed to be going in the opposite direction he hadnt quashed charlie lynton for proclaiming his allegiance to the first edition the democratic edition of mein kampf hed even talked about it himself and sosusanna wonderedthe devil can cite scripture for his purpose shakespeare wasnt quite medieval english when the quotation occurred to her she had to look it up to see which play it came from she shivered when she found it it was from the merchant of venice when heinrich gimpel found something he could sink his teeth into he worked like a man possessed his surroundings all but disappeared leaving nothing but the numbers he was manipulating his right hand dancing on the calculator or the keypad of the computer keyboard and the figures going up on the screen the only reason he looked up from this particular blitz of calculations was to take another sheet full of raw data out of his inbox when he did he saw the office full of ss men in camouflage smocks assault rifles at the ready all the guns seemed to point straight at him he froze the sheet of paper still between thumb and forefinger willi dorsch burst out laughing a couple of the ss men grinned too whats the matter heinrich willi said didnt you even notice them come in uh no heinrich said sheepishly willi laughed some more i didnt think so the way you were working there the world could have ended and youd never have known the difference what went through heinrichs mind wasoh thank god maybe they havent come for me then he took another less horrified look at the big blond hardfaced men when he didnt see them with eyes full of terror the muzzles of their assault rifles pointed every which way uh he still couldnt avoid that dismayed stutter whatare they doing here then before willi could answer heinz buckliger strode into the room along with everybody else at a desk heinrich sprang to his feet he drew himself up as straight as he could his right arm shot out heil buckliger he bawled at the top of his lungs he remained in place frozen like a statue casually the fuhrer returned the salute even more casually he waved to the men in the analysis section relax he said sounding much more like a human being than an icon this isnt anything fancy im here to pick somebodys brain thats all he peered down at a piece of paper then up then down at the paper againits an office plan heinrich realizedhes comparing the plan to the room and then to his amazement buckligers eyes met his youre gimpelnicht wahr the fuhrer said for a mad moment heinrich wanted to deny it clearly that wouldnt do he managed to mumble uh ja mein fuhrer heinz buckliger seemed used to people mumbling and stammering when they spoke to him good he said i want to talk with you about the americans he snagged the chair by heinrichs desk with his ankle pulled it closer and sat down in it by how much can we reduce their assessment to let their economy breathe a little easier and still keep ours going noticing heinrich still stood at attention he waved him to his chair he also waved to the rest of the people in the office relax i told you go back to work pretend im not here with those triggerhappy ss guards eyeing everybody that wouldnt be easy heinrich dizzily sank into his seat of itself the calculating part of his mind engaged the fuhrer s question even as another part of him wailedthis cant be happening he heard himself saying well sir a lot of that depends on how much the americans think they can get away with not paying if you let up on them theyre looking for signs of weakness i dont want to be weak buckliger said i do want the reich to be able to stand on its own two feet without being propped up so much from outside that sets a bad example and it sets a bad precedent too dont you think he cocked his head to one side heinrich realized he really was waiting for an answeri want the reichto grow like an onionwith its head in the ground no he couldnt very well say thatja mein fuhrer was less truthful but much safer as for the numbershis right hand flying on automatic pilot cleared the figures hed been working with and started entering the ones that would let him answer buckligers question you have the data at your fingertips the fuhrer said approvingly thats good thats very good efficient thank you sir assuming the americans will keep on paying the same percentage of a lower assessment as they do of the current one i would say you could reduce it by his voice trailed off as his fingers flew on the keypad he considered the answer the computer had given him then passed it to buckliger by about nine percent those are the figures from the machine right buckliger said heinrich nodded the fuhrer asked whats your personal opinion of them that if you reduce the proposed assessment by nine percent youll get back fifteen to twenty percent less thats if you dont go out and take the full assessment by force give the americans a centimeter and theyll take a kilometer i want to use less force in america not more buckliger said since he was moving a division back to the reich heinrich believed him he went on all right then to get nine percent less revenue from the americans by how much would i have to reduce the assessment that was a genuinely interesting question this is only an estimate you understand heinrich warned as he started stroking the keypad again the computer is very good with numbers not so good at figuring out how much people are liable to cheat aber naturlichthe fuhrer laughed we need other people for that uh yes sir heinrich said then he gave his attention back to the screen designing a function on the fly to figure out how much more enthusiastically the americans would cheat if they saw their risks as diminished was nothing hed ever tried before but he did it he punched enter one last time looked at the answer on the screen and slowly nodded to himself id say a formal cut of six percentmein fuhrer would give you an actual cut of nine buckliger nodded sounds reasonabledanke schon your numbers about what id figured for myself heinrich wondered how to take that he didnt think buckliger could have made these calculations for himself the new fuhrer had been a bureaucrat but not that kind of bureaucrat but buckliger didnt sound as if he were just trying to make himself sound clever after a moment heinrich realized working out how much the americans were likely to cheat wasnt only a mathematical calculation it was also a political calculation and if anybody could make political calculations the fuhrer was or needed to be the man happy to help sir heinrich said his own interior calculations hadnt taken more than a second and a half heinz buckliger gave him another one of those imjustaregularfellow smiles good i like to have clever people working for me it keeps the wheels going round he got to his feet and nodded to the ss troopers come on boys now we go and talk with field marshal tetzlaff out they went some of the guards preceding buckliger the rest following a considerable silence reigned in the room after the fuhrer left heinrich tried to get back to what hed been doing beforehand but discovered he couldnt not when everybody was staring at him he simply sat there dazed the two thoughts that kept going round and round in his head were oh thank godi got away with it and lise will never believe this not in a million years well well willi said at last you and field marshal tetzlaff is it and he came to see you first not too shabbyherr gimpel no sir not too shabby he got to his feet and saluted as he had a few minutes earlier for the fuhrer that roused the berliners almost automatic cynicism in heinrich ohquatsch he said the room exploded in laughter people came over to pound him on the back and shake his hand ilse perched on a corner of his desk showing a lot of leg she eyed him with frank calculation shed never looked at him that way before he didnt particularly want her looking at him that way now im supposed to be invisible dammithe thoughthow can i be invisible when people keepnoticing me he felt absurdly indignant seriously heinrich my boy id say your promotion chances just got themselves a kick in the pants willi didnt sound serious he was grinning to heinrichs relief his friend also didnt sound jealous willi went on i can just see your next performance review theres the examiner looking over what youve done ach jaconsulted with the fuhrer what can he say aboutthat i dont know if hes like most performance examiners hell find something rude heinrich answered he hadnt meant it for a joke but everybody laughed someone the fuhrer consulted had to be a very funny fellow heinrich reached for the telephone excuse me please im going to call my wife ilse stopped posing she got down from his desk and stomped back to willis heinrich thoughtthat was funny he dialed for an outside line when the dial tone shifted he called his home numberbitte lise said hi sweetheart its me heinrich said youll never guess who just came in the fuhrer came to see a friend of mine last week esther stutzman told her boss with what she hoped was pardonable pride dr dambach nodded he never seemed to get very excited about anything good for your friend he answered now i also know some people who have met him though i havent myself neither have i esther had never imagined wanting to meet the ruler of the greater german reich and the germanic empire either but maybe buckliger was different maybe even wondering felt not only strange but also more than a little unnatural ive been doing something interesting dr dambach said oh whats that esther asked as she was plainly meant to do whatever it was it didnt involve the coffeemaker what the pediatrician thought interesting there was liable to seem ghastly to anybody else some of the things hed done trying to fix coffee merited the word lately though the coffeemaker had been fine when he spoke esther wished hed spent his time messing with the machine for he said do you remember how the kleins genealogy charts had two different versions he made it a casual question for he didnt know how important it was to esther yes i do she answeredim not likely to forget went through her headyou didnt know it but you were trying to kill me too and he still was still in perfect ignorance well ive been going through some of the other patients charts to see if i can find more with the same problem i certainly hope not esther exclaimed dr dambach would reckon the horror in her voice a horror of disorder and illegality the sort of horror he had himself and indeed she was acquainted with that horror in her everyday life but what made her voice go high and shrill now was old and deeper and lessless germanic it was raw fear fear of disaster fear of death she had to fight to hold it in check as she asked havehave you found any dr dambach paused to sip from the cup of coffee shed made for him that only gave her a few more seconds to worry and to try to remember whether walther had had to change anybody elses pedigree she didnt think so no she didntthink so but doubt tore at her maybe shed forgotten maybe hed done it without bothering to tell her it wouldnt have seemed that important at the time now it loomed as big as the world the pediatrician set down the foam cup as a matter of fact yes he said deliberately and esther wanted to sink down through the floor but then he went on not quite like the klein babys case though esther dared breathe again if barely whats the difference she asked the question was dangerous but it had to come out dr dambach wouldnt read too much into itwould he hed all but invited ithadnt he he took another sip of coffee was he trying to drive her crazy if he was he was doing a bangup job he set the cup on his desk again the kleins charts showed two different family trees so it made me wonder whether they had more jews in their ancestry than they were willing to admit he said and cocked his head to one side waiting for her response she made herself nod i rememberim not likely to forget i almost got them killed i almost got more of my friends killed and my family and me the nod showed only polite agreement none of the nightmare underneath came out i havent found any more cases like that dambach repeated i hope not esther repeated herself too youd better not her knees didnt want to hold her up she felt giddy with relief but what have you found you said youd found something i have found that people will lie even when there is no good reason for them to lie the pediatrician looked as disgusted as if hed discovered maggots on a dressing that was supposed to be sterile i have found people inventing inflated ancestries for themselves people trying to connect themselves with noble familiesone family even trying to connect itself to the hitlers all of the forgeries are inept many of them are pathetic but they riddle the files why he looked at esther as if he really believed she had an answer she did the best she could there are people who want to seem more important than they really are its so stupid dr dambach said and it could be dangerous to them too if i think a childs ancestry is different from what it really is im liable to make the wrong diagnosis dont people think ofthat most of them probably dont esther said working for the pediatrician had gone a long way toward convincing her most people thought very littlecertainly less than shed believed when she took the job then because she couldnt help herself she asked what are you going to do about these fake pedigrees she knew she probably should have left well enough alone but her boss had reported the kleins without a second thought would he prove as hard on people he didnt suspect of being jews ive already done it as a matter of fact he said ive talked with the reichs genealogical office they want me to forward some of the more serious cases of abuse to them for possible prosecution and they suggested i write an article for a medical journal alerting other physicians to the problem esther eyed him with reluctant respect he did what he thought was right no matter whom it involved she could wish he didnt think getting rid of jews was right how many people in the reich didnt though pitifully few that was probably the hardest part of being a jew in berlin these days everyone you met was sincerely and honestly convinced you had no right to exist asking any more questions might have made dambach wonder why she was so curious instead she said im sure the article will be very interesting articles in journals are not supposed to be interesting they are supposed to be informative dambach said a touch of frost in his voice why not both esther asked the pediatrician shook his head that would not be goodfrau stutzman i have occasionally seen an article that is frivolous and who could hope to learn from such a thing he was serious himself as serious as he wanted medical articles to be esther couldnt understand it she thought she would learn more from an article that was entertaining as well as factfilled that anyone could think otherwise hadnt occurred to her but dr dambach did arguing with the boss when his mind was made up struck her as one of the more pointless things she could do instead she went back out to the receptionists desk and worked on billing and medical records till patients started coming in out of curiosity she looked at some of the genealogical records in the charts she soon saw that dr dambach was right some of the pedigrees were faked and pretty obviously fakedfoolishness she thought the kleins and her own family had the best of good reasons for tampering with their ancestries what was more important than survival but changing a greatgrandfather for the sake of vanity what was that what could it be but the urge to buy a mercedes if your neighbor had a new audi she almost didnt notice the outer door to the waiting room open but the yowl of a baby brought her back to the real world in a hurry she closed a chart and looked out ohguten morgen frau baumgartner she said how is little dietrich today teethingfrau baumgartner answered she would have been a pretty strawberry blond if she hadnt had dark circles under her eyes he never wants to sleep any more and if he doesnt sleep i cant sleep either i hope the doctor can give me something to make him more comfortable i hope so too esther said your appointment isnt till a quarter to ten though you know frau baumgartner nodded ja i do know but i thought that if i got here early i might get to see the doctor early too sometimes things did work out like that sometimes they didnt i cant promise you anything not yet esther said if some of the people with earlier appointments dont show up though little dietrich jammed his fingers into his mouth somehow he managed to let out an earsplitting howl despite the obstruction his mother looked frazzled oh i hope they dont she said fervently another mother came into the waiting room this one with a twoyearold who was tugging at her ear the little girl howled even louder than dietrich baumgartner guten tag frau abetz esther bellowed over the din liselottes earache isnt any better is it what said frau abetz who couldnt have heard the trump of doom through that racket esther repeated herself louder this timefrau abetz took the screaming liselotte into an examination room she had one of the nine oclock appointments frau baumgartner coveted the move redistributed the noise without making it much softer at least for esther dr dambach emerged from his sanctum going to be one of those quiet mornings is it he said with a wry chuckle and went into the examination room himself moments later liselotte screamed louder than ever and it was one of those morningsfrau baumgartner did get to take dietrich in twenty minutes early but that did nothing for the general level of peace and quiet of which esther saw very little every few minutes another mother would bring in a shrieking baby or toddler the phone kept ringing at the most inconvenient moments too by the time the lunch break arrived esther felt as if shed worked two whole days not half of one as a pediatrician dr dambach had to have more than an ordinary mortals share of patience but he also seemed to be feeling the strain i ought to put some brandy in this coffee he said pouring himself a fresh cup i was thinking of asking if you could prescribe something stronger than aspirin for a headache esther said i will if you like dambach answered she shook her head thanks but no i was only jokingmostly when irma ritter came in for the afternoon shift she said how are things dont ask esther said about the only good thing i can think of to tell you is that the office didnt catch on fire she thought of one more waiting for the bus that would take her home maximilian ebert hadnt come out from the reichs genealogical office to confer with dr dambachand to bother her and that she was convinced was very good news indeed wolf priller walked up to alicia on the playground he looked at her as if hed never seen her before she looked at him with nothing but suspicion he had no use for girls and she had no use for him now though he wouldnt quit staring what do you want she demanded after half a minute or so is it true he asked is what true did the fuhrer really come and talk with your dad the way people say oh that yes its true wolfs blue eyes got wider yet wow he breathed as if shed become important on account of the news she supposed she hadto him anyway then he asked how comeyou arent more excited about it alicia shrugged i dont know im just not that wasnt the whole truth or even very much of it wolfgang priller was the last person to whom she wanted to tell the whole truth the truth was she didnt know what to think about heinz buckligers call on her father before she found out what she was the visit would have thrilled her as much as it seemed to thrill everybody else now that she knew she was a jew the whole structure of the reich the structure she had loveddisgusted her it disgusted her when she remembered anyhow some of the time she didnt then for a little while shewas the good little german she had been and still pretended to be but from what shed gathered the new fuhrer didnt seem to be of the same stripe as the ones whod come before him maybe he wasnt quite so bad after all where did that leave her in confusion that was where wolf said when i told my dad about it yesterday he said hed give this fingerhe solemnly displayed the index finger on his right handto be able to sit down with the fuhrer and talk about things they didnt talk aboutthings not like that alicia said they talked about stuff that had to do with my fathers work even so wolf said my dad wasso jealous you have no idea how jealous he was i am too i never thought id be jealous of a girl but i am and then as if afraid hed said too much he rushed off and savagely booted a football why is he jealous of mealicia wonderedi didnt meet the fuhrermy father did she had never run into the phrasereflected glory but she was groping her way toward the idea wolf wasnt the only one who wouldnt let her alone emma sidled up to her whispered lucky and then scooted off shed done that four different times since hearing the news two days earlier alicia counted herself lucky to be alive and safe past that she didnt worry about anything even trudi krebs eyed her in a different way it wasnt approval halfway down the road to awe the look she got from most of her classmates she couldnt quite make out what it was disappointment that would have been her first guess why would trudi be disappointed in her if her father had met the fuhrer was trudi a jew could she be alicia knew she couldnt ask in case the other girl said noill ask my mom she thoughtshell know or be able to find out alicia thought trudi just came from a family of political unreliables that was almost as dangerous as being a jew herr peukert knew about what had happened to alicias father too of courseherr kessler would have made a big fuss about it till alicia couldnt stand it any moreherr peukert didnt do that he just seemedinterested alicia hardly knew what to make of that it made her want to talk too much had her own secrets been less important she might have when she went to wait for the bus that afternoon she found francesca there ahead of her face thunderous with furygott im himmel alicia exclaimed whats the matter i got a swat from the beast her younger sister answered looking even angrier than she had already alicia wouldnt have believed she could what did you do she asked francesca to put it mildly wasnt the sort who usually got paddled i didnt do anything not a single thing she burst out now she called me up to the front of the class and gave me one anyway just for the fun of it i hate her ill always hate her when she got angry she didnt fool around this isnt a camp with a bunch of jews in it its supposed to be school you already knew frau koch was like that alicia said everybody knows it why are you so mad now because she did it tome alicia started to laugh she choked it down before it even began to show her sisters outrage was only part of the reason why and a small part at that maybe at last shed found some of the reason people hadnt complained about what the party did to jews who would complain when something like that was happening to a small group of other people and not to themselves that was doubly true because if theydid complain such thingswere all too likely to happen to them it will be all right she told her sister remember youre only stuck with the beast for a year its not forever it seems like forever francesca often looked for the cloud not the silver lining she added and then next year ill probably get herr kessler she probably would too alicia didnt want to tell her so especially since that was also when she would find out she was a jew how would she react to that like aliciamaybe even more than aliciashe believed everything shed learned in school about jews she would have to change her mind the school bus turned the corner and rumbled toward the stop alicia pointed towards it here were going home now she said sometimes distracting francesca worked better than actually answering her heinrich gimpel had never imagined he could be a celebrity what occurred to him was a most unjewish thought o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me celebrity meant visibility visibility in his mind was inextricably wed to danger he was stuck with it though half the analysts in oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters made a point of coming up to him and passing the time of day even crusty wehrmacht officersreal soldiers not just bureaucrats in uniformunbent around him where they never had before some of themnot all but a surprising numberproved to be pretty good fellows under the crust and all because someone stopped at my desk for fifteen or twenty minuteshe thought dazedlypeople do that all the time it shouldnt be so important he laughed at himself other analysts stopped at his desk all the time officers stopped there every now and again the fuhrer the ruler of the greater german reich and the germanic empire well no the fuhrer didnt pay a call on an ordinary analyst every day some people didnt try to cozy up to heinrich some people turned green with envy instead and wanted nothing to do with him he was glad willi didnt willi instead made a joke of it me im going to get rich from knowing you how much do you suppose i can charge for twenty minutes of your time fifty reichsmarks a hundred a hundred and fifty he ran his tongue across his lips you could get a pretty fancy floozy for that kind of money but plenty of people would sooner seeyou what do you think of that i think theyd have more fun with a girl heinrich answered willi laughed till he turned red heinrich hadnt been kidding willi didnt seem to have noticed the speculative look ilse had given heinrich after the fuhrer s visit since heinrich had pretended not to notice it too ilses dallying with willi hadnt paused they were given to enough long lunches to make other analysts grin and nudge one anotherbut only when they werent around what irked heinrich about it at least as much as anything else was that he had to cover willis phone during those long lunches he didnt mind dealing with business that was what he was there for dealing with erika dorsch was a different story analysis section heinrich gimpel speaking he said after transferring a call from willis desk to his own hello heinrich erika said i was hoping for my husband too much to expect i suppose if you really want to talk to willi why dont you call him when hes likelier to be hereheinrich wondered a little resentfully he didnt say that out loud it would only cause trouble what he did say was as neutral as he could make it ill take a message for you if you like in a bit she answered where is he theyd gone around this barn before at lunch heinrich said he should be back by now shouldnt he erika said heinrich didnt respond to that at all she asked where did he go and then said youre going to tell me you dont know see i read minds well i dont heinrich said defensively i ate at the canteen today im so sorry for you wherever he went did he go there with ilse erika waited again heinrich didnt want to answer either with the truth or with a lie her laugh had a bitter ring youre too damned honest for your own good heinrich was that true heinrich didnt think so he had after all been living under an elaborate lie for more than thirty years erika didnt know that of course as long as nobody who wasnt also living the lie knew he could go on with it he realized he would have to respond though he said i wish you and willi werent having troubles thats all not only did he mean it it sounded like an answer to what shed just said he could have done much worse he could also have done better erikas sour laugh proved that wish for the moon while youre at it heinrich could have laughed even more sourly when she wished for the moon the wildest thing she could think of was repairing what had gone wrong between her husband and her heinrichs wish would have been not only lunar but lunatic he would have wished for the chance to live openly as what he was he knew too well that that wasnt going to happen no matter how hard he wished all that went through his mind in what couldnt have been more than a heartbeat erika hardly even paused as she went on you dont need to wish do you youve really got the world by the tail he did laugh then he knew he shouldnt but he couldnt help himself that made erika angry you do she insisted not likely heinrich said he couldnt tell her why but hoped his voice carried conviction evidently not for she said no i didnt see the fuhrer paying a call on my dear willi if anybody had called heinrichdear in that tone of voice he would have run away as fast as he could he answered he might have but im the specialist on the united states and he wanted to find out something about the americans even that was more than he felt comfortable saying along with the god of abraham isaac and jacob he also worshiped security a jealous god indeed but erika already knew what he did if she didnt wish willi would dry up and blow away she could figure this out for herself slowly she said there are times when youre too damned modest for your own good too shes angry atmenow he realized in astonished dismaywhat the devil did i do i told you the truth he said no ill tell you the truth erika said the truth is the fuhrer came to see you you not anybody else the truth is thats important it could make you important and the truth is you dont seem to want to do anything about it or even admit it she might have been a wife giving a husband a pep talk shewas a wife giving a husband a pep talk the only trouble was she wasnt heinrichs wife and she didnt know him as well as she thought she did i dont want to be important he said which was not the smallest understatement hed ever made i dont erika and thats the truth too a long silence followed heinrich hoped she would lose her temper hang up on him and either leave him alone or just think of him as her husbands friendsomebody who was fun to drink wine with and a decent bridge player but nothing more than that what he hoped for and what he got were two different things well at least you know your own mind erika said at last at least youve got a mind to know you dont do all of your thinking below the belt i like that its different in a man did she realize how much of her own thinking she was doing below the belt not as far as heinrich could see she didnt he almost pointed it out to her at the last minute he didnt talking with her about things below the belt struck him as a very bad idea id better go was what he did say is there a message for willi tell him i hope ilse gives him the clap erika answered promptly he wont have the chance to give it to me and you can tell him that too she did hang up then loudly heinrich hung up too rubbing at his ear he pulled a message pad from his top desk drawererika called while you were out he wroteno need to call her back if she wanted to deliver any more forceful message she could do it herself he put the small sheet of yellow paper on willis desk it didnt spontaneously combust as he retreated to his own desk he wondered why willi came back to the office about half an hour later he looked almost indecently pleased with himselfand that probably was the word for it too ilse by contrast just sat down and started typing willi picked up the message whats this he said he read it and set it down then started to laugh he looked over at heinrich what did she really say you can ask her yourself and find out heinrich answered no thanks willi laughed again she thinks the world revolves around her high time she finds out shes wrong dont you do the sameheinrich wondered but he couldnt ask willi that any more than he could have asked erika about the way she thought neither one of them would have taken the question seriously and they both would have got angry at him he wanted that no more than he wanted any other kind of notice willi said youre our fairhaired boy right now why dont you fix erika up with buckliger that would make everybody happy you really are out of your mind heinrich exclaimed in horror thank you willi said which only disconcerted him more i thought it was thewhat do you call it the elegant solution thats what im trying to say shall i tell you all the things that are wrong with it heinrich asked how much time have you got have you got all day have you got all week what ive got is a report to write willi looked lugubrious the boss wants it this afternoon too im going to have to rush like hell to finish it on time you wouldnt if heinrich broke off telling willi hed have less to do now if he hadnt spent a long long lunchtime screwing his secretary was true some true things though just werent helpful yes mommy willi said which proved this was indeed one of those things all right all right nothing annoyed heinrich like being condescended to but if youre going to complain about what youve got to do youd better have a look at what youve been doing i did a nice close look too willis expression left no doubt what he meant heinrich found nothing to say to that which was no doubt exactly what willid had in mind shaking his head he went back to work over at the other desk willi looked as desperately busy as a man juggling knives and torches he would type like a man possessed then shift to the calculator mutter at the results and go back to the keyboard at five oclock heinrich got up he put on his coat and his cap im heading for the bus stop he said are you coming no dammit willi shook his head looking harassed im still busy too bad heinrich said and left willi stared after him then plunged back into the report ix when susanna weiss listened to the radio in her office she usually hunted for mozart or handel or haydn or beethoven or bach verdi or vivaldi would do in a pinch the italians were reckoned frivolous but they were still allies you couldnt get in trouble for listening to them she sometimes let wagner blare out into the hallway too that was protective coloration pure and simple and not only because she despised him as an antisemite no matter how the nazis had slobbered over him for the past eighty years and more she couldnt take him seriously a lone lorn woman stands upon a stage trying to make herself heardan englishman had written at the start of the twentieth centuryone hundred and forty men all armed with powerful instruments wellorganised and most of them looking wellfed combine to make it impossible for a single note of that poor womans voice to be heard above their din shed seen it that way long before she ran into jerome k jerome now she couldnt even listen to wagner without wanting to giggle these days though less classical music lilted from the radio she tuned it to the news station more and more often a lot of what she heard was the same wretched sort of propaganda shed avoided for years a lot of it but not all every so often startling things came out of the speaker she listened in the hope of hearing more of them whenever the fuhrer made a speech she found herself urging him on thinkingyou can do it i know you can and sometimes heinz buckliger would and sometimes he wouldnt sometimes he was flat and pedestrian praising manufacture or agriculture or the hitler youth then as she had with too many boyfriends she decided shed been fooling herself shed been right about the boyfriends about buckliger the trouble with buckliger was he could be astonishing she was discussing a midterm with a student who had trouble understanding why hed got only a susanna knew whyhe wasnt too bright and he hadnt studied too hard however much she wanted to she couldnt come right out and say that she had the radio on not very loud as she went over the exam with him point by point it was one of those painful conferences if the student worked harder he might get a next time or even a he would never blossom and get a susanna hardly listened to herself as she explained all the myriad ways hed misunderstood the old english riddles hed tried to interpret more of her attention was on heinz buckliger who was speaking to an audience of german female pharmacists hed been blathering on about how pharmacists were vital for the health of the reich and how the womens group to which he was speaking had a long history of devoted service it didnt seem one of his more inspired efforts but then with just a few words everything changed buckliger went on we must examine the history of the reich in the same way that which is good and also that which is not so good we must not flinch from finding and noting our forefathers failures fraulein doktor professor i think you should raise my grade because wait susanna said the student tried to go on talking she waved a hand at him hush i want to hear this he couldnt very well complain not when she was listening to the fuhrer he still lookedaggrieved susanna didnt care those who complain about the recent emphasis on the first edition of mein kampf ignore certain essential facts heinz buckliger went on it is perfectly obvious that inadequate representation by the volk was at the root of past illegalities arbitrariness and repressioncrimes based on abuse of power professor weiss the student tried again hush i told you susanna snapped the female pharmacists were applauding the fuhrer but hesitantly as if they werent sure what they were hearing susanna was she just wasnt sure she could believe her ears what buckliger was saying was truewas in fact a colossal understatement but that the fuhrer of the greater german reich should say even so much and buckliger wasnt done he said the responsibility of past national socialist leadershe didnt name hitler or himmler but whom else could he mean and those close to them for undoubted repressions and illegalities is both difficult to forgive and difficult to admit but we must even now writers try to ignore important questions in our history they try to pretend nothing out of the ordinary occurred this is wrong it neglects historical reality of which we all must be aware he paused for applause he gota little had susanna been in the audience she would have been on her feet whooping and hollering the student tried to get her to pay attention to his earnest inept essay again she silenced him with a glare everyones dearest wish buckliger went on is for the reich and its ideology to stay unchanging for the thousand years hitler promised us but history does not work that way however much we wish it did we will either find ways to develop or we will stagnate and fail and go under murmurs said the pharmacists didnt know what to make of the hard truths buckliger was telling them and even the fuhrer seemed to wonder if hed gone too far he quickly added fascism has offered to the world its answers to the fundamental questions of human life at the center of which stands the volk the errors we may have made will not must not turn us from the path we embarked upon in we are traveling to the new order to the world of the reich and the volk we shall never leave that road there at last he gave the earnest women whod come to hear him something they could get their teeth into they cheered thunderously susanna wanted to yawn the speech continued but only in banalities fraulein doktor professor the student was nothing if not persistent ja ja susanna realized she would have to get rid of him so she could think she pointed to the essay you do understand that the ostensible answer to this riddle here isa key that gets you a passing grade but you dont see all the double meanings hiding underneath what else might a man have on his hip that could fill a hole if he hiked up his clothes excuse me the student stared at her as if shed suddenly started spouting hindustani im very sorry but he broke off she could tell exactly when he did get it his stare changed from one sort to another altogether he blushed like a schoolgirl prone to such problems herself susanna knew a good blush when she saw one butbut he sputtered then tried again but thisthis is atext fraulein doktor professor its a text now susanna said its a text to you but to the man who wrote it it was a riddle it was a joke and if you cant see the joke well im sorry but you dont deserve anything more than a bare pass he tried to argue some more but he couldnt or not very well he was both demoralized and embarrassed had he been a dog he would have had his tail between his legs as he left her office for a wonder no one else came in right away to complain about the exam that left susanna a few minutes to marvel at what shed just heard heinz buckliger had been careful about what he did hed surrounded the meat in his speech with clouds of puffy obscuring rhetoric but the meat was there hed admitted the nazi regime had made mistakes hed also admitted it had covered them up and hed admitted it shouldnt have once hed done that much gone that far what else was left only spelling out what the mistakes had been would buckliger have the nerve to do that would anyone else now that the fuhrer had given permission maybe so if people started to see that telling the truth didnt mean a trip to a camp or a bullet in the back of the neck susanna could hardly wait to find out lise gimpel was sorting laundrya labor of sisyphus if ever there was onewhen the girls came home from school francesca for once didnt start complaining about the beast right away she and roxane went into the kitchen to fix themselves snacks roxane opened the refrigerator olives yum she exclaimed her older sisters made disgusted noises except for heinrich she was the only one in the family who really liked them alicia hunted up lise instead of getting a snack she sat down on the bed beside her and said we talked about the fuhrer s speech in class today did you lises mind was still more on socks and underwear than the classroom we sure did alicia nodded solemnly did he really say the reich did things that were wrong things that were against the law i think he did lise answered i cant say for certain though i didnt hear the speech well suppose he did alicia waited till lise nodded to show she was supposing her oldest daughter looked out the bedroom door to make sure francesca and roxane couldnt hear then went on in a low voice does that mean he thinks the reich was wrong about what it did to jews i dont know lise said what people did to jews wasnt against the law though because they made laws ahead of time that said they could do those things but it was wrong alicia said fiercely oh yes it was wrong i think so just as much as you do but lise broke off and put both hands on alicias shoulders the people who run things probably dont think it was wrong you have to remember that and even if they say they do think it was wrong we cant just come out and go oh yes here we are now we can get on with our lives again why not plainly alicia wanted to do exactly that because it might be a trap they might be trying to lure us out so they can get rid of us once and for all the nazis have been killing us for almost eighty years why should they stop now alicia bit her lip she was after all only eleven years old would they do such a thing she whispered would they i dont know lise answered could they you tell me sweetheart what do they teach you about jews in school nasty things alicia made a face horrible things you know that well yes i do lise said i wanted to make sure you did oh alicia thought that over then nodded im going to go get a snack before sisters eat everything good in the house she ran out of the bedroom and started gabbing with francesca and roxane she didnt even tease roxane about the olives to her they werent part of everything good in the house and roxane was welcome to them lise went back to stacking socks and underwear into neat piles one for each person in the family she wished there were a laundry fairy to do the job for her but no such luck if she didnt do it nobody would heinrich at least put away his own clean clothes without being told the girlslise wished for a laundry fairy again she also wished she could share alicias optimism she wanted to maybe more than anything else in all the world she hated living in hiding hated fearing a knock on the door that could mean the end not just for her but for everybody she loved feeling she carried the weight of the world hadnt been easy when she was a child and hadnt got any easier now that shed grown up but i doshe thought miserablywe all do the handful of us who are left if we let go if we give upor if god forbid we get caughta world goes with us why have you got yipes stripes mommy there stood roxane in the doorway holding an olive impaled on a toothpick have i lise was sure she did she tried to make the frown lines leave her forehead there is that better a little roxane said dubiously how about this lise stuck out her tongue and crossed her eyes roxane giggled that suggested some improvement but then the youngest gimpel girl said you didnt tell me why you had them in the first place her stubborn streak was as wide as she was it would probably help make her a good jew when she got old enough to find out she was one in the meantimein the meantime it made her hard to distract grownup stuff lise answered nothing for you to worry aboutnot yet not for another few years and when you do find out youll be one more who knowsand one more who can give us away letting children know what they were was the hardest part of this secret life considering the rest of it that was no small statement roxane made a face of her own what good is being a grownup if you have to have yipes stripes so much she darted away without waiting for an answer what good is being a grownup lise echoed she thought of the obvious things the things that appealed to a childgoing to bed as late as you wanted to being able to drive having all the money you needed getting out of school forever not having anybody standing over you waiting to yell no all the time then she thought about all the worries that accumulated when you grew up when you had a family you worried plenty even if you werent a jew if you werewhat goodis being a grownup lise said again it was when you got right down to it a damned good question in the stahnsdorf train station heinrich gimpel remarked never know whats in the paper these days god knows thats true willi dorsch agreed sometimes you wonder if you want to find out too they threw fifteen pfennigs apiece into the vending machine nothing would have stopped them from grabbing two copies of the volkischer beobachter when willi opened the machine to take out his copy nothing would have stopped them but it didnt occur to either man a man had to do all kinds of things to get along in the third reich that kind of petty the ft though was downright ungerman willi was a good german in most ways so was heinrich the train got there almost as soon as they walked out on the platform they sat down side by side and started going through the newspaper some of the fuss over heinz buckligers speech to the pharmacists was starting to die down nobodyd said much in public except rolf stolle the gauleiter of berlin and hed been all for it hed also thundered fearsome warnings about all the bonzen who hated the very idea of reform heinrich thought stolle at least as much a clown as a politicianwith friends like him who needed enemies clown or not though he probably hadnt been wrong about the bonzen nothing too much today doesnt look like willi said no i dont see anything very exciting either heinrich tried not to sound too disappointed people might wonder why he was if the thaw endedand he knew too well it could knew too well it was probably going tosomeone might remember landing in trouble for being on the wrong side of a political squabble would be just as bad for him though perhaps not for everyone around him as landing in trouble for being a jew he went on working his way through the volkischer beobachter when he got to page eight he stopped hello whats this whats what willi hadnt got there yet two men arrested in copenhagen for carrying an antigerman banner through the streets heinrich answered they wanted full independence for denmark damn fools willi said hell the danes have it or close enough those idiots dont know when theyre well off they ought to go to poland or serbia for a while thatd teach em it sure would heinrich hoped that sounded like agreement the danes were better off than the poles or the serbs or what was left of the russians and ukrainians like dutchmen norwegians and englishmen danes got credit for being aryans they werent slavic untermenschen theyd always been pretty peacefulor at least resignedunder german occupation too but they plainly still remembered theyd been free for hundreds of years before heinrich wondered ifbefore he could even finish the thought willi beat him to it they probably listened to the fuhrer s speech the other day and figured anything goes from here on out i wouldnt be surprised heinrich said if he had finished the thought he would have kept quiet about it willi confident about who and what he was didnt censor himself so severely he didnt waste much sympathy on the danes either theyre lucky theydid get arrested not shot down on the spot were softer than we were in hitlers day ive told you that before then shifting gears he went on you want to have lunch today cant heinrich answered our goddaughters birthday is three days from now and ive got to find her a present anna stutzman wasnt literally a goddaughterjews didnt use that custombut came close enough heinrich couldnt resist asking besides what about ilse im not eighteen for gods sake willi said i cant do it every day any more and ive got to save some for erika otherwise shed be even crankier than she is generous of you heinrich murmured hed intended that for sarcasm it didnt quite come out that way willi had his own inimitable style but at least part of his heart seemed to be in the right place he grinned now isnt it he said complacently the train rattled on toward south station in berlin when lunchtime came heinrich hopped a cab up to the kurfurstendamm he knewhe had detailed instructions from lisewhat he was supposed to get for anna like everyone else who was breathing and halfway conscious hed seen advertisements for the vicki dolls imported from the united states they had flaxen hair vacant expressions improbable figures and clothes mata hari would have envied they looked perfectly aryan maybe that was why they were so wildly popular in the reich or maybe notyou never could tell with kids with three of his own heinrich knew that at least people werent fighting hand to hand these days the way they had been when the dolls first came out heinrich had asked lise if she was sure he wasnt getting something passe for anna shed shaken her head i checked with our girls shed answered theyre still popular with all the different outfits you can get for them theyll stay that way for years if the girls said it it had to be true heinrich did wonder who made clothes for the swarms of vickis they werent that expensive and they didnt come from the empire of japan with its ocean of cheap labor did the doll manufacturer know an official who could pull seamstresses out of a prison camp or maybe not pull them out of a camp but make them work inside theyd sew as if their lives depended on it their lives would too he grimaced you could ask that kind of question about a lot of things you saw every day sometimesusuallynot knowing was better he shook his head that wasnt right you needed to know heinz buckliger was dead on target there but ignorance could be easier for your peace of mind ducking into ulbrichts toy store banished such gloomy reflections if you couldnt be happy in ulbrichts you were probably dead dolls stuffed animals brightly colored childrens books football and basketball and archery sets toy soldiers and sailors and panzers and uboats and fighter planes landser sepp was the counterpart of vicki for boys and came with enough materiel to conquer belgium all waited for your money loud cheerful music made you want to smileand to part with your reichsmarks there hed been told to get that one a new orleans vicki dressed in lace and satin and looking as if shed just stepped out of gone with the wind that had been one of hitlers favorite movies it still got rereleased every few years susanna loved to go to it and make fun of the dubbing heinrich grabbed for the package a womans hand closed on it at the same time as his annoyed he looked up from the doll to see who else wanted itonly to discover erika dorsch also annoyed also looking up from the doll for what had to be the same reason they stared at each other and started to laugh for my sister leonores girl erika said for my goddaughter heinrich said is there another one like it in the bin lets see erika had to dig a little but she found one she handed it to him here oh good he said now we wont have to go to court the way those two women did a few months ago when the craze was at its craziest the judge should have played solomon and cut the doll in half if you ask me ja erika cocked her head to one side studying him if were not going to court whereshall we go i was going to pay for this and head back to the office heinrich answered its been busy it cant bethat busy if dear willi takes ilse out so often erika said and shouldnt you pay him back for the extra work you get stuck with when he does pay him back howheinrich wondered he was afraid erika would tell himor show him he had to be afraid of so many things that this should be one of them struck him as most unfair its not so bad he said that didnt satisfy erika either he might have known it wouldnt youre too easygoing for your own good she said you let people push you around do things to youeverybody but me ha heinrich said in a distinctly hollow voice ha ha what would you do to me she kissed him right there in front of the bin of vicki dolls she made a good thorough job of it too behind heinrich somebody coughed his ears felt ready to catch fire but so did the rest of him in a different way the only way he could have kept from kissing her back and tightening his arms around her was to die on the spot there she said breaking the kiss as abruptly as shed started it see you later enjoy your work she went off toward a cashier that new orleans vicki still in her hand heinrich stared after her a man with a white hitler mustacheprobably a grandfather shopping for a granddaughterwinked at him you lucky dog if ulbrichts sold dolls like that id buy myself one in a minute he said and cackled at his own wit like a laying hen lucky right heinrich said dazedly the old man thought that was pretty funny too still cackling he went on toward a display of stuffed kittens heinrich fumbled in his pocket for a handkerchief he rubbed at his mouth he could still taste the sweetness of erikas lipstickand of her lips the handkerchief came away stained the same bright pink erika had been wearing to make sure hed got it all heinrich went into a mens room and checked in the mirror a good thing he did toohed missed a large incriminating spot a few more dabs got rid of it he started out of the mens room then stopped the stained handkerchief went into the wastebin full of crumpled paper towels explaining how hed lost ita blank look and i dont knowwould be easier than telling lise how it had got those telltale stains on it anything would be easier than that he paid for the vicki and went out onto the kurfurstendamm to flag a cab for the ride back to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters a taxi pulled up the driver hopped out and opened the rear door for him here you go sir he said thanks heinrich slid in the cabby zoomed away from the curb heinrich looked down at the ulbrichts sack on his knees hed paid for the doll all right alicia gimpel peered out the window here she comes she hissed suddenly and ducked back out of sight like a sniper who had to stay hidden to stay alive she waved importantly to the other girls gathered in the living room quiet everybody she needed to say it three times before they paid any attention to her they finally did just when anna stutzman and her mother came up the walk toward the front door annas mother rang the bell alicia and her mother answered it francesca and roxane stood behind them in the entrance hall that was all right anna could see alicias little sisters they lived here after all and it was quietpretty quiet anyhowin the living room hello there alicias mother said opening the door how are you today heavens anna youre getting so big im barely keeping up with alicia anna said that was true but alicia showed signs that she would be very tall when she grew up anna didnt what does being twelve feel like alicia asked after they hugged like being eleven but one more anna answered they both laughed alicia hadnt found out what being eleven was like till a few weeks before come in come in come in her mother said alicia thought francesca and roxane would ruin things then because they made some of the most ridiculous faces shed ever seen but anna didnt seem to notice anything wrong maybe she thought alicias sisters were always ridiculous alicia often did francesca and roxane raced back into the living room that should have been a giveaway too but somehow it wasnt alicia and anna and their mothers followed more slowly anna was saying have you seen the new singers in the surprise yelled a dozen girls surprise alicia echoed grinning from ear to ear it had worked in spite of everything it had worked the look on annas face was worth a hundred reichsmarks you didnt she said to alicia ill get you for this i did too alicia answered and the other didnt bother her one bit anna rounded on her mother you must have known she accused who me frau stutzman said that made everybody laugh again before long it stopped being a surprise party and just turned into a birthday party alicia didnt know all of annas friends very well some of them lived near anna while others were in her class at school they seemed nice enough they put up with alicias little sisters some of them would have little sisters or brothers of their own alicia would have got mad if theyd teased francesca or roxane that washer job as far as she could tell none of the other girls shared the secret she and anna did that made the two of them specialor she thought it did anyhow how could she know for sure she couldnt it also made francesca and roxane special they didnt know it yet though and they wouldnt be too happy when they found out alicia shook her head this whole business still seemed very strange but then in the midst of games and songs and cake and ice cream and genuine american hot dogs from a stand that had opened up a few blocks away they tasted like any other frankfurters to alicia she forgot all about the secret when shed first learned it she hadnt thought she would ever be able to do that anna unwrapped her presents she squealed extra loud when she opened the new orleans vicki several of the other girls made envious noises alicia felt especially good because of that she wanted to give anna a really nice present more cake and ice cream followed youre going to make them sickfrau stutzman told alicias mom she didnt sound as if she meant it though not too much later she went home saying ill see you in the morning anna happy birthday sweetie the guests ran around and sang more songs and played games and fooled around with the gimpel girls dolls and toys when it got late they spread out sleeping bags on the floor of the front room nobody whod ever gone on a bund deutscher madel outing was without a sleeping bag francesca and roxane had theirs too even though they werent old enough to join the organization for german girls they might have got into the sleeping bags the lights might have been out they werent going to fall asleep any time soon though alicias father made a brief appearance coming halfway down the stairs try to keep it down to a low roar if you please he said he sounded as if he knew that was a lost hope they giggled they gossiped they told scary stories which seemed even scarier in the dark one of annas friends had read a translation of the telltale heart that was good for plenty of goose bumps roxane started to doze every so often shed say im awake in a small faraway voice she was still little even if she would have indignantly denied it one by one the girls did drop off to sleep snores replaced roxanes protests a couple of the girls annas age were snoring by the time francesca gave in and slept alicia wasnt surprised she knew how stubborn francesca was by two in the morning snores and deep breathing filled the gimpels living room alicias sleeping bag lay next to annas not only were they best friends but the party was in alicias house she doubly had the right to be there her voice a tiny whisper she asked are you still awake no anna whispered back and they both laughed did you have a happy birthday alicia asked anna nodded alicia could barely see the motion ill say anna answered good im glad alicia said and then how arethings things are all right with me anna poked her head up to make sure nobody else was awake and listening alicia did the same shed been sure anna would know how she meantthings and shed been right her friend even used the same word and the same little pause to ask how arethings with you theyre not too bad i guess but alicia couldnt leave it at that she went on i think its harder when other people in the house dont know she stuck her head up and listened again this would be a very bad time to find out francesca was only pretending to sleep i believe that anna said now she paused before continuing gottlieb told me the same thing once i was really little when he found out i was younger than roxane she laughed at the follies of her youth he must have wanted to kick me a whole bunch of times alicia had wanted to kick her sisters plenty of times the trouble was they kicked back the other trouble wasits what you learn in school its what you see on the televisor itsits just everything thats all i believed all that stuff till i found out in a tinier voice yet she added part of me still wants to believe it oh thank you anna said alicia blinked anna explained i was afraid i was the only one who thought things like that they both came halfway out of their sleeping bags so they could hug each other not once alicia realized had either one of them said the word jew even if one of the other girls were listening she wouldnt know what they were talking about they were both so very careful they had to be if they werent careful they were dead alicia had known that was what happened to jews long before she knew she was one anna asked her what do you think of the new fuhrer i was going to ask you the same thing alicia exclaimed she liked it when she and anna thought the same way nobody else thought like her except her father every once in a while since anna had asked the question first she had to answer it he seemsbetter anyhow he does doesnt he anna said he talks about how there ought to be laws not justthe triumph of the will theyd both seen the film everybody saw it in school and on the televisor it was old you could tell when you watched it but it had a kick like a mule even so you know the lady who made that movie alicia asked anna nodded alicia said she died just a few years ago she was over a hundredeven older than kurt haldweim she shivered remembering how shed filed past the late fuhrer s shrunken wizened corpse as it lay in state in the great hall thats scary anna said now alicia nodded anna went on when your sisterstalk about things they dont know about how do you stand it i dont know alicia answered just after i first found out it really used to drive me crazy now it doesnt or not so much anyway they dont know any better and they cant for a while theyre too little thats funny anna said alicia made a soft inquiring noise her friend went on gottlieb said almost the same thing to mealmost the same thing about meafter i finally did find out what was what the last few words came out muffled by a yawn alicia yawned too they were both up long past their usual bedtime of course that was what slumber parties were for alicias head went down i think i am going to sleep now she said happy birthday again it was the happiest anna said in a couple of minutes both of them were snoring with the other girls something peculiar was happening in adolf hitler platz when heinrich gimpel and willi dorsch got off the bus from south station heinrich asked whats going on he had trouble seeing not only because of the mist and light drizzle themselves but because of the way they spattered his glasses looks like willi brought up his hand heinrich wondered why his friend didnt wear glasses maybe the hand helped the visor on his cap keep water out of his eyes maybe he just thought the gesture looked impressive after peering he said i will be damned looks like some dutchmen are holding a demonstration over there dutchmen heinrich echoed then between raindrops he too got a glimpse of the red white and blue flag with the stripes laid out horizontally not vertically as in the french tricolor a couple of dozen men and women huddled beneath the damp banner a few of them carried signs distance and rain kept heinrich from making out the words he would have had to do some guessing anyway dutch had a teasing almostfamiliarity to someone who spoke german and english vrijheid the dutch shouted heinrich didnt have to do much guessing to figure out what that meant it was very close to freiheit the german word for freedomvrijheid willi got it too where are the security police he demanded here they come if heinrich was dismayedand he washe didnt show it about time willi said which showed what he thought the men in black tunics and trousers trotted briskly across the square they carried truncheons and pistols a couple of them had assault rifles would it be arrests or a massacre lights blazing and sirens howling police wagons followed the troopers it turned out to be arrests the dutchmen and women didnt try to flee they kept callingvrijheit as the security police herded them into the wagons which screeched away adolf hitler platz was quiet again the whole thing couldnt have taken more than three minutes they must have been out of their minds willi said they dont have the faintest idea when theyve got it good bunch of damned fools like those danes give em a little treat em halfway decent because theyre aryans and what do they do do they thank you hell no they grab with both hands thats what maybe theyre taking the new fuhrer seriously heinrich said as he and willi went up the stairs to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters willi gave him an odd look maybe theyre taking buckligertoo seriously he said whatll we see next poles shouting for freedom russians jews he threw back his head and laughed so did heinrich the idea was when you got down to it pretty funny he tried to imagine some of the handful of surviving jews in berlin getting out there in the middle of that enormous square and clamoring for their freedom would the security police even need to come or would ordinary people beat and stone them to death before the men in black uniforms got there everyone here or as near as made no difference had that same casual loathing for jews do you think willi sounded as if hed decided to take heinrich seriously after all instead of laughing at him do you think buckligerintends for things like this to happen heinrich didnt even try to answer that till the security guards had checked their identification cards and waved them through into the building then he said i doubt it who would but how can you make changes in the way things work if you cant even talk about changes without getting arrested oh come on willi said these were dutchmen the others were a bunch of crazy danes you didnt see any real germans out there did you not a one heinrich agreed he wondered if he ever would the party had spent the last three generations teaching the germans to be docile to their rulers no matter how ferocious they were when they put on uniforms and marched off to war could they nerve themselves to speak their minds after three generations of nazi propaganda did they have any minds to speak he wasnt an optimist on a question like that he couldnt afford optimism the cost of being wrong was too high coffee willi exclaimed when they got to the room where they worked he disappeared presumably heading for the canteen and came back five minutes later with a foam cup from which fragrant steam rose he gulped it down then sighed blissfully ahhh heinrich wanted a cup too even so he said ive seen drunks who didnt cozy up to a bottle of cheap schnapps the way you did with that coffee if youre going to enjoy something you shouldenjoy it shouldnt you willi said why only go halfway because sometimes all the way is too far heinrich suggested willi laughed at him again it wasnt surprising that he should national socialist ideology scorned the idea of restraint it always had heinrich wondered if heinz buckliger could change that or if it had even occurred to the new fuhrer to try he had his doubts he also had his work he got some coffee for himself with it unmelodramatically sitting there on the desk in front of him he got down to business sure enough with their assessments reduced the americans were paying even less than they had been they were trying to see just how much the reich would let them get away with before it clamped down if he hadnt already been sure they would do that it would have infuriated him the coffee hadnt had time to get cold before the telephone rang he picked it up analysis section heinrich gimpel speaking guten morgen herr gimpel an americanaccented voice said charlie cox herewie gehts mit ihnen im fine thanks heinrich answered automatically then he blinked its not morning where you are herr cox its still the middle of last night are you up early or up late late cox said easily i wanted to ask you something unofficial well go ahead heinrich told him of course an answer to a question like that is worth its weight in gold aber naturlichcox said he knew the answer wouldnt really be unofficial then by the nature of things it couldnt be that meant the unofficial question wasnt either cox proceeded to ask it just exactly how serious is herr buckliger about reforming the national socialist system thats a good question heinrich said he could see why the american and his leaders wanted to find out a lot of other people in the germanic empire and in the greater german reich wanted to find out too heinrich wouldnt have been surprised if heinz buckliger were one of them he went on the only thing i can tell you though is that i dont know unofficially dammit charlie cox sounded annoyed you idiot dont you think theres a bug on this phone someone will be listening to youand to meif not right this second then when he plays a tape aloud heinrich replied official or unofficial youd get the same answer from me come on charlie use your headyoud better im not at the level that makes policy all i do is carry it out the fuhrer talks to you cox said so that news had got across the atlantic had it either it had spread more widely than heinrich thought or the americans had better spies than intelligence gave them credit for that wasnt heinrichs immediate worry though he said for heavens sake he just asked me for a few figures sohe could set policy thats what the fuhrerprinzip is all about jacox agreed but if he likes the first edition as much as he says he does how much does he care about the fuhrerprinzip a lot of people in the empire and in the reich were also wondering about that im very sorry heinrich said but i still dont know if you want advice ill take whatever you give me the american broke in youve always seemed like a decent fellow are you naive enough to assume that about anyone in the reichor do you think im naive enough to be flattered in a way heinrichwas flattered but not in a way that would do cox any good he said the only real advice i can give you is wait and see what the fuhrer does will show you exactly what he has in mind i was hoping for a little advance warning but he must have realized he wouldnt get it from heinrich with what might have been either a sigh or a yawn he said all right im going on home to bed thanks for your timeherr gimpel he hung up so did heinrich with quite unnecessary force willi said sounded like somebody was trying to get something out of you an american heinrich said i think id better write up a report if he did the people surely monitoring the line would have less reason to read disloyalty into anything hed said as he began to type though he wondered how much good it would do if the powers that be decided he was disloyal they wouldnt worry about evidence theyd invent some or do without and just get rid of him will they under this fuhrerthat heinrich could wonder said how much things had changedand how much they hadnt walther stutzman was a straightthinking rational man he had to be to make himself a success at the zeiss computer works every so often though he found himself bemused by what he and a few others didhad to doto keep themselves hidden from the alltoonearly omniscient eye of the state hitler had thundered that there was a jewish conspiracy against the german volk against the reich at the time hed been talking through his hat the jews hadnt been plotting against germany most of the jewsin germany had thought of themselves as being as german as anybody else now on the other hand now the handful of jews remaining in berlin in germany as a whole had to conspire against the reich if they wanted to go on breathing hitlers extermination camps had had the ironic effect of calling into being what hadnt existed when he started making speeches even now it wasnt the sort of conspiracy he meant it didnt aim to take over the reich just to hide the few surviving jews from it but a conspiracy it undoubtedly was here sat walther controlling computer codes that would have earned him a bullet in the back of the neck if anyone knew he had them some of the codes erased his tracks after hed used others which made discovering him harder over at oberkommando der wehrmacht heinrich gimpel kept his ear to the ground there was a jew in a fairly high place in the foreign ministry there were even three or four in the ss walther had helped create false pedigrees for a couple of them the others he just knew about he wasnt sure how theyd established their bona fides his own work there still worried him if it unraveled so much was liable to unravel with it several other important ministries also held a jew or two when a jew in one place heard something that might be important others soon found out about it a chief undersecretary or a deputy assistant minister could meet with a friend at dinner or telephone a colleague in another ministrysometimes not a jew himself but someone who could be expected to spread the news to the jew who needed to know it heinrich said the american phrase was a grapevine that fit well enough and that chief undersecretary or deputy assistant minister sometimes got to propose a policy thatpurely by chance of course of coursemade things a little easier a little safer for the jews or bureaucracy being what it was one of those functionaries could sometimes ignore or soften a directive that might have hurt his people very often one bad scheme blocked was worth three good ones started a jewish conspiracy at the heart of the reich hitler would have had kittens he would have ordered all the jews killed and made horrible examples of the germans whod missed them walther thought of knives and pianowire nooses himmler would have killed the jews and made examples of some germans too but he would have got rid of them more humanely kurt haldweim would have got rid of the jews and reprimanded maybe demoted the germans heinz buckliger walther scratched his head he didnt know he didnt dare find out who would dare when the consequences for being wrong were so irrevocable for the first time in his life though he could think of the fuhrer without a shudder right afterwards hey walther what are you doing in there the booming voice jerked him out of his reverie nothing much boss he answered honestly hiding a start too just woolgathering im afraid you gustav priepke boomed laughter thatll be the day listen somethings come up and i need you to take a shot at it walther had told the truth and priepke hadnt believed him that was what he got for having a reputation for working hard if hed had a name for doing nothing he could have been working on six things at once and his boss wouldnt have believed that either he did his best to look bright and attentive even if he didnt feel that way what is it he asked the new operating systemwhat else priepke answered weve got to make it work or else he didnt say or else what but he didnt have to the project was long overdue that it was so long overdue made it harder too well there is one obvious answer we havent tried yet walther said whats that his boss asked i thought wed done all the obvious things walther shook his head no theres one thing we havent done that could save us a lot of time priepke let out an interrogative grunt walther said we could see how much japanese code we can steal or adapt donnerwetter gustav priepke looked at him as if hed suggested turning every ratskeller in the reich into a sushi bar what a bastardly idea what the japs know about real programming is just what we need right now walther broke in jesus christ priepke said harshly you know what hitler said about the japs in mein kampf if they didnt have aryans to steal ideas from their culture would freeze solid again likethat he snapped his fingers do you want to talk about politics or computers walther asked i dont care about politics i dont care at all what i care about are computers the japanese have some ideas we can use and i think we can extract them without too much trouble which counts for more ideology or the operating system you wouldnt have dared talk like that in himmlers time let alone hitlers oh yes i would walther said the russians had a terrific panzer in the second world war the t was better than anything we brought against it but we had better crews so we won our next panzer the panther borrowedstoleall sorts of ideas from the t the designers didnt care who built it all they cared about was that it was a good machine his boss grunted again this time meditatively then he said what if the codes got traps in it if we cant find them are we really smarter than the japanese walther asked one more grunt priepke said i cant decide that on my own i dont want the security police landing on us with both feet half an hour after we start he stormed away from walthers cubicle walther wondered whether he should have kept his mouth shut would the security police start asking him nasty questions now all hed wanted was to do the job the people set over him told him to do was that too much to hope for maybe it wasno good deed goes unpunished he thought sourly gustav priepke didnt come back for more than an hour that worried walther too had he got his boss in trouble or was the trouble waiting forhim instead he relaxeda littlewhen priepke did return the big burly man gave him a comicopera oriental bow velly good we tly that he said in what he imagined was japaneseaccented german walther made a face i wish id never suggested it he said priepke laughed he thought walther was kidding as hed been walther knew too well he wasnt a chilly wind blew through stahnsdorf rain was coming but it hadnt got there yet inside the gimpels house everything was warm and cozy heinrich moved at his wifes direction putting this away and dusting that he didnt move fast enough to suit her whats the matter she asked the dorsches havent been over in a while dont you feel like playing bridge its not that heinrich said and it wasnt he was always ready to play bridge what is it then before lise went on she looked around to make sure the girls were out of earshot erika making you nervous ha he said in a hollow voice erika damn well did make him nervous he hadnt said a word about running into her at ulbrichts he still didnt know what to think about that the doorbell rang he wasnt going to get a chance to decide now lise was closer so she opened the door they all hugged and said hello and asked about children and said how glad they were to see one another with a flourish willi handed lise his usual offering of a bottle of wine open it now he said when we make mistakes at the bridge table we always need something to blame them on erika opened her mouth heinrich knew exactly what she was going to say he didnt feel like having the sniping start before the dorsches even got out of the front hall since he didnt he forestalled her asking how arethings they could take that any way they wanted willi took it the way heinrich had intended he waggled his palm back and forth soso he said we have our ups and downs never one to leave a setup line alone he finished maybe not as often as when i was twentytwo but we manage youd manage more if it werent for ilse even you know that heinrich didnt say it he did wonder whether erika would and how he could deflect her if she started to fortunately she kept quiet heinrich wouldnt have wanted to be on the receiving end of the look she sent willi though let me go open the wine lise said why doesnt everybody else sit down willi dealt the first hand and now to give myself thirteen diamonds he said grandly as long as you give me thirteen hearts i dont mind heinrich said reality returned as soon as he picked up his hand which showed the usual mixture of suits and ten points willi opened with a club heinrich passed erika said two clubs which meant she had some support for willi but not a great deal he took it to three after which everybody passed and he made three clubs with no overtricks but without much trouble a leg he said as erika wrote their sixty points under the line heinrich gathered up the cards and started shuffling the only thing legs are good for is getting chopped off he observed he dealt out the next hand and opened with a spade after a lively auction he and lise got to four spades willi doubled if they made it they would take the game and wipe out the dorsches partial score if they went down it would get expensive above the line erika led a heart willi had been bidding them when lise laid out the dummy heinrich got an unpleasant surprise he had the ace queen ten and nine of spades plus a little one his wife had four little spades to the eight that left the king and jack conspicuously missing along with two little ones to protect them considering the other problems he had in the hand it also left him in trouble willi took the trick with the king of hearts then led the ace when that went through without getting trumped he grinned at heinrich and said got you maybe heinrich shrugged he thought willi had him too but he was damned if hed admit it no maybes about it willi led a diamond that wasnt the way to finish heinrich off he had the ace in his hand while the king was on the board he decided he would rather be in the dummy so he took the trick with the king then he led a small spade from the dummy willi played another one heinrich hesitated but only for a moment he set down the ten behind the cards of the dummy lise blinked he felt like shouting when erika sluffed a club that meant willi had all the oppositions spades no wonder hed doubled but it also meanthappily heinrich said im going to finesse you right out of your shoes willi looked revolted heinrich didnt blame him a bit had he been sitting in that chair instead of this one he would have been revolted too and he had plenty of board entries so he could get back to the dummy whenever he needed to he pulled willis trumps one by one willi couldnt make any of them good and he made the contractdoubled a deep finesse willi said mournfully who would have thoughtyou would run a deep finesse and who would have thought it would work i had to heinrich answered it was the only way i even had a chance to make four so i thought why not thats the way to do it erika said if youve got one chancetake it she looked right at him as she said that he passed her the cards in a hurry he knew too well she wasnt talking about bridge in spite of that hand she and willi won the rubber they didnt win by as much as they would have if willi hadnt doubled erika let willi hear about that when it was over he gave her a dirty look we won he said quit complaining if that wasnt calculated to annoy her it certainly did the job the only way heinrich found to make them stop bickering was to bring out a fresh bottle of wine a fancy burgundy it made willi wonder aloud whether hed robbed a bank or started taking kickbacks from the americans heinrich didnt care if willi was teasing him he wasnt throwing darts at erika when he wasnt he was good companyand so was she of course the more they drank the less they were liable to care what they said heinrich knew he might only be putting off trouble if he didnt put it off though he already had it inside the door he and lise won the next rubber all the hands were cut and dried nobody could complain about anyones play that relieved heinrich how fast the bottle of burgundy emptied didnt especially since willi and erika drank more of it than lise and he did he didnt begrudge them the wine but he feared it wouldnt just bein vino veritas in vino calamitas seemed much more likely the third rubber also went well enough erika and willi won it as smoothly and as competently as he and lise had taken the second heinrichs only bad moment came when erika started loudly praising the first edition of mein kampf but he could even cautiously agree with her she couldnt be far wrong if the fuhrer was saying the same thing because the first three rubbers had gone briskly they decided to play another one lise who drank the least of the four of them broke out another bottle of wine however much heinrich wanted to he couldnt yellmy god what are you doing since he couldnt he waited numblyquite numbly since hed had a good bit himselfto see what happened next what happened next was that willi went down three on a hand he should have been able to make with his eyes closed considering the way he played it he might have had them closed all through it when it was finally over he looked at his tricks and the defenders like a man contemplating a traffic accident hed caused well he said in tones of rueful surprise thatdidnt work ill tell you why it didnt work too erika said it didnt work because youre an idiot i dont know what i could have willi began she told him she told him in great detail and she was quite obviously right then she said if you cant hit the target any better with ilse shes got an heinrich and lise both said something anything to keep erika from finishing that sentence afterwards heinrich never could remember what had burst from his lips or from his wifes erikadidnt finish either a triumph of sorts but only of sorts for enough of the damage was already done willi went a hot crimson color his skin might have belonged to a perfectly ripe apple youve got a lot of damned nerve complaining about me he said his voice low and rough and furious youre the one who wants to enough that wasnt heinrich but lise she rarely raised her voice when she did as now surprise made everyone pay attention to her she went on theres a time and a place for everything and this isnt the time and the place for that the dorsches could easily have erupted if they had the friendship probably would have exploded right there at the bridge table heinrich waited the shrapnel from that explosion would tear into him not into his wife but it didnt come erika and willi kept on glaring at each other but neither one of them said anything new and inflammatory after a long long moment erika turned to lise and said you make good sense i see where heinrich gets it ohquatsch lise said now i have to figure out which one of us you just insulted she gathered up the cards in the meantime can we play some bridge hitting each other over the head with rocks is a different game and it shouldnt be a spectator sport what do you know about it willi asked half blustering half amused you and heinrich never do it she and heinrich both laughed raucously heinrich knew their marriage had its creaks and strains as what marriage does not he could put his finger on four or five without even thinking no doubt lise could do the same and no doubt some of his wouldnt be the same as some of hers which was in itself a strain but none of that was anybodys business but his and lises that thought led him to the next one we just try not to do it when other people are watching oh but having other people watch is half the fun willi said erika nodded there for once she agreed with her husband heinrich on the other hand did his best to hide a shudder little green men from mars could have had no more alien an attitude put your life on display as if you were characters on a daytime televisor drama he couldnt imagine living like that one of the reasons he and lise got on so well was that she was as intensely private a person as he was whose deal is it anyhow willi asked as easily as if he and erika hadnt been shelling each other a couple of minutes before lets see if i can butcher another one eh erika stirred suddenly she jerked in surprise had lise kicked her under the table heinrich had trouble imagining his wife doing such a thing he also had trouble finding any other reason erika would have jerked like that willi did win the contract at three diamonds he made it heinrich hadnt been sure he would but he did if anything that left heinrich relieved he wasnt used to rooting for the opposition he didnt much like it it took the competitive edge off the bridge the dorsches won the rubber again heinrich wasnt sorry and wished he were usually they would have talked and drunk for a while after they set down the cardsor maybe they just would have played some more tonight willi and erika got up and left with only the most perfunctory goodbyes heinrich and lise didnt ask them to stay longer even in the most perfunctory way are we going to be able to have them over any more or to go to their place lise asked once theyd gone the bridge is all very well but some things are more trouble than theyre worth yes i know heinrich said he also feared he knew what willi had been about to say when lise forestalled him after erika jabbed him about ilse he would have jabbed her about making a play for heinrich if things had been bad had been ugly before then how much worse and uglier would they have got afterwards heinrich was a man who thought in quantitative terms if he couldnt put numbers to something it didnt feel real to him he couldnt put numbers to this but for once he didnt need to it would have been about as bad as it could get alicia gimpel didnt like december the sun rose late and set early and clouds and fog were so thick you mostly couldnt see it when it did sneak into the sky it rained a lot of the time when it didnt rain sometimes it snowed some people said they liked having seasonsit made them enjoy spring and summer more alicia couldnt fathom that she wished she lived somewhere like italy where it was warm and nice almost all year round the only thing december had going for it was christmas she liked the tree and its spicy smell and the ornaments and gifts she liked the fat roast goose her mother cooked every year she liked the break from school she got at christmas and new years and of course she liked the presents this year though she looked at christmas in a new way up till now it had always beenher holiday if she was a jew though it was someone elses holiday her family would still do the same things she was sure of that they would have to if they didnt people would wonder why not but what they did wouldnt feel the same then something else occurred to her jews had their own new years day they had other holidays of their own too she remembered purim when shed found out she was a jew she asked her mother do we have a holiday of our own thats like christmas lise gimpel was frying potato pancakes fragrant with onion in a big pan of hot oil where are your sisters was the first thing she asked theyre upstairs alicia answered her mother looked around to make sure alicia was right then she answered we have a holiday at this time of year its called chanukah she told of antiochus war against the jews more than years before and of the oil that burned for eight days instead of just one alicia listened entranced then as was her way she started thinking about what shed heard the persians wanted to get rid of us she said her mother nodded and these syrians or greeks or whatever they were wanted to get rid of us mommy nodded again alicia went on and the nazis wanted to get rid of us too you know thats true her mother said they still do never forget it i wont i cant alicia said but what did we ever do to make so many people want to wipe us out i dont think we ever tried to do anything her mother replied we just tried to live our own lives our own way there has to be more than that alicia insisted her mother shook her head she asked well why is it just us then its notjust us her mother answered the turks did it to the armenians the germans did it to the gypsies too the americans did it to their blacks i think its happened to us so much because were stubborn about being what we are we didnt want to worship antiochus gods we had our own god we didnt think jesus was anything special people made us pay for that too we want to do what we do thats alldo it and not be bothered we dont bother anybody else it seems likean awful lot of trouble alicia said hesitantly well yes her mother managed a smile but we think its what god wants us to do too you know i suppose so alicia frowned how do we know thats what god wants us to do though i didnt say we knew i said we thought so her mother sighed i could tell you thats what the bible says but if you look through the bible and pick out this and that you can make it say anything under the sun so ill just say this is what weve thought for all these years all these generations ever since before the maccabees before esther and mordechai its a long long chain of people the nazis almost broke it but they didnt quite do you want to let them no alicia said not when you put it like that she had a childs conservatism things that were should keep on going and she also had her own strong sense of order one much like her fathers when all you girls find out what you are well be able to do a little more for chanukah her mother said youll all get some chanukahgelt for the eight nights youre supposed to light candles too one the first night two the second and so on up to eight i dont know if well ever be able to try that though if anybody caught us it would be the end hiding doing what you could remembering what you were supposed to do but couldnt maybe one day your descendants would be able to if they ever could those were things they would need to know a long long chain of people that was what alicias mother had said suddenly alicia realized she wasnt the last link on the chain others would come after her one day in the far far future there would be as many ahead of her as behind herif the chain didnt break here i understand she whispered i really do good her mother flipped potato pancakes with an iron spatula we make these at chanukah too thats not part of the religion its just part of the celebration and the nice thing is its safe because people make potato pancakes all the time nobody particularly notices if you do nobody particularly notices if you do what francesca asked from the doorway alicia jumped her heart leaped into her throat how much had her little sister overheard enough to send her running to the security police because she didnt know what was what maybe not or she wouldnt have asked that particular question she must have got there just before she spoke up mommy never turned a hair nobody particularly notices if you give somebody a potato pancake before supper she said and scooped out threeone for alicia one for francesca and one for roxane be careful with them theyre hot and francesca go get your little sister so she can have one too yours will cool off in the meantime away francesca ran alicia shared a secret smile with her mother they knew something the smaller girls didnt and it would stay a secret for a while and then get told and the chain would go on x as far as susanna weiss was concerned faculty new years parties were as dismal as they sounded people who often didnt much like one another gathered in a place where none of them particularly wanted to be they talked too much they drank too much they made passes they would have known were hopeless or offensive if they hadnt drunk too much and they had to show up and go through the ordeal every bloody year because if they didnt they would hear about it from the department chairman franz oppenhoff had a long memory for those who disdained his hospitality such mistakes had blighted careers to add insult to injury he served cheap scotch even if it was cheap though itand the schnapps and the brandy and the wine and the beerdid help loosen tongues and even if people did talk too much there was more to talk about than usual it wasnt just whod published what in which academic journal whod been promoted or passed over and who was sleeping with which bright andor beautiful student this year for the first time in susannas memory and probably for the first time in old man oppenhoffs too people were talking politics this system has grit in the gears but i am of the opinion that we can clean it up lubricate it and make it run smoothly the way it should declared helmut von kupferstein who was a goethe scholar susanna was of the opinion that von kupferstein was a pompous ass he was also thirty centimeters taller than she was and kept threatening to drop cigarette ashes in her drink without having any idea he was doing it she also knew he would never have dared such a thing while kurt haldweim was fuhrer still she could say i hope we can make things better without fearing the security police would haul her away five seconds later and so she did von kupfersteinhe was the sort who insisted on thevon nodded ponderously about a centimeter of ash from the cigarette went flying susanna jerked her glass aside just in time the ash landed on the carpet she stepped on it he said all things are possible under heinz buckliger he who wishes to uphold the truth and has but one tongue he will uphold it indeed he looked smug at working in a quotation from faust but susanna here couldnt quarrel with himexcept about that damned cigarette this is a good attitude to have she said we havent always been perfectly truthful before the great masses of the people will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one that was a quotation too from mein kampf she couldnt very well go wrong there helmut von kupferstein nodded in recognition oh yes but the national socialists were upandcomers then he said such things are beneath the dignity of those who actually rule they havent been susanna said and walked away if he thought indignity was the only thing wrong with lies but even that wouldnt have occurred to him a year earlier or if it had he wouldnt have had the nerve to say it if buckliger was making people look at the way things were and compare them to the way they ought to be that was a step forward near the liquorno great surprise therefranz oppenhoff stood pontificating to several professors not clever enough to get away but clever enough to look fascinated at the department chairmans every word oppenhoff said some remarkable things have happened this past year not the least remarkable of which is that they have been allowed to happen jawohl herr doktor professor three members of the captive audience said at the same time we have been ordered to be free and sofree we shall be professor oppenhoff stood there beaming unconscious of any irony the junior members of the faculty all but genuflected that the department chairman didnt know he was being ironic frightened susanna more than anything else and yet was he so far wrong all heinz buckliger had done was loosen the straps of the straitjacket a little susanna didnt think the fuhrer wanted anything more than to make it fit the reich better but if people started trying to wiggle out of the sleeves how could he complain he was the one whod made it possible in the first place would they really start wiggling the english proverb wasgive em an inch and theyll take a mile the reich had taken both inches and miles from britain forcing the metric system on it the point remained if the fuhrer gave an inch susanna shook her head and went over to the scotch again if the fuhrer gave an inch the ss was all too likely to take it away againand to break your fingers because youd tried to grab it professor oppenhoff fixed himself another drink too the old boy had to have a liver like a sponge he could pour down a lot of sauce without showing it like an oldfashioned archduke he inclined his head to susanna a good new year to you professor weiss he rumbled and exhaled a cloud of cigar smoke almost as toxic as mustard gas thank you sir the same to you susanna wondered how she could get away i daresay you approve of the radical changes we have seen lately oppenhoff observed there was a notquitequestion that dropped her right in the middle of a minefield if she denied it hed know she was lying shed always been as radical as she could be in a police state if she admitted it that might come back to haunt her after a crackdown the calculations you had to make living in such a state hard not to approve of anything that lets us inquire more openly into all sorts of things she said after no more than a seconds silence if she kept her answer strictly related to business it wasshe hopedless likely to seem politically dangerous inquire more openly professor oppenhoff pondered that with a judicious puff on the cigar and another cloud of poisonous smoke we in the department of germanic languages have never been greatly restricted in our scholarship well no susanna said could he be as naive as he sounded she had trouble believing it true the nazis didnt interfere so much with a professor of middle english or gothic or old high german but why would they susannas research touched the modern world almost nowhere if shed taught sociology or psychology or political science it would have been a different story anthropology anthropology was so full of aryan doctrine it was hard to tell scienceif there was anyfrom ideology there franz oppenhoff seemed oblivious to all that inquiry is good he said with the air of a man making a large concession then his gaze sharpened and i congratulate you on placing your recent articles in two most distinguished journals this brings credit to the whole department danke schon herr doktor professor susanna said i hope you will agree it also brings credit to me did oppenhoff turn red with all the booze he carried it was hard to tell the cigar could have caused his cough no doubt it does he said without conviction your research is ah most original thank you again susanna said though he hadnt meant it for a compliment shed undoubtedly written more about the roles of women in literature for instance than all the men in the department put togetherherr doktor professor oppenhoff would have looked down his nose at that even more than he didhe was an unreconstructed kuche kirche kinder manif she hadnt repeatedly placed her articles in some of the most prestigious academic publications in the germanic empire modern ideas he muttered now well you are better suited to cope with them than i am when they say they are going to change the ideology we have lived under for longer than i have been aliveis it any wonder i have a hard time working up much enthusiasm if the change is for the better we should make it susanna said she made herself a fresh drink wishing the scotch would change for the better yes if oppenhoff said who knows whatever happens you are bound to see more of it than i do with that cheery reflection he went off to inflict himself on someone else susanna took a long pull at the new drink even if it was nasty if the security police ever found out what she was the department chairman would outlive her by years whats this heinrich gimpel asked as he and willi dorsch got off their bus and started toward oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters the trip in from stahnsdorf hadnt been much fun an icy dagger of a wind from off the balticseemingly straight from the north polebrought flurries of snow and spatters of freezing rain with it which made standing at the bus stop an ordeal then the bus had had to detour around a wreck the freezing rain had probably caused and now blackuniformed security police stood alongside the usual wehrmacht guards the wehrmacht men did not look delighted to have company have you forgotten willi answered the gauleiter s going to tell us howwunderbar we are this morning oh joy heinrich had no trouble containing his enthusiasm rolf stolle the party leader who essentially ran berlin was a harddrinking womanizing bruiser if this generation had anybody whose debauchery came close to the legendary gorings stolle was the man what he knows about this place would fit on the head of a pin well yes willi said but hell be entertaining wouldnt you rather listen to him than stare at spreadsheets the honest answer to that was no if heinrich said as much willi would laugh at him and call him a greasy grind he shrugged instead willi laughed at him anyway which meant he knew what heinrich wasnt saying up at the top of the stairs the berlin police scrutinized identification cards before giving them to the usual guards to run through the reader the wehrmacht men smirked slightly as they returned the cards to heinrich and willithese fellows think theyre important they might have saidthey think so but theyre wrong signs taped to the walls said hear rolf stolle in the assembly hall heinrich sighed he really would rather have worked what did he need with one more tubthumping nazi blowhard but he couldnt take the chance of antagonizing the partyif anybody wonders why one of my projects is late ill tell the truth thats all televisor cameras were set up in the assembly hall whatever stolle said would go out locally it might even go out all over the reich all over the empire that did not rouse heinrichs enthusiasm broadcast speeches were no more exciting than any other kind rolf stolle clumped around up on stage he was a big bald bear of a man with a wrestlers shoulders and an actors large graceful hands resignedly heinrich sat down in a plushy chair he wondered if he could fall asleep without being noticed he closed his eyes in an experimental way but he was awake if he hadnt had his morning coffeehe had thoughmaybe stolle will put me under there was a hopeful thought more analysts and officers and secretaries came in till the front rows were full and the hall nearly so it wouldnt do for the gauleiter to make a televised speech in front of a lot of empty seats stolle took his place behind the lectern more security police stood behind him as bodyguards heinrich tried to yawn without opening his mouth by the way willi snickered he might have done better good morning gentlemenand all you pretty ladies too stolle boomed a couple of women giggled at his leer heinrichs guess was that the luck he enjoyed with them came from his rank not from his personhe certainly wouldnt have wanted that big oaf pawing him the gauleiter went on we are where we are today because of what the wehrmacht has done for the reich without our armed forces germany would be weak and our enemies strong with them we are strong and our enemies mostly dead heinrich didnt bother keeping his mouth shut when he yawned this time how often had he heard such boastful claptrap more often than he wanted he knew that next stolle would talk about how wonderful the national socialists were and he did the wehrmacht is the gun and the party is the man who aims it we chose the targets for your might and you knocked them down one by one wise leadership served us well it was all as predictable as the mass with fancy uniforms and swastika flags the nazis tried to make such ceremonials as majestic as the mass too in heinrichs privatevery privateopinion they were just bombastic to most party bonzen the two words might have been interchangeable but then though rolf stolle kept right on hamming it up for all he was worth he suddenly stopped boring heinrich for he went on wise leadership is always important and our beloved fuhrer is very wise in setting our affairs to rights some of the things we did in days gone by are no longer needed and some of the things we did in days gone by perhaps we never should have done at all heinrich looked at willi willi was looking back at him a low mutter of surprise ran through the hall whatever people had expected stolle to say this wasnt it there are people who say lets not change this he rolled on there are people who say lets not remember this there are people who say lets not remind the volk that the party was supposed to be democratic that the first fuhrer said so right from the start these people some of them have lots of decorations these people some of them have lots of power these people most of them have got fat and comfortable and lazy with things just the way they are andmeine damen und herren thats a pile of crap the mutter of astonishment that went through the hall wasnt low this time rolf stolle beamed as if hed set eyes on a goodlooking blonde his bald bullet head gleamed under the televisor lights a pile of crap i saidmeine damen und herren and a pile of crap i meant the fuhrer knows it too and hes trying to clean it up but he needs help and he needs something else too trouble is heinz buckliger is a gentleman he wants to go slow he wants to be polite he doesnt want to hurt anybodys feelings god forbid but i am here to tell you i dont think going slow and being polite will get the job done i am here to tell you when you see a pile of crap you grab the biggest goddamn shovel you can find you wade in and you clean it up no ifs ands or buts stolle slammed his fist down on the lectern we have to move faster we have to push harder if it were up to me id get rid of a lot of the lemonfaced naysayers who sit behind big desks and look important let em do something useful for a change or else put em out to pastureand let the people speak as soon as we have real elections youll see what they think about folk like that the sooner the better and let the chips fall where they may they will toodanke schon auf wiedersehen he made as much of a production of leaving the stage as most people did of coming to it only a thin spattering of applause followed him heinrich understood that he hardly remembered to clap himself what hed heard what rolf stolle had said left him stunned he couldnt possibly have been the only one either beside him willi said my god no heinrich couldnt have been and he wasnt he said some people dont like the fuhrer because hes doing too much i knew that i never dreamt anybody would have the nerve to say hes not doing enough neither did i willi said stolles off the reservationhe has to be and hell beon the televisor for all i know that speech could have been broadcast live what are people going to think whats buckliger going to think beats me heinrich answered maybe hes saying what buckliger told him to fat chance when was the last time anybody ever criticized a fuhrer willi said and you were the fellow who didnt want to come he added as they got up and started back to their office you were the fellow who didnt want to leave his precious desk what do you think now i think id have felt like an idiot if id stayed away heinrich said honestly a speech like that will go in the history booksif stolle isnt taken out and shot in the next few days anyhow by the look on willis face he was thinking the same thing if rolf stolle thought his speech would land him in trouble he gave no sign of it he came into the office where the budget analysts worked he wasnt after information the way heinz buckliger had been he just wanted to see and especially to be seen heinrich watched ilse watching the gauleiter and watched willi watching ilse watching the gauleiter ilse looked charmed or perhaps calculating willi looked dyspepticwas the word that came to mind and stolle noticed ilse too hello sweetie he said what do you do around here why whatever these gentlemen want me to domein herr she answered in a breathy littlegirl voice do you now the gauleiter rumbled his eyes lit up maybe you could do that kind of work for me too let me have your number well see what we can find out he didnt pretend to be anything but the predator he was ilse gave him her extension willi quietly steamed heinrich did his best to seem very very busy rolf stolle swept away flanked by his bodyguards how many other phone numbers would he collect before he went back to his own office more than a few unless heinrich was altogether mistaken he missed some of the subtle human byplay that went on around him he didnt think he was missing anything heresubtle was not a word in stolles vocabulary but some of the words that were in his vocabulary when this speech went out a lot of party bonzen would hate him but a lot of ordinary people would love him which counted for more till heinz buckliger took over the answer would have been obvious it wasnt any more and whatwould buckliger himself think of stolles speech that might be the most interesting question of them all esther stutzman looked up from the billing to see a woman and a little boy come into dr dambachs waiting room good morningfrau klein she said good morning eduard how are you today imall right said eduard who was just in for a checkup maria klein let out a long sigh im not so wellfrau stutzman she said in public they didnt let on how well they knew each other away from the pediatricians office but she didnt look good makeup couldnt hide the dark circles under her eyes and their whites were tracked with red richard and i have decided to take paul to a reichs mercy center im so sorry esther whispered hell be better eduard said hell be happy after that hes not happy now his mother winced and turned away for a moment it wasnt that eduard was wrong for he wasnt from everything esther had unwillingly learned taysachs disease was a slow descent into hell made all the worse because the children who suffered from it were too little to understand what was happening to them but that made it no easier for parents to let go of children who had it how could you not love a child even ifor maybe especially becausesomething was wrong with it he was such a sweet baby maria whispered he still is as much as he can be but he she turned away again and fished a tissue out of her purse i dont want eduard to see me like this she said dabbing at her eyes i see you mommy to eduard none of this meant much he was the lucky one and paul will be all better you and daddy said so yes sweetheart hell be just fine maria said why dont you go sit down and look at a picture book till its time to see the doctor eduard went the book he picked up was trust no fox in the green meadow and no jew on his oath it had been in the waiting room since before esther started working for dr dambach the pediatrician took the book for granted why shouldnt he it had been a childrens favorite and a party favorite for seventyfive years eduard opened it he smiled as he swallowed a dose of cheerful colorful poison maria klein saw what her son was looking at the most she could do was exchange a rueful glance with esther if shed come in for an afternoon appointment today when irma ritter sat behind the counter she couldnt even have done that so much eduard will have to unlearn when he gets olderesther thought sadly gottlieb and anna were still battling that so was alicia gimpel esther knew she was still battling it herself and would be till the end of her days when everyone around her thought she and all the people like her deserved to be dead how could she help wondering whether what the nazis taught wasnt right after all those were the black thoughts the upatthreeinthemorningandcantsleep thoughts she knew they were nonsense she knew but they kept coming back anyway maria sat down by eduard he held the book up to her look mommy its funny she made herself look she had to know what was in there when she was eduards age shed probably thought it was funny too with a visible effort she nodded yes dear she said it is a woman came out of one of the examination rooms carrying a wailing toddler whod just had a tetanus shot she may be cranky and feverish for a day or two and the injection site will be sore dr dambach told her a painrelieving syrup will help if the discomfort seems severe bring her back in and ill look at her how many times had he made that speech thank you doctor the woman said the toddler didnt seem grateful frau klein you can take your boy back in there now esther called poor maria got no relief for eduard carried streichers book into the examining room with him when he laughed at the antisemitic book that had to be one more lash for her especially since her other son was dying of a disease commonest among jews dr dambach had patients waiting in the other examining rooms it was a while before he could get to maria and eduard once he went in there he spent a good long while with the kleins esther knew he was thorough if he hadnt been he wouldnt have noticed discrepancies in their genealogy usually though that thoroughness worked for him and for his patients when he came out with maria and her son he had one hand on the boys shoulder and the other on hers this one here is in the best of healthfrau klein he said hell drive you crazy for years to come crazy eduard said enthusiastically he crossed his eyes and stuck out his tongue the pediatrician ignored him which wasnt easy dambach went on talking to maria klein and i think you are doing the right thing in the other case the procedure is very fast it is absolutely painless and it does relieve needless suffering pauls yes she answered what about mine and my husbands things are not always as simple as we wish they would be dr dambach said with a sigh you have the suffering of doing this yes but you escape the suffering of watching his inevitable downhill course over the coming months perhaps even over a couple of years which counts for more i dont know maria whispered do you the pediatrician shrugged he was basically an honest man now that the kleins had been released he showed no antagonism toward them hed done what he thought he had to do in reporting the discrepancy in their pedigree to the authorities if the authorities turned out not to care he didnt seem to either maria went on and its also hard knowing that theres a fiftyfifty chance eduard carries this horriblething inside him dont let that worry you dr dambach said in most populations this gene is very rare even if he does carry it the odds that he will marry another carrier are also very slim there is hardly any chance he would father another baby with this disease maria klein didnt answer like all surviving jews she was practiced in the art of deception so she didnt even look towards esther esther didnt look her way either but kept on with the billing as she and eduard walked out but she knew and maria knew in fifteen or twenty years eduard would probably marry a girl who was a jew and in how many of those girls did the taysachs gene lurk the kleins left the waiting room esther called in the next patients but she had trouble keeping her mind on her work if jews kept marrying jews would disease finish what the nazis hadnt quite been able to but if jews didnt marry jews wouldnt the faith perish because they couldnt tell their partners what they were was there a way out for the life of her esther couldnt see one susanna weiss had been taking her students through chaucers troylus and criseyde when she asked for questions one of them asked this is the basis for shakespeares play isnt it its probably the most important source yes but its far from the only one she answered again the question reminded her how shakespeare was a more vital presence in modern germany than in england his troilus and cressida was rarely produced or even read in english a few more questions about the material followed students started drifting out the door othersnot so manycame up to the lectern to ask questions of less general interest to pump her on what the next essay topic would be or to complain about the grades theyd got on the last one and then one of the students asked what did you think of stolles speech professor weiss it was interesting susanna answered we havent heard anything like it in a while that was the truth when had anyone ever publicly criticized the fuhrer even for not pushing his own agenda far enough and fast enough had anyone ever done such a thing in all the days of the third reich she didnt think so but what did youthink of it he persisted isnt it wonderful to hear somebody come out and speak his mind like that she didnt say anything for a momentwho are you she wondered all she knew about this enthusiastic undergrad was that his name was karl stuckart and he was getting a medium b in the course what did he do when he wasnt in her class did he report to the ss lothar prutzmann who headed the blackshirts undoubtedly had an opinion about stolles speech a low opinion and if stuckart didnt report to the ss did some of the other smiling students herethe smiler with a knife a fine chaucerian phrase one of those students an auburnhaired girl named mathilde burchert said i certainly think its about time we get moving with reform weve been in the doldrums forever and the gauleiter s right the fuhrer s not going fast enough several other students smiled and nodded susanna smiled too but she didnt nod she didnt know much about mathilde burchert either was she serious was she naive was she a provocateur either working with stuckart or independently were the young men and women who showed they agreed with her fools or did they sense a breeze susanna couldnt or wouldnt feel she hated mistrusting everyone around her she hated it but she couldnt let it go were she worried about only her own safety she thought she would have but choices she would make for herself she wouldnt for other jews she might endanger if she turned out to be wrong whatdo you think professor another student asked her i think the fuhrer will go at his own pace regardless of whether anyone tries to jog his elbow she answered hard to go wronghard to land in troublefor backing the fuhrer it made her seem safely moderate not a hardliner who hated the very idea of change but not a wildeyed bombthrowing radical either and whats a moderate someone who gets shot at from the rightandthe left she wished she hadnt had that thought karl didnt want to leave things alone i wasnt so much talking about what would happen i was talking about what should happen no matter how susanna seemed her instincts were of the wildeyed bombthrowing sort and to a degree that made rolf stolle hopelessly stodgy like buckliger stolle wanted to reform the reich susanna wanted to see it fall to pieces to ruin to disaster unparalleled she wished its foes would have smashed it in the second world war or the third maybe then she could have lived openly as what she was ill never do that now hiding is too ingrained in me even if i knew they wouldnt kill me i couldnt reveal myself that way easier to walk up the middle of the kurfurstendamm naked id like to vote in an election where i had a real choice mathilde said i dont know who id vote for but there sure are plenty of people id vote against again several of the youngsters up by the lectern showed they agreed with her only a couple of them frowned but who was more likely to be a spy for the security police someone who pretended to agree or someone who openly didnt susanna sighed that question had no answer anyone could spy for the security police anyone at all mathilde looked right at her how about you professor weiss dont you think wed be better off with real elections than with the ones where everybody just votesja all the time when horst says all the reichstag candidates got elected with percent of the vote dont you wonder how he keeps a straight face its such a farce you must feel the same way too youre a sharp person anyone can tell from the way you lecture tell us tell us the other students echoedtell us youre with it tell us youre not a fuddyduddy tell us we dont have to turn into fuddyduddies when were your age please tell us am i a sharp personsusanna wonderedam i really am i sharp enough to keep my mouth shut when i really want to shout to scream i dont know anything about politics she said as long as the politicians leave me alone ill leave them alone too but theydont leave us alone mathilde said fiercely if you say the wrong thing today youre liable to get a noodle tomorrow camp slang permeated german these days often people didnt even know where it came from when you were talking about a bullet in the back of the neck though there wasnt much doubt well susannas conditioned caution warred with the fury and outrage shed bottled up for so long she surprised herself what came out was a compromise and she wasnt usually good at splitting the difference all or nothing was more her style but now she said i wasnt sorry when the fuhrer reminded the volk about what the first edition of mein kampf says in fact i was in london for a conference last year when the british union of fascists reminded us all you were in london for the buf convention was that awe or horror in karl stuckarts voice some of each probably maybe he was wondering ifshe had ss connections no no no susanna shook her head i was in london for the medieval english association conference the buf was meeting across the street that shed found some of the fascist bruisers more interesting than her fellow professors was a secret she intended to keep its a shame the british had to remind us of what we should have remembered for ourselvesno what we never should have forgotten mathilde burchert said most of the other students nodded they didnt seem to fear informers or provocateurs maybe they were too young to know better although in the greater german reich you were never too young to learn such lessons or did they smell freedom on the wind heinrich gimpel pulled a copy of the volkischer beobachter out of the vending machine in the stahnsdorf train station a moment later willi dorsch paid fifteen pfennigs for his own copy on the front page was a color photo of heinz buckliger receiving an award in oslo from the nasjonal samling the norwegian fascist party the fuhrer was a big blond man the nasjonal samling officials in the photo were even bigger and even blonder with long faces and granite cheekbones willi saw the same thing at the same time damned scandinavians are the only ones who can racially embarrass us he said bastards look more nordic than we do was willi kidding was he kidding on the square or did he really mean it heinrich had trouble telling willi loved to joke but race in the reich was as serious a business as marxism had been in russia before it fell even the fuhrer hadnt said anything more than that the nazi founding fathers might not have understood race the right way heinrich gave back a grunt and a noda minimal answer they went up to the platform together and got there just in time to catch the train to berlin willi grabbed the window seat then proceeded to unfold his paper and ignore the scenery rolling by hed seen it often enough anyhow so had heinrich who sat down beside him and also buried his nose in the beobachter willi seemed to ignore his troubles with erika too except that every once in a while he would come out with a remark that also left heinrich wondering how to take it the two of them stiffened within thirty seconds of each other they both pointed to the same article on page three the headline above it said enough is enough the byline was konrad jahnke not a name heinrich had seen before he soon found out why the author declared himself to be a doctor from breslau not a reporter at all i am sick and tiredhe wroteof inaccuracies that blacken the history of the reichand the heroic deeds of our ancestors why men who were not there to see them now presume to cast judgment is beyond me we should be grateful for what our ancestors accomplished without their heroism jewish communists in russia and jewish capitalists in england and the united states would have swallowed up the whole world between them well well willi said looks like the other shoe just dropped doesnt it you might say that heinrich replied yes you just might say that someone didnt like stolles speech did he not very much willi said they both spoke of the article elliptically and in understatements that was the best way to play down how frightening it was heinrich read on with a detached horrified fascination the sort of fascination he would have given to a really nasty traffic accident on the other side of the roadthe whole business of repression has been blown out of proportion in some younger mens heads dr jahnke declaredit overshadows any objective analysis of the past hitler may have made mistakes but no one else could have readied the reichfor the great struggle against bolshevism anyone who thinks he can deny this suffers from ideological confusion and has lost his political bearings jahnke wasnt afraid to name the gauleiter of berlin sayingrolf stolle in his arrogance departs substantially from the accepted principles of national socialism and he went onother leaders try to make us believe that the countrys past was nothing but mistakes and crimes keeping silent about the greatest achievements of the past and the present he didnt name heinz buckliger but he came close there is an internal process in this country and abroadthe doctor from breslau thunderedthat seeks to falsify the truths of national socialism too many ignore the worldhistorical mission of the volkand its role in the national socialist movement i for one can never forsake my ideals under any pretext when heinrich finished the piece he let out a small tuneless whistle beside him willi nodded heavily as if hed just done a good job of summing things up who heinrich said who would have the nerve to publish such a thing why you see for yourself willi answered hes a doctor from breslau that gives him the right to say anything he pleases quatschheinrich said and then several things a great deal more pungent than that do you notice how carefully this was timed think its an accident that it shows up in the beobachter when buckligers out of the country just a coincidence willi said airily what else could it possibly be they got this letter and an assistant editor liked it and so he couldnt go on not with a straight face he started to snort and then to giggle any junior man who published an inflammatoryto say nothing of reactionarypiece like this without getting it cleared from on high would shortly thereafter wish hed never been born if you want to talk sense now lets try it again heinrich unconsciously lowered his voice as people did when they spoke of dangerous things who willi leaned toward him and whispered in his ear prutzmann naming the ss chief was more dangerous and so he did it more quietly still whispering he went on cant be anybody else if prutzmann says to print it whos going to tell him no the fuhrer might make a no stick but hes not here like you say anybody else not a chance no way in hell that made much more sense than heinrich wished it did if lothar prutzmann disliked reform so much did it have any hope of sticking if prutzmann disliked heinz buckligers policies so much did buckliger have any chance of staying fuhrer for very long it seemed unlikely to say the least well see what happens when buckliger comes home thats all willi said if he lets this ride he didnt go on or need to if the fuhrer accepted a rebuke like this any hope of change was dead and things would go on as they always had if buckliger didnt accept it thoughif he didnt accept it things were liable to get very interesting very fast the train pulled into south station heinrich and willi went up to catch the bus to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters whenever heinrich saw somebody carrying a volkischer beobachter he tried to eavesdrop how were berliners taking this for that matter how were people in breslau and bonn and other secondrate towns taking it this might not play out so neatly or so quickly he heard only two snatches of conversation both from people going down escalators as he was going up past them one was damn fool and the other about timeand both could have meant anything or nothing so much for eavesdropping nobody on the bus out of south station seemed to be talking about enough is enough that might have been out of a sense of selfpreservation people on that bus were heading for the beating heart of the greater german reich and of the germanic empire or it might just have been to drive heinrich crazy he wouldnt have been surprised when he got off in front of oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters he looked across adolf hitler platz to the fuhrer s palace buckliger wasnt there now of course but if he didnt already have a copy of the volkischer beobachter he would soon what he did after that would say a lot about who ran the reich as usual heinrich and willi gave the guards at the top of the stairs their identification cards one of the guards said well see if stolle wants the blackshirts standing watch over him after whats in todays papers would you willi asked the guard waited till the card showed green on the machine reader then shook his head that aspect of things hadnt occurred to heinrich until then if he were rolf stolle would he want prutzmanns henchmen keeping him safe he didnt think so who could arrange a tragic accident more easily than bodyguards nobody nobody in all the world ilse was on the telephone when heinrich and willi walked into their big office she hung up a moment later her face flushed with excitement the gauleiter is taking me out to lunch today me can you believe it isnt it amazing heinrich didnt say anything willi said amazing in tones suggesting the only thing along those lines to delight him more would have been an outbreak of bubonic plague ilse might not even have noticed his gloom next to rolf stolle a budget analyst wasnt amazing at all how would willi handle that heinrich sat down got to work and watched his friend from the corner of his eye willi sat there and fumed so openly that heinrich wondered if the office smoke detectors would start buzzing if stolle came to pick ilse up he might need protection against more than lothar prutzmann and the ss but the gauleiter of berlin didnt come in person and the men who did take ilse off to whatever rendezvous stolle had set up werent the blackshirted guards whod accompanied him on his last visit to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters they wore the gray uniforms of ordinary berlin policemen men much more likely to follow stolle than prutzmann willi noticed that too heinrich could see it on his face it didnt make him look any happier willis worries of course were personal heinrichs were more on the order ofif the ss tries to assassinate stolle could those fellows keep him safe only one answer sprang to mindhow the devil do i know ilse came back from lunch very very late with a big bouquet of roses in her arms and schnapps on her breath she giggled a lot and didnt do much work the rest of the afternoon somehow heinrich doubted rolf stolle had spent their time together talking about how to reform national socialism lise gimpel got the last of the dishes in the sink as her husband called hurry up sweetheart horst is just coming on here i am lise sat down beside him on the sofa she couldnt help adding id have been here sooner if youd helped oh heinrich looked astonished as if that hadnt occurred to him it probably hadnt she was just going to beat him about the head and shoulders for his male iniquity when he asked why didnt you say something sooner when i could have given you a hand that hadnt occurred to her i thought youd be tired from your day at the office by now were both tired its the tired time of day he was right about that before lise could say so horst witzlebens handsome blond ultraaryan features filled the screen a moment later after the newscasters greeting the scene cut away to a junkers jet airlinerluftwaffe alfathe code name waslanding at tempelhof airport our beloved fuhrer heinz buckliger returned to the capital this afternoon after a highly successful tour of the scandinavian countries witzleben said he spoke briefly to reporters before going on to his official residence the televisor showed buckliger standing behind a lectern ornamented with the usual gilded germanic eagle holding a swastika in its claws heinrich leaned forward intently this is important really important he said if he ignored the piece that jahnke put out last week why dont you just listen and find out what he said lise asked her husband looked flabbergasted again so much so that she almost laughed at him i was pleased to visit our fellowaryan friends and neighbors to the north the fuhrer said and particularly pleased to hear their leaders expressions of support for the course upon which the reich has embarked those leaders feel as i do that anyone who seeks to put the brakes on reform is suffering from a bad case of nostalgia for the dead days that will not and cannot return yes heinrich exploded as if the german team had scored the winning goal in overtime in the world cup finals it is proving harder than expected to get rid of old thoughts and habits but we must not turn back buckliger went on recently some have claimed that we can justify everything that has happened in terms of worldhistorical necessity but not all such deeds can be explained away they are alien to the principles of national socialism and only took place because of deviations from basic national socialist ideals he went on from there but that was the meat of it when he finished the picture cut back to horst witzleben the newsreader said while certain uninformed persons have taken irresponsible positions in the papers the fuhrer has made it unmistakably clear that a freer examination of the past and the lessons to be drawn from it is essential to strengthening and reforming national socialist thought and practice heinrich leaned over and kissed lise the kiss developed a life of its own suddenly he didnt seem tired at all on the screen horst kept on talking but she had no idea what he was talking about she didnt much care either when they finally broke apart she said gott im himmelif id known politics didthat for you id have got interested in it a long time ago he laughed she might have been half kidding on the other hand she might not have she wasnt sure herself he said up till last year politics just made me want to get sick but now theyreexciting you know what i mean i certainly thought so she said she kissed him this time what are the children doing he asked hoarsely when they came up for air again something in their bedrooms something too close to our bedroom we ought to wait till they go to bed some things shouldnt wait her husband let his hand fall on her thigh do you think we can get away with it if were quick the worst that can happen is they embarrass us a little they embarrass us a lot you mean but the thought of sneaking while the girls were awake and only a few meters away held a certain attraction of its own lise stood up and turned off the televisor come on wed better hurry though hurry they did behind a closed bedroom door and they got away with it heres to politics heinrich said still panting a little never mind politics lise told him put your trousers back on and that turned out to be good advice too no more than a minute and a half after they finished getting dressed francesca and roxane started squabbling over a set of colored pencils they both burst into the bedroom each loudly pleading her case to the court of parental authority that court was primarily lise because of what had just happened and because of what might have happened had the girls stormed in a few minutes earlier she was less concerned with fairness and more concerned with getting them out of there as fast as she could than she usually would have been neither one of them seemed too happy about her verdict she took that as a sign shed come somewhere close to justice even if she hadnt hit it right on the nose once they were gone she sent heinrich an accusing look you me he yelped if i remember right we were both here and they didnt see anything so what are you worrying about what might have been lise answered he took that to mean more than shed intended for us how could what might have been be worse than what really was she thought about it for a long time and couldnt find an answer alicia gimpel was talking with emma handrick and trudi krebs waiting for the bus to take them home from school when francesca came up with steam pouring out of her ears whats the matter with you alicia asked the beast thats what francesca was so furious she didnt even try to keep her voice down had a teacher heard her she would have got in trouble and not a little bit either all the girls at the bus stop exclaimed in sympathy even some of the boys there did the same the natural antipathy between frau koch and children overpowered the natural antipathy between girls and boys some of the other children had already had her the ones who hadnt knew about her whats she done now alicia asked you know that article that was in the paper a little while agothat enough is enough thing her sister said did your teacher talk about it too some alicia answered emma and trudi nodded alicia went on herr peukert was pretty cagey about it thoughherr peukert in fact had treated the volkischer beobachter story as if it were a large poisonous snake he couldnt ignore it but he didnt want much to do with it either alicia said how come what did the beast tell you about it oh my god you should have heard her francesca said she thought it was the greatest thing since mein kampf she went on and on about how dr jahnke was a true patriot who really understood what national socialism was all about and how everybody who liked these stupid newfangled ideas ought to go straight to the showers she said they sounded like a bunch of stinking bignosed jews put them together even for the beast thats bad trudi said several people nodded but thats not the worst of it francesca said shes been talking like this ever since enough is enough came out in the paper and then yesterday the fuhrer made a speech andhe said the article wasnt any good and we were going to go right on with the new stuff no matter what and do you know what the beast said did shesay the fuhrer was wrong alicia asked a year earlier the bare possibility wouldnt have occurred to her all sorts of new possibilities had occurred to her in the past year her sister shook her head her hairstraighter and a little lighter brown than aliciasflipped back and forth no that would have been bad what she did was even worse she started going on about how we needed change and how good it was going to be it was like she hadnt been talking about the other stuff at all it was scary the bus came up then alicia and francesca sat down together emma and trudi sat on the seat in front of them so they could all keep talking as the bus pulled away from the curb alicia said didnt anybody ask her about that werner krupke did francesca answered she looked at him like he was something you had to scoop out of the cat box and she didnt say a thing nobody asked any more questions after that i wonder why alicia said trudi snorted emma said boy im glad i never had the beast alicia was glad shed never had frau koch too how could you call yourself a teacher if what you said on wednesday didnt count on thursday the beast probably still believed what shed said before you didnt say those things if you didnt believe them when enough is enough came out she must have thought it was safe to say them out loud how scared was she when she found out she was wrong plenty i hope alicia thought trudi had to wiggle past emma to get out at her stop see you tomorrow she called as she went up the aisle down the rubbermatted steps and out the door a few stops later emma got out with all three gimpel girlsroxane had been chattering with a couple of her friends toward the back of the bus shed got to the stop after francesca and hadnt even noticed how mad she was now she did when she asked why francesca started ranting all over again that doesnt sound very good roxane said when she could get a word in edgewise which took a while what does your teacher say about all this stuff alicia asked her shes said the fuhrer is making some changes in how things work and theyll probably work better once everythings done roxane answered that seemed sensible enough and roxane was only in the first grade what more did she need to know has she said anything about enough is enough francesca asked she says that all the timewhenever were too noisy roxane spoke with a certain amount of pride if she wasnt one of the firstgraders who made a lot of the noise alicia would have been surprised but shed plainly never heard of dr jahnkes article emma waved goodbye to the gimpel girls when she came to her house alicia francesca and roxane walked on alicia said maybe getting caught like this will make the beast pull her horns in francesca gave her a look fat chance she was probably right people like frau koch were the way they were and that was all there was to it the beast wasnt about to change her mind or the way she acted alicia wouldnt have wanted to be werner krupke whod called her on her inconsistency shed likely make his life miserable for the rest of the school year home roxane said with a theatrical sigh as they came to the front door mommy let them in francesca told her horrible story for the third time shed no doubt tell it all over again when daddy got home too mommy never turned a hair what was going on inside her did she feel the sting because her own daughter didnt know what she was of course she did she had todidnt she when francesca was done mommy said the beast sounds like shes living up to her name all right but youve only got her for this school year and then youll be done with her forever and when you have children of your own you can say you think your teachers mean you should hear about the one i had she was so bad everybody called her the beast alicia smiled francesca didnt she said that doesnt do me any good now well would cookies and milk do you some good now mommy asked francesca nodded eagerly alicia and roxane didnt complain eithernot a bit susanna weiss got back from a shopping run along the kurfurstendamm a little past seven on a cold snowy february evening she set down her packagesthree pairs of shoes including some gloriously impractical highheeled sandalstook off her foxskin hat and got out of her overcoat then she dithered for a moment wondering whether to make dinner right away or sit down and watch the rest of the news first she poured a knock of glenfiddich over ice and turned on the televisor that wasnt horst witzlebens face that appeared on the screen it was charlie lyntons the head of the british union of fascists spoke good if accented german he was saying intend here to bring the democratic principles of the first edition into effect as soon as possible most seats in the next parliamentary elections will be contested i particularly admire the fuhrer for looking on this course with favor and for recognizing that he need not yield to the forces of reaction his image disappeared horsts replaced it along with the scandinavian leaders great britain stands foursquare behind the greater german reich s revitalization effort the newscaster said well be back in a moment the picture cut away to an obviously german farm family somewhere in the conquered eastprobably on the broad plains of the ukraine the advertisement was for agfa color film the smiling father took pictures of his wife and children relatives in a crowded german apartment admired them when they came in the mail that not only promoted the film it also urged germans to go out and colonize the propaganda ministry didnt miss a trick susanna smiled when that phrase went through her mind it made her think of heinrich and his passion for bridge another advertisement followed this one for volkswagens they still looked buggy as they had for more than seventy years but the lines were smoother more rounded now the engine had moved to the front the trunk to the rear the engine was watercooled these days and didnt sound flatulent the bumpers were actually good for something besides decoration the vw still had a bud vase on the dashboard though horst witzleben returned in st wenceslas square in prague several hundred persons gathered near the statue of the saint to protest the incorporation of the protectorate of bohemia and moravia into the reich he said st wenceslas equestrian statue was surrounded by figures of other bohemian saints counting the large base the statue stood seven or eight times as high as a man it dwarfed the men and women at its base and the signs they carried some of those signs were in german they said things like freedom for the czechs and we remember others in czech presumably said the same thing and some of the demonstrators carried flags the blue white and red banners of the longvanished republic of czechoslovakia a chill ran through susanna when she recognized those flags how many years had it been since anyone dared show them in public almost as amazing as the sight of the czechoslovak flags was that of the policemen who stood watching the demonstration without storming in to break it up and throw everybody in sight into jail or a concentration camp because the protest was peaceful and orderly no arrests were made horst witzleben said and he went on to a different story he spoke as if that had been standard practice in the third reich from the beginning not the next thing to a miracle a fat official pontificated about improvements to the harbor in hamburg susanna hardly heard him though theyd vanished from the screen she kept seeing those czechoslovak flags fluttering in the long shadow st wenceslas cast if those flags could come out of the dark backward and abysm of timeif they could come out and survivewhat else might follow them susanna shivered with awe and then something else occurred to her she shivered again this time a lot less happily did even heinz buckliger know all that might follow if he let people say what they really thought no one in the greater german reich no one in the part of the germanic empire on this side of the atlantic had been able to do that for a lifetime how much was bottled up and how would it come out when the telephone on his desk rang heinrich jumped that happened about a third of the time when he was really concentrating the outside world seemed to disappear it seemed to but it didnt as if to prove as much the phone rang again he picked it up willi was laughing at him ignoring his friend he used his best professional tones analysis section heinrich gimpel speaking hello heinrich had willi heard the voice on the other end of the line he would have stopped laughing and in a hurry it was erika hello heinrich did his best to keep his own voice normal it wasnt easy whatwhat can i do for you im at my sisters house leonore lives at burggrafenstrasse just south of the tiergarten do you know where that is yes i think so heinrich said automatically then he wished he could deny everything too late of course for wishes like that it always was good erika said another questionable assumption come over at lunchtime we need to talk you me and your sister heinrich said in surprise he hardly knew erikas sister leonore if he remembered right was separated from a midranking ss officer she was a year or two younger than erika and looked a lot like her but wasnt quite socarnivorouswas the word that came to heinrichs mind he asked what about im not going to go into it on the phone erika said which considering that the lines into oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters were monitored as closely as any in the reich was probably a good idea heinrich thought it over if leonore were there things couldnt get too far out of hand and even if they did all he had to do was walk out all right he said ill see you a little past twelve erika hung up without another word willi looked up from whatever he was working on going out to lunch with lise and her sister eh he said proving hed been snooping thank god i didnt say leonores nameheinrich thought he managed a rather sickly answering smile that avoided the lie direct anyhow willi took it for agreement he went back to the papers scattered across his desk heinrich who kept his work area almost surgically neat wondered how willi ever found anything but he did though he had his problems that wasnt one of them when heinrich wanted to do something at lunch the time before he could leave crawled on hands and knees today when he really didnt hours flew by had he done anything more than blink once or twice before he got up from his desk if he had it didnt feel that way at the same time willi headed out the door with ilse that had to mean rolf stolle never called her back willi was smirking seeing him with the secretary made heinrich a little less uncomfortable about paying a call on his wife but only a little why didnt i say noheinrich wondered waiting for the bus that would take him up to the park he could have stood erika and her sister up even after saying yes but that never occurred to him what he said he would do he did brakes squealing the bus stopped in front of him he climbed aboard stuck his account card in the slot and then put it back in his pocket the bus wasnt too crowded he sat down as it pulled out into traffic ten minutes later he got off at wichmannstrasse a little north of burggrafenstrasse when he looked across to the tiergarten he saw that it wasnt very crowded either not surprising on this cold gray winters day a few stubborn people sat on the benches and fed the squirrels and the few stubborn birds that hadnt flown south reluctantly he turned his back on the park and walked south down wichmannstrasse to where it branched then turned right onto burggrafenstrasse the neighborhood dated from the last years of the nineteenth century or the start of the twentieth time had mellowed the bricks on the housefronts here and there gray or greenish or even orange lichen spread over the brickwork as if it came not from the time of the kaisers but from the neolithic age here was burggrafenstrasse here was and here looking very little different from the houses on either side was with a sour half smile heinrich went up the slate walkway climbed three redbrick steps and stood in front of a door whose ornate carved floral border spoke of victorian bourgeois respectability wishing he were somewhere anywhere else heinrich rang the bell its open erika called come on in he did the entry hall was narrow and cramped it made a dogleg to the left so he couldnt see any of the rest of the house from the doorway a polished brass coatandhat rack by the door offered a mute hint heinrich took it hanging his black leather greatcoat and highcrowned cap on two of the hooks then with a shrug he went into the front roomand stopped in his tracks hed seen plenty of seduction scenes in films hed never expected to walk into one in real life but he did now it was almost too perfect a pair of champagne flutes sat on a coffee table behind it on a couch lolled erika dorsch she wore something white and lacy that didnt cover very much of her and didnt cover that very well there were no perfumes in films either this onechanel was devastating hello heinrich erika murmured if he wasnt going to go forward and do what she obviously wanted him to do he should have turned on his heel and got out of there as fast as he could he realized that later at the moment captivated if not quite captured he simply stared wheres your sister he blurted erika laughed musically she sat up which put even more of her on display as the lingerie gave ground you were the one who said shed be here she answered i never did heinrich thought back she was right hed assumed what he wanted to assume maybe shed let himno shed certainly let himdo that but she hadnt lied the collar of his uniform shirt felt much too tight id better go he mutteredthe first halfsmart thing hed said and it wasnt any better than halfsmart dont be silly you just got here erika patted the couch by her sit down make yourself at home have something to drink he didnt this is he cast about for a word he didnt take long to find one this is ridiculous what on earth do you want with me about what youd expect she answered do i have to draw you a picture i dont think soyoure smart and youregemutlich yourenot badlooking he almost laughed even she couldnt push it any further than that then venom filled her voice as she went on and willis a twotiming asshole so why not she leaned forward to pick up one of the flutes a pink nipple appeared for a moment as the lace shifted then it vanished again heinrich hadnt added a memory to thethings im glad i saw even if i wasnt supposed to file since he was sixteen he did now why not erika repeated this time making it a serious question whod know nobody but us and id get some of my own back willis probably out fucking that little whore right now so he was heinrich knew that where erika only suspected it but shed asked him why not and he thought he owed her an answer that was also at best halfsmart again he didnt realize it till later his thinking just then was less sharp than it might have been he said i love my wife i dont want to do anything to hurt her erika laughed at him you sound like a script from the propaganda ministryexcept i happen to know that every propaganda minister from goebbels on has screwed around on his wife whenever he got the chance so where does that leave you say whatever you want he answered i dont think this is a good idea no part of you does erika wasnt looking at his face heinrich intended to have a good long talk with that part too the trouble was it talked back unhappily he said find some other way to get even with willi find some way to make him happy if you can and for him to make you happy too i know the two of you used to be her eyes flashed you dont know as much as you think you do who ever does when its somebody elses marriage heinrich said reasonablyhe was reasonable most of the time even when being reasonable wasnt but thats how it looked from the outside i dont care how it looked erika said and i didnt ask you to come over here to tell you stories about my miserable marriage no you asked me to come over here so you could blow holes in itand in mine heinrich said mines already got holes in it erika said heinrich waited to see if shed add anything about his she didnt instead she went on i asked you to come over so i could forget about mine for a little while she wouldnt forget hers heinrich was blind to many things that went on around him but not to that if this went forward willi would be in the back of her mindor more likely the front of her mindevery second shed be gloating and laughing at him with every kiss with every caress didnt she see as much herself he thought about asking her while he thought erika lost patience heinrich she said in a voice more imperious than seductive are you going to make love to me or not he had to fight the giggles they wouldnt do just now what she reminded him of was a hitler jugend physicaltraining instructor whod always bawled out well are you going to push yourselves or not well she said when he didnt answer right away he bit down hard on the inside of his cheek the giggles were very close he had to say something what came out was im sorry erika sorry the heat that might have been passion turned to fury one way or another itwould come out you think youre sorry nowill make you sorry god damn you get out of here she grabbed the empty champagne flute and threw it at him he ducked it smashed against the wall behind him he beat a hasty retreat as she reached for the full one that got him in the seat of the pants it didnt break till it hit the floor he had his greatcoat and cap on the cap askew and was out the door before he realized he had a wet spot back there he shrugged the coat would cover it till he got back to the office and then he could sit on it till it dried all things considered he would rather have eaten lunch xi lise gimpel knew something was wrong when heinrich poured himself a healthy slug of schnapps as soon as he got home from the office he didnt do that on days when things went well then hed have a bottle of beer if he had anything at all but when she asked him what the trouble was he jumped as if shed poked him with a pin nothing he said quickly much too quickly she paused wondering where to go from therewondering whether to go anywhere from there but what hed said and the way hed said it were too blatant to ignore she picked her words with care you dont lie to me much when you do you arent very good at it oh he said and thenscheisse he knocked back the schnapps at a gulp lise blinked that wasnt his style at all as if to prove it he coughed several times his cheeks turned pink embarrassment or schnapps schnapps lise judged heinrich coughed again this time as if hed started to say something and swallowed it at the last moment well are you going to tell me about it or not lise asked for some reason that set her husband off again in a different way if his laugh wasnt hysterical it came close finally he said i suppose id better this is all by way of explaining how i managed to get a champagne stain on my ass this afternoon now it was lises turn to say oh she didnt know what shed been looking for whatever it was that wasnt it im listening she told him which seemed safe he talked it took about ten minutes and another drink this one gulped down as fast as the first lise had seen and heard for herself some of what heinrich was talking about at the time she hadnt realized it applied to him in particular shed thought erika was venting her spleen at the world at large and thats that heinrich finished that as a matter of fact is pretty definitely that i dont think there will be any more bridge games with the dorsches after this bridge just then wasnt the first thing on lises mind how do you feel about all this she asked glad its over heinrich reached for the schnapps bottle again that he did made lise sure he wasnt saying everything on his mind pour some for me too she told him if youve earned three i think im entitled to one after a sip she went on you kept quiet about this for months i kept hoping everything would justsettle down heinrich said is that what you were hoping for lise said erika dorsch made formidable competition those cool aryan good looks and the suggestion of raw heat underneathlise took another swallow of schnapps larger than the first formidable indeed if id hoped for the other it would have been easy enough to get why didnt you she asked it might have been the easiest way out of the trouble heinrich shook his head my life is complicated enough it has to be because of what i amwhat we are if you think i want any more complications on top of that youre crazy and besides i love you she would have liked it better if hed put those in the other order being who and what she was herself though she understood why he hadnt she prodded a little anyhow and you were enjoying yourself werent you with a a beautiful womanthere shed said itfalling all over you i might have enjoyed it a hell of a lot more if i hadnt been scared to death all the damn time he said this is mylife were talking about mine and lots of other peoples i hope im not stupid enough to put that on the line for a roll in the hay if he drank instead of finishing if what lise asked her husband didnt answer he peered out the kitchen window resolutely pretending he hadnt heard lise almost repeated the question but she could make a good guess at what hed swallowed it would have been something likeif i werent a jew or if she were she supposed she could get angry at him for even that much what was the point though things were the way they were there was no world where heinrich was agoy or erika a jewa good thing too lise thought and finished her schnapps with a gulp she poured the glass full again were both going to go to sleep in the middle of supper heinrich said thats all right thats the least of my worries right now lise answered you turned her down shes going to be angryyou said so yourself what can she do to you what can she do to us i thought about that heinrich said i cant see anything can you shes not going to pour gasoline on the house and set it on fire or anything like that i suppose not lise admitted she didnt stop worrying though how could any jew in her right mind stop worrying if you werent worrying you were likely to miss something that might kill you is it all right heinrich asked anxiously it could be better lise said and he flinched considering all the things that might have happened and all the different kinds of unpleasantness that might have sprung from them she decided she had to relent and she did it could be worse too so i guess its all right but if any more beautiful blondes make a play for you you might want to let me know a little sooner i promise he said she snorted or of course you might not want to let me know at all but i hope you do he had no answer for that which was in its own way reassuring when susanna weiss watched czechs demonstrating on the televisor without getting arrested she was astonished when she saw frenchmen demonstrating she was shocked but there they were marching by the arc de triomphe with signs that said libertyequalityfraternity that slogan had been outlawed for seventy years ever since the motto of the french state had been work family country but while the older phrase might have been forbidden it hadnt been forgotten here it was for all the world to see as in prague policemen stood around watching without doing anything in their round flatcrowned kepis they looked even more french than the demonstrators but they collaborated with the reich more enthusiastically than the czechs didor they had up till now anyhow for the french collaboration had meant survival to germany czechoslovakia had been an annoyance france had been the deadly foe crushed in avenged in shed been crushed once more in and never allowed to get off her knees again from that day till this french fascists had toed the german line anyone who didnt toe the line disappeared mostly forever when germany spat france swam but while she swam she breathed if softly and now with anyone whod lived under liberty equality and fraternity a whitehaired ancient these frenchmenand a few frenchwomen tooshowed they remembered them and they got away with it susanna stared and stared horst witzleben said this peaceful demonstration was photographed by a german cameraman no french televisor coverage was on the scene the french regime would sooner not admit its citizens can find fault with it susanna stuck a finger in her ear did i really hear that she asked no one was in the apartment with her but the cat and gawain fat lazy thing that he was lay asleep on the sofa his tail curled over the tip of his nose but susanna had to ask somebody germans had been making scornful gibes about frenchmen since the very beginnings of the reich and no doubt long before still susanna had never heard one like this it saidwere going somewhere new and you havent got the nerve to follow us the next story was about corruption in the iron guard the romanian fascist party susanna had no trouble believing there was corruption in the iron guard theyd held power for a long time and corruption wasnt rare in the balkans or come to that anywhere else talking about it was when a fat iron guard official who spoke german with a comicopera accent spluttered out denials he did his cause more harm than any accuser could have she wondered if the story after the st pauli girl beer advertisement would be subversive too but it wasnt it talked about the brazilian football team one of the favorites in the upcoming world cup susanna almost switched it off she had only slightly more interest in football than in suicide but the longer she watched the piece the more interesting it got here were some of the finest footballers in the world footballers expected to give the mighty germans a run for their money were they aryans hardly oh several of them obviously had some white blood but negro and american indian ancestry predominated on the brazilian team isnt that interesting susanna murmured the people at the propaganda ministry were working with a light hand they werent sayinglook at these brazilian mongrels theyre really quite impressive arent they instead the message was simplythis is what the team that will challenge germany looks like if watchers decided the brazilian mongrels were impressive theyd do it on their own that they were getting the chance was remarkable enough heinz buckliger had said before that he had his doubts about the nazis racial doctrines he and his people were practicing what hed preached here theyd shown black and brown men as human beings would they ever do the same with jews susanna wasnt going to hold her breath for one thing in national socialist dogma jews and aryans were natural enemies like capitalists and proletarians in the dead lore of communism for another jews craftiness made them all the more dangerous and for a third jews were thought to be extinct so why bother rehabilitating them even the most radical reforms had limits walther stutzman used a couple of different portals to get into ss databases and see what the blackshirts were up to he didnt like messing with them any time he poked around in there he exposed himself to a certain risk of detection even if he did have the proper passwords and some highly improper masking programs every so often he went sniffing in spite of the risk not knowing what lothar prutzmann and his cohorts were up to was also risky today at lunch he started in at one of the usual places a weak spot that had been in the software ever since his father put it there if and when the reich finally did go over to the longpromised new operating system it would have weak spots too walther had put a few into the code himself out of so many millions of lines who would find those few one of these days his son gottlieb could exploit them that was what he was thinking as he started the electronic journey toward lothar prutzmanns secrets more from habit than for any other reason he kept an eye on the monitor as the probe went through when he saw an alphanumeric group that didnt look the way it was supposed to he blinked when he saw two ice ran through him and he hit the abort key if that wasnt a trap hed never seen one now he sat there wondering if it had caught him he didnt think so he had programs that would muddy the trail and he hadnt gone in far enough to be fully noosedhad he he paused in indecision something he didnt do very often then reluctantly he nodded to himself only one way to find out and he badly needed to know he liked the second portal less than the first it was closer to a busy stream of electronic traffic if he made a mistake hed stick out like blood on the snowjust like that he thought unhappily and if the bloodhounds were waiting for him here too his finger stayed on the abort key all the way through the insertion process if the hounds had been a little more subtle they would have nabbed him the first time he hated giving them another chance but as far as he could tell everything went fine now he got inside the ss network without its being any the wiser and once he was inside he could look at the other portal from the rear so to speak the trap pointed outward hed thought it would people who designed traps like that were convinced of their own cleverness they didnt think anyone could sneak up on them from behind and they had been very clever indeed even if not quite clever enough the more walther studied their trap the nastier it looked if his probe had gone just a little farther through the portal it would have been seized and traced back to its beginnings and not one of his masking programs was likely to have done him much good oh yes the thing had teeth sharp ones he wondered if he could draw those teeth leave the trap seeming dangerous but in fact harmless shaking his head he decided against it at least for now that wouldnt be something to adlib on a lunch hour if he tried it he would have to be perfect the trapper would come back every so often to see what hed caught everything would have to look fine to him walther glanced down at his watch yes it would have to be another time people would start coming back from lunch pretty soon he couldnt afford to take the chance of being seen doing that kind of work and he was through the other portal if he was going to look around inside lothar prutzmanns domain he had to do it now too much information not enough time to sift through it that protected ss secrets as well as any encryption algorithm probably better if walther couldnt find what he was looking for what difference if it stayed in plain sight you couldnt read what you couldnt find he did find proof of prutzmanns hand behind the enough is enough article in the volkischer beobachter under other circumstances that would have delighted him as things were he shrugged if heinz buckliger didnt already know whod put dr jahnke up to writing that piece he was a fool so far he hadnt acted like one stilla message revealing in which ss directory all the dirt on enough is enough lurked wouldnt hurt walther had ways of bouncing such a message through the data system till it became impossible to trace he used them and he was back to working on the new operating system by the time his boss lumbered back into the office gustav priepke stuck his head into walthers cubicle saw what he was up to and nodded approval that goddamn japanese code really will save our asses wont it he said weve got a chance with it anyhow walther answered good good that was a hell of a good idea using it priepke said walther started to thank him but just nodded instead unless he misread the signs his boss had forgotten whose idea it was in the first place because it was working so well priepke had decided it was his had things been different walther wouldnt have let him get away with that as they wereas they were if priepke was angling for fame and glory he could have them walther didnt want them they were no good to him the less he was in the public eye the better he liked it and if his boss got a bonus and a raise that was all right too the stutzmans had plenty they needed no more no jew dared be or even think like a moneygrubber these days well do fine priepke said as if walther had denied it well do just fine of course we will walther said when gottlieb stutzman came home for a weekends leave from his hitler jugend service esther was amazed at how brown and muscular hed become they work us pretty hard her son said scratching at his mustache that was thicker and more emphatically there than it had been a year before too he wasnt a boy any more he was visibly turning into a man how is it esther fought to keep worry out of her voice shed been afraid ever since gottlieb left the house she hadnt feared he would be caught or hadnt feared that any more than usual he looked like an aryan he wasnt circumcised he had the sense to keep his mouth shut about his dangerous secret but in a setting like that suffused with the propaganda of the state and the volk what would have been easier than turning his back on the secret it was a burden he didnt have to carry nobody did if you chose to forget you were a jew who could make you remember esthers fear swelled when gottlieb shrugged and said its not so bad but then he went on or it wouldnt be if i werent different esther let out a heartfelt sigh of relief he accepted that difference then shed thought he had shed thought he would but you could never be sure he gave her a quizzical look what was that for just becauseand dont you forget it esther answered sure gottlieb plainly was humoring his mother since he hadnt had much practice he wasnt very good at it the doorbell rang whos that he asked as esther started for the door alicia gimpel esther answered she was going to visit anna and sleep over tonight they set it up before we knew you were coming home and it was a little late to cancel by then i hope you dont mind why should i he laughed its not like im going to pay any attention to alicia one way or the other all right esther said gottlieb no doubt admired one pretty fraulein or another of course he didat seventeen what was he but a hormone with legs no matter whom he admired though if he was as serious as he seemed to be about staying a jew and passing it on he would marry another jew seventeen would pay no attention to eleven but twentyfour might find eighteen very interesting seven years right now would feel like an eternity to gottlieb to esther they felt just around the corner she opened the door there were alicia and lise as alicia came in festooned with sleeping bag change of clothes and the other impedimenta of a sleepover anna bounded down from upstairs to greet her through the squeals lise said its a shame they dont like each othertragic in fact it is isnt it esther said they both smiled here for once was irony that didnt hurt esther waved back toward the kitchen come in and have a cup of coffee and say hello to gottlieb he got a free weekend and came home to visit lise followed but she said you should have called alicia could have come over some other time dont worry about it esther answered gottlieb wont even notice shes here another smile from both of them some of the thoughts that had occurred to esther had surely occurred to lise too the gimpels had three girls to marry off they would have started thinking about possibilities a long time ago my goodness gottlieb lise gimpel said youre looking veryfit i sort of have to be he answered with a broadshouldered shrug if you cant do what they throw at you they make your life so nasty you get into shape just so theyll leave you alone what are they telling you now that weve got a new fuhrer lise asked him he didnt shrug now he leaned forward this interested him when i first started it was the same old stuff id always got in school he said but its changed since then well what are they saying these days a lot more about what good exercise it is and how well make friends well keep for the rest of our lives gottlieb said a lot less about how its getting us ready to be soldiers wholl go out and slaughter the reich s enemies a lot less about our shovels too esther frowned your shovels her son nodded in the wehrmacht its your rifle thats what people say anyhow in the hitler jugend its our shovels we have to carry them with us everywhere we have to keep them polishedthe blade and the handle if you let your shovel get rusty or you lose it i dont know what they do to you something horriblei know that nobody wants to find out what shovels esther repeated it made sense of a sort the hitler youth was a dress rehearsal for the army someone who knew how to take care of a shovel and had the discipline to do iteven if the act itself was fundamentally meaninglesswould quickly learn how to take care of a rifle and gain the discipline to do it and that would not be meaningless at all the drillmasters dont yell at us as much as they used to either gottlieb said of course weve been in for a while now too we know what we need to do they dont have to yell at us all the time any more what do you do for fun esther asked polish our shovels gottlieb answered deadpan esther made a face at him he grinned hed got her and he knew it he went on a lot of the time we just sleep when we get the chance they do run us pretty ragged you cant sleep all the time esther said even if that was a risky assumption to make about teenagers but gottlieb didnt deny it he said we read we listen to the radiotheres no televisor in the barracks we play cards were not supposed to do it for money but im about fifteen reichsmarks ahead so far he looked smug then he added and theres a bund deutscher madel camp about half a kilometer from ours some of the guys sneak over there after lightsout there it was the thing esther feared lots of bd m camps were near those of the hitler jugend surprising numbersor maybe numbers not so surprisingof bd m girls found themselves pregnant every year too what about you she asked her tone as light as she could make it if some gentile girl won his heart or a related piece of his anatomy i havent i dont think i will he said after due consideration very much like walthers you get into real trouble if they catch you doing thatworse than losing your shovel and besides its like i told aunt susanna the night alicia found out what she is it just wouldnt be a good idea for me lise gimpel smiled esther kissed him she got lipstick on his cheek but he didnt notice and she didnt care she wanted to say something likeyoure a very good boy and im prouder than i know how to tell you the only thing holding her back was the knowledge that the usual seventeenyearold male hearing something of that sort would go disgrace himself just to take the jinx off on the other hand gottlieb was not your average seventeenyearold male esther did say it and gottlieb proved his sterling qualities he grinned along with the new orleans vicki which currently held pride of place annas bedroom was full of hedgehogs stuffed cuddly ones smaller ones made of painted ceramics or bronze a hedgehog lamp with the switch in his little black nose even hedgehogs printed on her sheets alicia thought it was all a little too much but she never would have said so besides today she had something else on her mind youre so lucky she burst out as soon as they were alone together solucky how come anna asked im just me same as i always was she never took herself too seriously but alicia had an answer for her ill tell you whybecause everybody here knows what you are you dont have to keep any secrets her friend nodded but then started to laugh dont tell that to gottlieb thats all ive got to say he knew for five years before they could tell me and it was driving him crazy crazier oh alicia hadnt thought of that well everybody knows now anyway some of the things francesca and roxane say make me want to smack em and i cant because theyd wonder why just pay no attention to them anna told hereasier said than done she went on gottlieb didnt pay attention to me when i said stupid stuff like that for all those years of course he doesnt pay much attention to me now that i know better either im just a kid he says her snort was intended to convey how little older brothers knew alicia didnt know anything about older brothersor younger brothers for that matter she wasnt much interested in learning more either the boys in her class were the worst sort of vermin a poor recommendation for the male half of the species when she said gottliebs notso bad she was offering anna an enormous concession shed known him all her life after all but so had anna and at much closer quarters if no man is a hero to his valet no boy is to his little sister itspeaceful now that hes off at the hitler jugend camp most of the time anna said peaceful alicia echoed with gottlieb gone anna had her parents all to herself alicia tried to imagine what that would be like she couldnt she hadnt even been two when francesca was born she didnt remember what being an only child was like and shed never know now when she got bigger she was the one whod leave for a bd m camp her little sisters would get more attention from mommy and daddy which hardly seemed fair here lets do this anna said the game that followed ended up involving the vicki several of the stuffed hedgehogsincluding a big one who was bright red and had a devils horns and pitchforkan imaginary and magical snowstorm and the willow tree that grew just outside annas window in the summertime when it had all its leaves the willow was full of peeping finches and warblers woodpeckers scuttled along the bigger branches and drummed as they drilled their way after caterpillars now the branches and twigs were bare still a house sparrow perched on one and peered into the bedroom with beady black eyes look alicia pointed at the sparrow its an ss bird it got incorporated into the game which had been short of villains up till then they groaned when annas mother called them down to supperfrau stutzman put alicia between anna and gottlieb at the table the same way a nuclear engineer would put cadmium between two uranium bricks so gottlieb said his voice very much a mans how do you like being one of us that was a question alicia couldnt have heard at the supper table at her house its all right ive kind of got used to it she said but then she decided something more was called for and she added it is what i am after all i ought to know about it gottlieb gave her a suddenly thoughtful look i said something like that too i took longer than you have to figure it out though alicia needed a little while to realize that was a compliment of sorts annas surprised expression did more to help her figure it out than gottliebs words themselves she had no idea what to do with praise from a seventeenyearold boy and so she didnt do anything but go on with supper it was beef tongue with potatoes and carrots and onions which she likedfrau stutzman spiced the tongue differently from the way her mother did but it was still good over dessertherr stutzman started telling gottlieb about something he called a software trap he hadnt gone very far before he stopped speaking german or at least any sort of german alicia understood gottlieb followed well enough and gave back some of the same gibberish you got through though he said at last through the second portal like i told you thats how i got the backside look at the trap his father answered i hope thats not all you did gottlieb said well i didnt have as much time as i wanted after the trouble at the first portal and i did want to see what almost bit me walther stutzman said but i got to look around a little the reichsfuhrer ss isnt very happy with the fuhrer like alicias father gottlieb and annas had a way of saying things that were important as if they werent what sort of fireworks could go off if the leader of the ss didnt like what the leader of the reich was doing before alicia could do more than begin to wonder about that anna said lets get back to the game all right alicia said though she wouldnt have minded sitting around and listening some more either the stutzmans talked more openly than her own family did of course they werent keeping the secret around the house any more theyd probably been a lot more careful before anna knew itll be years before we can tell roxanealicia thought sadly but gottlieb had been thinking the same thing about anna even longerwe have something in common that was a pretty funny idea it stayed in alicias mind for a little while then the vile deeds of the wicked ss bird made her forget all about it susanna weiss loathed faculty meetings nothing worthwhile ever got done in them and they wasted inordinate amounts of time but herr doktor professor oppenhoff loved them with a bureaucratic passion since he headed the department of germanic languages everyone else had to go along susanna eyed the conference room as if it were some especially nasty part of a concentration camp part of her knew that was foolishness the only poison gas in the room came from oppenhoffs cigar two steam radiators kept the place comfortable even toasty despite the chill outside sweet rolls and coffee waited on a table next to the window she didnt have to try to survive on camp swill no ss guards prowled with guns and dogs but she was stuck here when she didnt want to be which gave the meeting the feel of imprisonment she listened with half an ear to a report congratulating the department for its impressive publication record three of the articles professor tennfelde mentioned were hers she yawned even so shed learned to do it without opening her mouth so it didnt show nearly so much tennfelde was dull dull dull if he lectured this way his students would be anesthetized the report finally ended the spatter of applause the faculty gave seemed to signal relief that it was over but tennfelde knew who his primary audience was and hed pleased franz oppenhoff very informative the department chairman declared very informative indeed susanna drew a doodle of an alarm clock with a long white beard and more reports were coming none of them had anything to do with her she could have gone her whole life long without knowing or caring what the interlibraryloan committee had done lately or whether discussions on merging the flemish and dutch subdepartments had progressed any further especially since they hadnt she also yawnedopenmouthed this timethrough a report on financial planning from a professor who specialized in the nibelungenlied and dabbled in the stock market on the side if hed done well he wouldnt have had to worry about his university salary he plainly did worry about it which meant he hadnt done well why anyone would want advice from a bungling amateur was beyond susanna she had a thoroughly professional accountant and broker and no worries as far as money was concerned other things yes money no again though professor oppenhoff seemed pleased i would like to thank herr doktor professor dahrendorf for that interesting and enlightening presentation he puffed on his havana then he said and now fraulein doktor professor weiss will enlighten us on the current political situation and the changes we have seen in recent times why you miserable son of a bitchsusanna thought oppenhoff hadnt warned her he was going to do any such thing he sat there looking smug and pleased with himself if she made an ass of herself the rest of the department would assume she was incompetent not that hed set her up id better not make an ass of myself then thank you professor oppenhoff she said she would sooner have substituted another verb forthank but she gained a few seconds to gather herself even so some of these people couldnt get through a lecture even with the text on the lectern in front of them shed always prided herself on being able to think on her feetwell here we go first the obvious reform will continue i believe it will intensify the fuhrer has seen that we cannot stay strong by living on booty forever that saps the fiber of the volk if heinz buckliger could use what sounded like party doctrine for purposes that would have horrified analter kampfer so could she she went on he has also seen that it is in the interest of the reich to allow more expression of national consciousness within the empire especially among germanic peoples czechs werent germanic frenchmen only marginally so susanna shrugged thatespecially covered her also the possibility of error in the past has been admitted she said this appears to be a healthy development if we know we have made mistakes and we know which mistakes we have made we are less likely to make similar ones in the futurewe wont murder millions of jews again because there arent that many left we might have a hard time murdering thousands of them not everyone inside the party is pleased with the direction reform is taking i think the jahnke letter in the beobachter proves that no one i know believes jahnke could have published that letter without official ah encouragement its fairly obvious which officials encouraged him too she looked around at the language and literature professors by their expressions it wasnt obvious to a lot of them they were safe they were comfortable why should they get excited about politics on the other hand weve also seen that some reform has spurred a call for more reform susanna said some peoplepeople in high places toodont believe the fuhrer is moving fast enough like those who oppose any reform at all they may grow harder to ignore as time goes on she looked franz oppenhoff in the eye and thatherr doktor professor about sums it up hed wanted her to make a hash of it she knew that shed had to suffer through a string of indignities no professor who pissed standing up would have had to endure this was only the latest and far from the worst now she wanted to see whether oppenhoff would have the gall to claim she hadnt made a proper presentation if he did she intended to scorch him he scratched at the edge of his sidewhiskers coughed once or twice and looked down at the papers in front of him still looking down at them he mumbled i must thank you for your clear concise report people more than half a dozen seats from him undoubtedly didnt hear a word danke schonprofessor oppenhoff im glad you liked it susanna said loudly she would get the message across even if the department chairman didnt feel like doing it the meeting ground on oppenhoff didnt call on her any more he did keep glancing over to her every so often she smiled back sweetly wishing she could display a sharks teeth instead of her own heinrich gimpel was finishing up a bowl of rather nasty cabbage stew in the oberkommando der wehrmacht canteen when a uniformed guard coming off his shift walked in and said something juicys going on out in the adolf hitler platz what now somebody asked him more damned dutchmen yelling freedom they probably wont even bother arresting them these days but the guard shook his head no its bigger than any of that piddling crap theyve got a podium and televisor cameras and all kinds of stuff that sounded interesting heinrich got up threw out his trash and put his tray on a moving belt that took it back to the dishwashers by the clock he should have gone straight to his desk he decided to ignore the clock for once willi and ilse had taken plenty of long lunches without ending the world he figured he could get away with one especially since he was only going out onto the square in front of headquarters as soon as he walked out of the building he saw the guard was right in fact adolf hitler platz held not one commotion but two proud banners flying ahead of it an ss band full of tubas and thumping drums strutted through the square playing marches as loud as they could if they werent trying to drown out the man on the podium it was a bright spring day it wasnt very warmit couldnt have been above ten celsiusbut the sun shone down brightly it gleamed off the speakers head which wasnt just bald but shaven as soon as heinrich recognized rolf stolle he knew exactly why that band was blaring away he hurried down the steps and across the paving toward the podium from which the gauleiter of berlin was addressing a goodsized crowd stolle had a microphone even so he was barely a match for the booming band he not only knew it he took advantage of it saying you see how it isvolk of the reich some of the powers that be dont want you to hear me they dont want me reminding you that we need to go forward not sit around with our thumbs up our he stopped and grinned well you know what i mean and ill tell you something else i mean too these are the people in charge of protecting the fuhrer he wants reform he doesnt want enough of it he doesnt want it quick enough but he wants it they dont ive told heinz and told him dont let these people get behind you so they can stab you in the back but he doesnt want to listen stolle stuck out his chin and thrust his fist forward the pose made him look like mussolini heinz buckliger is a good man dont get me wrong he said a good man yes but a little too trusting whatever he said next the thundering ss musicians drowned it out instead of getting angry about that he laughed he even sang a few bars of the march they were playing people laughed and clapped their hands stolle grinned he struck another pose this time a silly one when heinrich thought of him as a clown he hadnt been so far wrong an appreciative audience made stolle come alive the band moved a little farther away from the podium the gauleiter moved a little closer to the microphone if those noisy ss bastards will just go home ill get on with my speech he said a man in the crowd shouted ss go home he shouted it again then three or four more people took up the call before long everybody whod come to adolf hitler platz to hear rolf stolle was yelling ss go home the cry echoed from the long front wall of the fuhrer s palace could heinz buckliger hear it in there if he could what did he think heinrich wondered but not for long he was caught up in the thrill of shouting ss go home he never would have had the nerve to be first to yell such a thing in the middle of thousands of others his voice was only one indistinguishable from the resttheyll have a hell of a time arresting all of us he thought and yelled louder than ever ss go home ss go homess go home the chant swelled and swelled looking at the excited faces and sparkling eyes of the men and women all around him heinrich realized he wasnt the only one whod wanted to say that for years how many germans did how many would if they got the chance he smelled the acrid sweat of fear but people kept shouting rolf stolle leaned toward the microphone again ss go home he called leading the chorus ss go home heinrich watched the band would the musicians deign to take any notice of the people clamoring for them to leave if they did wasnt that a sign of weakness if they didnt how long before hotheads started throwing rocks and bottles and whatever else they could get their hands on at them and what would the ss men do then and what would the crowdthe mob do in reply maybe those same questions were going through the band leaders head maybe he didnt like the answers that occurred to him either as if continuing a regular performancewhich this was anything buthe led the musicians to the edge of the enormous square they kept on playing but they no longer interfered with rolf stolles speech as the crowd roared in triumph stolle shouted do you seevolk of the reich do you without you theyre nothing and they arent with you are they no that was a great painfilled howl again heinrich yelled as loud as anyone had schnapps ever left him this giddy he didnt think so i was going to talk for a while longer friends but you just made my speech for me the gauleiter of berlin boomed the crowd cheered rolf stolle went on and do you know what else by this time tomorrow the whole reich will know what youve done ecstatic cheers drowned out the nowdistant ss band heinrich joined them but hesitantly he thought stolle was likely right he wasnt so sure that delighted him if this footage showed up on horst witzlebens newscast would gimleteyed ss technicians pore over it trying to identify every single personevery single subversive personin the crowd could they identifyhim most of the time things like that would have left him scared to death today he felt too much exultation too much exaltation to care very much germansgermans had just told the ss even if it was only a marching band where to head in hed joined them the ss even if it was only a marching band had retreated and nobody had got shot if that all wasnt a reason to make a man feel three meters tall heinrich couldnt imagine what would be something was going on lise gimpel could tell as much by the way heinrich acted when he came home from work he had almost a mad scientists gleam in his eye an air of excitement he didnt even try to hide he wouldnt tell her what it was all about though that made her want to smack him the most he would say was well watch horst after supper since he said that about three nights a week it didnt give lise much of a clue about why he wanted to see the evening news dinner ran late too the chicken lise was roasting took longer to get done than shed thought it would the family didnt finish eating till just before seven normally lise would have done the dishes while the news was on if she missed the first couple of stories well the world wouldnt end tonight she got the feeling it might she left plates and silverware and glasses in the sink and sat down next to heinrich to find out what horst witzleben had to say for himselfand why her husband had been looking wildeyed ever since he walked through the front door our opening story the newsreader said is the collision of two airliners on the runway at gander newfoundland a map flashed on the screen to show where gander was more than people are confirmed as fatalities only seventeen are known to have survived many of them with severe burns the televisor showed smoking wreckage and then one of those survivors coming out of an ambulance on a stretcher lise glanced over at heinrich whatever hed been waiting for that wasnt it she knew a certain amount of relief she would have worried if hed got that excited about a plane crash then the picture shifted to adolf hitler platz heinrich stiffened this was it all right but why there was rolf stolle making one of his usual rabblerousing speeches and the rabble were indeed roused as their cheers and shouts showed but some oompah music kept coming close to drowning out the gauleiter of berlin what was that all about then horst witzleben said despite attempted interference from an ss marching bandgauleiter rolf stolle delivered another strong statement supporting the fuhrer s reform program this afternoon in central berlin his large audience received him favorably and showed their displeasure at the bands not at all coincidental presence in the square his voice cut off lise heard people shouting for a moment it was just rising and falling noise then she made out words ss go home ss go home ice and fire rivered through her both together theyd saidthat nothing had happened to them and now the authorities were showing the pictures on the evening news heinrich grabbed her hand his voice quivering with excitement he said i wasthere out in the platz i was listening to stolle and i was shouting for the ss to leave along with everybody else and theydid you lise said in amazement heinrich nodded was that safe she asked i dont know i think so i hope so he answered so many people were there i dont see how they can grab everybody but he hesitated a little before he said that was he trying to convince her or himself or both of them well its done i hope it turns out all right she said and then i didnt see you anywhere on the tape good i didnt either heinrich said hed been watching for himself then which meant he was more worried than he let on lise sent him a look half affectionate half exasperated hewould try to play down whatever bothered him because he didnt want her to worry once in a great while that worked the rest of the time it only made her worry more an advertisement for a breakfast cereal tried to show that eating the stuff would make you rich athletic and beautiful lise remained unconvinced it tastes like library paste she said i wouldnt be surprised heinrich replied but how do you know what library paste tastes like how im the one who helps the girls put school projects together thats how lise said i eat the paste i breathe it i damn near bathe in it last weekfrau koch wanted everybody in class to make a model of one of the forts the reich uses to protect german farmers in the ukraine from bandits do you have any idea how much fun it is to glue three strands of tinsel barbed wire to toothpick stakes as a matter of fact no heinrich admitted is that why you were in such a lousy mood lastwhen was it wednesday night you bet it is lise said and there had to bethree strands of barbed wire too by god or francesca would have lost pointsfrau koch said so she really is a beast if you ask me everything else about the project was like that too do it exactly this way or else how are they supposed to learn anything ill tell you what they learn heinrich said they learn to obey lise hadnt thought of that but as soon as her husband pointed it out to her she saw that he was right school taught more than the multiplication tables and the capital of manchukuo and how bismarck unified the reich it taught children how to be good germans how to be good nazis one of the things they needed to know was how to blindly obey anyone set over them the fortress needs to have three strands of tinsel barbed wirejawohl frau koch three strands of tinsel barbed wire it shall have and why does it need to have them because frau koch says so no other reason needed but germanssome of them nazis no doubthad stood out there in adolf hitler platz shouting ss go home they really had and here was horst witzleben showing them to the whole reich to much of the germanic empire with every sign of approval would people be chanting the same thing in oslo tomorrow in london even in omaha what would happen if they did horst witzleben said today the fuhrer met with a delegation from the protectorate of bohemia and moravia to discuss that regions future relationship with the greater german reich at the close of the meeting a spokesman for the fuhrer said that while bohemia and moravia which have been part of the reich since cannot reasonably expect to regain their former independence a larger degree of autonomy within the german federal structure is not beyond the realm of possibility the picture cut to the delegation in the palace press room its leader a whitehaired man identified asof all thingsa playwright spoke in czechaccented german what we did here today marks a good beginning i am not sure herr buckliger realizes it is only a beginning but that is all right if he doesnt we will show him they didnt arrest this fellow either lise said incredulously doesnt look that way heinrich sounded startled too this is all very strange lise said her husband nodded she went on id almost rather buckliger had left things alone then wed know where we stood this way everything weve been sure of for so long is up in the air whats that myth pandora is that it the last thing that flew out was hope heinrich paused frowning i think thats how it is yes i think so too lise said i dont know if i have any not really but even wondering if i couldit feels funny it feels dizzy like somebody spiked my drink when i wasnt looking i thought so too this afternoon heinrich said but dont get too excited for every scene like this theres an enough is enough or something like it the cards may have been dealt but they havent been played yet and nobodys going to lay down a dummy we wont get to see anything till it comes out during the hand i suppose not lise sighed were going to have to find some new bridge partners you know one of these days heinrich gestured toward the televisor that czech playwright was gone but the memory of his calm assurance lingered heinrich said plenty of interesting things happening right now and pretty soon the kids will learn how to play all sorts of things to pass on to the next generation lise said they both started to laugh bridge wasnt even illegal ss men some in black uniforms others in camouflage smocks swarmed near the campus of friedrich wilhelm university snipers with rifles with telescopic sights took positions on rooftops that had never known the footsteps of anyone but occasional repairmen and notsooccasional pigeons susanna weiss would have been more alarmed if she hadnt known that heinz buckliger was coming here to speak along with the ss men a horde of workmen and technicians had also invaded the university banging hammers and buzzing power tools disrupted the quiet that was supposed to foster academic contemplation since susanna had never had any enormous use for quiet she turned up the radio a little louder to try to drown out the racket of carpentry that did the job well enough but curiosity accomplished what noise couldnt it made her get up from her work and look out the window a platform for the fuhrer s upcoming speech was rising in the open space between the two long wings that housed most of the universitys classrooms and faculty offices rising with it were platforms for televisor cameras those would lift the cameramen above the level of the crowd and make sure no ones head got between heinz buckliger and his larger audience across the reich and the germanic empire the crowd was already building susanna thought about going downstairs and joining it then she thought again what was the point she wasnt close to the platform here but she could see it if she went down there she wouldnt be able to see a damned thing because everybody around her would be taller than she was better to stay where she was shed hear heinz buckliger either way curiosity satisfied and decision made she went back to grading papers plenty of her students understood the scatology in the millers tale far fewer of them understood how the piece fit into the canterbury tales as a whole they enjoyed gross jokes finding and defining structure in a work of literature was something else again twenty minutes later the telephone rang she picked it up bittethis is susanna weiss fraulein doktor professor this is rosa professor oppenhoffs secretary paused for a moment then said the department chairman strongly advises against watching the fuhrer s speech from your window he does susanna said indignantly why because the ss has told him they may shoot anyone they see appearing in a window whoever it is might be an assassin they say oh now it was susannas turn to pause well i hope you get hold of everybody otherwise well need to fill some vacancies next semester ill do my best the secretary said and hung up considering how badly they got along susanna knew a certain amount of relief that rosa had called her the other woman didnt seem to want to see her dead anyhow that was something then she started to laugh god help anyone whos in the mens room when the phone rings she exclaimed even if watching buckligers speech turned out not to be such a good idea she could still listen to it she opened her window a few centimeters so she could hear better the fuhrer wasnt there yet so none of the ss snipers took a shot at her noise from down below swelled as the crowd built up you could put a lot of people between the two main wings of the university buildings from the excited buzz that rose she knew to the minute when heinz buckliger came into sight guten tagstudents faculty and friends buckliger said his amplified voice sounded a little tinny technicians would probably improve it for the radio and televisor i am glad to come to this great center of learning knowledge is at the heart of the reich s progress in war and peace without our talented scientists and engineers we could not have won our great victories nor would the peace that followed have been so prosperous so healthy or so enjoyable he got a hand susanna might have known he would she wouldnt have cheered that not in a million years buckliger proved he was a german after all the volk might live prosperous healthy enjoyable lives what about the jews the gypsies homosexuals poles russians ukrainians serbs arabs negroes feebleminded people did he think of them at all or only of his own comfort from what he said the answer seemed all too obvious we need to know ourselves as well the fuhrer said after showing he didnt know himself so well even if he could sound like marcus aurelius would a roman emperor count as an aryan probably not not when hed been fighting germans along the danube while he wrote the meditations buckliger continued and the best way to know ourselves is to tell ourselves the truth we cannot do that while the reichstag is only a rubber stamp it has been nothing more for much too long as hitler pointed out in the first edition of mein kampf democratic elections are the best way to find representatives who will serve the people who chose them and not themselves alone he paused for applause and got it this being so he went on i am calling new elections to the reichstag voting to take place on sunday july all seats are to be contested candidates need not be members of the party so long as they are of aryan blood and good character ballots will be secret there will be no penalty for voting ones conscience i have not the slightest particle of doubt that the best will prevail and the volk and the reich will be better for it the ovation this time was hesitant as if the fuhrer s audience was not sure whether it was allowed to cheer that didnt surprise susanna what heinz buckliger had said did but it was hardly surprising to be surprised in berlin these days that speech of rolf stolles in the adolf hitler platz where the crowd drove off the ss bandthe ss had gone away and not only did no one get arrested the story made the evening news heinrich had been there up till today susanna had been sick with envy now she too had a moment of history to claim as her own we national socialists have ruled germany wisely and well for many years buckliger said i have faith that the volk will recognize our service and give us the large majority in the reichstag we deserve loud confident applause rang out of course people knew they were safe clapping after the fuhrer praised the nazis susanna thought buckliger was probably right about the partys winning most of the seats in the reichstag even now how many nonnazis would be bold enough to run against party bonzen how many who did run would win maybe some many it seemed unlikely did buckliger really believe the nazis had ruled germany well and wisely theyd won thanks in no small measure to hitlers demonic energy and himmlers grim ruthlessness but the blood of the people theyd murderedthe blood of the peoples theyd murderedstill cried out from the graveand from the crematorium for those millions whod never got a grave i know reform revitalization cannot come overnight the fuhrer said the reich is large and complex those who call for everything to be perfect by tomorrow are naive but those who say nothing needs repair are willfully blind change is part of life it is here it will go forward and it will succeed he got another big hand susanna was intrigued by his methods in backtoback sentences hed skewered rolf stolle and lothar prutzmann no doubt he meant to show himself as a moderate as a man embarked on the only possible course that could work but she remembered the thought shed had not so long before a moderate was also somebody vulnerable from both the left and the right did heinz buckliger see that most people would saywhat do you think youre doing trying to guess along with the fuhrersusanna cared very little about what most people said if she had she would have dropped her judaism like a grenade with the fuse lit besides up till the time when buckliger became fuhrer politics in the reich had been not only appalling but worse yet bloody dull some of the things that went on were still appalling but only someone who was deaf and blind would have called them dull and when things were interesting how could younot try to guess what would happen next outside the applause went on and on though the fuhrer didnt say anything more susanna concluded he was leaving the platform leaving the university pretty soon the coast would be clear she could look out her window again without worrying about triggerhappy ss sharpshooters in the meantimein the meantime she still had her essays to grade they would have been there even if kurt haldweim were still fuhrer in a lot of ways life went on in spite of politics and in a lot of ways it didnt how many lives had the politics of the reich snuffed out too many millions and millions too many what did undergraduate essays matter with that in the back of her mind but her life had to go on no matter what the reich had done shaking her head she picked up a red pen and got back to work a day like any other day that was how heinrich gimpel remembered it afterwards it could have been any tuesday the kids were running around getting ready for school francesca was still grumbling about some new idiotic project frau koch had inflicted on the class roxane was spelling words out loud she was going to have a test and alicia had her nose in a book lise had to yell at her to get her to put it down and do the things she needed to do yes everything seemed normal as could be blackbirds on lawns tugged at worms as heinrich walked up the street toward the bus stop the sun shone brightly spring was really here now he couldnt recall any other spring that had seemed so hopeful so cheerful was that mother natures fault or heinz buckligers heinrich didnt know he didnt much care either he would enjoy the moment for as long as it lasted he waited at the bus stop for a few minutes then got on the bus for the stahnsdorf train station three stops later willi dorsch got on too he sat down next to heinrichguten morgen he said same to you heinrich answeredwie gehts its been better willi said i have to tell you though its been worse too erikas beenkind of cheerful lately he looked this way and that a comic show of suspicion i wonder what shes up to heh heinrich said uneasily as far as he could tell erika had never said anything to willi about what had happened at her sisters house on burggrafenstrasseor about any of the several things that might have happened there but hadnt he supposed he should have been grateful hewas grateful but he was also suspicious and his suspicion had no comic edge to it when the bus got to the stahnsdorf station he and willi bought their copies of the volkischer beobachter and carried them out to the platform they climbed aboard the train up to berlin sat down together and started reading the morning news almost as if theyd rehearsed it they simultaneously pointed to the same story below the fold on the front page stolle announces candidacy the headline said there was a small head shot of the gauleiter of berlin just below the line of big black type the story as bald as any heinrich had ever seen in the beobachter announced that rolf stolle was indeed running for the reichstag can he do that heinrich said and then how can he do that hes already gauleiter the puzzle offended his sense of order but willi had the answer gauleiters a party officereichstag member would be a state office he could hold both at once youre right heinrich said wonderingly the national socialist party and the reich were as closely intertwined as a pair of loversor as a tree and a strangler fig but they werent quite one and the same i wonder how the fuhrer will like that willi said stolle trying for a national forum willi nodded ja and stolle trying for votes in general he lowered his voice i mean who ever voted for buckliger for anything party bonzen and wehrmacht bigwigs sure but nobody else youre right again wonder filled heinrichs voice till buckligers speech at friedrich wilhelm university that wouldnt have mattered whod votedreally votedfor anyone who mattered in the reich no one elections had been afterthoughts farces this one felt different stolle must have sensed it too he might well have been a clown several of the moves hed made lately convinced heinrich he was anything but a fool and willi when it came to politics if not to women was also anything but a fool i wonderwhy the fuhrer s not running for a seat in the reichstag he said thoughtfully that was an interesting question too heinrich said maybe hes worried hed lose maybe willi said its the only thing i thought of that made any sense at all too but it doesnt make a whole lot of sense if you know what i mean he can find a district full of prussian cabbage farmers or bavarian beer brewers that would elect him no matter what youd think so wouldnt you heinrich agreed the more they talked about it the more normal their tone became the more freedom all the people of the reich got the more they seemed to take it for granted the more they got the more they craved was that true too could that be true maybe it could maybe it really could but who would have believed it a year before willi suddenly looked sly the other side of the coin is what happens if buckliger doesnt run for the reichstag if he doesnt hes still fuhrer hes still got all the fuhrer s powers he can tell it what to do thats the way things work all right heinrich said but then he did a little more thinking of his own thats the way things worknow all right if the volk chooses the reichstag though will it be so easy to ignore whats the point to having a real election if right afterwards you go and pretend you never did youre right there willi admitted i dont see the point to that either maybe buckliger does who knows heinrich said who knows for sure about anything thats going on these days well just have to wait and see sounds like traffic through berlin doesnt it willi said as the commuter train came into south station of course theres usually a lot more waiting than seeing with that maybe it wont be so bad heinrich said before willi could say anything sardonic he forestalled him maybe itll be worse as a matter of fact they got to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters fifteen minutes early had they been fifteen minutes late they both would have cursed and fumed early they took for granted heinrich looked out across adolf hitler platz toward the fuhrer s palace aside from a few joggers and a gaggle of earlyrising japanese tourists snapping photos the vast square was echoingly empty no gauleiter growling out a speech this morning no thumping swaggering ss band trying to drown him out no dutch demonstrators either willi was looking across the square too almost gets boring to see it this quiet doesnt it he remarked it does heinrich said in bemusement it really does they went up the stairs and after getting their identities confirmed into the headquarters building heinrich sat down at his desk and immediately yawned he got up and went to the canteen with willi to fortify himself with a cup of coffee he squirted some hot chocolate into the cup too from the machine next to the coffeemaker viennese today arent we willi said oh but of course heinrich put on an austrian accent willi laughed a viennese aristocrateven a viennese headwaiterwould have turned up his nose at the concoction heinrich had put together but it was hot and it was sweet and it had plenty of caffeine with all that going for it heinrich wasnt inclined to be fussy after he finished it and tossed the cup in the trash he thought about going back for another one but his brains were moving a little faster so he buckled down and got to work instead ilse wandered over to willis desk and started playing with little ringlets of hair that hung down over the back of his collar without looking away from his computer screen he swatted her on the fanny she squeaked she seemed to have recovered nicely from discovering that rolf stolle had had his fun with her and that his roving eye had then roved on she and willi were all but molesting each other when they went off at noon heinrich had no doubt they would pick a restaurant somewhere close to a hotel he walked back to the canteen the lunch special there was roast pork as he had all his life he ate it without a second thought he liked pork though hed had better than this when willi and ilse came in after a long long lunch break willi mimed smoking a lazy cigarette ilse thought that was the funniest thing in the world heinrich was plowing through an analysis of nearfuture american business activity when he looked up to discover three blackshirts standing around his deskwas ist hier los he asked in surprise but no real alarm you are heinrich gimpel one of them asked he nodded thats me he wondered if they wanted to take him to confer with heinz buckliger again they didnt the two lowerranking blackshirts grabbed him and hauled him out of his chair the senior man said you are under arrest arrest heinrich yelped in disbelief what for suspicion of being a jew xii herr peukert was talking about negative numbers when a clerk from the office came into the room and took him aside to speak with him alicia was glad for the break her head was spinning when you added negative numbers you really subtracted and when you subtracted negative numbers you really added it sounded crazy to say nothing of confusing what the teacher who had been speaking quietly exclaimed in surprise the clerk nodded and muttered something elseherr peukert shook his head the clerk nodded again the teacher sighed and shrugged alicia gimpel he said alicia jumped up to her feet ja herr peukert please go to the office with fraulein knopp here something has come up jawohl herr peukert alicia wondered what was going on it sounded as if her mother needed to pull her out of class for some reason or other had mommy forgotten to tell her about a dentists appointment or something like that she was usually good about remembering all kinds of things but she had forgotten once the way fraulein knopp kept looking at her all the way back to the office made her wonder when they were almost there the clerk asked are you really am i really what alicia asked but the clerk didnt answer when they got to the office alicia was surprised to find francesca and roxane already there they looked surprised to see her roxane asked are you in trouble too i didnt think so alicia said if they call you to the office youre in trouble roxane spoke with experience born of more mischief than both her sisters together had got into fraulein knopp went into the inner office the principals office alicia heard her say theyre all here now but the principala grayhaired severe woman named frau fasolddidnt come out half a dozen large men in black uniforms did one of them had a gray mustache that made him look like the boss sure enough he was the one who spoke up you will come with us immediately children until this question is answered roxane wasnt one to let anybody even an enormous officer in an intimidating uniform get the better of her she tilted her head back so she could look him in the eye and said what question alicia was suddenly horribly afraid she already knew and sure enough the officer said the worst thing in the world the question of whether your father heinrich gimpel is a jew and of whether the three of you are firstdegree mischlingen subject to the same penalties as fullblooded jewssubject to being shot or gassed or anything else we feel like doing to you he meant a terrified scream bubbled up in alicias throat but before she could let it out and give everything away francesca screamed first and her shriek was pure fury thats a lie she went on just about as loud were no damned stinking bignosed biglipped lying cheating germy jews and neither is daddy and dont you say he is either she kicked the security police officer in the shin teufelsdreck he shouted he swung back his hand as if to slap francesca roxane grabbed it and bit him he roared in pain you idiots he yelled at his men seize them he had to yell because roxane let go of him and started screeching it was all a lie too that told alicia what she had to do she added her voice to the clamor and did her best to fight and to get away before one of the big men grabbed her christ they sure dont act like a bunch of kikes the man said panting with the effort of hanging on to her francesca and roxane of course were convinced they were no such thing alicia realized she had to act as if she were too it was the only chance she and her sisters hadif they had any chance at all frau fasold finally did emerge from her office she disapprovingly surveyed the chaos in the outer room shaking her head she fixed the officer with the gray mustache with an icy blue glare reallymein herr she said in a voice just as icy is this disorder altogether necessary her manner could paralyze any student it seemed to have the same effect on the security police man these are uh jews or uhmischlingen anyway he said in a low voice we cant uh be too uh careful these are childrenand fine children too i might addfrau fasold said even in alicias terror that astonished her the principal never had a good word for anybodyfrau fasold went on why didnt you bring panzers and helicopters and flamethrowers too then you could have been safe she all but spat her contempt in the blackshirts face he turned red we have our orders maam he said stonily we have to carry them out orders for murdering children frau fasold said why the security police officer turned redder it is our duty god help you in that case the principal told him he turned his back on her the way a petulant secondgrader might have unlike a petulant secondgrader he didnt get a swat for being rude alicia wished he would have he deserved one but nobody was paying any attention to what she wished the officer with the mustache nodded to his men take them away they had their orders they carried them out it was their duty lise gimpel had just got back from the drugstore when the telephone rang she muttered to herself shed been about to make a fresh pot of coffee the ringing phone didnt magically shut up the way she wished it would she went over and picked it upbitte the first thing she heard was a car horn blaring was somebody playing a practical joke then as traffic noises continued she realized the call was from a pay phone on a busy street lise is that you a man asked ja willi she answered doubtfully dammit i wish you hadnt said my name yes that was willi but why was he calling from a pay phone and not from his desk no sooner had the question formed in her mind than she found out for he went on listen theyve just arrested heinrich forfor something completely ridiculous ive got to go bye he slammed the phone down in its cradle the line went dead as if moving in a dream lise hung up too but it wasnt a dream it was a nightmare the worst nightmare she could havesomething completely ridiculous could mean only one thing and it wasnt ridiculous not to her like any jew in berlin shed rehearsed this disaster in her mind hoping and hoping she would never have to use the plans shed made so much for that hope she might not have long they might be coming for her right now she reached for the telephone it rang again before she could pick it up she almost screamed bitte she snapped if it was some idiot salesman trying to get her to buy carpets frau gimpel a womans voice this not a familiar one yes what is it please frau gimpel this in ingeborg fasold the principal at your daughters school i dont know how to tell you this butthe security police have taken your daughters they accuse them of beingforgive me for saying thisthey accuse them of being part jew are you therefrau gimpel im here in her own ears lises voice sounded far away eerily calm theyve arrested my husband too its all a lie a mistake of course she had to say that she remembered she had to say that somebody might beprobably waslistening of course to her amazementfrau fasold sounded as if she meant it she added i think its a shame and a disgrace that they should take children no matter what how can a child have done anything bad to anyone even if the childwere a mischling how could it nonsense pure quatsch good luck to you thank you lise said in that same strange calm voice her mind was racing a million kilometers a secondmischlingen they thought the girls were mischlingen she was pretty sure theyd arrested heinrich as a jew that should mean they still believed she was an aryan herself if they kept on believing that it might give her the chance to save everyone or it might not help at all she couldnt tell till she tried if theres anything i can dofrau gimpel please dont hesitate to askfrau fasold said she really did sound as if she meant that lises eyes filled with tears danke she whispered this is a false accusation we will beat it i hope so the principal said again good luck she hung up so did lise maybe people were more decent than shed ever dared dream willifrau fasoldneither had had to say a word both had taken a chance in picking up the phone but theyd done it lise had her own ideas about how and why heinrich had been arrested but finding out if she was right would have to wait it didnt make any difference not when she had no time to lose the blackshirts were liable to come here next to see what evidence they could dig up against her husband or they might not worry about evidence and simply act if they did that heinrich and the girls were lost so they wont do that you have to think they wont and if they come looking for evidence theyd better not find any there wasnt much to find nothing printed in hebrew no sabbath candlesticks nothing like that she had pork ribs in the freezer right now but there were those pictures the ones that had come down from heinrichs father lise had never looked at them but she knew what they were they recorded the murder of a people first on this side of the atlantic and then a generation later on the other they would have been illegal any time now they were worse than illegalthey were incriminating heinrich had kept them to show the girls if the time ever came to remind them what the nazis did to jews who revealed themselves well the girls wouldnt need that kind of reminder any more now they had a better one she knew which filing cabinet in the study held the photographs she didnt know which drawer they were in or which folder would the knock on the door come before she found them that would be the cruelest cut of all here they were she started to carry the manila folder to the fireplace then hesitated they might wonder why she had a fire going or find the remnants of photos in the ashes lise knew she wasnt thinking too clearly she also knew she couldnt afford to take any chances at all she brought the folder into the downstairs bathroom instead she started tearing the photos into little bits and flushing them down the commode she couldnt help seeing some of what she destroyed here was the raw stuff of history disappearing one flush at a time part of her thought that wasnt rightthere should be some record of the germans crimes the restshe was shaking and in tears by the time the job was done heinrich would have shownthat to little girls the medicine was strongtoo strong she thought and she couldnt keep on shaking and crying even though this part of the job was done she still had more to do she went to the telephone and dialed it rang six or seven times before a man said bitte in a sleepy voice richard she said richard this is lise gimpel what do you want you woke me up richard klein grumbled woke you up in the middle of the afternoonlise blinked at that then she remembered he was a trombone player musicians kept strange hours richard i need the name and number of that lawyer you used last year youre not going to believe it but heinrich has the same problem you did gott im himmel klein exploded he didnt sound sleepy any more hang on ill get it for you he came back on the line a minute later hes klaus menzel heres his phone number have you got something to write with yes lise took down the number richard said good luck take care of yourself let us know what happens those were all things one friend could say to another without giving anything away to anyone tapping the line thanks lise said and hung up she could have made other calls to her sister to the stutzmans to susanna weiss to a fewso few other people she knew she could have but she didnt she had a plausible reason for calling the kleins house she couldnt bring them under greater suspicion by doing so that wasnt true of the others she didnt want the security police wondering about her side of the family and her friends even if the worst happened to her they could go on besides they would hear soon enough one way or the other she called the lawyer and set up an appointment first thing in the morningand got his promise to try to make sure nothing drastic happened before then shed just hung up the phone there when someone started banging on the front door she didnt need three guesses to know who that was the banging went on and on as she walked out to get the door she wondered if she would be able to keep that appointment after all susanna weiss sat on her couch a glass of glenfiddich in her hand the news was on but she couldnt pay attention to horst tonight she took a long pull at the scotch it wasnt the first one shed had it wouldnt be the last one she intended to have either if she felt like hell in the morningand she probably wouldwell that was why god made aspirin heinrich she muttered and shook her head in wonder mingled with despair when maria klein asked her to meet for a drink shed known something was wrong something yes butthat she shook her head again of them all heinrich gimpel was the last one shed expected to get caught he was the one who never took chances who never seemed to have the nerve to take chances no jew could afford to draw too much notice but heinrich often went out of his way to be not just solid and unexciting but downright boring susanna sometimes wondered what lise who was a good deal more lively saw in him she supposed something had to be there and now the security police had him how hard were they leaning on him how hardcould they lean on him the fuhrer had asked for information from him after all they had to know that even if he was a jew it should count for somethingshouldnt it she finished her drink got up and poured herself another one it all depended on how much they knew or thought they knew if they were sure heinrich was what they said he was they would go ahead and do whatever they wanted withand tohim the more doubts they had the more careful theyd need to be so it seemed to susanna anyway they wouldnt want to tear answers out of a man who might be able to get his own back one daywould they they might not care they might decide that once theyd used him up he wouldnt be able to do anything to them anyhow who in the reich in the past seventy years had been able to do anything to the organization lothar prutzmann now ran nobody nobody at all horst went away susanna couldnt remember a single thing hed talked about a game show came on with a wisecracking host and a statuesque blond sidekick susanna usually turned off the televisor the instant the news ended tonight she left it on more for the sake of background noise than for any other reason the questions were stupid some of the answers the contestants gave were even stupider and the way the people jumped up and down and squealedmen as well as womenmade susanna cringethis was the herrenvolk this was the material from which the nazis had forged a reich they said would last for a thousand years if this is the master race lord help the rest of the world susanna said but what had the lord done for the rest of the world given most of it german overlords that was what how could you go on believing in a god who went and did things like that susanna looked down and discovered her glass was empty again that fortunately was easy to fix the bookcrowded living room swayed a little when she got up she made it to the kitchen and back without any trouble thoughand she didnt spill the fresh drink either as for how and why you could go on believing in a god who did dreadful thingspeople had been wrestling with that at least since the time of job she wasnt going to settle it one drunken frightened night in berlin and if she drank enough maybe shed even stop worrying she set about finding out heinrich gimpel sat in a cell that held a cot whose frame was immovably set in the concrete of the floor a sink a toilet and damn all else whenever he stood he had to hang on to his trousers theyd taken away his belthis shoelaces too of course the first thing theyd done when they got him here was yank down his trousers and his underpants theyd grunted when they saw he was made the same way they were one of them said is that all youve got he supposed that sort of insult was meant to tear him down so hed be easier meat when they really started questioning him he wondered why they bothered he was already about as frightened as he could be he was so frightened he reckoned it a minor miracle he had anything at all to show down there they hadnt beaten himnot yet anyway they hadnt drugged him either theyd just tossed him in this cell and left him alone he didnt know what that meant were they working up something particularly horrible or were they unsure he was what they thought he was think heinrich dammithe told himself if he could change the mess he was in to any degree it would have to be with his brains but what were the odds hecould change it slim and he knew as much still he had to try if i were truly agoyhow would i act hed still be frightened he was sure of that if you werent frightened after the security police grabbed you you had to be crazy but he would also be outraged howdared they think him a dirty jew the anger he generated was ersatz but after a while it started to feel real he wondered if actors worked themselves into their roles this way for the time being he had no one for whom to show off his fine synthetic fury none of the cells close by had anyone in it no guards tramped past why should they he wasnt going anywhere i want a lawyer he said loudly this is all a stupid frameup get me a lawyer maybe nobody was listening he wouldnt have bet on it though a security police prison was bound to have microphones after what seemed a very long timehe didnt have his watch any moretwo blackshirts came up the corridor one pushed a food cart the other carried an assault rifle stand away from the bars he ordered in a bored voice heinrich obeyed the man pushing the cart shoved a tray into his cell i want a lawyer heinrich said again youve got to get me out of here the fuhrer himself has consulted me they ignored him he might have known they would how many prisoners had they seen thousands without a doubt how many had admitted they were guilty even one he ate what they gave him cabbage stew with little bits of salt pork in it did they think he would pick them out if he was a jew and a chunk of brown bread it wasnt as good as what he got at the canteen at work but it wasnt a whole lot worse he turned on the water in the sink and drank from the cupped palm of his hand till hed had enough to cut his thirst then he lay down on the cot on his back and stared up at the rough concrete of the ceiling he hoped they hadnt grabbed lise and the girls too he did his best to pray but that didnt come easy if god had let this happen to him how reliable was he but if you didnt believe what point to staying a jew good question he had no answer he felt empty useless what happened to him now was out of his hands he hoped it was in gods he knew for certain it was in the security polices he fell asleep with his glasses on he never heard the fellow with the cart retrieve his tray which hed left by the bars he stayed asleep till a key clicked in the lock and half a dozen blackshirts burst in on your feet you schweinehund you kike you stinking sheeny they screamed blearily he obeyed what time was it somewhere in the middle of the night he thoughti have to keep saying no whatever they do to me i have to keep saying no if they killed him they killed him with a little luckmaybe a lot of luckhe could keep his family and friends alive the security police hustled him along the corridor his pants fell down they wouldnt let him pull them up again im no jew i want a lawyer he said shut up they shouted in unison one of them stuck an elbow in his ribs it hurt he grunted hed never make a cinema hero laughing at wounds that would kill the average hero on the other hand they could have done worse to him than they did interrogation said the sign over the door to the chamber where they took him it wasnt quite all hope abandon ye who enter here but it was in the most literal sense of the words close enough for government work they slammed him down into a hard chair and shackled him at wrists and ankles they shone bright lights in his face hed seen this scene at the movies too the hero usually mocked his tormentors heinrich felt much more like screaming he managed to keep quiet which might have been the hardest thing hed ever done so jew said a voice from somewhere behind the glaring lights im no jew heinrich exclaimed jesus are you people out of your minds the more offended and horrified he sounded the better the chance he hadif he had any chance at all one of the blackshirts lifted his glasses off his nose another one slapped him in the face his head snapped to the side his ears rang he blinked it didnt do much good without glasses the whole room was blurry dont spew your lies the voice said youll only make it worse for yourself how could ihe wondered bleakly but youve got the wrong man he wailed ive worked for oberkommando der wehrmacht for almost twenty years now and another slap this time his head jerked the other way tearing down everything the reich builds up the voice growled an opening thatsa lie heinrich said look at my evaluations if you dont believe me ive served the reich ive never hurt it that was true hed hated himself because it was true too working for the regime might save him now though quickly desperately he went on ask the fuhrer if you dont believe me raucous laughter from the interrogator tell me another one jewboy as if the fuhrer cares about the likes of you one of the blackshirts whod frogmarched him into the room muttered to the man behind the lamps that man whom heinrich still hadnt seen let out a scornful grunt then he shifted gears he started hammering away at heinrichs pedigree that pedigree was of course fictitious from top to bottom the interrogator would have caught out a lot of jews grilling them about ancestors they didnt have but heinrich was a meticulous man he knew the ancestors he didnt have as well as the ones he didmaybe better since more about the fictitious ones had gone down on paper he had to remind himself to throw in i dont know s every so often how many people really could recite chapter and verse about greatgreatgrandparents off the tops of their heads he didnt want the blackshirts to think hed memorized a script even if he had they slapped him a few more times it stung but he endured it they werent working anywhere near so hard as they might have to break him maybe they werent sure what they had heinrich clung to that hope at last after what could have been half an hour or three hours the head man said take the kike back to his cell well have another go at him later back heinrich went he could have done without that promise from the interrogator but he hadnt told the security police anything and they still hadnt roughed him up too badlyit could be worse he thought on his way out of an interrogation that would do alicia gimpel envied her sisters no matter what the nazi matrons asked them they couldnt give anything away when they denied they were jews they believed those denials from the bottom of their hearts some of the blackshirts would remember taking them out of school for a long time the matrons called this place a foundlings disciplinary home the other children in here were ragged and scrawny but very clean the whole building reeked of disinfectant theyd separated the gimpel girls maybe to keep them from coming up with a story together for francesca and roxane there wasnt any story to come up with they were genuinely outraged at what was happening to them alicia had to pretend she was too if she could manage that she had a chance she might have a chance anyway theyd put her in a room with a sharpfaced stringyhaired blond girl named paula what are you here for paula asked you wont believe it alicia assumed somebody was listening to everything she said try me the other girls smile showed pointed teeth i burned down my schoolroom she spoke with nothing but pride wow alicia wasnt sure she believed that maybe paula was bragging or maybe she was trying to get alicia to talk big too and hang herself could an elevenyearold be an informer of course she could so what did you do paula asked they say im a jewor they say my father is anyway alicia answered that was the truth admitting it couldnt hurt paulas pale blue eyes widened now she was the one who said wow and then thats so neat i didnt think any of you people were left the way the nazis go on they got rid of you if you stayed ahead of em more power to you she sounded as if she meant it but then if she was an informer shewould sound that wayi cant trust her alicia reminded herself she said thats what they say but its a lie im not and daddy isnt either sure hes not paulas smile was knowing youve got to say that dont you if you say anything else its the showers or a noodle right that was what alicia was afraid of but she couldnt even show that the thought had crossed her mind they wouldnt do that to me she exclaimed i havent done anything and im not what they say i am maybe youre not paula said what the helli dont know but if they decide you are you are whether you are or not you know what i mean whether she was an arsonist or not she was a perfect cynic how many brushes with the authorities had she had how many of them had she won more than a few or alicia would have been astonished but not all or she wouldnt be here alicia knew perfectly well what she meant too here though she had to pretend she didnt if shed been seized for something she wasnt none of these dire things would have occurred to her she said they cant do that itswrong maybe fear sounded like anger she hoped so anyhow all paula said was when has that ever stopped them alicia had no answer not at first that had never stopped them but then hope flared the new fuhrer wont let them do things like that buckliger paula didnt try to hide her scorn you wait till the time comes lothar prutzmann will eat his lunch she might have been handicapping a football match not politics oh i hope not alicia said even that might have been too much when prutzmanns security police had her she said it anyway she meant it and she couldnt get in too much trouble for showing she was loyal to the fuhrer could she paula only laughed you just watch youll find out in the hallway a bell rang paula bounced to her feet thats supper come on it was a wretched excuse for a real supper cabbage soup boiled potatoes and brown bread without butter alicia could see why paula was so skinny she looked around for her sisters each of them had a matron hovering close when alicia looked back over her shoulder she saw one behind her too she decided not to get up and try to see francesca or roxane why give the matron the pleasure of telling her she couldnt these women looked as if saying no was their chief pleasure in life she did ask her matron when will you let us go back to our mother and father she made sure she mentioned daddy as well as mommy nobody seemed to think mommy was a jew she wondered how that had happened the matron frowned she had a long sour face a face made for frowning at last after a pause for thought she said well dearalicia had never heard a more insinceredear that depends on what they decide to do with your father you see maybe she hoped alicia wouldnt understand that and maybe if alicia hadnt been a jew she wouldnt have she was and she did but she had to pretend she didntif they decide daddys an aryan youll go home too but if they decide hes a jew hes dead and your sisters are dead and so are you lise gimpel paused in cleaning up the house to take a pull from a glass of schnapps the place was an astonishing mess it might have suffered a visit from an earthquake or a hurricane not the security police theyd torn the place apart looking for evidence that heinrich was a jew if she hadnt flushed the photographs they would have found it too her brain felt as badly disordered as the house theyd roared questions at her while they were throwing everything on the floor why had she married a jew how long had she known he was a jew why was she such a filthy whore did she think it was more fun sucking a circumcised cock maybe theyd figured that one would horrify her into spilling secrets all it did was make her furious you stupid fucking bastards shed screamed youve got him you know goddamn well hes not circumcised they hadnt arrested her theyd even been a little more polite after thatnot much but a little they hadnt got anything out of her or she didnt think they had and theyd been in a rotten mood when they finally quit searching the house so she didnt think theyd come up with anything there either nownow all she could do was pick up the pieces they hadnt smashed things on purpose anyhow all theyd done was toss them every which way getting them back where they belonged would take time but she could do it what else did she have to do with heinrich and the girls gone work helped hold worry at bayagain not much but a little the telephone rang lise jumpedscheisse she said crisply the last thing she wanted to do was talk to anybody right now but she knew she had to it might be important it mightliterallybe life and death making her way through drifts of things on the floor she went to the phone and picked it up bitte lise it was willi how are you is there any news news well yes theyve turned the house inside out theyve taken the children other than that everythings jolly gott im himmel willi burst out in the background erika asked what was wrong he relayed what lise had just told him the children erika said du lieber gotti didnt even think about the children thats terrible willi said to lise is there anything i can do ive got heinrich a lawyer i hope it helps lise answered it should hes innocent so theres no way they can prove hes a jew she assumed more people than willi dorsch were listening to her telephone calls she wouldnt have admitted what heinrich was even to willi alone with the security police surely tapping the line she wouldnt admit anything to anybody there you go willi said keep your chin up and everything will turn out all right he sounded like a man whistling past a graveyard lise said thanks anyhow willi meant well that probably wouldnt do heinrich any good but it was there she went on im going to go they left the house a hell of a mess oh all right take care of yourself were thinking about you willi hung up so did lisethinking about me thinking what about me she wonderedthinking i may be a jew myself but that wasnt fair willi had sounded the way a friend ought to sound and erika seemed genuinely horrified when he told her the security police had grabbed the girls too theyre good friends if they call thinking heinrichs not a jew theyd be better friends if they thought he was a jew and called anyway maybe they did think so but lise would be a fool to ask them and they would be fools to tell her shaking her head she got back to work you gimpel a blackshirted jailer roared and heinrich sprang to his feet and stiffened to attention as if he were back in elementary school back then he would have worried about a paddling now two more men from the security police leveled assault rifles at him the jailer unlocked his cell and swung the door open come with us jawohl heinrich said another grilling another tentative thumping or were they really going to get down to business this time hands behind your back the jailer told him when hed stepped out into the corridor numbly he obeyed the man cuffed them behind him then gave him a shove get moving feet light with fear he obeyed he couldnt do anything about his flopping trousers now they didnt seem to carethey were hauling him along they took him by a different route this time he didnt know if that was good or bad his heart thuttered one way or the other hed find out they brought him to a room divided in half by a thick glass wall a grill let someone on his side talk with someone on the other side and someone did wait on the other side a tall man almost as tall as heinrich with an impressive mane of gray hair the stranger wore a sharp pinstripe suit and carried a crocodileleather attache case with fittings that looked like real gold your mouthpiece the jailer sounded disgusted neither he nor his guntoting pals showed any sign of leaving the room whatever heinrich said to the lawyer hed say in front of them he hardly cared he shuffled to the grill he had to stoop a little to put his mouth by it he didnt care about that either who are you he asked can you get me out of here did lise hire you your wife you meanja my names klaus menzel and i dont have any idea whether i can spring you answered the man on the other side of the grill ill give it my best shot though all billable hours either way he sounded cheerfully mercenary somehow that made heinrich like him more not less he seemed less likely to be a security police plant someone put in place to get heinrich to spill his guts of course if theyd wanted him to do that they would have kept the guards out of the room do you know who falsely alleged youre a jew menzel asked again the way he put things cheered heinrich he wasnt assuming his client was guilty he wasnt acting as if he was assuming that anyway hearing him talk like that made heinrich want to help him unfortunately he couldnt he tried to spread his hands the cuffs wouldnt let him he said i havent the slightest idea will the security police tell you menzel shrugged he had broad shoulders and a narrow waist as if he were a retired soldier orperhaps more likelya football player whod stayed in shape into his fifties he said theyre supposed to of course they dont always do what theyre supposed to he raised his voice and called out to a blackshirt on heinrichs side of the glass isnt that right joachim screw you you damn fraud answered one of the men with an assault rifle you had your way the reich d be assdeep in kikes then theyd study law and squeeze you out of business serve you right too he sounded more amused than angry for that matter so did the lawyer how often had they harassed each other a good many times plainly heinrich asked when will you know if you can get me out im not sure menzel said with another shrug when they hear somebody might be a jew they grab first and ask questions later depends on what they turn up next depends on how much of an uproar they want to get their bowels into too i can promise you the moon but i dont know if i can deliver that wasnt what heinrich wanted to hear he would have loved to be promised the moon all wrapped up in a pretty pink ribbon but again klaus menzel seemed to work in the realm of the possible heinrich said whats your best guess ill find out as fast as i can a few days most likely the lawyer answered is lise all right the girls your wife is fine shes mad as hops because they made a mess of your house when they searched it i like her shes good people and she doesnt scare easy menzel hesitated as soon as he did heinrich feared he knew what was coming next and he was right theyve got your kids if you were a jew theyd be firstdegree mischlingen and subject to the same sanctions that was a bloodless legalistic way to put it what menzel meant wastheyll kill them too heinrich groaned they cant but they could theyd been doing it for seventy years why should they stop now hed had a surge of panic when he heard the blackshirts searched his house lise must have managed to dispose of the photos before they got there otherwise menzel wouldnt have been able to do anything at all for him probably wouldnt even have been allowed to see him he would have been dead by now and so would his children try not to worry too much the lawyer said if you come out the kids come out tooand if you dont they dont that hung in the air but if heinrich didnt come out hed die he wouldnt be able to worry then either will alicia hold uphe didnt have to fret about the other two not for that they didnt know what they were but if alicia broke if they broke her youre out of time gimpel said one of the men from the security police back to your cell and as for you you lousy shyster he sent klaus menzel an obscene gesture laughing menzel returned it they marched heinrich out of the room with the glass partitionyoure out of time gimpel the words tolled like a funeral bell inside his mind and it wouldnt be his funeral alone they had the girls too no matter how grim tomorrow looked you had to get on with today so esther stutzman told herself over and over and over again but when a friend and his children were in the hands of the security policeand when if they hurt him long enough and badly enough he might cry out her nameit wasnt easy she tried to carry on as if nothing were wrong when she went in to dr dambachs office she said not a word about heinrich gimpel dambach already knew she knew the kleins if he found out she was friends with someone else suspected of being a jew he might start wondering about her the best way to stay safe was not to let anybody wonder guten morgen frau stutzman the pediatrician said when she came in i was just about to start making coffee those were words to alarm anybody why dont you let me take care of that esther said quickly then you can do something uh useful instead well all right dambach said as long as youre here ill start reviewing medical journals with so much being published these days it gets harder and harder to stay up to date im sure it must esther said yes you get on with that and ill bring you some nice coffee just as soon as its made thank you very much he said and went back into his private office esther let out a sigh of relief one small catastrophe averted anyhow if only the big ones were so easy to get around the whole morning seemed one threatened small catastrophe after another one by one esther managed and mastered them she felt as if she were dancing between the raindrops without getting wet dr dambach had no idea most of them even turned up keeping him from needing to know about such things was part of her job when irma ritter came into the office at lunch esther did have to spend an extra five or ten minutes explaining some of the things that had gone on you had yourself a busy time didnt you irma said when she was through one of those days esther answered she made her escape and went down to the bus stop she took a different bus from the usual instead of going straight home she rode up to the kurfurstendamm to shop walthers birthday was coming up and so was their anniversary shed just got off the bus when a noisy parade came down the middle of berlins main shopping boulevard at first seeing the swastika placards some of the men on foot were carrying she thought it was only another trafficsnarling nazi procession then she realized she was wrong it was a nazi procession of sorts but not one like any shed ever seen along with the swastikas the paraders carried placards with slogans like throw the rascals out and reform candidates for the reichstag and down with the partybonzen men and women on the street stared everyone seemed as astonished as esther was that the authorities would allow such a parade but then people started to cheer and to wave at the reform candidates the politiciansmany of whom were fairly prominent party men themselveswaved back esther spotted rolf stolle marching at the rear of the parade and she began to understand the gauleiter s bodyguards were grayuniformed berlin policemen not the usual blackshirts he carried a bullhorn with his big booming voice he hardly seemed to need it the fuhrer says you can be free he shouted thats good because youve taken too many boots in the face for too long if you dont believe me ask lothar prutzmann the fuhrer says youcan be free yes but i say youought to be free do you see the difference raucous cheers said the crowd on the kurfurstendamm sidewalks did people were less restrained now than they had been while kurt haldweim was fuhrer theyd begun to see that they could say some of the things that had been on their minds for years without worrying that the security police would bundle them into a car and haul them off to prison or to a camp but they arent jewsesther thought wondering how heinrich was holding upand whether he was still holding out she wondered about alicia too what would they do to a child no one had come to bundle her into a car that was all she knew in an important way that was all she needed to know things will look different once we elect a real reichstag rolf stolle roared too many have got away with too much for too long were going to show the world where the bodies are buriedand we all know there are lots of them more cheers more shouts people around esther waved their fists in the air she stared at stolle he couldnt be talking about jewscould he she grimaced odds were against it plenty of germansand othershad gone missing during the third reich who would get excited about millions of jews now odds were no one after the first world war whod got excited about all the armenians the turks did in nobody hitler had seen as much and noted it in mein kampf and hed been dead right yes that was the word some peoplesome people with fancy jobs and even fancier uniformsare going to have a lot of explaining to do stolle declared will they be able to do it good question damn good question well find out then he broke out of the parade and away from his bodyguards and plunged into the crowd alarm on their faces the berlin cops rushed after the gauleiter he might have forgotten they existed hed spotted a tall pretty blond woman on the sidewalk she squeaked in surprise as he squeezed her kissed her on both cheeks and then on the mouth and very likely took a few other liberties esther couldnt see there he said grinning enormously youre going to vote for your good old uncle rolf arent you darling for good measure he kissed her again uhja she stammered sounding as dazed as a hurricane survivor men whooped women laughed rolf stolle not only had a reputation he reveled in it he elbowed his way back through the crowd and into the procession down the kurfurstendamm once more weare the volk he roared through the bullhorn this is a volkisch state everybody says that but nobody says what it means it means the state is ours thats what weare the volk we are the volk people picked up the rallying cry weare the volkwe are the volk when heinz buckliger started calling for reform had he expectedthis as esther ducked into a haberdashers she shook her head she couldnt believe it but whether the fuhrer had expected this or not this was what he had and what would he do about it now that lise had the house straight again she went through the motions of everyday life with heinrich and the girls gone all she could do was go through the motions nothing she did seemed to mean anything how could it without the people who gave it meaning she fixed food for herself and ate it as if she were fueling a machine that needed to keep going she had trouble figuring outwhy it needed to keep going more in case her husband and daughters came back than for any independent reason mechanically she washed her few dishes once that was done she kept having to find a way to get through the rest of the evening till it was time to try to sleep she didnt want to watch the news horst witzlebens halfhour suddenly seemed full of nothing but bright shining lies people all over the germanic empire were demanding their freedom or exulting in new freedom won up until a few days before lise had exulted with them now with heinrich in jail and the children stolen other peoples celebrations seemed a grim mockery she cleaned things that didnt need cleaning and read a novel where she knew she was missing one word in three every hour or two she would look up at the clock on the mantel and discover another ten minutes had gone by most of her wished she were in captivity with the rest of her family staying free didnt make her feel safeonly guilty when the phone rang she put down the novel without a trace of regret it wasnt as if she were paying attention to it anyhow maybe it was her sister kathe owed her a call even if the line was bugged the two of them could talk pretty openly no snoop could penetrate their pauses and misdirections bitte lise said guten abendlise it wasnt kathe it was a man lise just had time to shift gears and recognize willi dorschs voice before he said im so sorry oh my god lise blurted those words at this time were the last thing the very last thing she wanted to hear what do you know willi what have you heard tell me right this second before i reach down the telephone line and pull it out of you with both hands by what felt like a miracle he understood her right away and didnt try to joke around nothing about heinrichnothing i swear he said quickly but erikas in the hospital they think shell be all right but shes there wait lise said too many things were happening too fastmuch too fast for her to follow if erikas in the hospital im the one whos supposed to be sorry not you im not so sure about that willi sounded most unhappy he also soundedembarrassed willi please take this one step at a time youre wayway ahead of me lise said first tell me why erikas in the hospital well she took too many pills took them on purpose why on earth would she do that lise asked in honest amazement not because youve been fooling around on her for heavens sake that wouldnt do it shed get even instead a considerable silence followed mostly to himself willi muttered i might have known youd know about that another silence this one punctuated by a sigh he gathered himself and went on youre not wrong she did try to get even only it didnt work out the way she wanted thatssome of why she took the pills youd better tell me the rest of this lise thought she knew where he was going but she wasnt sure and she didnt want to guess not here too much rode on whether she was right or wrong well yet another long pause it seems she was trying to get even with me with uh with heinrich of all people lise almost laughed at how surprised he sounded hed never dreamt of heinrich as a rival she thought her husband was pretty hot stuff why wouldnt another woman but that was a question for a different time all she said now was go on you know about that too willi said in dismay lise didnt deny it why doesnt anybody tell me these things he wondered aloud never mind that now lise said as if there were reasons galore but she had no time to go into them just get on with it please i guess heinrich told her no even though willi put an audible question mark at the end of the sentence he didnt really sound as if he doubted it with a sigh he continued erikadoesnt like people telling her no and soand so shegod damn it lise imso sorry willis usually cheerful voice held something not far from a sob she was the one who accused heinrich of being a jew lise couldnt hear anything at all in her own voice the words might have come from the throat of some machine shed been right sure enough im afraid she was willi answered miserably he said something about acting like solomon and cutting a doll in half and solomon was king of the jews and that put the idea in her mind i suppose but she never thought about the children when she found out about them that was when shedid what she did wonderful lises voice stayed flat now choking back a scream erika hadnt cared if she killed heinrichhell shed wanted him dead but she drew the line at the girlshow generous of her when shes better shell go back to the security police and tell them it was all a lie i swear she will willi said she wants to make things right if she can wonderful lise repeated as flatly as before itll be all right it really will willi was all but babbling his laugh was nervous but it was a laugh i know heinrichs not a jewbelieve me i know dont get me wrongbut the way things are nowadays buckliger might not even care if he was he laughed again dont you have any sense in your head dont you know theyre bound to be tapping my phonelise couldnt say that because of course theywere listening before she could say anything someone knocked on the front door ive got to go she told willi and hung up in a hurry it didnt sound like the knock the security police used it didnt declarewell kick the door open if you dont let us in right this minute but you never could tell guts knotting lise turned the knob and swung the door on its hinges it wasnt the security police it was adela handrick emmas mother a rather squat blond woman who wore expensive clothes in loud colors that didnt suit her sallow skin up till now the neighbors had stayed away from the gimpel house the plague might have struck here hello lise said hesitantly uhwont you come in frau handrick shook her head lise got a whiff of some fancy cologne no thats all right the other woman answered she sounded nervous too and licked her carefully reddened lips i just wanted to tell you that stefan and istefan was her husbandhope everything goesas well as it can for you emma says she wants to see alicia back in school too tears stung lises eyes thank you she whispered thank you very much seeming to take courage adela handrick said youre all good people everybody in the neighborhood knows it this is all nothing but a bunch of garbage butan expressive shrugwhat can you do you have to be careful maybe things will be better after the elections but maybe they wont too even suggesting that they might be better was a wonder lise said all i want is for heinrich and the girls to come home what else frau handrick said even if you were jews youd probably want the same thing who could blame you she dipped her head take care of yourself without another word she started up the street toward her own house lise stared after her willid said the one thing now shed said the other maybe a lot of people paid as little attention to what they got taught in school about hating jews as they did about geometry but how could you afford to find out alicia gimpel had always been good at remembering her lessons that helped her now the security police were trying to get her to admit she knew her father was a jew they didnt have a real interrogation room at the foundlings home they had to make do with an office a desk lamp glaring into her eyes was almost as bad as some of the fancy lights they would have had back at their own headquarters you must have known one of them shouted he slammed his fist down on the desk alicia jumped so did the gooseneck lamp he had to grab it to keep it from falling over how could you not know your own father is a stinking jew he is not alicia said shrilly thats a lie and you know it she took her cue from her little sisters they thought they were telling the truth which gave them an edge on her but she was acting for her life and while some people might not have learned their lessons she knew what her teachers had drilled into her jews are bloodsucking tyrants they cheat people at business they crawl around their betters with vilest flattery they always try to steal credit where they dont deserve it thats what mein kampf says does daddy do any of those things you know he doesnt jesus said a blackshirt behind alicia shes even worse than the other two brats maybe that son of a bitch really isnt a goddamn sheeny whyd they grab him then asked the one at the desk if they grab you you bet your ass you deserve it he glowered at alicia he had a red beefy face with blackheads on his nose and between his eyebrows his teeth were yellow his breath stank of old cigars if you dont tell us the truth youll be sorry iam telling the truth alicia lied why dont you believe me all i want to do is go home she sure told the truth there she wanted to cry but held back her tears when she did cry it felt as if the security police had won something from her the blackshirts hadnt slapped her or hit her or done anything worse than that as far as she knew they hadnt hurt her sisters either maybe even the security police didnt like the idea of torturing little girls alicia had her doubts about that if you joined the security police you had to want to hurt people didnt you more likely they werent sure enough about daddy to have too much of that kind of fun they wont find anything out from mealicia vowedand they really wont find anything out from francesca and roxane scowling the blackshirt who smelled like cigar butts said what do you know abouthe looked down at some notes on the deskerika dorsch frau dorsch alicia said in surprisethis was a new tack the dorsches are daddy and mommys friends thats all this fellow couldnt think she was a jewcould he with a leer the man from the security police asked is this dorsch galreal good friends with your old man the other blackshirts laughed most of that went over alicias head i dont know she answered they all play bridge together and they talk till its late bridge the blackshirt threw back his head and snorted in contempt he needed to blow his nose alicia fought against revulsion the man asked whatother games do they play his pals laughed again still out of her depth alicia only shrugged i dont know about any other games i dont know what youre talking about forget it hans said one of the fellows behind alicia if this gimpel bastard is fooling around with her the kid doesnt know about it that was plain enough for alicia to understand she gasped at the very idea daddy wouldnt do any such thing she exclaimed not ever all the blackshirts laughed at that no eh said the one who was questioning her i sure as hell would shes a piece and a half he looked past her to his buddies you guys seen a picture of this broad shes a blonde good looking built his hands described an hourglass in the air hell id crawl through a thousand kilometers of broken glass just to let her piss on my toothbrush ewww alicias voice rose to a thin squeak thats disgusting the men from the security police thought her horror was funnier than their friends joke the interrogator thought revolting her was pretty funny too he kept on asking her questions after that but he didnt seem so mean and threatening any more it wasnt much worse than getting grilled by herr kesslerhe taught me all kinds of thingsincluding some he probably didnt intend to she thought even so she knew shed never be able to look at frau dorsch the same way again finally the man from the security police turned off the desk lamp well kid thats enough of that for a while he said in oddly intimate tones as if what theyd been doing together had somehow made them friends maybe he thought it had he stepped back straightened up and stretched trying to get her to say things that would kill her fatherand incidentally herselfwas all in a days work for him go on ulf take her back with the rest of the snotnoses you should talkalicia thought theyd made her miss supper this wasnt the first time that had happened she knew the staff at the foundlings home wouldnt give her anything till breakfast if you werent there when they dished out a meal that was your tough luck they werent actively cruel but they had no give whatever in them she lay down on her cot even if the blackshirts hadnt beaten her she felt trampled and miserable for hans and ulf and the others this was all just a game a game theyd played hundreds or thousands of times before alicias life was on the line and her fathers and her sisters and she knew it and she didnt see how she could win paula came into their room in a practically inaudible whisper she said here when i saw they werent going to let you go i swiped these for you like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a top hat she produced two hard rolls from under her dress and tossed them to alicia alicia blinked if they caught you youd get in big trouble well then youd better destroy the evidence eh paula wasnt especially smart not in the way that got you good grades at school alicia could tell but the other girl had a feel for whatneeded doing one that alicia couldnt begin to match she took paulas advice the rolls quickly disappeared they tasted like sawdust empty as alicia was she didnt care better paula asked when she was done jaalicia said thank you for what paula waved it away those shitheads are giving you a hard time anybody can see that if they were giving a vulture a hard time id try and get him some dead smelly meat springs squeaked as alicia shifted on the cot one of them poked at her too so she shifted again she stuck her head out and flapped her arms as if she were a vulture paula thought that was so funny she buried her face in her pillow to muffle her laughter alicia watched her out of the corner of her eye the other girl acted like somebody who hated the reich and the nazis and everything they stood for but if it was an act and alicia fell for it shed ruin herself and her whole family and so she wouldnt fall for it if paula really did hate the reich and the nazisthen she did that was all alicia couldnt afford to let on that she did too except for arresting her when they had no business to and that maybe was the hardest the saddest thing of all heinrich gimpel sat in his cell waiting for whatever happened next that was all he could do boredom mixed with occasional terrorthat was what his life in prison had been he could see how the blend was in and of itself part of what broke prisoners down as he sat on the cot he could practically feel his mind slowing down slowing down slowing and he was better equipped than most to fight boredom he had a fine memory he could call up books and plays and films in his mind trying to squeeze out every last detail he could set up complicated accounting problems and solve them in his head instead of with a calculator he could remember the last time hed made love with lise and the time before that and the quickie theyd sneaked in and he could worry he spent a lot of time worrying that was part of leaving him here by himself too he knew as much and tried to fight against it there he didnt have much luck he was brooding and wishing he werent when guards clumped up the hallway toward his cell one opened the door while two others pointed assault rifles at him he couldnt understand why they thought he was so dangerous under different circumstances it might have been flattering come on you growled the guard with the key your mouthpiece is waiting as heinrich rose he got a whiff of himself his nostrils curled hed done his best to stay clean but his best wasnt very good and he was still wearing the uniform in which hed been arrested it was ranker than he was down the hall he went holding up his trousers with one hand at least they hadnt cuffed him this time never mind the assault rifles at his back he couldnt very well make a break when his pants would fall down if he tried without laces his shoes flopped on his feet too klaus menzel stood waiting in the room with the glass partition the lawyer had on another suit that would have cost heinrich a months pay he stepped up to the grill and said i have some good news and some bad news for you which do you want first give me the good news heinrich said at once i havent heard any in so long all right here it is menzel told him how the charges against him had come from erika dorsch and how shed tried to kill herself after she found out shed got the girls seized along with heinrich menzel added you should have just screwed the broad gimpel no matter what your wife did to you afterwards you wouldntve landed in this kind of shit and youdve had the roll in the hay to remember heh heinrich said in a hollow voice that had occurred to him too he went on you say erikas going to be all right and thats shes withdrawn these stupid charges he needed to go on repeating that they were stupid or the blackshirts were liable to think he believed them thats all wonderful they have to let me out now dont they gloomily klaus menzel shook his head they donthave to do a goddamn thing and you ought to know it by this time trouble is they dont believe this dorsch item they figure shes got the hots for you so shes lying to protect you thats crazy heinrich yelped tell me about it menzel said but the way things are now they arent about to let you go right this minute they dont want to look soft he wrinkled up his nose as if at a bad smell is prutzmann heinrich began i dont know anything about politics his lawyer broke in if youre smart you dont either that was undoubtedly good advice with the guards in the room with microphones bound to be picking up every word saying anything bador anything at allabout the reichsfuhrer ss couldnt be smart well what are you doing about everything heinrich demanded that was a question he could legitimately ask even here trying to get them to look at whats right in front of their noses menzel answered maybe they will maybe they wont they havent given you a noodle yet anyhow thats something believe me i dont remember the last time they arrested somebody here they thought was a fullblood not just some kind of mischling whoever the last bastard was i bet he didnt come close to lasting as long as you have so keep your pecker up and well see what happens as soon as menzel turned away from the grill the security police jailers marched heinrich back to his cell there he sat by the world forgot though he couldnt forget the world they didnt take him out and shoot him or send him to a camp that was his only consolation no he had one other as long as they didnt do anything to him they wouldnt do anything to the girls either three days later a tall blond man in the uniform of a security police major came to his cell along with the warder the officer signed some papers on a clipboard and gave them to the warder who read them nodded and opened the door hes all yours he said good the officer answered briskly he pointed a leathergloved finger at heinrich youre gimpel heinrich nodded the major gestured peremptorily come with me gulping heinrich came hed been here long enough to have learned to fear changes in routine they were rarely changes for the better he shuffled around shoes loose on his feet one hand holding up his pants behind him the cell door clanged his fear grew when the officer took him down unfamiliar corridors would they give him the noodle right here when he least expected it he braced himself not that that would do him any good they left the cells and went into the prisons office block the blackshirt opened a door in here the room was small and bare the walls were whitewashed brick the floor cheap linoleum a bare bulb burned in a ceiling fixture on a rickety wooden table lay heinrichs greatcoat his belt and shoelaces his wallet his keys his comb even his pocket changethe personal effects hed had when he was arrested fix yourself up the security police major said heinrich obeyed though his hands shook so much he had trouble putting the laces in his shoes would they shoot him while attempting escape when he was dressed the major took him to a bathroom across the hall a scissors and a razor sat on the sink shave he did trimming his beard with the scissors before attacking it with the blade shaving in cold water without soap was unpleasant but he managed the major nodded youll do heinrich was surprised when the blackshirt after signing more papers led him out of the prison he was astonished when the man took him to a bus stop two blocks away so astonished that he blurted whats going on youre free the major said charges quashed go home this bus will take you right to south station my god heinrich whispered menzel came through a few meters away a wren scuttling through a flowerbed chirped shrilly it was the sweetest music hed ever heard your lawyer the security police officer threw back his head and laughed he thinks he did anyhow a bus came up the wren flew away the major winked at heinrichdid i really see that he wondered casually the fellow said you find us in the oddest places the bus door opened the major pushed heinrich towards itus he couldnt mean he never got the chance to ask the major had turned away and the bus driver waited impatiently heinrich fed his card into the fare slot the light flashed green the bus rolled away xiii the matron who ran the foundlings disciplinary home reminded alicia of frau koch like the beast she was perfectly aryan blond blueeyed fair and also like the beast she had a face like a boot she was tough and mean and ready to lash out at any moment alicia wondered why people like that hador wantedanything to do with children gimpel the matron said now sticking her head into alicias room come with me this minute jawohl alicia didnt know why the matron wanted her to come or where she was going asking questions was not encouraged blind obedience was alicia had to hurry to keep up with the matron whose soldierly stride conceded nothing to smaller people the woman always looked angry at the world this morning she seemed even angrier than usual she kept glaring down at alicia and muttering things the girl couldnt quite make outmaybe im lucky alicia thought and shivered in here the matron pulled open the door to her own office alicia hadnt been there since the day the security police pulled her sisters and her out of school and there were francesca and roxane now they sat on identical metal folding chairs and wore identical wary expressions the matron pointed to another chair by theirs sit down she told alicia the next word seemed aimed at all three gimpel girls wait still muttering the matron stalked to another door and flung it open in camedaddy alicia shrieked and ran to him her sisters squeals might even have been higher and shriller but couldnt have been any more delighted the three of them put together almost knocked their father off his feet he bent down to kiss and squeeze all of them behind his glasses tears gleamed in his eyes ive come to take you home he said huskily the security police have seen that im not a jew after all and if im not a jew the three of you cant possibly be mischlingen and since you arent you dont have to stay here any more francesca broke free of his arms and rounded on the matron i told you we werent filthy stinking jews itold you so and you didnt want to listen well now you see i knew what i was talking about she had her hands on her hips she might have been an irate housewife telling off a clerk whod been rude to her the matron turned bright red her formidable fists clenched but she didnt say a thing daddy was more polite he asked the matron is there paperwork i have to fill out so i can take my girls home paperwork the woman nodded jerkily little by little her angry flush faded jathere is paperwork there is always paperworkherr gimpel she took forms from filing cabinets and out of her desk daddy signed and signed and signed the matron studied everything she finally nodded you may take them their behavior here has beenacceptable im glad alicias father said they should never have been brought here in the first place but im glad he gathered up the girls come on kids lets go alicia had never left any place so gladly in all her life not even the doctors office after a shot as daddy led the three sisters towards a bus stop down the street from the foundlings home roxane said they thought we were jews ugly smelly yucky jews she made a horrible face they sure did theyre pretty dumb alicia chimed in she and her father knew the truth but her little sisters didnt she had to hold up a mask in front of them that wasnt any fun but shed just found out how needful it was well they were wrong werent they daddy said francesca and roxane nodded emphatically half a heartbeat later so did alicia her father had to hold up a mask too maybe the blackshirts had put a tiny microphone in his clothes maybe they were still listening you never could tell you never could be too careful not where the security police were concerned up came the bus daddy stuck his card in the slot four times after a while they got off and transferred to another bus then they did it again the third bus took them into stahnsdorf and a little more than an hour after theyd set out stopped at the corner up the street from their house daddy herded alicia and her sisters off the bus lets go mommys waiting when they got down onto the sidewalk francesca and roxane raced up the street alicia hung back she looked up at her father is everything all right she asked really all right he smiled i know what you mean as she had he spoke cagily everything is as good as it can be sweetheart were out here were free the way we should be because they shouldnt have grabbed us in the first place yes he too was playing to an invisible audience that might or might not be there im afraid we wont see some friends so much and thats too bad but he shrugged there are worse things the dorsches alicia asked daddy stopped how do you know about the dorsches the security police were asking me questions just like they were with francesca and roxane alicia tried to remember just what the blackshirt had said is frau dorsch really a piece and a half she wasnt precisely sure what it meant but it sounded impressive her father turned red he coughed a couple of times after a long long pause he said notquite in a small strangled voice alicia almost asked for more details but the front door opened then her sisters ran into her mothers arms mommy she shouted and broke into a run herself mommy had a hug for her too and kisses i know you were all brave girls she said alicias little sisters nodded eagerly so did she with a secret smile on her face shed had to be brave in a way francesca and roxane hadnt because shed known the truth and had to hide it and they hadnt their mother tousled her hair she had a secret smile on her face too yes shed meant that especially for alicia it went right over francesca and roxanes heads alicias smile got wider she liked secretswell most secrets anyway the big one she carried she still wasnt so sure about that one thing she was sure of though and all the more so after this ordeal like it or not it was hers daddy came up the steps did you tell them about the surprise yet of course not mommy answered if i told them it wouldnt be a surprise any more would it naturally that set all three gimpel girls clamoring their mother looked innocent till shed almost driven them crazy then she said if people look in the kitchen they may findsomething they ran in roxanes gleeful squeal rang out a split second ahead of her sisters the cake was enormous and covered with gooey white icing big blue letters spelled out welcome home when mommy cut the cake it proved to be dark dark chocolate with cherries and blueberries between the layers she gave them huge slices and when francesca asked can we have some more she didnt say anything about ruining their appetites she just handed out seconds as big as the firsts everything was so wonderful it was almost worth getting grabbed by the security police almost walther stutzman muttered to himself threading his way past the electronic traps on the virtual road that led to lothar prutzmanns domain wasnt his worry he had their measure now sooner or later an ss programmer would come up with some new ones and walther would need to spot them before they closed on him today though getting in had been easy enough so was looking around once hed got inside no what made him mutter was not finding what he was looking for heinrich had given him a good description of the man whod released him from prison tall blond a major in the security police by what the man had said he was a jew but walther had been pretty sure he knew about all the handful of jews in the ss none of them from what he recalled matched this fellow looking through the records only confirmed that so who was the major then more to the pointwhat was he someone whod tried a last trick to get a suspected jew to reveal himself that would have been walthers guess but it didnt fit the way heinrich had described the scene a couple of days earlier a joker or a real jew unknown to walther and his circle of friends that would be goodthe more who survived the better but it also raised doubts frightening ones now somebody outside the circle somebody no one in the circle knew knew something about somebody in it the last thing a jew in the third reich wanted was for anybody to have a handle on him what can i dowalther wondered one thing that occurred to him was tracking down everybody on duty at the prison the day heinrich was released not many majors would have been there one of them should have been the man who turned his friend loose before he could do that though his boss came back from lunch and bellowed walther you here walther three quick keystrokes and everything incriminating vanished from his monitor three more made his electronic trail vanish im here he called whats up gustav priepke stuck his beefy face into walthers cubicle you smart son of a bitch he said fondly you goddamn knowitall bastard i love you too walther said in his usual mild tones his boss roared laughter still mildly he asked could you at least tell me why youre swearing at me today delighted by god priepke answered youre not only a smart son of a bitch youre a thieving son of a bitch too you know that excitement tingled through walther now he had a pretty good idea of what his foulmouthed boss was talking about the code ran did it bet your sweet ass it did gustav priepke said and backward compatibility looks as good as you said it would weve got a real live modern operating system or we will once we root out the usual forty jillion bugs and we wont lose data on account of itll be able to read all our old files thatsterrific walther said computer experts in the reich had talked about modernizing the standard operating system for years theyd talked about it but they hadnt done ittill now he was proud hed had a part and not such a small one in turning talk into the beginning of reality and then he wonderedwhy he was proud a new operating system would only make german computers more efficient it would help the government work better and the government included the ss it might make the search for hidden jews more effective this was a reason to be proud yes in spite of everything it was if he didnt take professional pride in his own skill his own competence life turned empty whatever he did he wanted to do well as smoothly as only a man with no worries in the world could his boss changed the subject you going to vote when the elections for the new reichstag come up in a few weeks i suppose so walther answered you know i dont get very excited about politics he didnt show that he got excited about politics which wasnt the same thing at all but priepkeand the rest of the outside worldsaw only the calm mask not the turmoil behind it shit i dont get excited about the usual politics either gustav priepke said but this isnt the usual garbageor it had better not be anyhow if youve got a chance to make a real difference grab with both hands the gesture he used looked more nearly obscene than political but got the message across you really think it will make a difference walther asked it had better by god priepke rumbled ominously you wait and see how many bonzen go out on their ears when they run where people can vote against em a lot of those stupid bastards really believe everybody loves them i want to see the looks on their fat faces when they find out how wrong they are gloating anticipation filled his laugh without answering in words walther pointed up to the ceiling with one index finger and cupped his other hand behind an ear had his boss forgotten he was bound to be overheard by someone from lothar prutzmanns domain priepke gestured again this time with undoubted unabashed obscenity hell with em all he said thats the point of this electionto teach the goddamn snoops weve got lives of our own and if they dont like it they can screw themselves he means itwalther thought dizzilyhe doesnt care if theyre listening he doesnt think it matters he looked up tono pastthe ceiling hed just pointed atplease god let him be right another department staff meeting another dimly lit conference room foggy and stinking with franz oppenhoffs cigar smoke and innumerable cigarettes and pipes susanna weiss drew a face hidden by a pigsnouted gas mask wishful thinking unfortunately she scratched out the sketch as it vanished she wondered why she bothered bringing a pad to these gatherings nothing worth noting ever got said at the head of the long table the chairman stood up professor oppenhoff waited till all eyes were on him then after a couple of wet coughs he said a change is coming it is a change for which we must all prepare ourselves the budget half a dozen anxious voices said the same thing at the same time but oppenhoff shook his head no not the budget the budget is as it should be or close enough i speak of a more fundamental change if hed been trying to get everyones attention hed succeeded even susanna looked his way what could be more fundamental to a university department than its funding oppenhoff nodded portentously i speak of the changes that may come to pass in the reich itself two or three professors who cared about nothing more recent than the transition from old high german to middle high german leaned back in their leatherupholstered chairs and closed their eyes one of them began to snore and so quickly that he must have had a clear conscience susanna by contrast leaned forward this was liable to be interesting after all and if the department chairman expectedher to review the political situation again she would but he might not care for what she had to say like a lot of people in the greater german reich she thought she could get away with much more than she had only a few months before but professor oppenhoff did not call on her instead ponderously leaning forward he spoke for himself changes i say again may come to pass in the reich itself there has been much talk of openness and revitalization some of it from those most highly placed in the state and a certain amount of this is no doubt good and useful as anyone will recognize he paused to draw on his cigarnow that hes shown he can say nice things about reform what will he do next susanna wondered and promptly answered her own questionhell start flying his true colors thats what just as promptly oppenhoff proved her right in all this rush toward change for the sake of change we must not lose sight of what nearly eighty years of national socialist rule have given the reich he said when the first fuhrer came to power we were weak and defeated now we rule the greatest empire the world has ever known we were at the mercy of jews and communists we have eliminated the problems they presented weve killed them all is what you mean susannas nails bit into the soft flesh of her palmsnot quite all you pompous son of a bitch all this being so oppenhoff continued some of you might perhaps do well to wonder why any fundamental changes in the structure of the government are deemed necessary if you feel that way as i must confess i do myself you will also be able to find candidates who support a similar point of view puff puff puff change for the sake of change is no doubt very exciting very dramatic but when things are going well change is also apt to be for the worst some of you are younger than i many of you in fact are younger than i oppenhoff chuckled rheumily that was about as close to anything resembling real humor as he came you will perhaps be more enamored of change for the sake of change than i am but i tell you this when you have my years you too will see the folly of change when the german state has gone through the grandest and most glorious period in its history with a wheeze and a grunt he sat down his chair creaked as his bulk settled into it susanna couldnt have said why she was so disappointed shed known oppenhoff was a reactionary for years why should one more speech make her want to cryor better to kick him where it would do the most good maybe it was because in spite of everything shed let herself get her hopes up heinz buckliger had done more to open the reich than his three predecessors put together he seemed intent on doing more stilland if he didnt rolf stolle might some of the folk the wehrmacht had conquered were reminding berlin that they still remembered who they were and that theyd once been freeand they were getting away with it yes the security police had grabbed heinrich gimpel and his children but theyd let them go the accusation that he was a jew hadnt come from anyone who really knew but from of all things a woman scorned susanna had trouble imagining anyone chasing heinrich hard enough to want him dead when she didnt get him it only went to show you never could tell the point was though that theyhad let him go in a world where that could happen what couldnt heinrichs release only made franz oppenhoffs comfortable complacent words seem all the worse susanna almost burst with the temptation of throwing that in oppenhoffs face shed sometimes morbidly wondered which of the jews she knew was likeliest to get caught shed thought she herself topped that list just because she had the most trouble keeping her mouth shut when she ran into something wrong heinrich and lise were almost stoic in the way they refused to let what went on around them bother them susanna was a great many things but not a stoic and yet here she sat as safe and free as a jew in the reich could be no you never could tell herr doktor professor that was konrad lutze whod gone to the medieval english association meeting in london with susannawhod almost gone instead of susanna yes oppenhoff smiled benignlyof course he does susanna thoughtlutze pisses standing up how can he do anything wrong with an advantage like that and then lutze said herr doktor professor shouldnt we return to the first principles of national socialism and let the volk have the greatest possible say in the government of the reich please excuse me but i dont see how this could do anything but improve the way the reich is run professor oppenhoff looked as if hed just taken a bite out of a hot south american pepper without expecting it susanna stared at konrad lutze too but with a different sort of astonishment he was an indifferent scholar everyone in the department except possibly oppenhoff knew that shed always figured him for more of a careerist than someone who truly loved knowledge he was the last man she would have imagined sticking out his neck and hed just thrown reform in the department chairmans face what did that say that oppenhoffs politics were even more dinosaurian than susanna had thought what elsecould it say back to work heinrich gimpel climbed onto the bus that would take him to the stahnsdorf train station while he sat in prison hed wondered if he would have a job if he got out it hadnt been his biggest worry next to a noodle or a shower being alive and unemployed didnt look so bad but he still had his place nobody at oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters had said so out loud when he called to inquire but he got the feeling his superiors there enjoyed putting him back in that slot because it gave the armed forces a point in their unending game against the ss three stops later willi dorsch got on the bus his face brightened when he saw heinrich then almost as abruptly it fell the seat next to heinrich was empty willi hesitantly approached heinrich patted the artificial leather to show he was welcome back when heinrich was a boy people had called the stuff jews hide you didnt hear that much any more till the reform movement started heinrich hadnt thought about it one way or the other now he dared hope it was a good sign its damn good to see you willi said shaking his hand with a wry smile that twisted up one corner of his mouth he added youd probably sooner knock my block off than look at me its not your fault heinrich said and then cautiously hows erika shesbetter shes glad the girls are all right shes glad youre all right too that wry smile got wrier she wanted to find out just how good you could be didnt she wellyes dull embarrassment filled heinrichs voice i never would have figured that willi said and i really never would have figured that shed go and call the security police sometimes i wonder if i know her at all now i suppose telling you im sorry is the least i can do being sorry wouldnt have mattered if the blackshirts had got rid of heinrichand of alicia francesca and roxane stillits over heinrich said i hope to god its over anyhow erikas sorry too if she werent she wouldnt have swallowed those stupid goddamn pills willi shook his head she swears up and down she didnt think they would go after you and the girls the way they did heinrich only grunted when she picked up the phone whathad erika thought the security police would do invite him up for coffee and cakes plainly shed regretted what she did afterwards at the time at the time shed no doubt wanted him dead he asked a question of his own are the two of you really going to patch things up now or will you go on squabbling and cheating on each other he added but only to himself he always tried to stay politemaybe even too polite for his own good willi answered with a shrug i dont know what the hell were going to do if it werent for the kidsbut theyre there and we cant very well pretend theyre not how much did he worry about his son and daughter when he took ilse out for lunch and whatever else he could get away with maybe some he did love them heinrich knew that love them or not though he went right on doing whathe wanted to do at the train station heinrich shelled out fifteen pfennigs for a volkischer beobachter so did willi as heinrich carried the paper toward the platform a sudden thought made him glance toward the other man when they grabbed me did it make the news he asked jawilli answered uncomfortably a jew in berlini mean somebody they thought was a jew in berlinisnews did anybody say anything when they let me go now willi looked at him as if hed asked a very dumb question indeed and so he had dont be silly willi said when was the last time the ss admitted it made a mistake the twelfth of never thats when the train rumbled up doors hissed open heinrich and willi fed their cards into the fare slot then sat down side by side and started reading their papers the upcoming election dominated the headlines rolf stolle had given another speech calling on the fuhrer to move harder and further on reforms the volkischer beobachter covered it in detail quoting some of the juiciest bits a year earlier even if the gauleiter of berlin had presumed to give such a speech the beobachter would have pretended he hadnt out of the commuter train up the escalators onto the bus into downtown berlin traffic willi looked out the window and shook his head he said im glad im not driving in this youd have to be crazy to want to heinrich agreed but the swarms of cars clogging every street argued that a hell of a lot of peoplewere crazy out of the bus up the steps to oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters nods to the guards identification cards one of the guards nudged his pal hey look adolf heres gimpel back adolf nodded good i didnt figure you were really a kikeherr gimpel the security police couldnt grab their ass with both hands im here heinrich pocketed his card once more what would adolf have said knowing he was a jew that seemed only too obvious but theyd decided he wasnt or at least decided they couldnt show he was there was an improvement in the way things worked when kurt haldweim was fuhrer suspicion alone would have earned him a trip to the shower he got to his desk late analysts and secretariesand wehrmacht officers tookept stopping him in the corridor to shake his hand and tell him they were glad to see him he was slightly dazed by the time he finally did walk up to the familiar battleshipgray metal desk he hadnt realized so many people cared he was just about to sit down in his squeaky swivel chair when ilse spotted him ohherr gimpel im so happy youre back she squealed and ran up to him and gave him a hug and a kiss then she laughed now ive got lipstick on you the way i do with willi willi chose that moment to have a coughing fit heinrich would have too ilse turned and made a face at her lunchtime lover she pulled a tissue from her purse and rubbed at heinrichs cheek she drew back looked him over and rubbed a little more there all better she said briskly is it heinrich said she nodded he was almost as much an object to be dealt with for her as he had been for the security police her ministrations were a lot more enjoyable though off she went heinrich sat down the chair did squeak he tried to remember what hed been doing when the blackshirts grabbed him before he could even come close willi stalked over and spoke in a mocktough voice trying to steal another woman of mine are you heinrich hoped it was just mocktough he said the only thing im trying to do is mind my own business and have people leave me alone up till now i never realized how hard that was willi laughed and slapped him on the back all right i can take a hint heinrich wasnt at all sure willi could but his friendand in spite of everything willi did still seem to be his friendwent back to his desk and got to work with real relief heinrich did the same he knew he wouldnt accomplish much this morning it would be like coming back from vacation hed need to figure out what had gone on while he was out before he could do anything useful here what had gone on while he was out couldnt have been more obvious if it had marched by with a brass band the americans were kicking up their heels they took heinz buckligers policy for weakness payments were lagging excuses were some of the plainest lies hed ever seen over on the other side of the atlantic they were finding out how much they could get away with so far they seemed to be doing exactly that panzers hadnt rolled out to plunder the countrysideor to surround the american legislature and bureaucrats in omaha and make them cough up what was due the reich haldweim would have arrested people himmler would have machinegunned people up till now heinz buckliger hadnt even squawked if i were running thingsbut heinrich wasnt he wondered if anyone was or if the people above him were just letting everything drift till they got orders from the fuhrer with worries closer to home would buckliger give orders about the usa how about some lunch willi asked heinrich looked up in astonishment it couldnt be lunchtime yet but his watch insisted it was ten to twelve willi went on how about admiral yamamotos sounds good to me after cabbage stew in prison any real food sounded good to heinrich several big meals at home had only just begun to fill the hole inside him shrimp tempura teriyaki beef and a plate of berlin rolls enlivened with soy sauce and wasabi went some way toward holefilling miso soup came with the meal so did rice which was to be expected and potato salad which never failed to leave him bemused it was pretty good potato salad but he didnt think the average japanese came home to potato salad every nightor any night but admiral yamamotos wasnt the only japanese place in berlin that included potato salad in its meals so maybe he was wrong more likely the restaurant owners just knew what their customers favored as usual plenty of customers favored admiral yamamotos it drew people from every government agency within several kilometers along with hotel clerks shopgirls and even the occasional japanese tourist hungry for the tastes of home and discovering that the restaurant offeredsome of them heinrich ate rather clumsily with chopsticks he sipped a good wheat beer which went well with the spicy salty lunch and he listened to the people chatting at nearby tables the tables were so close together he couldnt help listening to his neighbors one question he heard over and over was who are you going to vote for once to his astonishment he heard one trooper from the waffen ss division leibstandarte adolf hitler ask that of his pal he was even more astonished when the second trooper answered me stolle who else the tough young aryan warrior sounded as if no other choice besides the radical gauleiter of berlin were possible and the first man nodded plainly agreeing with him i wasnt sure what i thought of this whole election business heinrich said sounds like everybodys excited about it though sure does willi agreed im as surprised as you are maybe more so and once the votes get counted i can think of some other people wholl be more surprised yet he mouthed lothar prutzmanns name but he didnt say it out loud not in a restaurant full of strangers someone else might be surprised too heinrich mouthed the fuhrer s name and willi nodded i dont think he expected rolf to get so popular so fast willi nodded again but he said still the two of them ought to be able to work together theyre going in the same direction its not like that other fellow the one who wants to turn back the clock no i wouldnt think so i sure hope not heinrich said the only thing that worries me is what happens if the one of them gets jealous of the other yes not naming names was definitely a good idea a few months earlier heinrich wouldnt have dared to talk about party rivalries in a public place with or without names back in the days when kurt haldweim was fuhrer he would have been leery about doing it even if private as usual willi dorsch had more nerve than he did of course willi hadnt been hauled away from his desk by the security police either buckliger shouldve run for the reichstag himself willi said this way stolle will be able to say the volk chose me but who chose you if elections really do stick that could matter it could matter a lot youre right heinrich said willi might not notice something like his wife making a play for another man but he missed very little when it came to politics and when heinrich tried to pay the tab willi wouldnt let him next time fine but not right after the security police let you go you dont need to show me youre no cheap jew i believe it thats nice heinrich said willi laughed at the irony in his voice but it held more irony than willi knew it was especially nice that willi thought heinrich wasnt a jew when he really was had willior anybody elsebeen truly convinced he was he wouldnt be full of japanese food right now he would have been disposed of and so would his children willi got to his feet shall we head back he said i know youre dying to with all the catching up youve got to do heinrich rose too i dont mind he said willi rolled his eyes and shook his head at such dedication heinrich meant it though he wasnt dying to get back to the office but as hed thought a moment before he would have been dyingor deadif he couldnt go back given that stark choice sitting at a desk and adding up long columns of figures didnt look bad at all alicia gimpels class went out to eat their lunches and play on the schoolyard she was about to walk out with the other boys and girls when her teacher called her name she stopped what is itherr peukert she asked youve only been back in school for a couple of days alicia he said you dont need to work so very hard to make up all the assignments you missed but i want to get them out of the way alicia exclaimed then i wont have to worry about them any more im not going to worry about them now or not very muchherr peukert said youre a good student and youve shown you can understand the material thats what really matters he hesitated then went on and its not as if you could help being absent not with what happened to you im glad youre back thank youherr peukert im glad im back too alicia said are you sure its all right about the work i dont mind doing it like her father she was glad to have the chance to work yes im sure the teacher hesitated again finally nodding to himself he asked has anyone given you a hard time aboutabout where you were and why no sir alicia answered which wasnt strictly true wolf priller and a couple of other boys had teased her but it hadnt been too badcertainly nothing where she felt she ought to tattle but now she was the one who paused but what herr peukert asked the charge made against you was serious but it was false now that its been shown to be false people have no businessnonethrowing it in your face do you understand ja herr peukert alicia would have let it go at that if her teacher hadnt sounded angry that anybody could still be bothering her since he did though she added its not me sirits my sister some of the students in your sisters class are giving her trouble peukert sounded angrier still who is your sisters teacher well deal with this alicias heart sank she wished shed kept her mouth shut francescas in uhfrau kochs class sir shed almost saidthe beasts class but not quite the boys and girls arent giving her any trouble though itsits frau koch she waited to see if the sky would fall oh the word seemed heavy as lead as it came from herr peukerts throat thatsvery unfortunate alicia im sorry i dont know just what to do about that i dont know if i can do anything about that some peoplesome people cant be reasonable about some things itstoo bad when those people get put in charge of others but sometimes it happens its not fair its not right alicia said she shouldnt say those things daddysnot a jew and that means my sisters and meand i arent mischlingen part of that was true anyhow she and francesca and roxane werent mischlingen they were fullblooded jews alicia knew what she had to say though herr peukert looked troubled if you like alicia i will speak to the principal but i have to tell you i dont know how much good it will do or if it will do any good at all inside their classrooms teachers do as they see fit as long as they teach what they are required to teach and i know frau koch has been at this school a long time much longer than the principal has he waited alicia needed a few seconds to understand what he was saying if he talked to the principal the principal might tell the beast to go easy on francesca because she told her though that didnt mean frau koch would do it she might act meaner than ever to get even with francesca for trying to land her in trouble knowing the beast that was just what shewould do maybe youd better let it alone then alicia said reluctantly i think youre being smart her teacher sounded relieved alicia didnt feel smart she felt shoddy this was the same as not standing up to somebody on the playground even if you were right because hed beat the snot out of you if you tried sometimes you had to make choices like that when you got to be a grownup from what shed seen you had to make choices like that all the time no matter what you ended up doing you couldnt be sure it was the right thing sometimes therewas no right thing herr peukert said why dont you go out and play now alicia this business with your sister will sort itself out sooner or later sooner or later alicia echoed in mournful tones whenever a grownup said that he meantsooner whenever a child heard it she heardlater as far as alicia knew there was no bridge across that chasm between the generations she went out emma handrick and trudi krebs waved to her she went over to them and started chatting everything was pretty much the way it would have been if the blackshirts hadnt taken her away pretty much even while she was talking with her friends though part of her mind was chewing on something herr peukert had said about the beastsome people cant be reasonable about some things its too bad when those people get put in charge of others but sometimes it happens hed been talking about frau koch he hadnt meant anything more alicia knew that but she couldnt help thinking the words applied to the first fuhrer at least as well as they did to the beast oh thank youfrau stutzman dr dambach said when esther set a foam cup of coffee on his desk the pediatrician took a sip then eyed her youre looking happy this morning am i esther said her boss nodded she shrugged and smiled well maybe i am its a beautiful day isnt it dambach nodded again it certainly is i saw more of it than i really wanted to as a matter of fact did you esther knew she was supposed to say something like that i certainly did dambach answered i wanted to get here early so i could go through some of the medical journals that keep piling upsure enough he had a stack of them on his desk and a scalpel in place of a knife to open the pages of the numbers that didnt come cut from the printersbut i got caught in a traffic jam so i didnt come in more than five minutes earlier than usual thats too bad esther said what happened was anyone badly hurt dr dambach shook his head it wasnt an accident it was a political parade if you can believe such a thing up until very recently esther wouldnt have been able to believe it the only parades allowed would have been those organized by the government and they would have been publicized in advance someone efficient like dambach would have known one was coming and would have chosen a route it didnt block things had changed though esther asked who was parading people who like that fat fraud of a stolle dambach answered the mans out for himself first last and always anyone who cant see as much needs to go to an optometrist if you ask me or do you think im wrong he tacked on the last question with the air of a man suddenly realizing the person he was talking to might disagree with him ive told you before i dont really pay a whole lot of attention to politics esther said i think everybody knows what our problems are if the election could help get rid of some of them that would be nice and if it cantshe shruggedthen it cant thats all you have a sensible attitude the pediatrician said most people are fools they expect the sun the moon and the little stars from this new reichstag dont they see that most of the members will be the same old scoundrels whove been running things all along they wont turn into angels just because people were able to write an x beside their names i suppose not esther paid more attention to politics than she let on she had more hope for the election than she let on too that hope was probably what made her add isnt conscience supposed to be the still small voice that says someone may be watching maybe the bonzen will behave better when they knew people can vote them out if they dont maybe plainly dambach went that far only to be polite my guess is theyll hold this election and maybe one more and then theyll forget about them againand well go back to sleep for another seventy or eighty years well you could be right esther retreated to the receptionists station in a hurry her bosss cynicism was like a harvester rolling over the fragile young shoots of her optimism and cutting them down maybe dambach was right the whole history of the reich argued that he was but esther didntwouldntlike it she got busy with the billing as long as she was thinking about that she didnt have to worry about anything else irma should have taken care of more of it than she had the evening before fuming at her also kept esther from fretting about politics and then patients and their parentsas always mostly mothersstarted coming in nobody could get excited about rolf stolle or heinz buckliger or lothar prutzmann with toddlers screaming in the background today the racket seemed more a relief than a distraction telephone calls kept esther busy too the busier she stayed the less she had time to wonder if all of buckligers reforms were nothing but new makeup on the same old party face mothers talked in the waiting room though thanks to their children she could hear them only fitfully she did prick up her ears when rolf stolles name came up the woman who mentioned him wasnt talking about politics though or not exactly if what she said was true stolle had made a pass at her sister from everything esther had heard her sister was far from unique thats not good another mother said her toddler made a swipe for her glasses she blocked the little arm with the practiced ease of someone whod done it many times before thats not good either sweetheart she told the boy and then went back to politics still even if he does make passes at everything in a skirt he wont send the blackshirts out to knock your door down in the middle of the night which counts for more sometimes we need the security police yet another woman said look how they found a jew a while ago in this day and age a jew sneaking around in berlin if that doesnt scare you i dont know what would all the women in the waiting room nodded esther had to nod too someone might be watching her wondering about her heinrichs arrest had made the papers and the radio and televisor no one had said a public word about his release as far as people knew the blackshirts were doing their job keeping berlin and the reich judenfrei and safe from all sorts of untermenschen as far as people knew that was an important job people didnt know as much as they thought they did esther wished she could tell them that but they wouldnt listen except for the ones whod report her to lothar prutzmanns henchmen too bad too bad but true a woman came out of an examination room leading a blond fouryearold boy by the hand esther made arrangements for a followup visit in a week then called to one of the women in the waiting room you can bring sebastian in nowfrau schreckengost about time frau schreckengost sniffed my appointment was for fifteen minutes ago after all im so sorry esther liedfrau schreckengost a doughy discontentedlooking woman was the one whod said germany needed the security police dr dambach has to give all his patients as much time as they require and keepme waitingfrau schreckengost said as far as she was concerned the world revolved around her with everyone else put in it merely to dance attendance upon her and if that didnt make her a typical german esther couldnt think of anything that would susanna weiss turned on the news shed timed it perfectly the computer graphics of the opening credits were just dissolving into horst witzlebens face good evening the newsreader said the fuhrer today submitted an absentee ballot to the voting chairman of his precinct as did his wife the televisor showed heinz buckliger and his wife a skinny blond woman named erna handing sealed envelopes to a uniformed official who looked slightly overwhelmed at having so much attention focused on him witzleben went on the absentee ballots are necessary because the buckligers will not be in berlin for the election next week they are going on holiday at the croatian island of hvar except for a ceremonial meeting with the poglavnik of croatia they have no events scheduled for the time when they will be away though it is expected that the fuhrer will offer some comment on the results of the upcoming election he disappeared again this time the shot cut to tempelhof airport where the buckligers were shown boarding luftwaffe alfa the big specially modified jet airliner taxied down the runway and lumbered into the air as usual fighters escorted it to its destination in other news horst witzleben said the gauleiter of berlin continued to call for accelerated reform there was rolf stolle shouting away from the secondfloor balcony of the gauleiter s residence to a few hundred people in the small square below the scene seemed to susanna a parody of the fuhrer delivering an address to tens or hundreds of thousands of people in adolf hitler platz but as she realized when shed watched a little more it wasntjust a parody it was also a comment and a barbed one pounding his fist and bellowing up there on his little balcony with the oldfashioned iron railing even rusty in places stolle made a genuine human connection with his audience no fuhrer since hitler had been able to do that the reich and the germanic empire had grown too overwhelmingly large by the nature of his job the fuhrer talked at people talked down to them rolf stolle reminded them what they were missing of course if he ever moved to the fuhrer s palace he would have to behave as himmler and haldweim and buckliger had before him behaving that way was part of what being the fuhrer involved maybe stolle didnt realize that yet maybe he did but didnt want anyone else to know he did susanna wondered which would be more dangerous the gauleiter got less air time than the fuhrer horst witzleben soon cut away to dramatic footage of an industrial accident in saarbrucken a helicopter plucked a workman out of what looked like a sea of flames more than a dozen other germans hadnt been so lucky along with the aryans an unknown number of untermenschen also perished horst said and went on to the next story laborers from poland or russia or the ukraine or serbia or egypt whod been lucky enough to be chosen to stoke furnaces or clean chemical tanks or do some other work too hard or too nasty for aryans and do it till they dropped instead of going to the showers right awaythis was their epitaph one sentence on the evening news it was more than most of their kind would ever get too with a shiver susanna turned off the televisor if theyd decided heinrich was a jew he would have needed a miracle to get sent to one of those mankilling jobs the powers that be would probably have just given him a noodle and gone on about their business and there was no doubt at all about what would have happened to his girls they were too young to do any useful work and so and so susanna muttered she went into the kitchen and poured two fingers of glenfiddich into a glass she almost knocked it straight back but that was a hell of a thing to do to a singlemalt scotchice she wondered and shook her head she was chilly enough inside anyhow she sipped the smoky peatflavored whiskey its warmth dammit couldnt reach where she was coldest that didnt stop her from topping up the drink a little later on put down enough and it would build a barrier against thought she wasnt often tempted to get drunk but that one dispassionate sentence on the news had gone a long way toward doing the trick heinz buckliger talked about disclosing and ending abuses did he even begin to know what all the abuses in the reich were susanna had begun to hope so now all her doubts came flooding back again the telephone rang her hand jerkednot enough fortunately to spill any scotch whos that she asked god god wasnt listening when was the last time hed ever listened to a jew it rang again she walked over and picked it upbitte professor weiss uh susanna a man on the other end of the line a nervoussounding man yes who is this not a student whoever it was no student would have had the nerve to call her by her first name even hesitantly this is konrad lutze susanna is it she said well this is a surprise what can i do for you uh konrad she had almost as much trouble using his first name as hed had with hers she really did wonder what he wanted too something to do with her work with his work with department politics she tried to steer as clear of those as she could with national politics if he thought she was going to talk about those on the telephone he had to be a little bit crazy too she wasnt anywhere near sure that was safe but after a couple of hesitant coughs he said i was uh wondering if you would uh like to go to dinner and the cinema with me on saturday night that new thriller is supposed to be very good susannas mouth fell open after her unfortunate experience with the drunk shed largely sworn off the male half of the human race because she was what she was eligible bachelors were few and far between for her and she hadnt thought he was eligible enough once she found out how he poured it down he meanwhile had married and was the father of a baby boy some people werent so fussy as she was from everything shed heard he still drank like a fish how long had the silence stretched long enough for konrad lutze to say hello are you still there im here she answered youstartled me thats all what do you say he asked we would have things to talk about anyhow that is not so baddo you know what i mean if i go out with someone i just happened to meet and she says so what do you do and i answer i am a professor of medieval english at friedrich wilhelm university where do i go from there her eyes glaze over i have never yet met a nurse or a librarian or a salesgirl who gave a damn about piers plowman or sir gawain and the green knight i believe that giggling would have been rude no matter how much susanna wanted to being a jew made her feel so alone in the world it had hardly occurred to her that being a professor of medieval english literature could do the same thing she did believe konrad lutze not many ordinary people would care about piers plowman will you then now he seemed almost pathetically eager will i thensusanna asked herself every so often jews did fall in love with gentiles most of them stopped being jews almost as completely as if the blackshirts had carted them away dinner and a film werent falling in love not by themselves but by the way lutze talked he hoped that was how things would work out and susanna wasnt interested in anything that didnt have a good chance of turning serious sowould she then could she even imagine being serious about a gentile whether she could imagine being serious about konrad lutze seemed an altogether different and much smaller question iim sorry konrad she heard herself say im afraid ive got other plans that evening i see he said heavily well im sorry ive taken up your time i hope i wasnt too much of a bother good night he hung up so did susanna part of her felt as if shed passed a test maybe the hardest one shed ever face the restshe filled her glass with glenfiddich and poured it down the hatch as if it were so much rotgut then two or three minutes later she did it again her head started to spin she didnt care tonight she would have been good company for the drunk shed dumped shed feel like hell tomorrow that was all right she felt like hell right now too admiral yamamotos again a big plate of berlin rolls herring and onion and seaweed and rice wasabi to heat them up wheat beer to wash them down imperfectly japanese perfectly good the place was jammed as usual heinrich and willi sat at a tiny table wedged up against the wall bureaucrats and soldiers ss men and party bonzen businessmen and tourists secretaries and shopgirls a radio going in the background nobody paying any attention to it nobody able to pay any attention to it because you couldnt hear anything but the din of people chattering after a bite of his shrimp tempura willi said beats the hell out of what they were feeding you a little while ago doesnt it heinrich eyed him try as he would he couldnt find any irony reluctantly fighting hard not to believe it he decided willi meant that as a simple comment not as any sort of jab or gibe anyone else would have anyone else at all heinrich nodded i thought of that the last time we were here you might say so yes you just might an sshauptsturmfuhrer a couple of tables over laughed uproariously at something one of his underlings had said he waved a seidel in the air for a refill willi raised an eyebrow noisy bastard even for this joint hes a noisy bastard jaheinrich eyed the fellow hed seen him before even more to the point hed heard him before right here last time we were in this place at the same time as he was he was pitching a fit about the first edition i wonder what he thinks with the election just a few days away is it that same captain willi tried not to be too obvious looking him over by god i do believe youre right all those ssschweinehunde look the same to me he said that very quietly he might despise blackshirts but he didnt want them knowing he did everyone who wasnt in it despised the ss hardly anybody dared to come right out and say so where anyone but trusted friends could hear am i still willis trusted friendheinrich wonderedwhen it comes to lothar prutzmanns boys i suppose i amthey threw me in the jug after all when it comes to erika when it came to erika if he never set eyes on her again that would suit him down to the ground the hauptsturmfuhrer poured down his fresh mug of beer one of the noncoms with him said something heinrich couldnt make out the officer nodded putting on a comicopera japanese accent he said they want an erection ret them go to a borderro he made not the slightest effort to keep his voice down and howled laughter right afterwards his henchmen thought it was pretty funny too charming people willi mutteredagain so softly only heinrich could hear arent they heinrich agreed shows theyre good and serious about moving the fuhrer s reforms ahead too neither his words nor willis seemed disrespectful to the ss if anyone was secretly recording their conversation he would have a hard time proving sardonic intentunless he also recorded the hauptsturmfuhrer s joke even then he might think they approved of what the officer had said saying one thing and meaning another was an art people learned young in the greater german reich not that ss men had to worry about such things of course much of what they said amounted toim going to punch you in the nose and you cant do a thing about it when that was the message subtlety lost its point a pair of wehrmacht officers got to their feet and stalked out the looks they sent the hauptsturmfuhrer would have melted titanium but not even they had the nerve to confront him directly he noticed he laughed he said something to the other ss men at the table with him to heinrich they sounded like carrion crows cawing over the body of something that would soon be dead their black uniforms only emphasized the resemblance and what sort of untimely demise would the blackshirts anticipate with so much glee only one thing occurred to heinrich the death of reform the death of the chance to speak your mind the death of the chance to remember the past as it really was the death of the chance not to make the same mistake again he shivered though it was a warm spring day and the crowded restaurant fairly radiated heat he gulped what was left of his beer almost as fast as the hauptsturmfuhrer had drained his then he took out his wallet and laid down enough money to cover the bill come on he told willi lets get out of here willi hadnt quite finished lunch he started to say somethingprobably something pungent but whatever he saw in heinrichs face made him change his mind give me half a minute was as much protest as he offered he devoured his last tempura shrimp in hardly more time than hed promised still chewing he got to his feet all right im ready thanks heinrich said once they were out on the sidewalk dont worry about it with an expansive wave willi brushed aside gratitude they walked toward the bus stop after a few strides heinrich asked why didnt you argue with me more are you kidding willi said you looked like a goose walked over your grave you were going to get the hell out of there regardless of whether i came along so i figured i might as well come he made things sound simple he usually didwhether they were or not thanks heinrich said again after another few paces he added it wasnt a goosebut youre close enough come on heinrich lise said do you want to be late for work she looked toward the stairway alicia francesca and roxane should have come down for their breakfast they hadnt not yet lise threw her hands in the air does everybody want to be late this morning im going im going her husband said he put down his coffee cup gave her a quick caffeinated kiss grabbed his attache case and hurried out the front door calling goodbye girls as he went only silence from the second floor two minutes later thoughlise decided that couldnt possibly be a herd of buffalo on the stairs which meant it had to be her daughters they swarmed into the kitchen by the way they ate she hadnt fed them for six or eight weeks eggs bacon sweet rollswhere were they putting it all i ought to make you take off your shoes and see if youre hiding breakfast in there lise said the girls made faces at her the time theyd spent in that foundlings home didnt seem to have done them any harm francesca and roxane were still sure theyd gone there by mistake alicia knew better even if she couldnt say so while her sisters were around but even she was young enough to have a lot more resilience than most grownups would have and she was young enough for death not to seem altogether real to her which also helped lise wished she could say the same shed died ten thousand times before her husband and children came home then roxane raced up the stairs with a wail of dismay i forgot to do my arithmetic homework unlike her sisters she did such things every once in a while this time at least she remembered shed forgotten work fast lise called you still have to catch the bus we could go on mommy francesca said no wait for your sister youve got time lise looked at the clock on the range i hope youve got time shed better not take too long another glance at the clock why couldnt mornings ever run smoothlybecause then they wouldnt be mornings thats why she could do some of her homeworkon the bus alicia suggested let her do as much as she can upstairs lise said roxane liked to chat with friends when she rode to and from school she was always talking about how they said this to that or that about this once she was out of the house even the threat of getting in trouble might not hold her to doing what she needed to do hurry up roxane im hurrying that was a frantic screech just when lise was about to go upstairs and get her littlest daughter roxane came pounding down all right im done she was all smiles again for heavens sake try to remember to do your homework when youre supposed to lise said roxane nodded solemnly shed be good nowtill the next time she wasnt then they would go through this againwell so what lise thoughtnext to getting arrested and killed forgotten arithmetic isnt so much of a much now is it kisses all around if lises were more heartfelt than they had been before the girls got taken awaywell then they were that was all alicia francesca and roxane probably didnt even notice goodbyes out the door the girls went there was emma handrick just coming out of her house up the street if she wasnt late they werent either and she wasnt so they werent lise closed the door sudden quiet inside the house not just quietpeace time seemed to slow down after the frantic jangling of getting her family off to work and school now she could fix herself another cup of coffee sit back and listen to music for a little while she could and she would after half an hour or so her own batteries recharged she could get on with the things she had to do today plenty of cream and plenty of sugar in the coffee a strauss waltz coming from the radio a couple of song thrushes and a blackbird hopping in the back yard hunting for wormsit wasnt bad it would have been better if she hadnt gone through terror not long before but it wasnt bad and then the waltz disappeared it hadnt ended it just stopped halfway through close to a minute of dead air followedsomebodys going to catch it lise thought foulups like that didnt happen very often music began again but this still wasnt the vanished waltz it was deutschland uber alles the horst wessel song came hard on its heels lises brief sense of peace had shattered well before she heard the second national anthem there hadnt been a mistake at the radio station something had gone wrong badly wrong somewhere in the wider world the horst wessel song ended after another stretch of silence a mans voice came on the air the following important statement comes to you from the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich what the devil is the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reichlise wondered shed never heard of it the government had nine million different committees and bureaus and commissions so she didnt know how much that proved but if it wasnt important what was it doing on the air like this the fuhrer heinz buckliger has been taken ill on the island of hvar the man said as a result of this illness he no longer has the capacity to rule our beloved reich under such emergency conditions the state committee will administer affairs lise frowned that sounded likebut it couldnt be nobody since the night of the long knives more than seventyfive years earlier had tried to seize power like this the announcer went on we address you at a great and critical hour for the future of the vaterland and of our volk a mortal danger now looms large over our great vaterland the policy of socalled reforms launched at heinz buckligers initiative and allegedly designed to ensure the reich s dynamic development has in fact gone down a blind alley this is the result of deliberate actions on the part of those who trample on the laws of the greater german reich so they can stage an unconstitutional putsch and gather all personal power into their hands millions of people now demand stern measures against this gross illegality du lieber gott lise exclaimed whoever was on the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich they really meant it by order of the state committee citizens of the reich are to remain calm the announcer saidand if that wasnt a command designed to spread panic she didnt know what would be the fellow continued the holding of meetings street processions demonstrations and strikes isverboten in case of need a curfew and military patrols will be imposed important government and economic installations will be placed under guard by the ss which remains loyal to the ideals of the state even in this time of corruption ahalise thought now she could make a good guess about who was behind the committee and the putsch decisive measures will be taken to stop the spreading of subversive rumors actions that threaten the disruption of law and order and the creation of tension and disobedience to the authorities responsible for implementing the state of emergency what did the announcer feel about the words in front of him was he for the putsch did he hate it he read like a machine droning on mechanically control will be established over all radio and televisor stations now serving as interim fuhrer of the reich and of the germanic empire is odilo globocnik who lise had heard no more of him than she had of the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich his name hardly even sounded german who has previously served the state as high commissioner for ostland affairs hed been in charge of slaughtering slavs in other words and now they were bringing his talents to the reich itself lise shivered the difference between bad and worse was much bigger than the difference between good and better much much bigger xiv ceiling speakers in oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters carried the announcement of heinz buckligers incapacity moments after heinrich and willi sat down at their desks decisive measures will be taken to stop the spreading of subversive rumors actions that threaten the disruption of law and order and the creation of tension and disobedience to the authorities responsible for implementing the state of emergency control will be established over all radio and televisor stations now serving as interim fuhrer of the reich and of the germanic empire is odilo globocnik who has previously served the state as high commissioner for ostland affairs after the announcement deutschland uber alles and the horst wessel song rang out again heinrich looked at willi willi looked back at heinrich its an ssputsch heinrich said willi nodded it sure as hell is he agreed and then he said odilo fucking globocnik in tones of absolute disbelief be careful willi ilse exclaimed if you talk like that who knows what kind of trouble youll end up in in times like these that might have been excellent advice but willi only shook his head odilo fucking globocnik he repeated even more amazed and disgusted than before over the patriotic music blaring out of the intercom heinrich said hes prutzmanns puppet he cant be anything else well i should hope not willi said hes certainly nothing by himself didnt he get in trouble for driving drunk a while ago beats me heinrich said i dont remember hearing that but you could be right i think so but im not sure willi said who the hell pays attention to the odilo globocniks of the world running feet in the corridor before heinrich could respond to his friends bon mot someonea soldierstuck his head in the room and called globocniks on the televisor theyve got it on in the canteen the man didnt wait but thudded down the hall in his jackboots and repeated his message for the next big office come on half a dozen people said the same thing at the same time wheels squeaked as analysts pushed swivel chairs back from desks a few stolid people went right on working the rest heinrich and willi among them swarmed out of the room and toward the canteen so many menand a few womenwere going that way something not far from a rugby scrum broke out in the corridor heinrich took an elbow or two and gave out a couple of his own he squeezed into the canteen just in time to hear somebody yell shut up which made the clamor from the people already crowding the room drop a little because heinrich was ten or twelve centimeters taller than most people he got a good look at the televisor screen even though he couldnt get close to it odilo globocnik wasnt in the fuhrer s office in the palace across the square from oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters or in the even more magnificent study in the reichskanzellerei he spoke from a studio that could have been anywhere and globocnik himself was as unimpressive as his surroundings he was in his fifties and had the face of a street bruiser whod gone to fat his eyes and his short nose were both redstreaked heinrich would have bet that willi was right and he did drink probably a lot hed jammed his uniform cap down low on his forehead perhaps to keep the bright studio lights out of those watery eyes he was reading from a text on a lectern in front of him very obviously and not very well we will uh restore law and order we will check antiparty tendencies at home and abroad we will stamp out nationalist uh adventurism his voice was a gravelly croak his big soft jowls wobbled as he spoke when he reached up to turn a page on his speech his plump beringed hand shook was he stumbling over the speech because he was a stupid lout or because hed had a snootful before he got in front of the cameraor maybe both how much did any of that matter though in the background out of focus and only half visible but instantly recognizable all the same sat lothar prutzmann the reichsfuhrer ss might choose to rule through a puppet but he was bound to be the power behind the putsch and what could anybody else do about it nothingwas the only answer that occurred to heinrich whod just got out of the clutches of the security police but then someone in the crowded canteen said this is the national channel whats on the berlin channel the buzz that rose from that made it hard to hear what odilo globocnik was sayingnot that missing his speech meant missing much will stolle let them get away with this somebody asked can stolle do anything to stop it somebody else came back if he cant nobody can two people said that awehrmacht colonel no less turned the dial on the televisor set on the berlin channel a frightenedlooking man sat on what looked like a quizshow set he was saying not know how long you will be able to hear memeine damen und herren armed men claiming to be from the security police have come to this studio our guards refusing to let them in they opened fire there have been casualties on both sides we have asked for help from the berlin city police but we do not know if it will come or if it will be enough we the wehrmacht colonels voice rang out sauer ja herr oberst someonepresumably sauersaid get two companies of men to that studio on the double they are to hold it at all costs they will be reinforced if necessary do you understand me jawohl herr oberst sauer started shoving his way out of the canteen let me through the crowd parted for him like the red sea for moses a telephone rang behind the man on the set he didnt look like an announcer he looked like a director suddenly in front of the camera instead of behind it when the bell sounded he jumped he grabbed the phone listened saidja a couple of times and hung up he started talking even before he turned back toward his audience meine damen und herrenthat was rolf stolle the gauleiter of berlin he calls the arrestthat is what he terms it the arrestof the fuhrer illegal and says globocnik and prutzmann and the forces of darknessso he calls themfear elections and the exposure of the truth and he disappeared there was rolf stolle himself his shaved head gleaming as he glared out of the televisor set am i on he rasped and then volkof the reich anyone who can hear me listen and listen good this is an ssputsch nothing else but if you stand up against it it will come to pieces right in front of your noses if they dont shoot me ill kick em right in the teeth dont let the bastards pull the wool over your eyes the way theyve been doing for years they when his angry face vanished from the screen everyone in the canteen groaned but the feed didnt turn into predigested pap or a smiling ss announcer explaining that everything was fine it went back to that harriedlooking man in the berlin stations studio he said weve lost our transmission from the gauleiter s residence i dont know whether it has just been cut off or they are under attack there i the phone behind him rang again he jumped again too and snatched the handset off the cradle when he hung up this time he looked relieved that was rolf stolle he is still free he a cheer rang out drowning his next few words heinrich joined it he pumped his fist in the air willi dorsch pounded him on the back wants you to come to the square in front of his residence stolles amateur spokesman said when heinrich could next hear him over the din how can the ss cut him down when all berlin is watching it may be dangerous but heinrich waited to hear no more than that he turned around and started swimming upstream against the throngs still battling to get into the cafeteria where are you going willi asked him to stolles residence werent you listening heinrich answered after what prutzmanns bully boys just did to me you think im going to let them screw the reich too if i can do anything to stop em the reich would be worse off with the ss in charge than with heinz buckliger yes jews he had no doubt would be disastrously worse off but his being a jew played only a small part in this as hed said it was personal he didnt look behind him suddenly though he had help breasting the crowd im with you willi said when esther stutzman turned the key to the outer door and walked into the waiting room the radio in dr dambachs office was blaring out patriotic marches she scratched her head the pediatrician didnt usually listen to that kind of music he wanted something soft and calm in the office something that might soothe both a crying baby and a worried mother dr dambach esther called he must not have heard her over the thump of drums and the bronze clangor of bugles then the march ended and an announcer said now here is reichsfuhrer ss lothar prutzmann to explain the goals of the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich dr dambach esther called again her voice this time rising in astonishment what on earth had happened while she was coming to work now her boss heard her come in here and listen to this he said i think theyve gone right off the deep end it sounded that way to esther too she hardly remembered to close the door behind her before hurrying into dr dambachs inner office in a surprisingly high thin voice prutzmann was saying obvious symptoms of overwork and stress necessitated the fuhrer s stepping down for reasons of health odilo globocnik our interim fuhrer has already shown that he is fully up to the demands of the position what the esther said dambach just pointed at the radio and mouthedlisten we have already outlined the prohibitions necessary for the success of the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich the reichsfuhrer ss brought out the cumbersome name without a bobble he might have been mulling it over in his mind for a long long time before pronouncing it in public he went on now we must set forth the goals for which we struggle first we shall roll back the antigermanic antistate measures herr buckliger was unwise enough to introduce aryan supremacy must always be the primary objective of the greater german reich we struggle for the richness and variety of the aryans life in peacetime we struggle for mans right to kultur this is the basis of the new social order in europe the capable individual must be able to occupy by his efforts the place for which he is fitted and we struggle for the final solution to the question regarding the workers standing in the reich the path leading the worker to a secure existence has already been trodden german workers are no longer proletarians they have a legal claim to work an adequate wage medical care and pensions all this the socalled reforms of the buckliger regime have threatened but we dutybound to the highest concept of aryan blood and honor have rescued the state from his clutches order will soon be fully restored so long as you obey thank you and good morningheil globocnik the patriotic marches resumed as loud and bombastic as before with a gesture of disgust dr dambach turned the radio way down isnt that a fine kettle of fishfrau stutzman he said they blather about law and order but whats their blathering worth i respect law and order they dont they throw such things over the side as soon as itstheir ox being gored pah for a moment esther thought he would spit on the carpet everything was fine when i left the house this morning esther said still dazed or i thought it was anyhow well it isnt fine now dambach said heaven only knows when itll be fine again talk about your hypocrites and whited sepulchers he made as if to spit again and again seemed barely able to check himself what do you mean esther asked dont you recall dr dambach said in surprise the whole business with the kleins and how they escaped the suspicion of being jews after they had that poor baby with taysachs disease of course i remember that they ended up being set free esther answered didnt that nasty man from the reichs genealogical office say they got away because lothar prutzmanns niece had also had a taysachs baby maximilian ebert a nasty man indeed dambachs round face was roundly disapproving but you seem to miss the point or at least part of the point what is the most likely explanation for the fact that prutzmanns niece had a baby with taysachs im very sorry doctor but youre righti think i am missing the point esther said the pediatrician clucked reproachfully the most likely explanation for the fact that lothar prutzmanns niece had a baby with taysachs diseasenot the only explanation mind you but the most likely oneis that there is in fact jewish blood in prutzmanns family jews are the most common carriers of the diseaseand who would have a better chance of concealing such an unfortunate pedigree than the reichsfuhrer ssyesfrau stutzman you may well look horrified i dont blame you a bit esther hadnt known she looked horrified but she supposed she might have she remembered the hidden jew the practicing jew in the ss whod helped heinrich escape he wasnt one of the little group of which she was a part walther hadnt been able to identify him for sure even after tapping into ss records whoever he was though hed preserved his identity lothar prutzmann might have had jewish ancestors but he was no jew dr dambach rammed that point home nothing but a damned hypocriteexcuse me pleaseas i told you before dutybound to the highest conception of aryan blood and honor the reichsfuhrer ss claimed when the odds are he is not fully of aryan blood himself tell mefrau stutzman where is the honor in a lie idont see it either esther said her boss nodded why not shed agreed with him if that didnt make her a clear thinker what would she went on do you mind if i call my husband from here dr dambach id like to meet him for lunch go right ahead dambach answered but would you be kind enough to put the coffee on first i really would like some but i held off on making it till you got here you always have better luck with the machine than i do its not luck its following the bloody directions but esther said ill take care of it right away a putsch might have overthrown the fuhrer but dr dambach messing with the coffee machine would have been a real catastrophe susanna weiss hand shook as she dialed the telephone she had both the radio and the televisor going full blast lothar prutzmann talked about duty and aryan blood on the radio odilo globocnik was speaking on the televisorrambling rather and not making a whole lot of sense if he wasnt drunk he could have made money doing impressions of someone who was the telephone rangonce twice three times then a woman picked it up department of germanic languages guten morgenrosa susanna said to professor oppenhoffs secretary this is professor weiss will you please post a notice in my classes that i wont be in today yes of coursefraulein doktor professor rosa answered now that were finally rid of that stinking buckliger a lot of people are celebrating im sure they are susanna said and hung up in a hurry now she knew what sort of politics the department chairmans secretary had she wished she didnt though it wasnt really a surprise professor oppenhoff himself was probably out in a bierstube downing a couple of seidels and smoking one of his smelly cigars and singing along to the asinine lyrics of the horst wessel song she switched the televisor to the berlin channel there was rolf stolle staring out of the screen sweaty and disheveled and furious if you can still see me the thieving bastards in the ss havent won yet he growled they think they can get away with dirty deeds done in the dark of night like they have for so longi think theyre full of shit i think the reich has seen enough of that to last it forever i think its seen too goddamn much and i think the volk are going to show lothar prutzmann what they think of him and of his lousy henchmen if you think the same way come and join medeutschland erwache ice ran down susannas spinegermany awake had been a nazi slogan years before the party took power to hear it thrown in the face of the reichsfuhrer ssto hear it thrown in lothar prutzmanns face made susannas mind up for her she turned off the televisor and hurried out of her flat it was a lovely day puffy white clouds floated across the blue sky a blackbird chirped in a linden tree yellow beak open wide to let out the music the breeze which came out of the west brought the clean smell of grass and flowers and other growing things from the tiergarten only a few blocks away rolf stolles residence wasnt far either easy walking distance the gauleiter of berlin had stayed in the same old downtown building long after the national government and party apparatus took up their quarters in the grandiose structures hitler had run up one after another to celebrate his triumphs national officials might have been telling the berlinersyoure not important enough to come along with us the nazis had always distrusted and looked down on freethinking leftleaning berlin and now at long long last the berliners had a chancea slim chance maybe only a ghost of a chance but a chanceto pay them back on that slim chance susanna hurried toward the gauleiter s residence her heels clicked out a quick rhythm on the slates of the sidewalk she didnt see unusual numbers of soldiers or ss men or for that matter berlin policemen on the streets most of the shops were open a lot of them had televisors gabbling away some were tuned to the national channels othersa surprising numbershowed rolf stolle who went on bellowing defiance at the world deutschland erwache a young man shouted from a side street cheers answered him susanna wished rosa could have heard themmaybe only a ghost of a chance but a chance she thought and walked faster her shoes started to pinch she should have chosen a more comfortable pair her shoulders straightened she wasnt going back now when she rounded a corner a couple of blocks from stolles residence she stopped in her tracks ahead was nothing but a sea of people no not quite nothing but theyd made barricades of trash cans and benches and planters and whatever else they could get their hands on men and women scrambled over them and shakily perched on top how much good would they do against panzers susanna feared she knew the answer to that but the very fact that the berliners had dared to run them up heartened her flags fluttered over the crowd most were the usual national banners the black swastika on a white disk in a red field but just as shed got chills seeing pictures of vanished czechoslovakias flag flying in prague so she did here once more a few of the banners waving around rolf stolles residence showed the black red and gold of the weimar republic which had been extinct even longer than the czechoslovak state if people dared showthat flag in public maybe there really was hope she worked her way up the street and into the square that faced the residence it took patience and the occasional shove everybody was trying to get closer to rolf stolle to hear him if he came out to protect him if the ss came after him feeling like a chamois or some other nimble creature of the alps she scrambled over an overturned trash can it shook only a little under her feet instead of garbage it held dirt and stones and chunks of concrete to make it harder to move theyd also give people ammunition of sorts if the ss did come rocks against panzersthe mere idea was enough to make her wobbly when she stumbled a fellow in a bus drivers uniform steadied her thanks she said youre welcome his grin showed crooked teeth and vast excitement this is fun isnt it telling the bonzen to go stuff themselves its susanna had been about to deliver a brilliant offthecuff lecture on how important this moment was for the future of the reich and the volk she found herself grinning back instead yes by god itis fun we should have done it a long time ago the bus drivers shinybrimmed cap bobbed up and down as he nodded televisor cameras on rooftops peered down at the crowd did they belong to the berlin station or was lothar prutzmann gathering evidence for later revenge for that matter why hadnt the ss knocked the berlin station off the air by now maybe the blackshirts werent as efficient as they wanted everybody to believe some people waved to the cameras others aimed obscene gestures at them somewhere not far away a raucous shout rang out all the world is watching all the world is watching it rose like the tide all the world is watching all the world is watching susanna joined in hardly even realizing she was doing it she hoped it was true itcould be other stations in the reich and beyond it could be picking up the berlin broadcasts and retransmitting them they couldif they had the nerve what was going on outside of berlin susanna had no idea whatever it was how much would it matter not much she suspected one way or the other history would be made right here someone stepped on her foot he said sorry lady so he probably hadnt done it on purpose she pressed on after a while she got what would have been a pretty good view of stolles balconyif a beanpole in a black leather trenchcoat hadnt been standing right in front of her she hadnt got as far as she had in life by being shy she poked him in the small of the back and said excuse me please but could you move to one side or the other the beanpole turned around he wore an irritated expressionwhich dissolved a moment later susanna what are you doing here committing treason just like you if things dont go our way heinrich gimpel grimaced well yes there is that but sometimes you have to try eh ive always thought so susanna fit her words into pauses in the all the world is watching chant heinrich on the other hand had always believed in staying under a flat rock amazing what even a short stretch in the hands of the blackshirts could do he patted the back of the man next to him who was almost his height and wore an identical greatcoat youve met my friend willi dorsch havent you oh yes i certainly have susanna said as dorschwho looked as aryan as an overfed ss manturned and nodded to her she couldnt resist asking and how is your wife by heinrichs horrified expression he wished she would have kept quiet well too late now shed never been as cautious as he was willi dorsch winced dammit i had nothing to do with that he said which from everything heinrich had told susanna was true willi went on i just wish it hadnt happened we all wish it hadnt happened even erika from everything heinrich had said that was true too if susanna did any more prodding she might start more trouble than she wanted no point to pushing anyhow not when shed got the needle under willis skin and then even if shed wanted to she lost the chance to add anything more for a great roar from the crowd would have drowned out whatever she said theres stolle heinrich shouted he could see over most of the people in front of him susanna couldnt even see over him and willi dorsch she had to take his word for it that the gauleiter of berlin had come out onto his little balcony showing himself took nerve the ss was bound to have assassins in the crowd you are the volk rolf stolle boomed through a microphone you are the aryans you are the people who would have chosen your own leaders if loathsome lothar prutzmann hadnt hijacked an election he didnt think his cronies could win but do you know what a perfectly timed pause youre going to win anywayweregoing to win anywayand there wont be enough lampposts to hang all those blackshirted pigdogs on jaaaaaa an enormous ecstatic almost orgasmic cry rose from the crowd susanna screamed her lungs out just like everybody around her even staid heinrich part of her thought they were all out of their minds the rest though wondered whether lothar prutzmann had even the faintest idea how big a monster hed called into being the tiergarten was quiet and peaceful no one in the park seemed to know or care that the ss had staged a putsch that morning esther stutzman wondered whether such normality showed that nobody gave a damn or simply that it was a nice summers day and strolling with an arm around your girlfriends waist or lolling on the grass in the sun counted for more than whose fundament rested on the chair behind the desk in the main office of the fuhrer s palace were the people in the park too apathetic to care about the putsch or too sane did the difference matter here came walther hurrying past a juggler keeping a stream of brightly colored balls in the air and an upsidedown hat on the ground in front of him for spare change past a hooded crow and a red squirrel screeching at each other over a discarded crust of bread and past a couple on the grass whod almost forgotten anyone else was around esther got up from her bench walther gave her a quick kiss lord im glad to have an excuse to get away he exclaimed the zeiss works are going nuts that bad she asked worse he told her about one man in five is all for prutzmann and the ss more i think are against them but when the two sides start screaming at each other theres another whole big lot who wish theyd both shut up and go away i wouldnt be surprised if the whole countrys like that esther said neither would i walther said so whats going on i know something must be from the way you sounded on the phone dr dambach was talking this morning talking about lothar prutzmann and his family esther went on to explain what the pediatrician had said then she asked do you think we can do anything with that i dont know walther looked half intrigued half appalled do you think weshould do anything with it im not sure i was hoping you would be esthers hand folded into frustrated fists if we dont and if the ss takes over but prutzmanns liable to win whether we do that or not walther said and if he doesor maybe even if he doesntusing its liable to putus in more danger every word he said was true esther knew as much walther was nothing if not sensible all the same she said if we dont do anything if we dont even try to do anything what good are we we might as well not be here what difference would it make if they had wiped us out i havent got a good answer for that her husband said slowly about as close as i can come is if we do try to do something wed better pick our spots with care because we wont get many of them is this one is buckliger that important are you sure before esther could answer the traffic noise around the tiergarten changed it was always there in the background the only real reminder that the park lay in the middle of a great city but suddenly it leaped from background to foreground esther had never heard such a deepthroated roar of diesel engines and rattling of treads not even at a construction site she turned her head through the screen of bushes she saw a column of panzers and armored personnel carriers purposefully pushing eastward in the direction of rolf stolles residence the breeze shiftedor maybe the armored column made its own breeze the harsh stink of diesel fumes suddenly clashed with the tiergartens green growing smells the panzers rumbled past and were gone esther turned to walther raw terror on her face to her surprise he leaned forward and kissed her on the lips almost as if he were one of the pair of lovers not far away who hadnt even looked up as the deadly machines went by well sweetheart you were right he said sometimes you have to try he got to his feet and hurried away off toward the zeiss works off toward trouble esther stared after him hoping shed done the right thing fearing shed just made the worst mistake of her life the crowd in the square outside rolf stolles residence was for the most part orderly and wellmannered heinrich would have been surprised if it had been otherwise it was a crowd full of germans after all people shared cigarettes and whatever bits of food they happened to have the gauleiter threw the ground floor of the residence open to the throng two neat bathroom queues one for men and one for women formed seemingly of themselves every so often a chant of all the world is watching or we are the volk would start up last for a little while and then die away the rooftop cameras kept carrying pictures of the scene to the outside world heinrich hoped they did anyhow by the way the cameramen stayed with them they were still working he hoped so there too the more people who knew berlin wasnt taking lothar prutzmanns putsch lying down the better and then instead of defiant chants cries of alarm rang out from the distant fringes of the crowd panzers the panzers are coming scheissewilli dorsch said which summed up what ran through heinrichs mind some of the men and women whod come to stolles residence decided they wanted no part of facing up to ss armor they pressed away from the panzers and armored personnel carriers growling up the streets others as automatically advanced on the armored vehiclesafter all these years berlin still breeds street fighters heinrich thought in amazement he himself stood irresolute for a long moment susanna surged toward the panzers without the slightest visible hesitation the only thing that surprised heinrich was that she didnt have a molotov cocktail in one hand and a cigarette lighter in the other after standing there for another few seconds he went toward the armor too it didnt feel like bravery desperation was a much stronger part of the mix willi grabbed his arm are you nuts probably heinrich shook free go the other way if youd rather i wont hold it against you scheissewilli said again in doleful tones youre going to get both of us shot or more likely just run over as heinrich had waited before following susanna he waited before following heinrich but follow he did berlin might still breed street fighters but they were amateurs up against professionals the panzers rolled over the barricades the crowd had run up as if they werent there as they crushed the second one a horrible shriek rang out for a moment rising above even the roar of their engines after that the lead panzer had blood on its left track the death might have broken the crowd instead it infuriated the berliners they shook their fists at the blackcoveralled panzer crewmen who rode with their heads and shoulders out of the vehicles murderers they shouted butchers assassinsschweinehunde pulling a bullhorn out of the turret the officer commanding the lead panzer aimed it at the crowd like a weapon disperse he blared disperse in the name of the volk of the greater german reich but that only roused fresh fury among his foes we are the volk they shouted over and over again we are the volk some of them added and who the hell are you they swarmed toward the armored vehicles the driver of the lead machine stopped he could only go forward by crushing scores of people under his treadsor by pulling out his personal weapon and opening fire on the crowd he didnt he was a freshfaced young man probably under twenty and seemed astonished that people werent listening to his superiors orders go home his superior seemed astonished too even with his voice electronically amplified go home and you will not be harmed we are the volk weare the volkwe are the volk the chant swelled and swelled through it individuals shouted insults at lothar prutzmann hes afraid of elections he threw down the fuhrer because he wants the job himself he wants you to murder stolle the same way you just murdered that poor sap at the barricade by then heinrich was up within ten or twelve meters of the lead panzer he could see the frown on the drivers face and the deeper one on the panzer commanders things were not going according to plan the ss men didnt like that at all and didnt seem to know what to do about it and heinrich could also see the panzers two machine guns and the enormous yawning bore of the cannon if the commander ordered a couple of rounds of highexplosive or if he had it grapeshothed clear a path in front of him all right his panzer and the vehicles behind it would wade in gore all the way to rolf stolles residencesome of that gore would be mine too heinrich wondered why he wasnt even more frightenedbecause its too late now he decidedif he does start shooting i cant do anything about it he looked around for susanna he could hear her somewhere not far away but he couldnt see her disperse the panzer commander shouted again through the bullhorn go peacefully to your homes and you will not be harmed in the name of the volk of the greater german reich disperse that was what theyd told him to say before he set out from his barracks and he stubbornly went right on saying it they didnt seem to have told him what to do if it didnt work and it didnt instead of making the people around stolles residence leave it just seemed to make them more stubborn too we are the volk they shouted back ever louder weare the volkwe are the volk the ss officer stared at them his gray eyes wide what was going on in his mind did he understand that what hed been told and what he was seeing and hearing didnt add up how could henot understand heinrich laughed at himself ss men werent trained to understand anything but the brute simplicity of orders but in that case why hadnt this fellow already opened fire did he realize thatwas the volk in front of him heinrich laughed again questions answering questions what else was an analyst good for when these questions got answered it was all too likely to be with blood and iron bismarck could turn a phrase all right meanwhile the tableau held we are the volk heinrich shouted again did the ss officer believe him believe the others he didnt start shooting anyhow weare the volk gustav priepke plopped his fat bottom down on the corner of walthers desk its a goddamn crock thats what it is walthers boss said on a smaller scale he reminded walther a little of rolf stolle it certainly is walther answered hoping priepke would go away if he didnt say much he wasnt supposed to have access to the networks where he needed to plant rumors about lothar prutzmann how could he get at them with priepke staring over his shoulder he couldnt and he knew it odilo globocnik his boss shook his head sounds like a goddamn skin disease and lothar prutzmann lothar prutzmann is a dose of the clap and he aims to give it to the reich uhhuh walther looked at the pictures of esther and gottlieb and anna on the gray fuzzy wall of his cubicle he looked up at the soundabsorbing tiles on the ceiling he looked everywhere but at gustav priepke he agreed with every word priepke said but the longer priepke hung around saying it the less chance he had to try to set things right they say buckligers ill my ass his boss said theyre sick of him thats what i just hope to christ they havent given him a noodle eh uhhuh walther said again and then you know youd better be careful if you keep carrying on like that people are liable to remember gustav priepke slid off the desk like a walrus sliding off an ice floe he said if youre not going to show some balls now goddammit when will you ever or maybe you havent got any to show when walther didnt answer priepke lumbered off shaking his head walther swore softly hed just lost his bosss good opinion but now good opinion or not maybe he could do more than grouse about what was going on maybe if anybody came into his cubicle while he was doing it he was dead that meant he had to work fast if he made a mistake though he was just as dead sweat ran down his face and streamed from his armpits he could smell his own fear just making his fingers hit the right keys was an effort he planted what esther had given him about lothar prutzmanns niece in more than a dozen places in the reich s computer network places where ss officials party big shots and wehrmacht officers were likely to find the news what they would do with it when they found itwell who could say but walther knew hed done what he could covering his tracks went faster than inserting the false dataor were they true data esthers boss seemed to think so walther hardly cared using reports of jewish blood to try to bring down the reichsfuhrer ss struck him as blackly delicious prutzmann couldnt even start a pogrom if the move failedagainst whom would he strike and even if he got all the surviving jews there werent enough left to make a decent pogromsee how you like it one last keystrokeone last checkthere he was free his swivel chair creaked as he leaned back in it hed earned the sigh of relief that burst from him hed not only done what he could do he could relax for about fifteen seconds then a programmer screamed reactionary at the same time as another one yelled radical one of themwalther never knew whichshouted asshole that cut across political lines the meatythock of fist smacking flesh followed a heartbeat later fight fight the cry and the sound of people rushing toward the brawl took walther back to the school playground and the fifth grade he didnt get up he would have gone running then he hoped he was a grownup now not so distant battle made the walls of walthers cubicle shake he stayed right where he was hed just taken worse chances than any of the hotheaded fools punching away at one another if they wanted to waste time on black eyes and bloody noses they could do that but information packed a bigger wallop than even the hardest fist he hoped we are the volk chanted the crowd outside rolf stolles residence and panzers go home and all the world is watching heinrich sang with the rest he was getting hoarse but he kept on he felt more real more alive while he was making noise he also felt there was a better chance the ss armored vehicles wouldnt start shooting if the people in front of them stayed noisy a couple of hours had gone by now and the officer in the lead panzer hadnt opened up yet every so often he would raise the bullhorn to his mouth and order the crowd to disperse no one paid any attention to him hed ducked down into the panzer turret several times probably to use the radio what was he telling his superiors what were they telling him how much of what they were telling him was he heeding wouldnt they be yelling for him to murder everybody in sight all the world is watching heinrich called all the world is watching he hoped the world was watching if it was prutzmanns goons hadnt seized the berlin televisor station the cameras on the rooftops kept on panning over the crowd and the panzers that was a good signwasnt it heinrich he jumped he hadnt seen susanna come back to him hed been watching the lead panzer and the officer standing head and shoulders out of the cupola good panzer officers were supposed to stand like that they could see much more than if they stayed buttoned up inside it also made them much more vulnerable to anything their foes did he dragged his attention back to susanna what is it you should go home she told him youve got a family one person here more or less wont make any difference she made good sense after a moment heinrich shook his head anyway a lot of people here have families if they all left he shook his head again besides now that i am here i want to see how things play out what would lise say susanna asked that was a low blow before he could recover she pointed to the panzers cannon if the shooting starts you wont see anything or not for long neither will you heinrich pointed out i dont see you going anywhere she shrugged im a hothead youre not youre supposed to be too smart to do things like this she sounded almost annoyed at him before he could answer there was a stir in the crowd behind them back toward the doorway to rolf stolles residence the panzer commander was already looking that way when his jaw dropped heinrich decided hed better turn around he did his view wasnt as good as the ss mans but after a moment he froze in astonishment too what is it susanna demanded impatiently you tall people itsits stolle heinrich had to work to bring forth the words hes coming out what susanna exclaimed in horror hes crazy theyll kill him for gods sake somebodys got to stop him she was looking at heinrich as if she expected him to deliver a redcard tackle on the gauleiter of berlin more and more people spied rolf stolle and the squad of grayclad berlin policemen who surrounded him along with them came two photographers one with a leica the other with a small televisor camera on his shoulder some of the people like susanna called out for him to go back into the residence and stay safe but there was a rising cry of rolf rolf rolf as others cheered his courage and there was another cry one heinrich had never dreamt hed hear in berlin and one he gladly joined shouting it out with all his might down with the ss down with the ss beside him willi dorsch was yelling stolles name he paused for a moment to shout into heinrichs ear hes fucking out of his mind but christ hes got balls you ought to take horsts place heinrich yelled back he couldnt have said it better willis smirk said he wasnt sure whether heinrich was joking heinrich noddedhed meant it all right the noise of its hydraulics lost in the tumult the turret of the lead panzer traversed a few degrees so that that cannon and the machine gun beside it bore directly on the advancing rolf stolle but the gauleiter kept coming and the panzer commander didnt open fire instead he raised the bullhorn to his lips herr stolle you are at the center of an illegal and seditious rally one outlawed by the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich dismiss your followers and surrender to duly constituted authority at once rolf stolle didnt have a bullhorn with his big bass voice he hardly needed one not likely sonny boy and if an illegal committee says were illegal that means we deserve a medal far as im concerned a great cheer rose behind his words rolf rolf rolf his name in the crowds mouth sounded like the baying of a pack of hounds were they baying for freedom heinrich didnt know but he shouted rolf along with everybody else stolle pushed through the crowd till he stood alongside the panzer the officer in charge of it had to lean over awkwardly to keep an eye on him the berlin policemen got between the gauleiter and the next panzer farther back they might protect him against its machine guns if its cannon spoke but rolf stolle wasnt thinking about getting shot he aimed to cause the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich as much trouble as he could the still photographer and the televisor cameraman both captured his scornful kick at the panzers iron road wheel if those dont turn into famous photos heinrich began itll be because prutzmann makes sure nobody ever sees them willi said heinrich bit his lip his friend wasnt wrong stolle shook his fist at the panzer officer leaning out of the cupola go back to your barracks he bellowed get the hell out of here using force now is intolerableintolerable i tell you the volk of the reich will not let this illegal tyrannical putsch stand the men who made it have no sense of shame and no sense of honor all proper ss personnel men loyal to the state and not just to the reichsfuhrer ss should show their high sense of racial courage and have nothing to do with this thievery rolf rolf rolf the crowd shouted and down with the ss heinrich got a good look at the panzer officers face the man looked as stunned as if hed just taken a right to the chin whatever hed been looking for when his superiors sent him rolling toward the gauleiter s residence this sure wasnt it his orders were probably simple go over there and arrest stolle or kill him they wouldnt have said anything about thousands of germans and even a couple of hidden jews furiously determined that he do no such thing stolle and a couple of his biggest bodyguards had their heads together the policemen raised him up onto their shoulders so the crowd could see him better they staggered a littlehe was a big man himselfbut they held him the cheers came louder and fiercer than ever stolle waved not just to the crowd but also to the panzer commander it doesnt look like theyre going to shoot your gauleiter right this minute he called rolf rolf rolf the people shouted louder than ever heinrichs ears rang he was yelling too down with the ss down with the ss and then both chants faded and a new one rose driven straight into the face of the lead panzer commander go home go home go home go home if hed looked stunned before he seemed positively poleaxed now he disappeared down into the turret jeers sped him on his way go home go home the cry swelled and swelled inside the panzer there he was bound to be on the radio again what were his distant superiors telling him kill strike destroy now what else could they be saying if they bagged both buckliger and stolle the game was theirs what was he telling them that wasnt so obvious he came out again he still looked as if he didnt know what hit him along with everyone else heinrich poured abuse down on his head then rolf stolle raised his right hand silence rippled outward even to those who couldnt see the gauleiter into it stolle spoke to the panzer officer you have taken your oath to the volk you cannot turn your guns against the volk the days of this putsch are numbered you must not cover the honor of the german soldier with the blood of the volk you must not i tell you his voice burned with terrible urgency you cannot blindly follow the men who made this putsch here in berlin lothar prutzmanns naked grab for power will not prevail the volk will the first edition of mein kampf will and we will stay in the streets till we bring those bandits to justice an avalanche of cheers thundered down on him he grinned and pumped his fist in the air the lead panzer commander or any other ss man whose gun bore on stolle could have ended things then and there but no one opened firenow they know what the people think of them heinrich thoughtthey dont want to be even more hated than they are and that the people could show what they thought and that even ss men might believe it mattered was not the smallest part of heinz buckligers revitalization program all by itself lise gimpel dialed heinrichs number in her ear the phone rang once twice three times someone picked it up oberkommando der wehrmachtanalysis section a womans voice ilse i want to talk to heinrich this is his wife lise said im sorryfrau gimpel but hes not here the secretary answered do you know when hell be back im sorry but i have no idea as soon as we heardwhat had happened he and herr dorsch and some other people uh left the building left the buildingoh lise needed a moment but she figured out what ilse meant theyd headed for rolf stolles residence that had to be it ilse wouldnt come right out and say so though not when the phones were bound to be monitored she might have round heels but she definitely had strong survival instincts thank you lise said both for the information and for the nonincriminating way the secretary had given it to her she hung up survival instinctsshe thought and shook her head shed always believed heinrich had strong ones but if he did why had he gone running to stick his head in the lions mouth at first she was inclined to blame willi a moment later though she shook her head again heinrich hadnt taken willi all that seriouslynot seriously enough to let willi talk him into risking his lifeeven before the trouble with erika the trouble with erikalise saw or thought she did before the blackshirts grabbed heinrich and flung him into prison he never would have done anything so crazy now though hed lain in the hands of the ss maybe he thought anything that might help stop that committee with the silly name was worth doing it will happen just the same with you there or without you lise couldnt shout that to heinrich no matter how much she wanted to hed had an attack of patriotismand wasnt that a strange fit to come over a jew at the beating heart of the third reich was the difference between lothar prutzmann and odilo globocnik on the one hand and heinz buckliger and rolf stolle on the other really so enormous lise wished she hadnt asked herself the question that way the answer looked much too much like yes she turned on the televisor most of the stations were broadcasting reruns of daytime dramas or quiz shows or weepy advice shows every so often words would glide across the bottom of the screenyou are ordered to obey the decrees of the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich the crawl said over and over and over again the berlin channel was different it showed the crowd milling around rolf stolles residence and now the stalled armored vehicles in front of it we are still here a frightenedsounding announcer said over the noise of the crowd i dont know how long we can stay on the air though if we didnt have our own generator we would have been shut down already ss men have come here but our guards turned them back the guards have since been heavily reinforced by wehrmacht troops was that a warning to prutzmann and his henchmen or was it a bluff the announcer seemed nervous enough to make the latter seem a real possibility but then the picture switched to a tape of stolle kicking at a panzers iron tire and bellowing at the ss man leaning out of the turret seeing the gauleiter s nerve made lise willing to forgive the announcers nerves her daughters got home from school just then she thought that would distract her from what was going on downtown but it didnt they were more excited about it than she was francesca said frau koch says we have to do what the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich tells us and odilo globocnik is the new fuhrer odilo globocnik roxane echoed teacher made us learn how to say it us too francesca said the beast made us memorize his name and state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich and anybody who couldnt do it got a swat i did it shes not going to hitme again she spoke with grim determination what does your teacher say lise asked alicia who hadnt spoken yet he made us learn herr globocniks name her eldest answered he said there wasnt any law for a committee like this one but that wouldnt matter if they held on to power he said wed just have to wait and see pretty much hell get in trouble francesca said frau koch says the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich since shed memorized the name she used it every chance she gotis going to pay back everybody who ever liked what the old fuhrer was doing odilo globocnik is the new fuhrer roxane showed off what shed learned too if that state committee wins they may do what frau koch says lise said carefully but alicias teacher has a point they havent won yetgauleiter stolle and lots of people are protesting against what theyve done she didnt say that heinrich was there even if things went sour in front of the gauleiter s residence he might get away safewell he might she insisted to herself aloud she went on theyre on the televisor too do you want to see would you get us snacks first roxane asked that seemed reasonable so lise did then they all went back to the living room the berlin channel was showing the tape of stolle kicking at the panzer again francesca in particular watched wideeyed there was no room for dissent in frau kochs universe seeing that there was or might be in the real world seemed to hearten lises middle daughter alicia asked what are the other stations showing they were just putting on boring reruns i suppose to make people think everything is normal lise answered but we can see what theyre doing now she changed the channel it wasnt a daytime drama any more horst witzleben looked out of the screen at her and her children i have been given the following statement to read he said and i quote he looked down at a paper on his desk rumors relating to the ancestry of the reichsfuhrer ss are false malicious and despicable lies he is of unblemished aryan descent this being so anyone repeating or spreading the false rumors will be subject to the most severe penalties by order of the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich we now return you to your regularly scheduled programming regularly scheduled programming turned out to be a nature film about the migration of storks what did that mean mommy roxane asked im not quite sure lise answered he didnt look very happy about it whatever it was alicia said he didnt sound very happy either youre righthe didnt lise said witzleben had been a cheerleader for heinz buckligers reforms if hed actually been as enthusiastic a cheerleader as hed seemed what had prutzmanns bully boys done to persuade him to speak on their behalf held a gun to his head held a gun to his wifes head there were no doubt all sorts of ways and theyd be the ones to know them she changed channels again the berlin station was still broadcasting the crowd around rolf stolles residence was still there lise shrugged well just have to see what happens thats all let me through somebody with a big voice shouted behind heinrich get out of my way dammit clear a path in your dreams pal willi dorsch said even if they didnt clear a path the man kept on coming using his shoulders and his elbows to force his way forward he was a berlin police officer people did try to move aside for him but in the press of bodies it wasnt easy let me through he yelled again ive got important news for the gauleiter he pushed past heinrich and willi a moment later a woman spoke sharply you might say excuse me for a wonder the policeman actually did say sorry lady then as roughly as ever he went on toward rolf stolle who was still arguing with the commander of the lead panzer was that your friend who called him on his manners willi asked grinning susanna i do believe it was heinrich answered shes got nerve willi said admiringly oh yes that she does there was a stir when the police officer came up to the grayuniformed men guarding the gauleiter of berlin they must have recognized him for they let him through he spoke to stolle for perhaps a minute and a half heinrich wasnt that far away but couldnt hear a word he said he could see stolles reaction though the gauleiter stared his eyes went wide with surprise then to heinrichs amazement he threw back his head and bellowed jovian laughter at the sky what the hell willi said beats me heinrich said that great bellow of mirth had made everybody within a hundred meters turn and look at stolle with a sense of timing an actor might have envied the gauleiter waited for peoples attention to wing his way before shouting up to the panzer commander hey you ss man what do you want the officer in the black coveralls asked warily you know your boss the high and mighty reichsfuhrer ss the chief aryan of all time lothar goddamn prutzmann you know who im talking about rolf stolle waited again he looked as if he could afford to let the moment stretch he also looked as if he was enjoying himself immensely the panzer commander saw that as clearly as heinrich did his nod was a small masterpiece of reluctance i know who youre talking about what about him he didnt use the bullhorn now that was sensible it was even smart but when he went up against rolf stolles leather lungs it didnt do him much good what about him ill tell you what about him you picklefaced son of a bitch stolle boomed in a voice audible all across the square in front of his residence you know what your precious aryan prutzmann is hes a jew thats whatnothing but a lousy kike in a fancy uniform why you lying toad the panzer commander exclaimed shocked out of his reticence as the crowd began to buzz stolle shook his bullet head not me by god what do you ss bastards use for a motto my honor is loyalty thats it well on my honor its the truth its all over the computersand prutzmanns come out and said on the televisor that people arent allowed to talk about it if that doesnt make it true whats likely to here he shoved the newly arrived police officer forward tell him norbert norbert told the same story the gauleiter had in a higher thinner voice but with more details beside heinrich willi dorsch listened with his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open he had to shake himself to turn back to heinrich that cant be true can it but if its a lie its a lie that goes right for the throat and if its a lie why would prutzmann deny it like that sounds like panic and what would make him panic like the truth beats me heinrich started to quote hitler about the big lie but checked himself he remembered how the kleins had got released after they were seized one of prutzmanns relatives had had a baby with the same horrible disease as theirs maybe that was a coincidence or maybe the reichsfuhrer ss really did have jews in his woodpile and his enemies were seizing on it where was susanna there only a few meters away she was looking back toward him as he was looking for her when their eyes met he saw her thoughts were going in the same direction as his lothar prutzmann certainly wasnt a jew in any meaningful sense of the word but wouldnt it be luscious if the reichsfuhrer ss came to grief because people thought he was the panzer commander disappeared down into the turret once more no doubt to get on the radio yet again heinrich would have given a good deal to be a fly sitting on the breech of the cannon in there no such luck whatever the officer said no one else but his fellow panzer crewmen heard it he didnt emerge for some little while when he did his troubled features proclaimed that he didnt like much of what hed heard even so he raised the bullhorn to his lips once more gamely he said achtungwhat the gauleiter says is nothing but a pack of lies anyone saying such things about the reichsfuhrer ss makes himself liable to severe punishment you have been warned rolf stolle laughed again yes you have been warnedvolk of the reich he called mockery dancing on his voice and what have you got to say about that he waited so did heinrich would the people dare after theyd been warned not to by men with guns they dared prutzmann is a kike somebody yelled and in an instant the whole crowd was chanting it prutzmann is a kike prutzmann is a kike heinrich shouted it too as loud as anybody prutzmann is a kike prutzmann is a kike he looked over to susanna again she was shouting the same thing her hands cupped in front of her mouth when their eyes met this time they both started to laugh they went right on chanting though heinrich had never imagined antisemitic slogans could be so much fun prutzmann is a kike prutzmann is a kike with her mother and sisters alicia watched the crowd in front of rolf stolles residence from the safety of her suburban living room the panzers in the televisor screen looked like toys though she knew they were real kike kike roxane chortled gleefully the word was almost a joke to her she didnt know that shed ever seen a jew let alone that she was one neither did francesca i wonder what the beast will tell us aboutthis she said she was going on and on about how wonderful the reichsfuhrer ss was and how brave and how patriotic if hes really a dirty jew dirty jew dirty jew roxane didnt seem to care what she shouted as long as she could make noise alicia didnt say anything she didnt know what to say she sneaked a glance at mommy only to find her mother looking as confused as she was everything seemed not just upside down but dropped on its head alicia didnt know why rolf stolle and his followers thought prutzmann was a jew why hardly seemed to matter of all the things they could call the head of the ss none struck a harder blow against him alicia understood that she also understood that the reichsfuhrer ss was against all the changes the new fuhrer had made did that mean using this weapon against him was all right she didnt know that wasnt so easy to figure out over the noise of the crowd the announcer for the berlin station spoke in a high excited voice british prime minister charles lynton calls on the men who made the putsch to end their lawless behavior at once and release the rightful fuhrer heinz buckliger he is joined in this call by the leaders of norway denmark sweden and finland the premier of france also agrees in principle can they do that francesca asked in astonishment the states that made up the germanic empire didnt talk back to the reich that was a law of nature neither did its little allies not talking back kept them from getting swallowed up it means they think whats going on here is really really wrong alicia said mommy nodded thats what it means all right and theyre braver than they used to be because the new fuhrer made them freer than they used to be holland has joined in the call for the rightful fuhrer s release andeven on this day of one astonishing surprise after another the announcers voice rose to a startled squeakin prague a czech organization called unity has declared the independence of the protectorate of bohemia and moravia from what it terms the illegal immoral and illegitimate government of odilo globocnik and lothar prutzmann oh my mommy said that will mean more trouble after they get this trouble settled if they do get it settled whens daddy coming home roxane asked that question had also crossed alicias mind she thought shed got a glimpse of himand maybe even of aunt susannanear the panzer closest to rolf stolles residence but she hadnt been sure and the camera had panned away before she could say anything pumpkin i dont know mommy answered he went to the square there on the televisor this morning getting there was easy then getting away is liable to be harder im not even sure theyre letting people leave alicia didnt like the sound of that she tried not to show how worried she was she had to stay strong to help mommy keep her younger sisters from getting upset all she could do was wait and watch the televisor nobodys done any shooting here her mother said as long as it stays like that everythings all right and then suddenly the berlin station announcers voice rose not in surprise but in anger and alarm and fear we are under attack i say again we are under attack there are ss troops outside this building and they are assaulting it as i speak they want to cut the volk off from the truth and there were banging noises and shouts and what might have been gunshots then the screen went blank alicia and her mother exclaimed in dismay francesca and roxane were too little to know what that static and those swirling grays meant as far as alicia was concerned they meant the end of hope change the channel francesca said wait mommy said i want to see what comes on next what came on next after three or four minutes of hisses and scratchy noises that made alicia wish mommy would change the channel was a test pattern francesca and alicia groaned the test pattern lasted longer than the static had alicias patience was wearing very thin when it finally disappeared horst witzlebens grim face replaced it the newscaster said the illegal and unauthorized broadcasts formerly coming from this station have now ceased the public is urged and instructed to disregard them and to ignore the slanderous insults aimed at the reichsfuhrer ss regular programming will now resume here and factual bulletins will be issued as necessary good evening regular programming turned out to be a rerun of a game show alicia looked at her mother shaking her head mommy got up and turned off the televisor xv heinrich gimpel had yelled down with the ss and we are the volk and all the world is watching and prutzmann is a kike all day long he was tired and hungry some sandwiches and fruit had got to the crowd but none had got to him the sss armored vehicles hadnt opened fire but they hadnt left either they showed no sign of leaving nor was he sure they would let himor anyone elsego the officer commanding the lead panzer had stayed down inside the turret for a while now he came out again bullhorn in hand yell as loud as you please he blared no one will hear you no one will care your pirate televisor station is in the hands of the state committee liar people shouted they shouted worse things than that too the panzer commander let the abuse wash over him as if it didnt matter more than anything else that convinced heinrich he was probably telling the truth if hed got angry or defensive he might have been bluffing as things were he seemed to thinksticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me and all the sticks and stones here were on his side the crowd in front of the gauleiter s residence had only words still stubborn rolf stolle boomed you dont dare let what you do see the light of day if you were honest you would have started shooting while the cameras were rolling beside heinrich willi nervously shifted from foot to foot i wish he wouldnt say things like that dammit hell give the bastard ideas hes got ideas already he has to heinrich answered dont you think theyve been screaming in his ear to open up for hours he hasnt done it yet stolles working on his conscience son of a bitch is an ss man willi said he had it surgically removed just like the rest of them ha heinrich said a mournful attempt at a laugh many a true word was spoken in jest he wished willi hadnt spoken these they felt altogether too true slowly slowly the sun sank toward the northwest berlin wasnt far enough north to get white nights in summer nights where twilight never turned to real darkness but sunset came late and darkness didnt last long all the same heinrich feared it would last long enough to mask dark deeds he looked around for susanna when he spied her their eyes met she smiled and waved weve both chosen our spot she said i think its a good one a good one to get killed inheinrich thought but maybe that was part of what susanna had meant she got passionately devoted to causesand if you werent passionately devoted to being a jew these days you werent a jew at all even so heinrich wanted to live he had another generation at home to worry about susanna hadnt been lucky enough to hook up with anyone with whom she got along looking for hope he pointed up to the rooftop televisor cameras theyre still filming even if the signal isnt going out the fear that people might see it one of these days may do for a conscience where nothing else will susanna nodded heres hoping beside heinrich willi said that should last us for another hour maybe even another hour and a half but what happens when it gets dark heinrich eyed the setting sun he almost said something about joshua and making the sun stand still at the last minute though he didnt not too long after he said something biblical to erika hed ended up in one of lothar prutzmanns prisons he didnt think willi would accuse him of being a jew all the same prison would be one of the better things that might happen to him if things went wrong here joshua he was not in due course the sun sank below the horizon twilight began to deepen shadows spread and lost their sharpness faces farther away grew dim and indistinct venus blazed low in the western sky above it saturn was dimmer and yellowerand that ruddy star between them had to be mars heinrich almost wished he hadnt recognized it tonight he wanted nothing to do with the god of war lights on rolf stolles residence were bright but not bright enough to illuminate the square in front of it after the sun went down the panzers and armored personnel carriers turned on their lights that though heinrich knew was not for the benefit of the crowd confronting them their crews wouldnt want anybody to sneak up with a molotov cocktail or a grenade in the dark and then off in the distance but swelling rapidly heinrich heard one of the sounds hed listened for and dreaded all day long the rumbling snarl of more diesel engines heading toward the gauleiter s residence he wasnt the only one who heard them a low murmur of alarm ran through the crowd willi dorsch managed a creditable chuckle i dont know what were worrying about he said theyve already got enough firepower here to massacre the lot of us you always did know how to cheer me up when i was feeling low heinrich answered and willi laughed out loud the officer in charge of the lead panzer raised his bullhorn and aimed it at rolf stolle its all over now you can see its all over surrender to me and ill make sure they dont shoot you by mistake you can take your by mistake fold it till its all corners and shove it right on up your ass sonny boy the gauleiter of berlin shouted if you want me if prutzmann wants me youll have to kill me on account of im damned if youll take me alive and give me a show trial buckliger let himself get caught the poor sorry son of a bitch to hell with me if i intend to hes got balls willi said admiringly i know heinrich said but if they take him out theyll take out everybody whos here with him he had to raise his voice to make himself heard over the engine noise and clanking clattering treads of the approaching armored vehicles willi gave an airy shrug as if to sayeasy come easy go heinrich clapped him on the back he regretted being here less than hed thought he would susanna was right this was a good place to stand down the peopleclogged street farther away from the gauleiter s residence jeers and hisses and derisive whistles rang out as the new contingent of armored fighting vehicles came into sight if a hothead in the crowd had an assault rifle and opened up on the panzers from sheer frustration that could touch off a massacre damn near anything could touch off a massacre now and heinrich knew it only too well iam sorry about erika willi said suddenly as if he too was thinking this was the end and some things should not go unspoken tears stung heinrichs eyes he nodded its all right he said dont worry about it and then the noises from down the street changed as if by magic boos and curses were transmuted into wild even frantic cheers heinrichs head which had been hanging on his chest came up like a dogs when it took an unexpected scent so did willis so did susannas they all leaned toward the startling new noise heinrich willed words to come through the mad joy its the more cheers drowned whatever the key word was its not the frustrated again heinrich swore and kicked at the paving slates but the third time was the charm its not the goddamn waffen ss its the wehrmachtand theyre on our side heinrich threw back his head and howled like a wolf a crazy grin on his face he grabbed willis hand and pumped his whole arm up and down as if he were jacking up a car he shoved through the crowd toward susanna she was coming toward him too laughing and crying at the same time they squeezed each other he was forty centimeters taller than she was he had to bend down a long way to give her a kissand he did susanna only half remembered actually clambering up onto this panzer it hadnt been more than fifteen minutes earlier but already it seemed like a mad fever dream the panzer had handholds welded to the turret and the chassis so soldiers could cling to it and ride along but the gray capable engineers whod designed it surely had never dreamt it would clatter through the neon nighttime streets of berlin with as many people aboard as it carried the panzer commander seemed taken aback by the whole business himself he rode head and shoulders out of the cupola and couldnt have been as young as he lookedcould he be careful he shouted over and over again to his unexpected load of passengers if you fall off youll get squashed he was bound to be right about that this panzer was second in a long column rolling from rolf stolles residence toward lothar prutzmanns lair not far from the fuhrer s palace susanna wondered where heinrich had gone he wasnt on this panzer was he riding another one or had his usual prudence come back to life and persuaded him to stay away from places where guns were liable to go off prudence susanna laughed nothing that had happened all this mad day had had even a nodding acquaintance with prudence it wasnt even prudence that had kept the ss men from fighting it out when they found themselves outgunned by the wehrmacht they still could have killed stolle then as they could have killed him a hundred times earlier on but their hearts hadnt been in their orders and so they hadnt started shooting and had given up at the first excuse they got ss men who would have imagined it not prutzmann susanna thought and chuckled evilly here and there in the city she did hear spatters of gunfire but only a few the panzer commander heard them too what are you people going to do when we get where were going he asked plaintively hang the reichsfuhrer ss from a lamppost thats what bawled a burly man near susanna she and the rest of the panzerriders cheered but were liable to have to shoot some of those ss bastards and theyre liable to shoot back the wehrmacht man said whenever the panzer passed under a streetlight the little silver totenkopf on his black coveralls glittered for a moment give us guns that burly man said well shoot em ourselves through more cheers he went on to describe in vivid terms the personal and moral shortcomings of the ss then he nodded to susanna meaning no offense maam it doesnt bother me she said theyre much worse than that the man blinked then grinned enormously susanna grinned back ss men had barricaded the grounds around their brooding headquarters what theyd run up looked much more formidable than the flimsy makeshifts the people of berlin had erected in front of rolf stolles residence but there was no swarming mass of people behind these barricades only prutzmanns allegedubermenschen and as the first panzer stopped and turned its lights on them the ss men looked quite humanly nervous even if they did clutch assault rifles and a few antipanzer rocket launchers the commander of the lead panzer yelled you fuckers open up on us and well slaughter every goddamn one of you well laugh while were doing it too you shot our boys at the televisor station and we owe you plenty you got that he ducked down into the turret the panzers engine began to race and roar the commander reemerged to issue a oneword order he surely hadnt learned in any training school charge his panzer thundered forward it hit a parked truck headon and hurled it out of the way susanna screamed with delight her panzer rumbled through the breach the lead machine had made others followed so did trucks and armored personnel carriers full of wehrmacht soldiers the ss men didnt fire a shot troopers in wehrmacht gray urban camouflage came down from their vehicles and began disarming the men whod made careers of spreading fear and now suddenly discovered there were people who werent afraid of them fear is what they hadsusanna realizedthe wehrmachtalways had more muscle up till now it never used what it had politics held it back but tonight the gloves are off and its nobodys fault but lothar prutzmanns she whooped again the reichsfuhrer ss hadnt known what he was getting into he hadnt known but he was finding out in a hurry prutzmanns office was on the third floor of the ss building right above the monumental entryway anyone who paid attention to the news knew that much the wehrmacht panzer commanders evidently did half a dozen mm cannon rose and swung to point straight at the famous chamber one of the panzer commanders had a bullhorn probably the same model as the ss panzer man had used outside of rolf stolles residence prutzmann he shouted his amplified voice echoing from the granite and concrete and glass come out with your hands up prutzmann we wont kill you if you do youll get a trial and then well kill yoususanna finished mentally hearing lothar prutzmanns unadorned surname blare from the bullhorn was a wonder in itself a wonder and a portenthow the mighty have fallen it said unadorned surnames blared at prisoners in interrogation cells the reichsfuhrer ss had surely never expected such indignities to be his lottoo bad for him no answer came from the famous office the lights were on in there but closed venetian blinds kept susanna from seeing inside dont screw around with us prutzmann the wehrmacht commander shouted you have five minutes if you dont come out well come in after you youll like that a lot less i promise susanna looked at her watch only to discover shed somehow lost it she shrugged five minutes wouldnt be hard to figure out all the civilians on the panzer with herand on the other wehrmacht machinesshouted and cursed the reichsfuhrer ss between their cries including her own and the rumble of the panzers engines whatever was happening more than a few meters away got drowned out the deadline had to be drawing near the man commanding susannas panzer leaned down into the turret presumably to give the gunner his orders the commander had just straightened when a tall blond man in the uniform of a security police major came out with a handkerchief tied to a pointer to make a flag of truce dont shoot he shouted why not said the commander of the lead panzer why the hell not you ssschweinehund wheres prutzmann hes the one we want hes dead the blond security police major answered he stuck a pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger didnt you hear the bang a frantic tumult of cheering rose from the civilians through it the lead panzer commander used the bullhorn to say show me the body till i see the body i figure this is some sort of scheme to buy time for him to get away the blond major started to go back into the building the panzer commander stopped him hold it right there buddy if they dont bring prutzmanns body outyoure the one whos dead meat have it your way the major said you will anyhow he turned and shouted back into ss headquarters hansjoachim detlef bring him out they want to see him noxious diesel fumes from the idling panzer made susanna cough a dull headache pounded behind her eyes it all put her in mind of professor oppenhoffs cigars she didnt care to see lothar prutzmann dead she would have gone through worse than this or so she thought till two ss menshe supposed they were hansjoachim and detlefdragged out a corpse each had hold of a highly polished boot the body wore the black dress uniform of a highranking ss official in the glare of the panzers lights the blood that ran from the back of the head was shockingly scarlet susannas stomach lurched deathanyones deathwas better contemplated at a distance than seen close up again so she thought but the man who commanded her panzer said only its a fresh corpse anyhow they dont drip that way very long if that wasnt the voice of experience shed never heard it the commander of the lead panzer got down from his machine and bounded up the stairs to the entrance two at a time so he could get a good look at the body he stooped beside it then slowly straightened with a fine flair for the dramatic he spread his arms wide and waited till every eye was on him then and only then did he shout its prutzmann susanna squealed a great roar of joy rose from the crowd that burly man on the panzer with her planted a big smacking kiss on her cheek he needed a shave his beard rasped her skin he smelled of schnapps and onions she couldnt have cared less wheres heinrichshe wondered againis he seeing this too that she cared about after a spell in lothar prutzmanns prison heinrich of all people deserved to see his corpse wheres that friend of yours that susanna willi dorsch bawled in heinrichs ear i dont know heinrich shouted back i havent seen her in a while the two of them had precarious perches on an armored personnel carrier full of wehrmacht soldiers as it rattled west through the streets of berlin one of the crew fired short machinegun bursts into the air whenever he felt like it the noise was shattering if somebody starts shooting back at that triggerhappy maniac were all ground round willi sounded absurdly cheerful this charming thought already occurred to me thanks heinrich didnt willi laughed so many crazy things have already happened today im just not going to worry any more one way or another itll all work out maybe it will by then heinrich was past arguing in fact he couldnt very well argue because a hell of a lot of crazy thingshad happened the wind of their passage whipped around his glasses and made his eyes water that wind was cool but not especially clean it was full of diesel exhaust from the other armored vehicles in this convoy how many panzers and armored personnel carriers and selfpropelled guns to say nothing of softskinned trucks were trundling around berlin tonight even more to the point how many different sides were they on and what would happen when those on one side bumped up against those from another ratatattatthe machine gunner squeezed off another exuberant burst a tracer round drew a hot red line across the night nobody returned fire heinrich approved of that somewhere though those bullets would be coming down even as falling lumps of lead they could kill theyd be falling from a long way up treads growling and grinding the armored personnel carrier turned left heinrich started to laugh whats funny willi asked back where we started from heinrich answered there on the left stood oberkommando der wehrmacht headquarters on the right across the wide expanse of adolf hitler platz the fuhrer s palace and the vast looming bulk of the great hall dead ahead towered the arch of triumph as usual bathed in spotlights heinrich would have bet it had sharpshooters atop it but were they wearing ss black or the wehrmacht s mottled feldgrau the armored column of which the personnel carrier was a part turned right rumbling toward the fuhrer s palace the panzers and apcs had to go slowly and carefully to keep from crushing people under their tracks adolf hitler platz wasnt jammed sardinetight the way the little square in front of rolf stolles residence had been it would hold more than a million people at the moment it held tens perhaps hundreds of thousands wehrmachtor ss somebody called nervously bugger the ss with a pine cone the machine gunner answered and fired another burst into the air were thereal soldiers by god and if those blackshirted pricks dont know it theyll find out pretty goddamn fast the whoops that came from the crowd said that was what they wanted to hear but ss men held the fuhrer s palace sandbagged machinegun nests outside the entrance were plenty to keep the people at a respectful distance panzers and armored personnel carriers laughed at machine gunsthough heinrich on the outside of the armor plate wouldnt laugh if they opened up and if the ss had machine guns here it probably had antipanzer rockets too heinrich didnt see any waffen ss armor maybe lothar prutzmann had figured he wouldnt need it here once hed got hold of stolle that only went to show he wasnt as smart as he thought he was or does it show im not as smart as i think i amheinrich wondered would waffen ss panzers suddenly charge out of the night their cleated steel tracks tearing up the pavement like those of the wehrmacht machines he shrugged if the officer in charge of the wehrmacht armor couldnt anticipate a threat like that he didnt deserve his shoulder straps a blackshirt in front of the entrance stepped forward his hands conspicuously empty try as he would to hold it steady his voice quavered a little when he asked what do you want globocnik half a dozen wehrmacht panzer commanders hurled the acting fuhrer s name in his face one of them added we know hes in there we saw him come in this afternoon the crowd of angry civilians with the wehrmacht men took up the cry globocnik globocnik we want globocnik in a different tone of voice those shouts would have warmed any politicians heart as things were if heinrich had been odilo globocnik he would have been looking for a place to hide licking his lips the ss man said you are speaking of the rightful fuhrer of the greater german reich and of the germanic empire he orders youhe commands youto disperse maybe the panzer commanders answered if they did they couldnt make themselves heard even with bullhorns the crowds roars drowned them out heinz buckliger is the rightful fuhrer people shouted and we wont take orders from globocnik and down with the ss heinrich gleefully joined that last chant he liked the others but that one hit him where he lived this is nothing but treason the ss man had got his nerve back he sounded angry now not frightened we will not surrender him then youre going to be mighty sorry one of the wehrmacht panzer commanders said the crowd bayed agreement so will you if you try to take him the ss man answered he was used to making people afraid he was good at it too after all fear was his stock in trade the german people had had almost eighty years in which to learn to fear the ss but today as heinrich had seen in front of rolf stolles residence fear was failing and intimidating men in panzers that carried big guns was a lot harder than scaring civilians who couldnt fight back jeers and curses rained down on the ss mans head more rained down on odilo globocniks head was he listening there inside the fuhrer s palace with a strange snarling joy heinrich had never known before he hoped so the ss man in his own coldblooded way had style he clicked his heels his arm shot out toward the crowd in a party salute he spun on his heel executed an aboutface of paradeground perfection to turn his back on the wehrmacht soldiers and the people and marched away to his comrades and to a certain extent his intimidation worked even against his formidable foes he might have beenheinrich thought he wasbluffing when he warned that the ss could make the wehrmacht sorry but the panzers cannons and machine guns waited tenselywaited for they knew not what a nightjar swooped out of the darkness to snatch one of the moths dancing in the air around the palace lights the sudden unexpected streak of motion made men from the ss and the wehrmacht turn their heads towards it if it had startled one of them into tightening his finger on a trigger heinrich never knew exactly how long the impasse lasted somewhere between half an hour and an hour was his best guess what broke it was a high clear sound that pierced both the yells from the crowd and the diesel rumble of the armored fighting vehicles the sound of one man laughing the man was a wehrmacht panzer commander like his fellows he wore radio headphones he laughed again louder this time and raised a bullhorn to his mouth give it up you sorry bastards he blared prutzmanns blown his brains out the putsch is falling down around your ears liar one of the ss men shouted an odd desperation in his voiceit wasnt i dont believe you but i dont dare believe you youve got your own radios the wehrmacht panzer commander answered through the bullhorn you can find out for yourselves go ahead ill wait he theatrically folded his arms across his chest there in the glare of the panzers lights an ss radioman did callwhom somebody at prutzmanns headquarters heinrich supposed he could tell when the radioman got his question answered the fellow suddenly sagged as if his skeleton had turned to rubber he spoke to the officer whod parleyed with the wehrmacht soldiers the officer clapped a hand to his forehead in an altogether human gesture of despair the kind of gesture heinrich had never imagined seeing from an ss man little by little the officer pulled himself together he stepped forward again you seem to be right he called bleakly to the wehrmacht panzer commander what do you want from us give us globocnik the wehrmacht man said the rest of you lousy sons of bitches can go back to your barracks well deal with you later if we decide youre worth the trouble the ss officer drew back to hash things out with his comrades heinrich couldnt hear a word they said through the growl of the armored fighting vehicles engines and the shouting and oaths from the crowd those soon coalesced into a chant of globocnik globocnik give us globocnik heinrich happily howled it along with everybody else when a squad of blackshirts with assault rifles turned and went purposefully into the fuhrer s palace he stopped chanting and thumped willi on the shoulder theyre going to get him he exclaimed they really are either that or theyre going to try to sneak him out of here willi said this place has got to have more secret escape routes than brazils got coffee beans their buddies will pay for it if they do that heinrich reminded him and besides whod want to rally behind odilo globocnik prutzmann maybe whatever else he was he was sly but globocnik he was never anything but a false front for other people to work behind willi thought that over then nodded well when youre right youre right he grinned at heinrich you should try it more often heinrich snorted a shot rang out inside the fuhrer s palace hearing it over the engine heinrich jerked and almost fell off the armored personnel carrier is that globocnik taking prutzmanns way out he said or was he shot while attempting to escape the familiar ss euphemism for an execution had a fine ironic flavor here well find out willi said what a manthe twentyfourhour fuhrer he made as if to spit to show his contempt but held back when he realized he was all too likely to spit on someone a few minutes later the squad of ss men came out again they half led half dragged a lurching figure in their midst blood ran from their captives head but he seemed no worse than stunned heres globocnik one of the blackshirts shouted he tried to shoot himself but he didnt have the balls to do it right his hand twitched when he pulled the trigger so all he did was crease his scalp you want him youre welcome to him they shoved odilo globocnik down the steps toward the waiting wehrmacht men he staggered as if drunk his arms flailing wildly but the soldiers never got him instead the baying mob surged forward globocnik wailed once as they swarmed over him the wehrmacht men might have been able to stop it they stayed in their panzers and apcs and did not a thing and when the people were through they hanged the twentyfourhour fuhrer by the heels from a lamppost heinrich looked once then turned away glad he hadnt eaten much since breakfast what was left of odilo globocnik hardly looked like a human being at all here was one morning where esther stutzman was glad she didnt have to go to work she poured herself a second cup of coffee turned on the televisor and sat down in front of it horst witzleben stared out at her behind him were the tarmac and buildings of tempelhof airport shed caught him in the middle of a sentence by me fightersluftwaffe alfa is expected to land in about five minutes the return of heinz buckliger from his confinement on the island of hvar will hoffentlich bring to an end this bizarre episode in the history of the reich afuhrer overthrown by putsch a man named fuhrer overthrown by the outraged volk the powerful reichsfuhrer ss dead by his own hand horst shook his head as if to say the events of the past couple of days left him as baffled and bemused as anyone else two of the escorting luftwaffe fighters touched down side by side smoke spurting from their tires as they hit the runway then the fuhrer s personal jetliner landed two more sleek deadlylooking mes came in just behind itwehrmacht panzers rumbled forward to help form a protective cordon around luftwaffe alfa if any diehard ss men tried to take out the fuhrer theyd have their work cut out for them as soon as luftwaffe alfa had taxied to a stop near a terminal airport workers wheeled a stairway to the planes front door in their wake strode rolf stolle his shaved head gleaming in the summer sun bodyguards in berlin police gray surrounded the gauleiter seeing them reminded esther how much things had changed how many nazi bigwigs had she seen on the televisor over the years more than she wantedshe knew that how many of them had had ss bodyguards in black every damned one but no more no more the door opened a couple of alertlooking wehrmacht men with assault rifles emerged first making sure the coast was clear only after one of them nodded did heinz buckliger come out erna behind him he waved awkwardly toward the televisor cameras broadcasting the scene across the germanic empire in a low voice horst said the signs of the fuhrer s ordeal remain on his face esther found herself nodding buckligers features were pale and ravaged he blinked against the sunshine as if he hadnt seen it in weeks not days esther wondered what the ss had done to him while it had him in its clutches he might have aged ten years in this small space of time rolf stolle by contrast fairly burst with youthful energy even though he was older than the fuhrer he shook off his guards and bounded up the stairway toward buckliger the wehrmacht men with the rifles looked uncertainly at each other for a moment then they both grinned and stepped aside to let him pass still quietly horst witzleben said here is a meeting the world will long remember at the top of the stairs stolle stuck out his hand buckliger took it in a tentative way one of them must have been wearing a microphonemaybe both of them werefor their words came clearly from the televisor set welcome homemein fuhrer the gauleiter of berlin boomed we had a little bit of a mess here but we cleaned it up for you just fine good thats good heinz buckliger sounded as worn and weary as he looked he was the fuhrer stolle only the gauleiter yet rolf stolle by some mysterious reversal was the one who seemed possessed of the greater authority or maybe the reversal was not so mysterious after all buckliger had had things done to him during the putsch stolle had gone out and done things himself how much of a difference that made esther could see for herself as the two men confronted each other stolle said everything will proceed as you have orderedmein fuhrer he sounded deferential no matter how he sounded he wasnt he promptly proved as much too for he went on after the elections the reichstag will be a different place and well really be able to get something done about time too jabuckliger said but his expression was that of a man whod bitten into something sour stolle hadnt saidyoull really be able to get something done hed assumed power would lie with the reichstag not the fuhrer and heinz buckliger whod been far away and under guard while stolle led resistance against the ssputsch couldnt contradict him the gauleiter of berlin drove that home the volk saved your regimemein fuhrer he was most subversive when he sounded most modest if theyd sat on their hams youd be a dead man and so would i but they liked the way the wind was blowing and i maybe pointed them in the right direction once they got riled up the first edition was right trust the volk and theyll never let you down adolf hitler hadnt said any such thing in the first edition of mein kampf or anywhere else but buckliger again was in no position to tell stolle he was wrong the fuhrer said revitalization will continue it was his first effort to get in a word for the program hed pushed so hard and rolf stolle graciously granted him a nod ohja ja revitalization he might have been humoring a child but thats only the beginning weve got to do something good and final about the ss too make goddamn sure the lousy blackshirts cant make trouble again and weve got to give democratic rights back to some other aryan peoples too not just to the volk of the reich buckligers eyes widened he coughed in astonishment i am sure that this is not the place for such discussions he said stolle thumped him on the backagain or so it seemed to esther indulgently well maybe youre right you ought to get rested up get ready to deal with the new reichstag thatll be coming in after the elections the camera cut away from the scene at the top of the airplane steps a few months before it never would have lingered so long during the time of the previous fuhrer it never would have gone there at all in tones full of wonder horst witzleben said this is an extraordinary day in the history of the reich let me repeat that an extraordinary day heinz buckliger returns to a state far different from the one he left when he went on holiday not all the differences are obvious yet some that seem obvious may not last but surely some changes will be deep and farreaching where the volk once comes out into the streets against those who have proclaimed themselves to be the governmentwell how can things possibly remain the same after that esther didnt know if things could stay the same after that she also didnt know if their being different for the reich as a whole would make them different for her buckliger and stolle remained nazis she didnt expect any nazi to have much use for jews but there were nazisand then there were nazis with a choice between this pair and the overthrown duo of prutzmann and globocnik she knew where she stood and the german people stood with her if that wasnt a miracle what was susanna weiss got out of bed early on sunday morning if that didnt prove it was an unusual sunday she couldnt imagine what would sleep on weekends was a pleasure she took seriously so was coffee any morning of the week she said something unfortunate but memorable when she found she was out of cream then discovering whipped cream in the refrigerator she brightened that would do it would more than do in fact on reflection she added a shot of brandy to the coffee she had a sweet roll with it which made her feel thoroughly viennese but she left her apartment with berlin briskness this wasnt just any sunday this was the election day the late unlamented lothar prutzmann and his stooge of a globocnik hadnt been able to hijack she wanted to vote early she really wanted to vote early and often an american phrase that had been making the rounds in the reich the last few days but she didnt think she could get away with it her polling place was around the corner in a veterans hall she couldnt remember the last time shed voted what was the point when the results were going to be reported as percentja regardless of what they really wereand when votingnein was liable to win you a visit from the security police as soon as she came out of her building she stopped in surprise however brisk shed been she hadnt been brisk enough the line for the polling place already stretched around the block and came back toward her normally she hated queuing up now she joined the line without a qualmwhy is this night different from all other nights went through her head the passover question the jewish question almost seemed to fit the reich today germany really might be different after this election it might or it might not life came with no guarantees a jew surviving in the nazis berlin knew had to know as much a man in a battered fedora a windbreaker and a pair of faded dungarees got into line behind her guten morgen he said scratching his chin he needed a shave now we get to tell the bastards where to head in he might be a provocateur susanna knew that too on this morning of all mornings she couldnt make herself care you bet we do she answered ive been waiting a long time who hasnt the whiskery man said they never wanted to listen before now by god theyre gonna have to he cursed the ss and the party bonzen without great imagination but with considerable gusto up and down the linewhich rapidly got longer behind susannapeople were doing the same thing they couldnt all be provocateurscould they susanna didnt think so the ss couldnt arrest everybody in the city if they did nothing would get done and the blackshirts had their own worries at the moment the wehrmacht was gleefully cutting them down to size with heinz buckliger and rolf stolle cheering the soldiers on had buckliger understood the animosity ordinary people felt toward the state when he ordered these elections if he had would he have ordered them susanna had trouble believing that but order them he had and now hed be stuck with the results prutzmanns failed putsch might have been the best thing that could have happened to reform it reminded people what they could be in for if they voted to keep the status quo the queue snaked forward the closer to the polling place people got the nastier the things they had to say about that status quo men and women who came out of the veterans hall strutted and swaggered proud grins on their faces nobody needed to ask how theyd voted the hall smelled of old cigars and spilled beer helmets were mounted on the wall big cumbersome ones with flaring brims from the first world war and the lighter and sleeker models german soldiers had worn during the second and third the uniformed precinct leader stood around looking important clerks in mufti did the real work your name one of them said when susanna came up to him she gave it he made sure she was on a list in front of him then went on your identity papers she displayed the card she would no more leave home without it than she would without a top once the clerk was satisfied he used a ruler to line through her name and address in red then he handed her a ballot choose any vacant booth next there were no vacant booths not with the way people had swarmed to the polls susanna waited till a woman came out of one she ducked into it herself pulling the curtain closed behind her she wasnt in rolf stolles district but she knew which candidate here supported reform and which was a party hack she knew which candidate for the berlin city council was which too voting for candidates had never mattered to her voting against thembeing able to vote against themcarried a kick stronger than glenfiddich straight up she put the ballot in its envelope emerged from the booth a tall man immediately took her place and handed the envelope to the clerk he put it in the ballot box intoning frau weiss has voted fraulein doktor professor weiss has voted she corrected crisply every so often the formidable academic title came in very handy half a dozen people in the veterans hall looked her way the clerk stared at her as she walked out she wanted to know right away how the election turned out she couldnt of course because the polls were still open talking about results till they closed might have influenced those who hadnt voted yet and so wasverboten that made most of sunday pass in what felt like anticlimax she turned on the televisor a few minutes before eight that evening watching the end of an idiotic game show seemed a small price to pay for what would follow at eight oclock precisely horst witzleben came on the screen in place of the sunday night film that normally would have run today is a watershed day for the greater german reich the newscaster declared in germanys first contested elections since candidates favoring the reform policies of heinz buckliger and rolf stolle appear to be sweeping to victory all across the country hearing stolles name mentioned in the same breath as the fuhrer s was new since the failed putsch the gauleiter s status had risen as buckligers fell the one was a hero the other a victim even in the reich it turned out there was such a thing as moral authority a map of germany appeared in gray on the screen here and there it was measled with green spots there were also red spots but far fewer of them green shows proreform candidates with substantial leads in their districts witzleben said red shows candidates of the other sort who are in the lead if we look more closely at berlinthe map changed as he spokewe see that every district but one in the capital of the reich supports reform rolf stolle himself is being sent to the reichstag by a margin of better than six to one over his foe building contractor engelbert hackmann good susanna murmured that wasnt a surprise but it was a relief the map went back to coverage of the whole reich more of it had turned green some more had turned red too but not nearly so much then it shifted again this time to a detailed look at the protectorate of bohemia and moravia most of that area was green except for a few red patches in the former sudetenland horst witzleben continued along with electing delegates to the reichstag the people of the protectorate are also voting on a nonbinding referendum concerning their relationship with the reich latest returns show that seventyseven percent favor the declaration of independence proclaimed by the unity organization in the wake of the putsch while only twentythree percent wish to continue as a reichs protectoratein effect a province of the reich most of the delegates elected are pledged to bring this issue to the attention of the new reichstag and to seek relief that was pretty dizzying too true the referendum had no official weight any more than the declaration had but it wouldnt have been on the ballot if those things didnt count for something and the czechs had shown a lot of nerve in reminding the world they hadnt forgotten the freedom theyd known between the first two world wars how could a reichstag chosen on the basis of selfdetermination ignore it once in office maybe theyll say the czechs are only slavs and too ignorant to know what theyre talking about susanna thought cynically but in that case why give them the chance to speak their minds susanna had yet to hear anyone no matter how radical a reformer speak up for letting poles or ukrainians or russians tell the world what they wanted their opinions didnt matter why else had god put them on earth except to be worked to death and no one had spoken up for keeping heinrich gimpel and his daughters alive when they were arrested had the authorities decided he was a jew and they firstdegree mischlingen they would have been killed and that would have been that the reich had come further in the past year than in the previous lifetime it still had a long way to go susanna suspected neither buckliger nor stolle realized how far maybe charlie lynton did over in london he had the british union of fascists out several steps in front of the german national socialists that took special nerve in a subject ally and the whitehaired czech playwright who led unity seemed to have a good understanding of where the reich needed to go whether it would go there was another question more and more of the map filled in there were spots where red predominated over green bavaria parts of prussia rural austria vienna was a different story but it looked as if reformers would have a solid majority how solid would it have been had prutzmann not tried his putsch susanna feared it would have been much less so but nobody would ever know now then the camera cut away from the map away from the studio there was heinz buckliger walking through the little square in front of the gauleiter s residence with rolf stolle stolle was pointing to the makeshift memorials that had sprung up where ss panzers crushed berliners flowers candles notes tothe dead and one big sign that saidfreiheit uber alles the two chief architects of this remarkable day confer horst said quietly it didnt look like a conference to susanna it looked as if the gauleiter was lecturing the fuhrer and it looked as if heinz buckliger was taking it he would nod whenever stolle stuck out a finger and made a point once stolle laughed at something and slapped him on the back hard enough to stagger him buckliger took that too though it was anything but the gesture of a subordinate to a superior despite their titles it didnt seem as if the gauleiter were the fuhrer s subordinate stolle pointed to the freiheit uber alles sign buckliger earnestly nodded again stolle didnt really understand what the sign meant either susanna had already realized that but if you said the words often enough didnt you sooner or later have to go where they led you didnt youwell find out susanna thought francesca came bounding up to alicia at lunchtime guess what she cried i dont know alicia said what frau koch is gone her sister caroled gone gone gone weve got a new teacher his name is herr mistele he smiles at people like he means it smiles the beast is gone gone gone gone thats wonderful too bad it didnt happen sooner alicia said and francescas head bounced up and down in unreserved agreement alicia asked did he say why the beast left with frau koch not there alicia came out with the nickname without looking over her shoulder first to see whether any other teachers could hear francesca frowned he said she paused trying to make sure she got the words just right he said with the political something the way it was the situation alicia broke in thats right thats the word i couldnt come up with francesca started over he said with the political situation the way it was it was better if frau koch did something else for a while as far as im concerned she can do something else forever maybe she will alicia said she liked lothar prutzmann a lot didnt she francesca nodded again alicia continued well with prutzmann dead and gone and with the putsch down the drain naturally theyre going to get rid of people like that shes probably lucky shes not in jail or maybe she is ooh her sister said ooh ihope she is she said daddy deserved to be back when they grabbed him and us i hope she finds out what its like francesca liked revenge it could happen alicia didnt mind the idea of the beast behind bars eitherfar from it and when one side won a political fight the other side suffered that had been true in the reich ever since the night of the long knives sooner or later though didnt revenge have to stop or at least slow down if it didnt whod be left after a while that made more sense than alicia wished it did all the same she couldnt help hoping vengeance wouldnt stop till frau koch got what was coming to her she waved and called hey trudi listen whats up trudi krebs called alicia nudged her sister tell her francesca did trudis eyes widened really she whispered francesca crossed her hearti dont think jews are supposed to do that went through alicias mindshe hadnt done it since she found out what she was then she stopped worrying about it trudi put one arm around her and the other around francesca and started dancing both of them around in a circle whooping while she danced whats going on another girl called trudi and francesca both shouted out the news the other girl jumped straight up in the air then she ran over and started dancing too more girls heard the news too and joined the circle it got bigger and bigger spinning dizzily around the playground a few boys even danced with them mostly ones whod had the beast and knew what francescas class was escaping was ist hier los a mans voicea teachers voicestopped the exuberance in its tracks where nothing else would have alicia gimpel tell me at once jawohl herr peukert all panting and sweaty alicia paused its nothingherr peukert were justhappyherr peukert would he ask why they were happy would their being loud and disorderly count for more it would have with a lot of teachersherr peukert kept right on looking stern but then slowly and thoughtfully he nodded happy is not a bad thing for children to be you may continue he turned his back on the circle he didnt turn around when the dancing started again he knows why francesca whispered to alicia he knows but he doesnt care wonder filled her face nobody cares about what happened to the beast alicia corrected herself except that shes gone i mean she couldnt think of a better reason to dance when lunch ended and students went into their classrooms again hers buzzed with the news nobody could hold still nobody could keep quiet a lot of alicias classmates had suffered through a year with frau koch some of the ones who hadnt had a brother or sister who had the way alicia did and all the boys and girls knew what the beast was like herr peukert put up with it longer than alicia thought he would at last though he said enough if you want to dance at lunch or after school thats your business when youre here though we have work to do you may not care about it now but some of it will be important later on kindly buckle down and pay attention and they did or most of them did the bargain seemed fair to alicia the boys and girlsmostly boyswho kept on being noisy were the ones who were always noisy in classherr peukert had a lot more patience than herr kessler had but he didnt own an infinite supply he gave the loudest most obnoxious boy a swat the whack of paddle on backside did an amazing job of calming the others down nobody on the bus going home told the children to be quiet they giggled and squealed and sang songs most of them about the things a beast did in the woods they would have danced in the aisle but that was too much for the longsuffering bus driver you got to stay in your seats he shouted over the din in the bus you got to thems the rules by god the children did sit down maybe that was simply fear about what would happen to them if they didnt but maybe it was something more too in the reich few arguments carried more weight thanthems the rules the rules and good order went hand in hand and german children learned to obey along with their other lessons but we wouldnt obey lothar prutzmann even if the beast thought we ought toalicia thought then something else crossed her mindwhat do you mean weshe couldnt automatically think of herself as a german any more that was what being a jew did to her it made her an outsider in her own country part of her still wished for the feeling of belonging shed had before she found out what she was but considering a lot of the things germans had done maybe being on the outside looking in was the better part of the bargain had lise gimpel expected miracles from the new reichstag she would have been disappointed since she expected very little she found herself pleasantly surprised every now and again the delegates chose rolf stolle as their speaker the gauleiter used his new bully pulpit to go right on slanging heinz buckliger for not doing enough and for not doing it fast enough that didnt surprise lise at all laws cutting back the powers of the ss did so did the public hangings of a couple of lothar prutzmanns chief henchmen the dangling bodiesshown on the evening newsdeclared the new laws had teeth the lesson was unsubtle and thoroughly nazi but no less effective for that holland held elections too and chose a parliament with a nonfascist majority panzers didnt roll the german foreign ministry said not a word dutchmen didnt dance in the streets they didnt seem to want to give the reich any excuse to change its mind lise couldnt blame them as summer gave way to fall heinrich said the americans were getting friskier than ever what will they do lise asked him will they try to rebel i dont think so i hope not her husband answered that would be just whatsome people needed he still spoke carefully the house might be bugged how hard would the governmentthe way it is nowtry to stop them i dont know that either heinrich said but if the governmentthe way it is nowdidnt try to stop them i dont think it would be the government for very long but they really have put a boot on the sss neck lise protested i wasnt talking about the ss i was talking about the wehrmacht heinrich said the army wont put up with weakness here and it wont want to let the yankees get too strong they arent like the dutch or the czechs they could be rivals they could be worse rivals than the empire of japan because theyre more like us the wehrmacht wouldnt like that at all and how can you blame it lise eyed her husband before answering hed tacked on the last half dozen words she judged to keep anyone on the other end of a bug happy who possibly could she said in the same spirit after it broke up the putsch who could blame it for anything heinrich started to nod then caught himself and wagged a finger at her as if to saynaughty naughty lise stuck out her tongue maybe shed meant you couldnt blame the wehrmacht for anything because it hadnt done anything blameworthy or maybe shed meant you didnt dare blame it for anything because it was the greatest power in the land which her green eyes dancing she shook her head she was a woman she was entitled to her mysteries and she wasnt altogether sure herself what about the czechs she asked changing the subject a little will the reich let them go her husband shrugged beats me they have the vote last summer to back up their declaration of independence and if anybody can outfinagle the foreign ministry its the fellow theyve got leading unity he can make you feel ashamed when you do something that isnt on the upandup and how many people are able to do that but yes but lise knew why heinrich hesitated the czechs were slavs and slavs even slavs like the czechs whod been entangled in german affairs since time out of mind were in the national socialist way of thinking untermenschen if you once started making concessions to untermenschen didnt you acknowledge they might not be so inferior after all and if you acknowledged that how did you justify the massacres and the slave labor that had filled the last seventy years even more to the point if you acknowledged that slavsor some slavsmight not be untermenschen didnt you take a step towards acknowledging that jews also might not be untermenschencould a national socialist government take a step in that direction the fuhrer has said mistakes were made in years gone by heinrich said if the fuhrer said it it couldnt possibly be treasonousas long as he stayed fuhrer if we decide to set some of those mistakes to rights that wouldnt be so bad no of course it wouldnt lise answered even though the czechs were doing most of the agitating these days theyd got off relatively easy how could the reich make amends to the relative handful of poles and russians and ukrainians who still survived and for that matter how could the reich make amends to the handful of jews who in spite of everything still survived lise knew an impossibility when she saw one come to that she didnt want a parade of blackshirts and party bonzen clicking their heels and apologizing to her that sort of spectacle might appeal to susanna but then susanna reveled in opera all lise wanted was to be left alone to get on with her life regardless of what she happened to be were asking questions we couldnt even have imagined a couple of years ago heinrich said next to the questions the answers dont seem quite so important says who lise inquired sarcastically if the security police had come up with a different answer to their question a few months ago you wouldnt be here trying to come up with answers to yoursand the girls wouldnt be here either she thoughtand it wouldnt matter whether i was here or not because id be dead inside after a brief pause her husband nodded well youre right he said one of the reasons theyd stayed pretty happily married the past fifteen years was that they were both able to say that when they needed to politics lise turned the word into a curse i wish politics never had anything to do with us i wish we could just go on about our business part of our business is making the reich better thats part of everybodys business right now i think heinrich said if we dont make it better whatll happen we saw before the electionother people will make it worse thats what lise wanted to quarrel with him but she remembered too well the horror that had coursed through her when lothar prutzmanns tame announcer started going on about the state committee for the salvation of the greater german reich and remembering she too said those three little words almost as important as i love you well youre right heinrich lise and the girls closed their umbrellas when they came up onto the stutzmans front porch the walk from the bus stop had been wet but not too wet winter was thinking about making way for spring it hadnt got around to doing it yet still the worst of the nasty weather was probably past heinrich dared hope so anyway all three gimpel girls raced for the doorbell francesca rang it a split second before alicia or roxane could heinrich and lise smiled over the girls heads they would do that at elevators too which made their parents require that they take turns pressing those buttonsanyone would think theyre children or something went through heinrichs mind he smiled again esther stutzman opened the door come in come in welcome welcome she said and stood aside delicious odors wafted out of the doorway cooking meat newbaked bread and something else something spicy heinrich couldnt quite place oh goodyouve got a mat out lise said we dont want to drip all over your front hall she wagged a warning finger at the girls dont you go running all over till you get out of your raincoats do you hear me the warning came just in time alicia was trembling with eagerness to charge up to annas room is susanna here heinrich asked she got here twenty minutes ago esther answered now she and heinrich were the ones who smiled susanna always showed up early esther turned to alicia francesca and roxane why dont we hang those coats on the bar for the shower curtain in the downstairs bathroom here that way they wont get anything else wet heinrich and lise followed so they could hang their coats in the bathroom too lise asked did gottlieb get leave from the hitler jugend esther shook her head im afraid not hes stuck somewhere out in the provinces communing with his shovel heinrichs laugh wasnt far from a giggle he hadnt been ideal material for the hitler jugend he was slow and ungainly and nearsighted and none too strong but by god his spade had always gleamed blade and handle both hed seen at once that survival lay in that direction and hed been right he hadnt been an analyst yet but hed already thought like onecommuning with his shovel hed have to remember that he could tell it at the office who hadnt gone through the hitler jugend come on anna said appearing behind esther as if by magic the gimpel girls were off like three brownhaired shots esther nodded to heinrich and lise here we are she said yes heinrich nodded too here we are there were times this past year when i wouldnt have given a pfennig for our chances but here we are what can i get you esther asked beer will do he answered for me too please lise said they followed esther toward the kitchen susanna sat on the sofa scotch on the table in front of her she got up to hug heinrich and lise she and heinrich each raised an eyebrow at the other they were in a way veterans of the same campaign it hadnt lasted long and there hadnt been many casualties but it could have been much worse and they both knew it did you ever find new bridge partners susanna asked him we play every now and then but not regularly not the way we used to he replied willi and i still get along fine at work but yes but lise said pointedly its hard to play cards with somebody who tried to seduce your husband and then tried to kill him heinrich wondered which of erikas transgressions his wife resented more since asking would have landed him in hotter water than knowing was worth he expected hed go right on wondering esther came back with two steins of pale gold pilsner here you are she gave heinrich one and lise the other thanks heinrich sipped he nodded appreciatively is that pilsner urquell esther said it before he could she nodded too its good beer and besides buying it sends the czechs a little money they deserve all the help we can give them her usually sunny face clouded for a moment anyone who wants to get away from the reich deserves all the help we can give them omaynlise said softly she and heinrich and esther and susanna all smiled that particular pronunciation of the word ordinary germans said asamen was one jews could only use among themselves which meant it was one they couldnt use very often hearing it reminded heinrich he was part of a small but very special club wheres walther he asked at the same time as lise was saying what smells so good im carving the goose walther called from the kitchen answering both questions at the same time he added it probably wont be the neatest job in the world because the joints arent quite in the same places as they are on a capon but the taste wont change esthers responsible for that the two of you cooked goose last summer too susanna said lothar prutzmanns i mean esther blushed like a schoolgirl who can say for sure the putsch might have fallen apart anyhow the ss had already started shooting at the wehrmacht at the berlin televisor station and that would have started things rolling downhill on prutzmann all by itself heinrich shook his head dont sell yourselves short you werent in the square when stolle shouted out that prutzmann was a jew it took the wind right out of the ss panzer troopers sails and it gave the crowd something new and juicy to yell at them he sipped from his beer i was yelling it myself that hed yelled it embarrassed him now though it hadnt then so was i as loud as i could susanna sounded proud and guilty at the same time walther came out he was wearing an apron to guard against grease he had a beer in one hand for himself and in the other a glass of liebfraumilch which he gave to esther heinrich raised his own seidel in salute heres to getting that story out im just glad it may have helped walther said at the time i wasnt even close to sure i was doing the right thing who was heinrich answered but it worked outas well as anything could have anyhow if hed had things exactly as he wanted them everyone would have gathered at his house for supper the way people had two years before but he still had to assume the security police had planted bugs there and that they were monitoring them the blackshirts were down but they werent necessarily out esther took his mind off his worries by saying lets eat shall we she went to the base of the stairs and hallooed for the children annas bedroom door opened she and the gimpel girls reluctantly emerged whatever theyd been doing in there theyd had a good time at it the table groaned with food the goose was stuffed with sauerkraut and caraway seeds and was done to perfection there was liver dumpling soup a puree of yellow peas boiled potatoes with plenty of butter to slather on them and a medley of green peas carrots asparagus kohlrabi and cauliflower garnished with more butter and salt and chopped parsley there was homebaked bread with cinnamon and raisins and candied cherriesthat accounted for the enticing spicy scent heinrich had noticed when esther opened the door and there was a peach cobbler if by some accident anyone had room for it pilsner urquell and liebfraumilch and glenfiddich flowed freely for the grownups for the children as there had been two years earlier there was wheat beer with raspberry syrup not a treat they got every day anna and alicia and francesca were careful about how much they drank roxane wasnt she put down a big glass of beer and turned almost as red as the syrup she was yawning long before dessert which didnt keep her from making a pretty good dent in the cobbler but that finished her off her eyes started to sag shut no matter how she fought to keep them open when she swayed in her chair heinrich went over and picked her up im not sleepy she said indignantly around a yawn that showed off her tonsils i know sweetheart he said but im going to take you up to annas bedroom to rest for a little while anyway she didnt argue with him a telling measure of how worn she was he carried her up the stairs that was harder work than hed expected hed put away a lot of food himself when he laid her on the bed she started to snore he watched her for a minute or two to make sure she wasnt pretending then smiled shook his head once or twice and went back down to the dining room he hadnt even sat down before francesca said something funnys going on she pointed to alicia when you turned ten like this you got to stay up late too and roxane and i had to go to bed i remember alicia looked at heinrich when he didnt say anything she did youreten now so its your turn my turn for what francesca asked curiosity and suspicion warring in her voice alicia looked at heinrich again this time he knew he had to speak despite all hed eaten and drunk fear made his heart pound the past two years had taught him more about danger than he ever wanted to know but if this didnt go forward through time what was the point to all that danger none none at all he licked his lips well francesca weve got a secret to tell you
