darkness and light paul bthompson tonya rcarter chapter separate ways autumn painted solace in gay colors each porch each window was filled with red orange and yellow foliage for the shops and houses of solace were nestled among the stout branches of a vale of vallenwood trees well above the mossy ground here and there were clearings in the treetown these were the towns commons where there might be a market one week and a traveling carnival the next on this bright afternoon three figures stood in a sunlit clearing two men and a woman two swords played back and forth flashing with fire when the suns rays caught them two figures circled warily feinting with sudden flicks of their naked blades the third one stood back watching the swords scraped together with a kiss of tempered steel well met said caramon majere the onlooker a very neat parry sturm the tall young man with the drooping brown mustache grunted a brief acknowledgment he was rather busy his opponent sprang forward lunging at his chest sturm brightblade cut hard at the onrushing point backpedaling as he swung it missed him by a scant inch sturms foe wobbled as she came down off balance her feet too far apart steady kit caramon called his halfsister recovered with the practiced grace of a dancer she brought her heels together with a smack of boot leather and presented sturm with only her slim profile as a target now my friend she said ill show you the skill that comes from fighting for pay kitiara cut tiny circles in the air with her sword tip once twice three times sturm watched the deadly motion caramon watched too openmouthed at eighteen he was the size of a fullgrown man but he was still a boy inside the wild and worldly kitiara was his idol she had more drive and dash than any ten men from his place caramon could see every nick in the edge of kitiaras blade mementoes of hardfought battle the flat of the blade was shiny from frequent and expert polishing by contrast sturms sword was so new that the hilt still showed the blue tinge from the smiths annealing fire watch your right said caramon sturm closed his free hand over the long pommel and awaited kitiaras attack square on as a solamnic knight would hai kitiara whirled on one leg cleaving the air with an upward sweep of her sword caramons breath caught as she carried her swing forward sturm did not move her sword would complete its arc at his neck caramon shut his eyes and heard a solid ring of steel feeling foolish he opened them again sturm had parried straight across hilt to hilt with no finesse at all he and kitiara stayed locked together with their sword points high kitiaras wrists shook she stepped in and braced her sword arm with her empty hand sturm forced her guard down her face paled then flushed red caramon knew that look this friendly bout was not going to her liking and kitiara was getting angry vexed she shifted her stance and strained against sturms greater size and strength still her hilt fell the knobbed quillon of sturms new sword brushed her chin with an explosive gasp kitiara ceased the struggle both sword points stabbed into the green sod enough she said ill buy the ale i shouldve known better than to let you bind up my guard like that come on sturm lets have a tankard of otiks best sounds good to me he replied he freed his blade and stepped back breathing heavily as he moved kitiara thrust the flat of her weapon between his ankles sturms feet tangled and he sprawled backward on the grass his sword flew away and in the next instant kitiara stood over him holding thirtytwo inches of steel poised at his throat combat is not always a sport she said keep your eyes open and your sword firmly in hand my friend and youll live longer sturm looked up the blade at kitiaras face sweat had stuck dark curls of hair to her forehead and her naturally dark lips were pressed firmly together slowly they spread in a lopsided smile she sheathed her weapon dont look so downcast better a friend knock you down as a lesson than an enemy cut you down for good she extended a hand wed better go before flint and tanis drink all of otiks brew sturm grasped her hand it was warm and calloused from gauntlets and sword grips kitiara pulled him up until they were nose to nose although a head taller and fifty pounds heavier sturm still felt like a callow youth beside her but her bright eyes and engaging smile dispelled his anxiety i see now how youve managed to prosper as a fighter he said stooping to retrieve his sword he buried the blade in its sheath thank you for the lesson next time i will keep my feet out of reach later will you teach me some of your moves kit asked caramon eagerly he carried a short sword himself a gift from his adventurous sister shed picked it up on one of her many battlefields flint fireforge who knew metalwork as few did said that caramons sword had been made in southern qualinesti only by clues such as this did her friends know where kits wanderings had taken her why not ill tie one hand behind my back to make it fair caramon opened his mouth to retort but kitiara clapped a hand over his lips now to the inn if i dont get a draft of ale soon ill perish when they reached the base of the great vallenwood tree that supported the inn of the last home they found their friend flint sitting at the bottom of the ramp the dwarf had a split of kindling in his massive knobby hands and was shaving off hairthin slices with a singleedged knife well you came back with your skin whole said flint eyeing sturm i halfexpected to see you carrying your head under your arm your confidence in me is enormous the young man replied sourly kitiara halted and draped an arm across caramons broad shoulders better watch yourself old dwarf our master sturm has an uncommonly strong arm once he learns not to hold to outdated knightly codes honor is never outdated said sturm which is how you landed flat on your back with my sword at your neck if you would dont start groaned caramon if i have to hear another debate on honor ill die of boredom i wont argue kitiara said slapping her brother on the rump i made my point come with us flint kits buying said caramon the elderly dwarf rose on his stumpy legs sweeping a cascade of white wood slivers off his lap he straightened his clothing and tucked his knife back in his leggings no ale for you kitiara said to caramon with mockmaternal sternness youre not old enough to drink caramon ducked under her arm sprinted up to sturm and said im eighteen kit kitiaras face showed surprise eighteen are you sure her little brother was an inch or so taller than sturm caramon gave her a disgusted look of course im sure you just havent noticed that im a grown man youre a baby kitiara cried whipping out her sword any more out of you and ill spank you ha caramon laughed you cant catch me so saying he dashed up the stairs kitiara returned her sword and bounded after him caramons long legs covered the steep boards quickly laughing he and his sister disappeared around the tree trunk flint and sturm ascended more slowly a light breeze rustled through the tree sending a shower of colored leaves across the steps sturm gazed out through the branches at the other tree homes in a few weeks youll be able to see clear to the other side of the commons he mused aye said flint its strange not to be on the road right now for more years than youve been alive boy ive tramped the roads of abanasinia from spring to autumn plying the trade sturm nodded flints announced retirement from his itinerant metalworking had surprised them all its all behind me now flint said time to put my feet up maybe grow some roses sturm found the image of the bluff old dwarf tending a rose garden so unnatural that he shook his head to dispel the thought at the level platform midway up to the inn proper sturm paused by the railing flint went a few steps beyond before halting he squinted back at sturm and said what is it boy youre about to burst to tell me something flint didnt miss a thing im going away said sturm to solamnia im going to look for my heritage and your father if there is any trace of him to be found i shall find it it could be a long journey and a dangerous search flint said but i wish i could go with you never mind sturm moved away from the rail its my search sturm and flint entered the door of the inn just in time to receive a barrage of apple cores as they wiped the sticky palp from their eyes the room rocked with laughter whos the rascal responsible roared flint a gawky young girl no more than fourteen with a head of robust red curls handed the outraged dwarf a towel otik pressed some new cider and they had to have the leavings she said apologetically sturm wiped his face kitiara and caramon had collapsed against the bar giggling like idiots behind the bar otik the portly proprietor of the inn shook his head this is a firstclass inn he said take your pranks outside if you gotta pullem nonsense said kitiara she slapped a coin on the bar caramon wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes and stared it was a gold coin one of the few hed ever seen that will ease your temper eh otik kitiara said a tall wellfavored man stool up from his table and approached the bar his motion was oddly graceful and his high cheekbones and golden eyes eloquently proclaimed his elven heritage he picked up the coin whats the matter tanis kitiara asked havent you ever seen gold before not as large a coin as this tanis halfelven replied he flipped it over where was it struck kitiara lifted her mug from the bar and drank i dont know she said its part of my wages why do you ask the inscription is elvish i would say it was minted in silvanesti sturm and flint came over to examine the coin the deli cate script was definitely elvish flint said faroff silvanesti had practically no contact with the rest of ansalon and there was much curiosity as to how an elvish coin managed to drift so far west plunder said a voice from the corner of the room what did you say raist asked caramon in a corner of the inns common room a pallid figure could be seen raistlin caramons twin brother as usual he was immersed in the study of a dusty scroll he rose and moved toward the group the colored light filtering through the inns stainedglass windows gave his pale skin odd tints plunder he repeated robbery rapine booty we know what the word means said flint sharply he means the coin was probably stolen in silvanesti and later turned up in the coffers of kits mercenary captain said tanis they passed the coin from hand to hand turning it around and feeling the heft of it more than its crude monetary value the elven coin spoke of faroff places and distant magical people let me see said an insistent voice from below the bar a small lean arm thrust between caramon and sturm no said otik taking the coin from taniss hand when a kender gets hold of money you can kiss it a quick goodbye tas cried caramon i didnt see you come in he was in the room the whole time tanis said tasslehoff burrfoot like most of his race was both clever and diminutive he could hide in the smallest places and was known to be lightfingered curious as he said ale all around said kitiara now that my credit is good otik filled a line of tankards from a massive pitcher and the friends retired to the great round table in the center of the room raistlin took a chair with the others instead of returning to his scroll since we are all here tanis said someone ought to make a toast heres to kit the founder of the feast said caramon raising his clay mug of cider heres to the gold that pays for it his sister responded heres to the elves who coined it offered flint ill drink to elves in any form kitiara said she smiled over her mug at tanis a question formed on his lips but before he could speak it tasslehoff stood on his stool and waved for attention i say we drink to flint said tas this is the first year since the cataclysm that he wont be on the road a chuckle circled the table and the old dwarf reddened you whelp he growled how old do you think i am he cant count that high said raistlin well im a hundred and fortythree and i can lick any man woman or kender in the place flint declared he thumped a heavy fist on the table care to test me he had no takers despite his age and short stature flint was powerfully muscled and a good wrestler they toasted and drank from then on with good cheer as afternoon became evening and evening became night to stave off tipsiness one of otiks large suppers was ordered soon the table was groaning under platters of squab and venison bread cheese and otiks famous fried potatoes the redhaired girl brought each platter to the diners at one point caramon put his gnawed chicken bones in her apron pocket the girl responded gamely dropping a hot potato slice down caramons collar he squirmed out of his chair as the girl skipped back to otiks kitchen who the blazes is she asked caramon wiggling the crispy potato slice out his shirttail she is in otiks care said raistlin her name is tika the night passed on other patrons came and went it grew late and otik had tika light a fork of candles for the friends table the merry banter of the early evening gave way to calmer more reflective conversation im going tomorrow kitiara announced by candlelight her tanned face seemed golden tanis studied her and felt all the old pangs return she was a most alluring woman going where asked caramon north i think she answered why north tanis asked reasons of my own she said but her smile softened the flat answer can i go with you caramon said no you cant brother why not kitiara seated between her halfbrothers glanced at raistlin caramons gaze went from her to his twin of course raistlin needed him though twins they were not much alike caramon was a genial young bear while raistlin was a studious wraith he was frequently ill and had an uncanny habit of antagonizing large belligerent types after the birth of the twins their mother had never recovered her strength so kitiara had fought for young raistlins health now it was caramon who watched out for his twin im leaving too put in sturm north he glanced at kitiara foo said tasslehoff north is dull ive been there now east theres the way to go theres lots to see in the east cities forests mountains pockets to pick horses to borrow said flint the kender stuck out his lower lip i cant help it if im good at finding things someday youll find from the wrong person and theyll hang you for it i have to go north sturm said he leaned forward resting his chin on his hands im going back to solamnia they all stared at him they knew the story of sturms exile from his homeland twelve years had passed since the peasants of solamnia had risen against the knightly lords sturm and his mother had escaped with only their lives the knights were still despised in their own country could you use a good right arm offered kitiara her offer caught everyone by surprise i wouldnt want you to go out of your way said sturm noncommittally north is north ive been east and south and west very well then id be honored to have you with me sturm turned from kitiara to tanis what about you tan tanis pushed a hunk of bread through the remains of his dinner ive been thinking of doing some travel myself nothing specific just a trek to see some places i havent seen i dont think my journey will take me north he looked at kitiara but her gaze was directed at sturm thats the idea tasslehoff said briskly his right hand dipped into his fur vest and came out with a flat copper disk he rolled the disk over the back of his knuckles it was an exercise he sometimes did to keep his fingers nimble not that he needed practice lets go east tanis you and me no the flat turndown froze the copper disk midway across the back of the kenders small hand no said tanis again more gently this is a trip i must make alone the table was silent again then caramon let out a single great hiccup and the laughter returned pardon me said caramon reaching for kitiaras tankard she was not fooled as his hand closed around the pewter stem she rapped his wrist with her spoon caramon snatched his hand back ouch he protested youll get worse if you try it again said kitiara caramon grinned and made a fist save your energy brother raistlin said youll need it how so raist since everyone has decided to undertake journeys this seems like a good time to announce one of my own flint snorted you wouldnt last two days on the road perhaps not raistlin folded his long tapering fingers unless my brother goes with me where and when asked caramon pleased to be going anywhere i cannot say where just now raistlin said his pale blue eyes stared fixedly at his nearly untouched plate of food it may be a long and perilous voyage caramon jumped up im ready siddown kitiara said dragging on her brothers vest tail caramon plumped down on his stool flint sighed a great gusty sigh youre all leaving me he said ill not go atinkering this season and all my friends are going their own way he sighed again so heavily that the rack of candles flickered you old bear kitiara said youre feeling sorry for yourself theres no law that says you have to stay in solace by yourself dont you have any relatives that you can impose on yes tasslehoff added you can visit your graybearded i mean grayhaired old mother the dwarf bellowed his outrage those sitting closest to flint caramon and sturm slid quickly away from the furious dwarf flint banged his tankard on the tabletop sending a splash of ale at tasslehoff rivulets of sticky golden ale ran off the kenders nose and soaked into his topknot of wild brown hair he rubbed the brew from his eyes nobody makes sport of my mother flint declared not more than once anyway tanis observed sagely tas wiped his face on his sleeve he picked up his own scaleddown tankard it was empty and tucked it under his arm like an absurd helm assuming an air of injured dignity he declaimed now we must fight a duel kitiara said gleefully ill be your second tas ill stand for flint caramon cried who has choice of weapons asked tanis flints challenged it is his choice sturm said smiling whatll it be old bear apple cores at ten paces ladles and pot lids asked kitiara anything but ale mugs tas quipped his pose of haughty dignity replaced by his usual grin the laughter didnt stop until tika returned shh shh its late will you people be quiet she hissed go on before someone spanks you caramon said without turning to look at her tika slipped in behind his stool and made horrid faces at him the others laughed at her caramon was puzzled whats so funny he demanded tika deftly lifted the dagger from caramons belt sheath she raised it over her head with a terrifying grimace as though to stab caramon in the back tears ran down kitiaras face and tas fell off his chair what shouted caramon then he snapped his head around and spied tika in midgrimace aha he started after her the girl darted around the nearby empty tables caramon blundered after her upsetting chairs and stumbling against stools otik appeared from the kitchen with a lamp in his hand his nightshirt was askew and his sparse white hair was standing up in comic tufts whats this row cant a man get some sleep around here tika where are you girl the redhaired girl peeked over the rim of a table you were supposed to hush them not join in the party that man was chasing me she pointed at caramon who was busy studying the candlelit rafters go to your room tika went regretfully she cast a last grin back at caramon and stuck out her tongue when he started toward her she flipped his dagger at him it struck the floor quivering inches from his feet tika vanished through the kitchens swinging doors otik planted his fists on his hips flint fireforge i expected better of you youre old enough to know better and you master sturm a wellbred fellow like you ought to know better than to be roistering this late at night flint looked properly abashed sturm smoothed his long mustache with his right forefinger and said nothing dont be an old sop said kitiara tika was very amusing besides this is a goingaway party everything is amusing to people whove got four kegs of ale in their bellies growled otik whos going away well everybody otik turned back to the kitchen he said well for pitys sake go quietly and left caramon returned to the table through a gaping yawn he said that tikas the ugliest girl in solace old otikll have to put up a big dowry to get her married off you never know said raistlin with a glance at the kitchen people change it was time to part there was no reason to delay any longer sensing this tanis stood with folded hands and said though we friends will separate our good wishes cannot be diminished by time or distance but to keep the circle in our hearts we must come together again each year on this day here in the inn and if we cannot asked sturm then five years from today everyone here tonight shall return to the inn of the last home no matter what lets make this a sacred vow who will take it with me kitiara pushed back her stool and put her right hand in the center of the table ill take that vow she said her eyes fixed tanis in a powerful hold five years tanis lowered his hand on hers five years upon my honor and in the name of the house of brightblade sturm said solemnly i vow to return in five years he placed his sword hand on taniss me too said caramon his broad palm hid even sturms hand from sight if i am living i will be here said raistlin with a strange lilt in his voice he added his gracile touch to his brothers and me ill be here waiting for all of you so saying tasslehoff stepped up on the tabletop his tiny hand rested next to raistlins both lost on caramons wide hand lot of confounded nonsense flint grumbled how do i know what ill be doing five years from now could be a lot more important than sitting in an inn waiting for a pack of errant rascals cmon flint were all taking the oath said the kender hmph the old dwarf leaned over and set his age and workworn hands around the others reorx be with you until we meet again he said his voice caught and his friends knew him for the sentimental old fraud he was they left flint at the table the twins departed tanis kitiara and sturm strolled to the foot of the stairway tasslehoff trailed after them i will say good night said sturm with a glance at tanis but not goodbye they clasped hands kit my horse is stabled at the farriers will you meet me there thats good my beast is there too sunrise tomorrow sturm nodded and looked around for tas tas he called where did he get to i wanted to say goodbye tanis gestured toward the inn above he went back up i think sturm nodded and strode away into the cool night tanis and kitiara were left with the crickets which sang from the massive trees a symphony of hundreds walk with me asked tanis wherever you like kitiara replied they strolled a dozen paces from the inn before kitiara took the opportunity to slip her arm through taniss i have a thought she said slyly whats that that you should stay with me tonight it may be five years before we see each other again he halted and drew his arm free i cannot said tanis oh and why not there was a time not so long ago when you couldnt keep away from me yes in between the times you spent far away campaigning for whoever would pay you kitiara lifted her chin im not ashamed of what i do i dont expect you to be the point is ive come to realize more and more clearly that you and i are of two worlds kit worlds that can never hope to be reconciled so what are you saying i had a birthday while you were gone do you know how old i am ninetyseven ninetyseven years old kit if i were a human id be a withered ancient or dead she eyed his willowy form appreciatively youre not withered or ancient thats the point my elvish blood will extend my life far beyond the normal span of humans tanis stepped closer and took her hands while you kit will age and die kitiara laughed let me worry about that you wont i know you kit youre burning your youth out like a twoended candle in a gale how do you think i feel knowing that you might be killed in battle for some petty warlord while i would live on and on without you it has to end kit tonight here and now though it was dark and the white moon solinari was hidden by boughs of valenwood tanis saw the hurt in kitiaras expression it was there but an instant she mastered it and forced a superior smile maybe its just as well she said i never did like being tied down my poor fool of a mother was like that she never could get along without a husband to tell her whats what thats not my style i take after my father burning in the wind am i so be it i ought to thank you tanthalus halfelven for holding a mirror up to the truth he interrupted her tirade with a kiss it was a gentle brotherly kiss on the cheek kitiara glared its not what i want kit tanis said with great sorrow its how it must be she slapped him being the warrior she was kitiaras slap was no light tap tanis staggered and put a hand to his face a thin smear of blood showed in the corner of his mouth keep your pretty gestures she spat save them for your next lover if you find one who will it be tanis a fullblooded elf maiden but no the elves would despise you as a halfbreed you need a female version of yourself to love she marched away leaving tanis staring youll never find her kitiara called from the darkness never the crickets had quieted under kitiaras shouts in their own time they began to sing again tanis stood alone in the night finding no comfort in their song chapter high crest the sky hab not yet lost its violet hue when sturm reached the farriers shop tirien the farrier had his establishment in a vallenwood tree the winding ramp to tiriens shop was doubly wide and strongly braced for horses tirien ruddyfaced from leaning over forge fires and with heavily muscled arms and shoulders from wielding his farriers hammer was already up and about when the knight arrived sturm he boomed come in lad im just straightening some nails tiriens helper a boy named mercot plucked a redhot spike from the furnace with a pair of tongs he set the bent nail in the groove atop tiriens anvil and the brawny farrier smote it twice mercot flicked the straight nail into a bucket of water a serpents hiss and a wisp of steam arose i need my horse tirien said sturm right mercot fetch master brightblades animal the boys eyes widened rings of soot around them made him look like a startled owl the chestnut gelding aye and be quick about it said tirien to sturm he continued reshod him as you asked a good mount sturm paid his bill while mercot led tallfox his horse to the lower platform sturm had bought tallfox from a quekiri tribesman only a few weeks before and he was still learning the horses manners he shouldered his bedroll and pack and descended the ramp to where mercot had tied his mount tiriens hammer rang out again banging twisted scrap iron into arrowstraight horseshoe spikes sturm distributed his baggage over tallfoxs sides and rump he filled his water bottle and heard youre late kitiara was slouched in a corner under the liverys eaves she was wrapped to her ears in a red horse blanket am i asked sturm the sun is just rising when did you get here hours ago i slept here she said casting off the blanket underneath kitiara still wore the clothes shed had on the previous night she stretched her arms and braced the knots out of her stiff back why in the gods names did you sleep here asked sturm did you think id forget and leave without you oh not you noble friend it seemed like a good place to sleep thats all besides pira needed a shoe repaired sturm led tallfox down to the ground he swung into tallfoxs saddle and waited for his companion kitiara came loping down the ramp leading a rather nondescript brown and white spotted mare something wrong she asked mounting beside sturm i just imagined that you would prefer a fiery stallion for your mount he replied this ah quaint animal doesnt suit you at all this quaint animal will still be walking a steady pace long after that beast of yours is no more than bones and hide kitiara said her fitful sleep had not improved her temperament since her parting with tanis ive been on six campaigns with pira and shes always carried me home my apologies they rode out of solace north by east the new sun pierced the hills around solace and warmed the air sturm and kitiara breakfasted simply on jerky and water the fine dawn became an even finer morning and kitiaras spirits rose i cant be unhappy on the road she said theres too much to see and do we should be on guard as well sturm said i heard travelers in the inn say there were brigands about tshaw peasants on foot may have reason to fear brigands but two warriors armed and mounted its the robbers whod best be afraid sturm made polite assent but still kept his eyes on the horizon and his sword hilt handy their route was simple enough once clear of solaces hills the two would turn northwest and make for the coast on the shore of the straits of schallsea was a small fishing port called zaradene from there kitiara and sturm could easily take passage to caergoth in southern thelgaard north of caergoth lay solamnia proper their ultimate destination such was their plan but plans as said the sage wizard arcanist are like figures drawn in sand easily made and just as easily disturbed the forests and hills of abanasinia thinned with the miles kitiara filled the hours with tales of her past adventures my first hire was with mikkians marauders they were a bad lot mikkian was a lowborn lout from lemish he had the bad fortune of always losing parts of himself in battle an eye an arm half an ear pretty ugly he was and mean i walked into his camp sure of my skill with a blade in those days i had to pretend to be a boy else the churls would have ganged up on me she said how does one go about getting hired as a mercenary in mikkians band there was only one way kill one of his men mikkian had only so many openings on his payroll and he wouldnt expand it for anybody kitiara wrinkled her nose at the memories conjured up by mikkian worthless rogue the foot soldiers made a big ring and put me in it with a snaggletoothed axeman called now what was his name first man i ever killed trigneth drigneth some name like that so we went at it axe against sword it was not a pretty fight i tell you we had to stay in the dead center of the ring or mikkians boys would poke us with daggers and spear points trigneth drigneth fought like a woodcutter chop chop chop he never laid an edge on me i got him with a straight thrust right through the neck she regarded sturm he looked shocked how long were you with mikkians company he asked finally twelve weeks we sacked a walled town near takar and mikkian finally lost a part he couldnt do without sturm raised an eyebrow his head said kitiara that was the end of the marauders it was every man for himself and the whole company broke up looting and killing the townsfolk rose up and fought back wiping out the whole damn gang save for yours truly she smiled crookedly kitiara had a deep fund of such stories all exciting and nearly all bloody sturm found himself confused hed known her for about two years now and was no closer to understanding her this handsome bright woman possessed no small measure of wit and charm and yet was enamored with war on its basest level he had to admit he marveled at her strength and cunning but he feared kitiara a little too the road petered into a path and after a score of miles it merged into a stretch of sandy pine barrens the air grew still and heavy with moisture they camped in the barrens that night and the wind gave them their first smell of the sea pine knots made an acrid smoky campfire as kitiara fed the flames sturm watered the horses he returned to the dim circle of firelight and squatted on the sand kitiara handed him a cold mutton joint sturm gnawed the peppered meat and kitiara leaned back her feet to the fire and her head pillowed by her bedroll theres paladine she said see she pointed to the heavens paladine mishakal branchala she said naming each constellation in turn do you know the sky my boyhood tutor vedro was an astrologer sturm said not really answering he lifted his eyes it is said that the will of the gods can be divined by the movement of the stars and planets what gods kitiara replied lazily you dont believe in the gods why should i what have they done for the world lately or for me ever sturm could tell she was baiting him so he decided to drop the subject what is that group there he asked opposite paladine takhisis the queen of darkness oh yes the dragonqueen he tried to see the authoress of evil but to him it was only a spatter of stars the white orb of solinari climbed above the horizon in its glow the sandy hillocks and solitary pines were pale ghosts of their daytime selves not long after in the middle quadrant of the sky a red glow of equal size appeared now that i know said sturm lunitari the red moon luin to the ergothites redeye in goodlund a strange color for a moon dont you think said kitiara he tossed the naked mutton bone aside i didnt know there were proper colors for moons white or black are proper red means nothing she propped her head up so that lunitari was directly in her line of sight i wonder why its red sturm reclined on his bedroll the gods ordained it so lunitari is the abode of neutrality of neutral magic and illusion vedro theorized that the color came from the blood sacrificed to the gods he offered this cautiously other philosophers claim the red color represents the heart of huma the first knight of the dragonlance there was only silence from his companion kit he said quietly a rasp from the shadows revealed the result of his lecture kitiara was asleep the village of zaradene was a low brown smudge on the graywhite shore there were perhaps fifty weatherworn houses of varying size none with more than two stories sturm and kitiara rode down the face of a steeply sloping dune toward the village on the way they had to thread through lines of sharpened stakes buried in the sand with the points slanting out here and there the stakes were scorched by fire a hedgehog kitiara remarked a defense against cavalry the villagers must have been raided not long ago behind the stakes was a shallow trench which was spotted with black clots of blood soaked into the sand the faces of the people of zaradene were not friendly as sturm and kitiara rode up the single sandy track that was the main street sullen eyes and workgnarled hands clenched into fists seemed to be everywhere kitiara reined up and dismounted in front of a sagging gray tavern that bore the name three fishes odd white posts and rafter ends showed between the weatherworn clapboards sturm tied tallfox to one of the posts it was bone from some enormous longdead sea creature what do you suppose it was he asked kit curiously kitiara glanced at the bone and said sea serpent maybe come therell be shipmasters in here the three fishes tavern was well filled with patrons for so early an hour the first master that kitiara approached growled mercenaries and spat at her feet she almost drew her blade on him but sturm caught her wrist cut one and well have to fight them all he muttered be patient we must have a boat to cross the straits they tried half a dozen sea captains and were rebuffed each time kitiara was fuming sturm was puzzled hed voyaged before and knew that mariners usually liked to take on a few passengers they paid better than fishing or cargo did took care of themselves and didnt take up much deck space so why are the masters of zaradene so hostile he wondered they drifted to the bar kitiara called for ale but all the barkeep had was black wine of nostar after a sip of the bitter vintage sturm shoved his cup aside better to be thirsty he thought kitiara plunked one of her silvanesti coins on the dirty bar even in the dim tavern the glow of gold caught the barkeeps eye he came to the end of the bar where sturm and kitiara leaned you want something said the man a sheen of sweat coated his shaved head words said kitiara merely a few words for that amount of gold you can have all the words you want the barkeeper tucked his greasy rag under his arm sturm wondered idly which was dirtier the rag or the barkeeps canvas shirt what happened here asked kitiara they dont like mercenaries here ten nights ago horsemen attacked the village carried off everything they could grab including some women and children who were they sturm asked did they wear insignia some say they wasnt true men at all said the barkeeper some say they had hard dark skin and he looked from side to side to see if anyone else was listening and some say they had tails sturm started to ask another question but kitiara stopped him with a glance we need to buy passage to caergoth she said will anybody in zaradene take us dunno some of them lost heavy in the raid theyd as like to slit your throats as take you to sea the barkeep went back to dispensing his awful wares sturm surveyed the room i dont like this he said raiders with tails what sort of monsters could they have been dont take that ones mutterings too seriously kitiara said the farther you get from safe havens like solace the wilder and weirder the tales youll hear she tossed back the nostarian wine without a shudder skinhead is right about one thing we have no friends in this room from behind their backs a voice said be not certain of that me hearties sturm and kitiara faced the speaker he was a full head shorter than kitiara with sharply pointed features and a clean boyish face signs of elven blood kitiara saw a flash of tanis as she had last seen him blood on his lips his cheek red from her slap staring at her in shock tirolan ambrodel at your service he bowed from the waist mariner map maker gem cutter and piper tirolan reached for kitiaras hand and raised it to his lips he didnt kiss it but touched it to his forehead she smiled sturm introduced them both and asked can you provide us with transport to caergoth master ambrodel easily sir me craft high crest is laden with dunnage for that very port will it be just the two of you and two horses were traveling light kitiara said for two passengers and two horses i shall require five gold pieces each sturm gaped at the high price but kitiara laughed scornfully well give you four gold pieces for the both of us she said eight for both countered tirolan five she said and well pay in silvanesti gold tirolan ambrodels arched brows bunched over his thin nose true gold of eli kitiara picked up the coin from the bar and flashed it in the mariners face carefully almost tenderly tirolan reached for the elven gold he held the coin caressed it and ran his fingertips over the worn inscription very fine he said do you know that this coin is more than five hundred years old minted just before the lords of the east withdrew into the forest severing all ties with the human world how many of these relics have you tossed away for meat and wine i had a dozen said kitiara now i have five they are yours if you ferry us to caergoth done when do we sail asked sturm the tide ebbs with the first moons rise when the silver moon clears the grip of the sea we up anchor and away tirolan slipped the coin into a suede pouch on his belt now follow me and ill take you to the high crest sturm dropped some coins on the bar and they exited the tavern they led tallfox and pira through the streets of zaradene following as tirolan ambrodel led people turned from them everywhere they went one old crone uttered a charm against bad luck as tirolan passed the natives are very superstitious he said anything or anyone foreign is believed dangerous these days sturm looked back at the circle of stakes in the dunes above the town they have reason to be afraid he said zaradene had a single decrepit wharf sturm was uncertain the warped planks would hold tallfoxs weight but tirolan assured him that it was safe cargo far heavier than horses passed over the wharf every day he said wheres your boat asked kitiara me ship is beyond the headland yonder why anchor so far out sturm asked me vessel and crew are not well liked in zaradene when we must call here we moor in deep water so as to avoid trouble with the natives a wide shelllike lighter was tied to the pier a man lay asleep in the stern a ragged cap over his face tirolan jumped into the lighter startling the man into wakefulness this your boat said tirolan in a loud cheerful voice uh yeah well then hop to it man you can earn your grog money for the week the horses were led to a gangplank kitiara spoke soothingly to pira and the mare entered the rocking lighter without too much trouble tallfox on the other hand balked completely sturm wrapped the reins around his fists and tried to drag the terrified animal into the boat no no thats not the way said tirolan he hopped to the narrow gunwale and walked agilely to the foot of the gangplank may i master brightblade sturm reluctantly gave over the reins tallfox began to calm the moment tirolans slim hands stroked his neck tirolan spoke soothingly to the horse strong as you are and youre afraid of a little boat ride im not afraid am i better than you am i braver to sturm and kitiaras astonishment tallfox shook his head energetically and snorted then continued tirolan in quiet golden tones step down and take your place with your friends the chestnut gelding stepped daintily into the lighter and stood quietly next to pira their tails switched gently in time with the rocking of the boat how did you do that asked kitiara tirolan shrugged i have a way with animals after sculling away from the pier the boatman raised a tattered lateen sail the lighter skimmed between bobbing fishing craft and past the few major merchant ships in the harbor the laden boat ran uneventfully all the way to the southern headland then the wind died and the boatman went back to his sweep dark slateandindigo clouds piled up on the southern horizon against the blue and green of the sea stood the white hull of the high crest its shape was quite unlike the other boats in zaradene harbor the sheer line rose from the low sharp bow to a high poop the single lofty mast was painted white too and in the freshening air a green pennant rippled from the masthead me vessel said tirolan proudly isnt she beautiful ive never seen a white ship before said sturm its very handsome kitiara said she frowned privately at sturm and gestured to him amidships they huddled between their mounts this is getting stranger by the minute whispered kitiara an elven captain shunned by the local folk a strange white ship anchored far from other vessels theres more to this than meets the eye im glad i lied about how many gold coins i have sturm said i agree the way he charmed tallfox wasnt natural i think he used a spell to sturm steeped in the solamnic tradition there was no worse sign than the use of magic kitiara put a hand to his shoulder and said keep your sword handy all is well called tirolan over his shoulder very well said kitiara oh your ship is big they were now only a hundred yards from it and the high crest filled their view the white ship rode steadily in the waves anchored at both bow and stern the deck and rigging were empty but a boarding ladder hung over the bulwark waiting tirolan snared a dangling rope and tied the lighter fast to the high crest ho there me hearties show yourselves he sang out in a clear tenor the ships ghostly inactivity vanished in a flurry of bare feet and whoops a score of agile sailors all sharpfeatured and beardless poured onto the deck sturm found himself seized by eager hands and hauled to the deck kitiara followed carried by four smiling sailors she laughed and they set her on her feet beside sturm a sailor with white hair yet quite young looking approached tirolan and bowed to him hail kade berun said tirolan hail hail tirolan ambrodel weve two fine horses to bring aboard kade see to it will you horses i havent seen horses since kade berun glanced at sturm and kitiara since we left home he shouted some orders in a strange tongue and the lively sailors rushed to the rail overlooking the lighter they looked at tallfox and pira with unconcealed admiration the chatter ceased sling a boom called the boatman in the lighter ill fasten the harness and you can hoist them up the high crest crew did so and they all were quickly aboard the ship beneath the rapidly setting sun the sailors fell to quickly and soon had the high crest ready for sea the sail was raised a fat triangle of brilliant green fabric the high crest stirred and stood out from the abanasinian headland tirolan took the wheel and buried the ships bow in the tossing waves of the straits of schallsea kitiara discarded her black leather jerkin the breeze stirred her light linen blouse she closed her eyes and ran her fingers through her short black curls when she opened her eyes she spied sturm brooding by the bowsprit cheer up she said whacking him on the back the wind is fair and tirolan seems to know his trade well be in caergoth in no time i suppose sturm answered but i cant help being worried the last time i made a sea voyage in these waters was as a boy there was magic on that ship and things went badly for my mother and me for a time but you came through didnt you we did then be calm youre a knight in all but the ceremonial sense going to reclaim your rightful heritage maybe you dont realize it but ive got family in solamnia too the uth matars she nodded ive not had contact with them since my father left us in all my travels ive never penetrated the solamnic plain when you declared your intention to go north it seemed as good a time as any to do some exploring up there she raised an eyebrow the uth matars are a knightly line too you know no i didnt he realized he knew so little about her really she left him by the bowsprit and went below sturm slipped the strap off his chin and removed his helmet the twin brass horns were smudged hed have to polish them tonight for now he cradled the helmet against his chest and let the sea wind wash through his long tangled hair chapter the severed head hail captain tinolan said sturm blinking in fhe bright morning light hail hail sturm brightblade weve reached the cape of caer in splendid time did you rest well well enough why have we anchored so far from the harbor sturm asked kade handed his captain a loose hooded coat which tirolan slipped on the city folk here are even less fond of elves than those at zaradene here comes one of me boys now with a lighter for you he said tell kit were going he lifted the latch on the cabin door and bulled right in to find that kitiara was up and dressing a linen blouse beautifully embroidered with red and blue slid up over her bare shoulders shed already exchanged her heavy corduroy riding pants for baggy ergothicstyle trousers he could not help but stare im just about ready she said how does the city look he swallowed and said were a mile or two out tirolan fears the antielf sentiment in caergoth hes rowing ashore to scout things and im going with him good she picked up her sword belt and buckled it around her hips im ready too the four of them lowered the horses with a block and tackle kade held the painter line while tirolan sturm and kitiara climbed down into the boat the first mate cast them off and tirolan dug in with the oars it was a sultry morning hotter than any theyd had yet and a steamy calm hung over the water no one spoke as tirolan rowed toward the hazy line of the coast caergoth was a major port and the watercraft thickened as they drew nearer skiffs and dories ketches and pinnaces plied to and fro laden with fish crab and clams larger boats shuttled goods from the big merchant ships at rest in the main harbor tirolan swung his arms untiringly back and forth maneuvering the yawl between the bigger vessels skillfully kitiara craned her neck to see up the steep side of an ergothic argosy a quartet of sailors in woolly caps leaned over the rail and hooted at her she waved gaily and said to sturm id like to see how bold theyd be if we faced each other with swords in our hands once clear of the heavier ships the trio noticed a very strange vessel drawn up to the deepwater docks it was high and square with a pair of what looked like wagon wheels attached to each side the short mast was very thick and a signal fire seemed to be burning from its top a patch of grimy smoke drifted away from the ugly ship what in the world is that asked tirolan creeping nearer they saw that a heavy boom had been rigged to the crafts starboard side a barge lay alongside it and two enormous wooden crates were already on it a third crate fully as large as tirolans yawl was slowly being hoisted off the deck of the queer smoking ship its going to fall said tirolan watch the boom swung out revealing that the crate was wrapped up in a cago net clusters of small figures heaved against the weight of the crate in train the net sagged a corner poked through and the crate ripped free and crashed into the water just missing the loaded barge a string of little people shrieking in highpitched voices tumbled over the side tirolan chuckled loudly i shouldve known he said gnomes sturm knew the little people only by reputation they were incessant tinkerers makers of weird machinery and purveyors of endless theories disdaining magic gnomes were the most fervent technologists on krynn for centuries the gnomes and the knights of solamnia had maintained a pact of mutual aid since both groups distrusted the workings of magic tirolan rowed around the stern of the gnome ship kitiara pointed to an endless string of letters painted across the stern along the side under the bow it was the name of the ship the portion on the stern read principle of hydrodynamic compression and etheric volatility controlled by the most ingenious system of gears invented by the illustrious inventor hewhoutterspolynomialfractionswhilesleeping and on and on should we lend a hand sturm asked not unless you want to get wet said kitiara sure enough the gnomes on the barge who tried to rig up a life line succeeded only in falling overboard themselves tirolan rowed on i wonder what the crates contain sturm said as the gnomish pandemonium passed astern who knows a new machine to peel and core apples perhaps said tirolan heres the dock the elf captain shipped his oars and the yawl coasted in to the dock sturm slipped the bowline over a cleat and the three of them climbed the short ladder to the platform with a large block and tackle anchored to the dock for loading and unloading cargo they easily transported their horses to the dock and shore where to now asked sturm a row of grog shops and taverns lined the wharf and beyond them were great warehouses i dont know about you fellows kitiara said gazing at the line of public houses but im starved cant you wait objected sturm why should i she hitched her sword belt into its proper angle and set off trailing her horse behind her tirolan and sturm reluctantly followed she chose for no obvious reason a tavern called the severed head kitiara tied her horse outside kicked the door open and stood there surveying the room figures stirred in the dim recesses an odd fetid odor wafted out the door faw said tirolan that smell is not human come kit this is no place for us sturm tried to take her by the elbow and steer her away but kitiara would have none of it she jerked her arm free and stepped in im tired of barren roads and snug ships she said this looks like an interesting place be on your guard sturm muttered in tirolans pointed ear kits a good friend but long months of the quiet life in solace have made her reckless tirolan winked and followed kitiara inside there wasnt an actual bar in the severed head just a scattering of tables and benches kitiara swaggered to a table near the center of the room and threw one leg over the back of a chair barkeep she shouted in the darkness heads swiveled toward her sturm saw more than one pair of eyes glowing in the shadows they were red like the coals in a farriers furnace sturm and tirolan sat down warily a squat lumpish creature appeared by kitiaras elbow it puffed like a leaky bellows and each breath brought a fresh wave of foulness uhh said the lumpish creature ale she snapped uhuh ale she said a little louder the creature shook its upper body in negative fashion kitiara slapped the tabletop bring the specialty of the house she said this elicited an affirmative grunt the servant trundled around doublequick kit screeched and the creature ambled off something rose out of the taverns shadows it stood a good halfhead taller than sturm and was at least twice as wide the shambling hulk approached their table this is not a place for you said the hulk its voice was deep and hollow i dont know kitiara said airily ive been in worse this is not a place for you it repeated maybe we should go said tirolan quickly there are many taverns he eyed the door gauging the distance to it i already ordered sit down the hulk leaned over and rested a hand as big as a dinner plate and with four fingers on the table the hand was dry and scaly you go or i send you out said the hulk tirolan sprang up theres no need for trouble the creatures other arm shot out catching the elf in the chest tirolan staggered back his hood fell off his head revealing his elven features there was a general intake of breath in the room the hiss was enough to make the hair on sturms neck bristle kurtrah said the menacing creature sturm and kitiara stood smoothly but quickly swords flicked out of sheaths tirolan produced an elvish short sword and the three closed together back to back what have you gotten us into sturm asked keeping his blade on guard i just wanted a little fun kitiara replied whats the matter sturm do you want to live forever a threelegged stool hurtled out of the dark sturm knocked it aside with his blade not forever but a few more years would be nice somewhere in the gloom steel glinted move for the door tirolan said there are too many of these things in here to fight a clay mug shattered on an overhead beam showering them with shards and i can barely see them it would be nice to have a candle or two admitted kitiara one huge figure moved out of the shadows toward her it wielded a blade as wide as her palm but she parried disengaged and thrust into the darkness kitiara felt her sword point strike flesh and her attacker howled candle i can do better than that tirolan said he whirled and jammed his sword into the center of their table he began to sing in elvish hastily and shakily the blade of his weapon glowed red two creatures closed on sturm he beat against their heavier weapons making a lot of noise but accomplishing nothing tirolan we need you he barked the elf sang on the short sword was nearly white now smoke curled up from the tabletop an instant later the table burst into flame the enemy stood out in the first flash of fire there were eight of them great brawny lizardlike creatures in thickly quilted cloaks the light dazzled them and they retreated a few steps kitiara gave a battle cry and attacked she avoided a cut by her towering opponent and brought the keen edge of her sword down on the creatures arm the big sword clattered to the floor kitiara took her weapon in both hands and thrust it deep into her foes chest the creature bellowed in rage and pain and tried to get her with its clawed hand she recovered and thrust again the creature groaned once and fell on its face sturm traded cuts with two creatures the burning table filled the room with smoke and the creatures backed away gasping tirolan on sturms right was not doing well hed recovered his nowcool sword but the short weapon was doubly outclassed only his superior nimbleness was saving him from being cut down with a bang the creatures stormed the tavern door and smashed it aside flames had spread down the tables legs to the tinderdry floor out out sturm cried kitiara was still dueling so sturm grabbed her by the back of the collar and pulled her away let go leave me alone she threw an elbow at sturm he blocked the blow and shook kitiara listen to me the place is burning down around your ears get out he cried reluctantly she complied the smoke billowing from the upperstory windows had drawn a crowd of curious caergothians tirolan sturm and kitiara erupted into the street ahead of the flames sturm scanned the watching crowd but the strange lizard creatures were gone the three of them leaned on each other and coughed the rancid smoke from their lungs gradually sturm became aware of the silence of the crowd around them he lifted his head and saw that they all were staring at tirolan elf someone said making the word sound like a curse trying to burn down our town said another always causing trouble added a third back to the boat sturm murmured to tirolan and watch your back kitiara offered tirolans fee but he took only half the elvish sailor started off as sturm and kitiara mounted their horses he stopped though turned and tossed a shiny purple carved gem to kit a wink of his eye made her smile a gift was all he said the three of them then parted chapter a hint of purple kitiara and sturm rode up a winding trail to the sand cliffs overlooking the bay the high crest had shrunk to toy size in the distance after a last look at the elf ship they turned their horses inland they soon reached the road outside the walls of caergoth from the sutlers and traders who lined the road they bought bread and meat dried fruit and cheese the road ran as straight as an arrow east domed and cobbled it was one of the few public works remaining from precataclysmic times kitiara and sturm rode side by side down the center of the road its shoulders were fairly thick with travelers on foot at least for the first ten miles or so from the city by midafternoon they were alone they said little kitiara finally broke the silence saying i wonder why there are no travelers on the way to caergoth i was puzzled by that myself said sturm a bare road is a bad sign war or robbers beset empty roads ive heard no rumors of wars so it must be the latter they paused by the side of the road long enough to don their mail shirts and helmets no sense catching an arrow when they were so close to reaching solamnia the eerie desolation persisted to the end of the day now and again they passed the burnedout remains of a wagon or the blanched bones of slaughtered horses and cattle kitiara rode with her sword across her saddle they were tired from the days morning mayhem and decided to camp early they found a pleasant clearing in a ring of oaks a hundred yards from the road tallfox and pira were tied to a picket line to graze on grass and broom straw sturm found a spring and fetched water while kitiara built a fire dinner was bacon and hard biscuit toasted over the fire night closed in and they moved closer to the flames smoke wound in a loose spiral toward the stars the moons were up solinari and lunitari souls rise up like smoke to heaven sturm thought sturm kitiaras voice brought him out of his reverie yes well have to sleep in turns quite so ah ill stand watch first all right suits me kitiara circled around the campfire with her bedroll she unrolled it beside sturm and lay down wake me when the silver moon sets she said he looked down at the mass of dark curls by his knee veteran that she was kitiara soon dropped off sturm fed the fire from a handy pile of kindling and sat crosslegged with his sword across his lap once kitiara stirred uttering faint moans hesitantly sturm touched her hair she responded by snuggling closer to him until her head was resting on his crossed ankles he never felt the lethargy creep over him one minute sturm was awake facing the fire with kitiara asleep in front of him and the next thing he knew he was lying facedown on the ground there was dirt in his mouth but for some reason he couldnt spit it out worse he couldnt seem to move at all one eye was mashed shut against the ground with tremendous effort he was able to open the other he saw the fire still burning there were several pairs of legs around it clad in ragged deerskin leggings there was an odd unpleasant smell like singed hide or burning hair kitiara was beside him lying on her back her eyes closed nuttin but food said a scratchy bass voice deres nuttin in dis bag but some lousy food me me said another shriller voice me find coin one pair of legs ambled out of sturms sight where da coins he heard a tinkle of metal one of kitiaras last silvanesti gold coins dropped on the ground the shrill speaker said ai and dropped on his hands and knees then sturm saw who what they were there was no mistake the pointed heads angular features gray skin red eyes they were goblins the smell was theirs too sturm tried to muster all his strength to stand but it felt as though bars of lead were piled on his back he could see and feel enough to know he wasnt tied that and the suddenness with which he was taken meant that someone had cast a spell on him and kitiara but who goblins were notoriously dimwitted they lacked the concentration necessary for spellcasting stop your bickering and keep searching said a clear human voice so the goblins were not alone hard bony hands grabbed his left arm and rolled him over sturms one open eye stared into the face of two of the robbers one was warty and had lost his front teeth the other bore scars on his neck from a failed hanging ai him eye open squawked the warty one he see scarface produced an ugly forkbladed dagger i fix dat he said before he could strike the helpless sturm another brigand yelped the others quickly converged on him i found i found babbled the goblin what he had found was the arrowhead amethyst tirolan had given kitiara she had tied a string around the carved shoulders of the stone and had been wearing it around her neck the finder held it up and capered away from his fellows they slapped and clawed at him for the pale purple stone let me see that said the man the dancing goblin halted and contritely carried the amethyst into the shadows beyond the fire rubbish said the man a flawed bit of crystal the arrowhead arced through the air it hit the dirt between sturm and kitiara and bounced into kitiaras slack and open palm the goblins scampered over to retrieve it leave it the man commanded its worthless pretty pretty protested warty me keep i said leave it or shall get the wand the goblins sturm estimated there were four shrank back and gibbered well take the coins and the horses leave the rest said the robbers human master what about da swords said scarface dese is good irun he held out sturms sword for his leader to see yes too good for you bring it it will fetch good money at trader lovos get the womans too warty hopped over to kitiara he kicked her arm aside and bent over to draw the sword which lay under her as he did her hand clamped around the goblins ankle wha said the wartfaced goblin kitiara yanked his leg out from under him and the goblin went down with a thud in the next instant she was up sword in hand warty groped for his dagger but never drew it with one cut kitiara sent his ugly head bouncing away get her get her you miserable wretches its three against one yelled the man from the shadows scarface pulled a hookbladed bill off his shoulder and attacked kitiara knocked the clumsy weapon away repeatedly the other two goblins tried to circle behind her she turned so that the fire was at her back sturm raged against the spell that kept him helpless a goblins foot passed within easy reach of his right hand but he couldnt even flex a finger to help kitiara not that she needed any help when scarface lunged with his bill she lopped the hook off the goblin stared stupidly at his shortened shaft kitiara thrust through him now its two to one she said she leaped over the campfire landing between the last two robbers they screeched in terror and dropped their daggers she cut one down as he stood there the last goblin ran to the edge of the clearing sturm heard him die among the oaks there were a few other sounds feet running loud breathing and a howl of pain thought you could get away eh kitiara said she had caught the hidden magicuser and brought him back into the firelight he was a gaunt fellow twice sturms age dressed in a shabby gray robe tools of his art dangled from a rope tied around his waist a wand a bag of herbs amulets wrought in lead and copper kitiara kicked the magicians legs out from under him and he sprawled in the dirt beside sturm take the spell off my friend kitiara demanded ii cant you mean you wont she poked him with her sword no no i dont know how i dont know how to take it off he seemed ashamed i never had to take a paralysis spell off before the goblins always cut their throats because you ordered them to no no kitiara spat the only thing worse than a thief is a fool weakling of a thief she raised her blade to her shoulder theres only one way to break the spell that i know of she was right and when the magicuser was dead the leaden feeling vanished from sturms limbs he sat up rubbing his stiff neck by all the gods kitiara youre ruthless he said he looked around the campsite now a bloody battlefield did you have to kill them all theres gratitude for you she said she wiped her blade on the tail of the dead magicians robe they would have cheerfully cut our throats sometimes i dont understand you sturm he remembered the goblins forkbladed dagger and said you have a point still killing that scruffy magician was no honorable deed she slid her blade into its sheath i didnt do it for honor she said i was just being practical they gathered their belongings from where the robbers had scattered them sturm saw kitiara pick up the amethyst necklace look she said its clear in the light from the fire sturm saw that the oncepurple stone was now ordinary transparent quartz that explains it he said you were able to move when the amethyst fell into your hand yes the light dawned on her thats right i was wearing it over my blouse and under my mail when it touched your skin the paralysis spell was broken the dissipation of the spell bled all the color from the stone its just an arrowheadshaped piece of quartz now kitiara slipped the loop over her head ill keep it just the same tirolan probably never realized he was saving our lives when he gave me the stone their baggage recovered sturm began to gather dead wood from the circle of oaks and heaped it on the fire the flames leaped up why are you doing that asked kitiara im making a pyre said sturm we cant leave these corpses lying about let the vultures have them its not out of respect that i do this evil magicians even one as lowly as this one have the unhappy habit of returning undead to prey on the living help me put them onhe pyre and their menace will truly be over she agreed and the goblins and their master were consigned to the flames sturm flung dirt on the embers then he and kit mounted their horses how do you know so much about magic asked kitiara i thought you despised it in all forms i do sturm replied magic is the greatest underminer of order in the world its difficult enough to live with virtue and honor without the temptation of magical power but magic exists and we all must learn to deal with it for myself have had many talks with your brother and ive learned some things ive needed to defend myself you mean raistlin she asked and sturm nodded his lectures on magic always put me to sleep she said i know said sturm you go to sleep awfully easily they turned the horses toward the new mornings sun and rode away chapter cloudmaster the day after the robbers attack was oppressively humid tallfox and pira needed frequent watering for their heads would sag and their gait falter they entered a district of orchards and farms with a good view from the road on all sides kitiara and sturm discarded their mail for shirtsleeves and by noon kitiara had pulled her blouse loose and tied the tails together around her waist thus cooled they paused in a fig grove for lunch too bad theyre green said kitiara pinching an immature fig between her thumb and forefinger i like figs i doubt that the orchards keeper would share your enthusiasm unless you paid for what you ate said sturm he hollowed a large biscuit and filled the hole with chopped dried fruit and cheese oh come on havent you ever snitched apples or pears stolen a chicken and roasted it over a bark fire while the farmer hunted for you with a pitchfork no never i have and few things in life taste as sweet as the food you season with wit she dropped the fig branch and joined sturm under the tree you never considered what your witty little thefts might do to the farmer did you kit that he or his family might go hungry for a night because of your filched meal she bristled a fine one you are to talk master brightblade since when did you ever work for the food that went into your belly its very easy for a lords son to speak of justice for the poor never having been poor himself sturm counted silently until his anger subsided i worked he said simply when my mother her handmaid carin and i first arrived in solace twelve years ago we had some money that wed brought with us but soon it ran out and we were in dire straits my mother was an intensely proud woman and would not take charity mistress carin and i did odd jobs around solace to put food on the table we never told my mother kitiaras prickly demeanor softened what did you do he shrugged because i was able to read and write i got a job with derimius the scribe copying scrolls and manuscripts not only was i able to earn five silver pieces a week but i got to read all sorts of things i never knew thatin fact i met tanis at derimiuss shop he brought in a ledger that he kept for flint tanis had spilled some ink on the last pages and wanted derimius to replace them with new parchment tanis saw a sixteenyearold boy scribbling away with a gray goose quill and inquired about me we talked and became friends this statement was punctuated by a roll of faroff thunder the sultry air had collected in a mass of blueblack thunderheads piling up in the western sky they were moving quickly eastward so sturm crammed the last of his lunch in his mouth and jumped to his feet he mumbled something through bread and cheese what said kitiara horses must secure the horses lightning lanced down from the clouds to the hills where the robbers had been vanquished wind blew out of the upper air swirling dust into sturm and kitiaras eyes they tied tallfox and pira to a fig tree and hastily rigged their blankets as a shelter to keep the rain off down the road kitiara could see a wall of rain advancing toward them here it comes she said the storm broke over the fig grove with all its fury rain hammered the skimpy screen of blankets down on their heads in seconds sturm and kitiara were completely soaked rain collected between the rows of trees and filled the low places water climbed over kitiaras toes tallfox couldnt bear it a nervous beast by nature he reared and neighed as the storm played around him his terror infected the usually stolid pira and both horses started straining against their tethers a bolt of lightning hit the tallest tree in the orchard and blasted it into a million burning fragments the horses driven beyond terror tore free and galloped away tallfox fleeing east and pira veering north after them sturm cried above the din he and kitiara splashed off after their respective mounts tallfox was a longlegged sprinter and he galloped in a straight line pira was a hardcornering dodger she wove among the leafy fig trees changing direction a dozen times in twenty places kitiara stumbled after her cursing her favorites agility the orchard ended in a gully kitiara slid down the muddy bank and into calfdeep water pira she called pira you peabrained nag where are you all she got for her shouting was a mouth full of water she scanned both sides of the gully for tracks in the lightnings glare kitiara saw a strange thing an angular black shape like a warriors shield was silhouetted against the clouds some forty feet overhead the dazzling glow faded but not before she saw a long line trailing below the shield to the ground kitiara slogged forward not knowing what she would find tallfox easily outran his master but sturm was able to follow the chestnuts prints in the mud a wall of closely growing cedar saplings blocked the end of the orchard there was only one gap wide enough for a horse to pass through and sure enough sturm found tallfoxs trail there he plunged into the dense tangle of evergreen broken saplings told well which way his horse had gone the lightning was unusually active overhead it crackled and pulsed from cloud to cloud one prolonged stroke illuminated a wonder to sturms eyes an enormous bird fluttered in the storm wind the bird wobbled from side to side but never flew off another bolt of lightning crackled and he saw why someone had tied cords to the birds feet kitiara climbed a hill of solid mud her hair was plastered to her head and her clothing felt as if it had absorbed a ton of water at the top of the hill she could see down into a wide clearing there was no sign of pira there was however plenty to see in the center of the clearing was a thing such as kitiara had never seen it was like a huge boat with large leather sails furled along each side there were no masts but the prow was long and pointed like a birds beak and there were wheels on the underside of the hull above the boat tied to it by a rope netting was a big canvas bag a huge eggshaped bag squirmed and writhed in the wind like a living thing a swarm of little men surrounded the boatthing beyond them a couple of tall poles rose straight up from the ground from the tops of these four poles long ropes whipped about and at the end of the ropes were more of the warriors shields that kitiara had seen at the same time sturm emerged from the cedars on the opposite side of the same clearing he gaped at the thing wordlessly he headed toward it a little man in a shiny hat and long coat greeted sturm ggreetings and felicittationsl he said cheerily hello said a bewildered sturm what is going on here even as he spoke a bolt of lightning struck one of the birds tethered on a pole the same thing kitiara had mistaken for a shield bluewhite fire coursed down the line to the pole from the pole it flashed along another line a foot off the ground until it reached the boatthing where it vanished the boat swayed on its wheels then settled back ddoing well charging up as you ccan see said the little man when he flipped the wide brim of his hat back sturm saw his pale eyes and bushy white brows and realized that he was a gnome it really is a wwonderful storm were so llucky kitiara wandered around the oddlooking craft warily keeping her distance by one especially vivid bolt of lightning she saw sturm talking to the little fellow she cupped her hands around her lips and yelled sturm kit she joined him did you find the horses no i was hoping they ran to you she waved her arms in great circles i fell in a ditch so i see what are we going to do ahem said the gnome ddo i understand that you ttwo have lost your mmeans of transportation thats right said sturm and kitiara in unison fortuitous ffate perhaps we can help one another he flipped the brim of his hat down again a tiny torrent of water spilled down his coat will you ccome with me where are we going asked sturm for nnow out of the wweather said the gnome im for that said kitiara the gnome led them up a ramp into the left side of the boat the interior was brightly lit warm and dry their guide removed his hat and coat he was a mature male of his race with a fine white beard and bald pink head he gave sturm and kitiara each a towel which being sized for gnomes was no bigger than a handtowel sturm dried his hands and face kitiara loosened some of the mud from hers wrung out the towel and tied it scarffashion around her head ffollow me said the gnome my ccolleagues will join us llater theyre busy now ggathering the lightning with this amazing statement he led them down a long narrow passage between two banks of machinery of unfathomable purpose all the rods cranks and gears were skillfully wrought in iron or brass and carefully hollowed out their guide came to a small ladder which he ascended the upper deck they entered was subdivided into small cabins hammocks were slung from hooks and all sorts of boxes crates and great glass demijohns were packed on every inch of floor space only a narrow track down the center of the passage was clear for walking they climbed a second ladder and were in a house built in the center of the deck there were portholes in the walls and sturm could see that rain still lashed at them the deckhouse was split into two large rooms the forward room where they entered was fitted like a ships wheelhouse a steering wheel was set at the bow end which was extensively glazed with many glass panels all sorts of levers sprouted from the floor and ceiling and there were mysterious gauges labeled altitude indicated air speed and density of raisins in breakfast muffins kitiara introduced them the gnomes eyes widened and he smiled benignly when he learned that sturm was the son of an ancient solamnic family ever curious he inquired after kitiaras antecedents she turned his query aside and described their journey so far their goal and their general frustration at having lost their horses pperhaps i can be of sservice said the gnome my name is hewhostuttersappropriatelyinthemmidstofthemostabstrusetechnicalexplanations sturm interrupted knowing the length of gnomish names please what do those not of the gnomish race call you the gnome sighed and said very slowly i am often ccalled stutts a wholly inadequate approximation of my true nname it has the virtue of brevity said sturm bbrevity my dear knight is no virtue to those who love knowledge for its own ssake stutts folded his stubby fingers across his round belly i should like to offer you a pposition if under the circumstances you are iinterested what sort of position asked kitiara my ccolleagues and i arrived here today from caergoth the awkward spectacle of the gnome ship in caergoth harbor came to the humans minds we ccame to this region of solamnia because the weather patterns are well known for vviolent thunderstorms sturm brushed his drying mustache with his fingers you were seeking a storm pprecisely the lightning is vital for the operation of oui mmachine stutts smiled and patted the arm of his chair isnt it a bbeauty it is called the ccloudmaster what does it do it fflies oh of course it does kitiara said with a chuckle very ingenious of you gnomes what does that have to do with sturm and me stuttss small face flushed a deeper shade of pink ahem wweve had a bit of bbad luck you see in calculating the opoptimal lifttoweight ratio someone failed to consider the effect of the cloudmaster coming to rrest on soil in an advanced state of hydration what did you say were ststuck in the mud said stutts turning pink again and you want us to dig you out asked kitiara for which we will ggratefully fly you to any point on krynn that you wish to go enstar bbalifor or far karthay the plains of solamnia were where we were headed said sturm thats as far as we need to go kitiara swung an elbow into sturms ribs youre not taking this little lunatic seriously are you she hissed from the corner of her mouth i know gnomes he replied their inventions work with surprising regularity but i dont stutts hopped up youll want to ddiscuss it may i suggest you clean up have a good mmeal and then ddecide we have a cleansing station on board like nothing youve sseen before im sure of that kitiara muttered they agreed to bathe and dine with the gnomes stutts pulled a light chain that hung from the ceiling by the steering wheel a deepthroated ah oo gah echoed through the flying ship a young gnome in greasy coveralls and with very bushy red eyebrows appeared show our gguests to the cleansing station said stutts the bushybrowed gnome whistled a string of notes in reply no one at a ttime stutts said bushybrows whistled again does he always talk like that queried kitiara yes my ccolleague here he recited about five minutes of gnomename has evolved the theory that spoken language was derived from the songs of birds you may call him stutts paused and looked at the bushybrowed fellow who tweeted and chirped stutts continued birdcall birdcall took sturm and kitiara below deck to the stern there with whistles and gestures he indicated two cubicles on either side of the corridor the doors bore identical signs that read rapid and hygienic cleansing station perfected and provided to the flying ship cloudmaster by the guild of hydrodynamic masters and journeymen and the apprentices of mt nevermind level twelve sancrist ansalon krynn sturm looked from the door to kitiara do you think it works he asked only one way to find out she replied pulling the filthy towel from her head and dropping it on the floor she stepped through the door and it swung shut behind her with a soft click the tile walls inside the cleansing station were covered with writing kitiara squinted at the handpainted script some of it ran sideways and some of it was upside down most of the writing concerned proper and scientific bathing procedure some of it was nonsense she saw a line that declared the absolute value of the density of raisins in the perfect muffin is sixteen and some of the writing was rude the inventor of this station has dung for brains she peeled off her outer clothing and put it in a convenient wicker basket kitiara stepped to a raised wooden platform there was a ghastly rubbery hissing sound an water began to spray from a pipe above her head it caught her by surprise so she clamped a hand over the spoutin end no sooner had she stopped one spray than another started from the wall on her left that one she plugged with a finger then the real melee began with mud and water trickling down her face kitiara heard a rattling and squeaking behind her she twisted around without unstopping the spouts a square tile on the wall had popped open revealing a jointed metal rod that was unfolding and reaching out for her on the end of the rod was a round pad of fleece rapidly spinning wheels and pulleys set along the jointed rod made the sheepskin turn what a time to be without a sword kitiara said aloud the rod wavered and came toward her it was a moment of decision she accepted the challenge and released the pipes water gushed out sluicing the mud from her body kitiara grappled with the whirling fleece grabbing it with both hands the pulleys whined and the cords twanged finally she succeeded in snapping the rod off at the first joint the water stopped kitiara stood panting as the water drained through slots in the floor there was a knock on the door kit sturm called are you finished before she could reply a heavy piece of cloth dropped from the ceiling over her head she yelled and threw fists at her unseen attacker but all she hit was air kitiara pulled the cloth off her head it was a towel she dried off and wrapped herself in it sturm was in the corridor likewise swathed in a dry blanket what a place he said grinning more widely than kitiara had ever seen him do im going to have a few words with stutts she declared whats wrong i was attacked in there stutts appeared is there a pproblem kitiara was about to voice her outrage but stutts wasnt actually speaking to her he bustled on by and opened a panel in the wall inside a rather harriedlooking gnome lay in a tangle with a threelegged stool at the gnomes waist level was a handcrank labeled cleansing station number rotary washing device is that what i was fighting kitiara said looks that way said an amused sturm the poor fellow was just doing his job the fleece is like a washcloth only he does the scrubbing for you i can do my own scrubbing thank you she said sourly stutts mopped his face with his sleeve this is all vvery distressing i must ask you mistress kitiara to not ddamage the machinery now i shall have to write a report in quiquintuplicate to the aerostatics guild ill keep an eye on her sturm said kit has a tendency to bash things she doesnt understand birdcall came down the corridor whistling furiously stutts brightened oh ggood time for ddinner the gnomes dined in the rear half of the deckhouse a long plank table was suspended from the ceiling as on an oceangoing ship but the gnomes had improved on the sailors arrangement by hanging their seats from the ceiling too they swung happily from side to side thus sturm and kitiara had to squeeze into narrow chain swings just to sit at the table dinner proved ordinary enough beans ham cabbage muffins and sweet cider stutts apologized they had no scientifically trained cook on board the warriors were grateful for that the gnomes ate rapidly and without conversation because it was more efficient the sight of ten bowed balding heads accompanied only by the sound of spoons scraping on plates was a little unnerving sturm cleared his throat and said perhaps we ought to introduce ourselves everyone knows who you are said stutts without looking up i ssent out a memorandum while you were bbeing cleansed then you can introduce your crew to us said kitiara stuttss head snapped up theyre nnot crew we are ccolleagues pardon me kitiara rolled her eyes you are ppardoned he spooned the last of his beans swiftly into his mouth but if you insist stutts slipped from his swinging seat and walked down the row of eating gnomes he gave a yawningly elaborate profile of each of his colleagues including the name by which those not of the gnomish race could call each one sturm distilled all of this into a short mental list birdcall chief mechanic in charge of the engine wingover stuttss righthand gnome in charge of actually flying the machine sighter astronomer and celestial navigator roperig expert with rope cord wire cloth and so forth fitter roperigs apprentice flash collector and storer of lightning bellcrank chief metal worker and chemist cutwood in charge of carpentry woodwork and all nonmetal parts rainspot weather seer and physician by designation how did you come to build this uh machine asked sturm it is part of my life quest said wingover a tallerthanaverage gnome with a hawklike nose complete and successful aerial navigation thats my goal after years of experimenting with kites i met our friend bellcrank who has discovered a very rarefied air which when enclosed in a suitable bag will float and support other objects of weight preposterous said sighter this socalled ethereal air is humbug listen to the stargazer the tubby bellcrank said with a sneer how do you think we were able to fly to this point from caergoth eh magic the wings supported us sighter replied with heat the lift ratios clearly show it was the ethereal air retorted rainspot who sat by bellcrank wings shouted sighters side of the table air cried bellcranks allies colleagues ccolleagues stutts said holding up his hands for quiet the ppurpose of our expedition is to establish with scientific accuracy the ccapabilities of the cloudmaster let us not argue needlessly about theories until the ddata is available the gnomes lapsed into sullen silence rain drummed on the skylight over the table the hostile silence lingered for an embarrassing length of time then rainspot lifted his eyes to the dark panes and said the rain is stopping a few seconds later the steady thrumming ceased completely how did he know that asked kitiara theories differ said wingover a committee is meeting even now on sancrist isle to study our colleagues talent how can they study him when hes up here sturm wondered he was ignored its his nose cutwood said his nose kitiara asked because of the size and relative angle of rainspots nostrils he can detect changes in relative air pressure and humidity just by breathing hogwash roperig said hogwash echoed fitter the smallest and youngest of the gnomes from his place by roperig its his ears continued roperig he can hear the rain stop falling from the clouds before it reaches the ground unmitigated tommyrot that was sighter again any fool can see its his hair that does it he can feel the roots uncurl when the moisture in the air falls bellcrank sitting opposite sighter snatched up a muffin from the table and bounced it off his rivals chin flash and fitter pounced on the fallen muffin and broke it open twelve thirteen fourteen flash counted whats he doing sturm asked ccounting raisins answered stutts thats his current project to determine the world average density of raisins in muffins kitiara dropped her face into her hands and moaned the dinner debacle over the gnomes left the flying ship to dismantle their equipment in the meadow kitiara and sturm now dry dressed in enough clothing to hike back to their campsite in the fig orchard and pick up their gear the storm had blown itself out and stars showed in the ragged holes between the clouds are we doing the right thing asked kitiara these gnomes havent got all their bootlaces tied sturm glanced back at the queer machine lying cockeyed in the muddy field they are lacking in common sense but theyre tireless and creative if they can get us to the high plains of solamnia in a day then i for one dont mind helping to dig them out of the mud i dont believe that thing can fly she said we never saw it fly for all we know the storm blew it here they reached the sodden remains of their camp and packed up their scattered belongings kitiara hoisted piras saddle on her shoulder blast that horse she said raised her from a filly i did and she never looked back once she got loose ill bet shes halfway to garnet by now tallfox was a bad influence i fear tirien warned me that he was skittish it may be that tallfox had the right idea kitiara said how so said sturm she slung the damp bedroll over the saddle if the gnomes can do half the things they claim we may end up wishing wed run away in the storm too chaptea hours minutes higgher higher get that balk in place sturm grunted against the massive weight of the gnomes flying ship he and kitiara strained against a roughhewn lever theyd made over the gnomes protests crude levers the gnomes protested bellcrank claimed that any gnome could invent a device ten times better for lifting heavy objects of course it would take a committee to study the stress analysis of the local wood as well as to calculate the proper pivot point for raising the ship no kitiara had insisted if you want us to help get your ship out of the mud then well do it our own way the gnomes had shrugged and rubbed their bare pates trust humans to do things the crudest way the gnomes rolled several large rocks up to the hull these would be the fulcrums after sturm and kitiara had made the ship level the gnomes shoved short thick timber balks into place to brace it upright it was slow sweaty labor but by noon of the day after the storm the flying ship was finally on an even keel a problem wingover announced now what kitiara asked the landing gear must have a firm surface on which to roll therefore it will be necessary to construct a roadbed here ive made calculations as to how much crushed stone and mortar well need kitiara plucked the paper from his hand and tore it in two ive gotten wagons out of mud before she said by putting straw or twigs in the ruts might work sturm said but this thing is very heavy he spoke to stutts who promptly removed the protesting gnomes from their important though completely useless improvement work and set them to gathering windfall branches and brushwood they all turned out except bellcrank who was busy with his pots of powders and vials of noxious liquids i must attend to my first task generating the ethereal air he said pouring iron filings from a keg when the air bag is filled it will help lighten the ship you do that said kitiara she leaned against the hull to watch she didnt like strenuous work work was for dullards and peasants not warriors the gnomes returned with a scant armful of brush nine of you and thats all you have sturm said incredulously roperig and sighter disagreed on which kind of sticks to bring so in the spirit of cooperation we didnt pick up either of their choices wingover said wingover sturm said pleadingly please tell roperig and sighter that the kind of wood doesnt matter in the least we just want something dry for the wheels to run over the tallish gnome dropped his bundle of sticks and led his fellows back to the woods meanwhile bellcrank had managed to enlist kitiaras aid in inflating the cloudmasters air bag on the ground beside the ship hed set up a big clay tub five feet wide he poured powdered iron and other bits of scrap metal in the tub and smoothed the pile out around the edges lower away he told kitiara and she set a domed wooden lid like the top half of a beer barrel on top of the ceramic tub bellcrank worked around the outside poking a long strip of greased leather into the joint it must be tight he explained or the ethereal air will seep out and not fill the bag she hoisted the gnome up and set him on top of the barrel with a corkscrew bellcrank popped a large cork in the top of the barrel hand me the hose he said v this asked kitiara holding up a limp tube of canvas the very thing she gave it to him and he tied it over the neck of a wooden turncock now said bellcrank for the vitriol there were three very large demijohns sitting in the tall grass kitiara stooped to pick one up oof she gasped feels like a keg of ale its concentrated vitriol be careful not to spill it it can burn you very badly she set the heavy jug down by the tub you dont expect me to pour that stuff in there do you bellcrank said no indeed i have a most efficacious invention that will circumvent such tiresome duty hand me the excellent mouthless siphon would you kitiara cast about but saw nothing that resembled an excellent mouthless siphon bellcrank pointed with his stubby finger that there the bellowslooking item yes she gave him the mouthless siphon bellcrank put the beak of the bellows into the demijohn and pulled the handles apart the sinister brown liquid in the jug sank by an inch there the gnome said triumphantly no sucking on tubes no spillage he pushed the beak into the hole in the barrel where the cork had been and emptied the vitriol ha ha gnomish science overcomes ignorance again bellcrank repeated the siphoning four more times before kitiara noticed vapor escaping from the leather hinges of the excellent mouthless siphon bellcrank she said hesitantly not now the process has begun and it must be kept going at a steady pace but the siphon a drop of vitriol seeped through a hole that it had eaten in the hinge of the siphon and splashed on bellcranks shoe he carelessly flung the siphon away and began hopping around on one foot trying desperately to pry the shoe off his foot the vitriol ate the buckle strap in two and with a mighty kick bellcrank flung the shoe away it missed the returning fitters nose by a whisker oh reorx said bellcrank sadly the excellent mouthless siphon was a pile of steaming fragments never mind kitiara said whe wrapped her arms around the vitriol jug and planted her feet firmly haiyup she grunted and raised the demijohn to bellcranks level he guided the jugs mouth and soon a steady stream of the acrid fluid was spilling into the ethereal air generator the hose from the keg to the air bag swelled the sagging bag itself began to fill out and grow firmer inside its web of netting soon all the rope rigging and tackle was taut the bag strained against the confining ropes at bellcranks signal kitiara lowered the heavy demijohn sturm came around the bow with the other gnomes the ruts are full of brush he said the bag is full of ethereal air said bellcrank my back is killing me said kitiara what next we ffly said stutts all colleagues to their flying ststations stutts wingover and the two humans went into the forward end of the deck house the other gnomes lined the rail release ballast cried wingover release bballast stutts called out an open porthole the gnomes took up long sausageshaped bags that lined the rail the ends opened and sand poured out the gnomes flung sand over the side getting as much in their own eyes as they did out of the ship this went on until sturm felt the deck shift under his feet kitiara wideeyed grabbed the brass rail that ran around the wheelhouse at the gnomes shoulder height open front wings cried wingover opening ffront wings stutts replied he leaned against a lever as tall as he was and shoved it forward a rattle a screech and the leather sails that kitiara and sturm had noticed on the hull unfolded into long graceful batlike wings the goatskin covering the bony ribs was pale brown and translucent ffront wings open stutts reported wind caught in them and the ship lifted an inch or two at the bow open rear wings opening rear wwings a slightly wider and longer pair of leatherclad wings blossomed aft of the deckhouse set tail the gnomes on deck ran out a long spar and clamped it to the stern roperig and fitter clambered over the spar attaching lines to pulleys to hooks they unfolded a fanshaped set of ribs also covered in goatskin by the time they finished the cloudmaster was swaying and bucking off the ground wingover flipped the cover off a speaking tube hello birdcall are you there a shrill whistled answered tell flash to start the engine there was a sizzle and a loud crack and the deck quivered beneath their feet wingover twirled a brass ring handle and threw another tall lever the great wings rose slowly in unison the cloudmaster lost contact with the ground down came the wings folding inward as they came the flying ship lurched forward its wheels sucking free of the mud and bouncing over the scattered brush the wings beat again faster wingover grasped the steering wheel in both his small hands and pulled the wheel swung toward him the bow pitched up the wings flapped crazily and the cloudmaster was borne aloft into the blue afternoon sky hurray hhurray stutts said jumping up and down the cloudmaster climbed steadily wingover eased the wheel forward and the bow dropped kitiara yelled and lost her footing sturm let go of the handrail to try to catch her and he fell too he rolled against one of the levers knocking it out of place and the wings instantly stopped moving the cloudmaster wobbled and plunged toward the ground there were several seconds of stark terror sturm disen tangled himself from the lever and hauled back on it the wings sang as the taut skin bit the air stutts and kitiara in a knot rolled to the rear of the room shakily wingover steadied the ship i think passengers ought to leave the wheelhouse wingover said his voice shook with fear at least until you get your air legs i agree said sturm from his hands and knees he grabbed the handle of the door and crept out on deck kitiara and stutts crawled out behind him the rushing wind was strong on deck but by taking firm hold of the rail and leaning into it kitiara found it tolerable the wings flexed up and down in close harmony kitiara slowly straightened her legs she looked over the side great lord of battle she exclaimed we must be miles and miles straight up stutts boosted himself to the rail and hung his head over the side nnot as high as all that he remarked you can ststill see our shadow on the ground it was true a dark oval sped across the treetops sighter appeared with his spyglass and he promptly announced their altitude as feet are you certain kitiara asked please said sturm take his word for it where are we headed sighter asked kitiara due east thats the lemish forest below in a few minutes we should be over the newsea but thats seventy miles from where we were sturm said he was sitting on the deck are we truly flying that fast indeed we are and we shall go faster still sighter said he strolled forward his spyglass stuck to one eye as he surveyed the world below its wonderful kitiara said she laughed into the wind i never believed you could do it but you did i love it tell the whistler to go as fast as he can stutts was almost as excited and he agreed he turned to reenter the wheelhouse sturm called to him and he paused why are we heading east sturm asked why not north and east toward the plains of solamnia stutts replied rainspot ssays he feels turbulence in that direction he ffelt it wouldnt be prudent to fly through it he disappeared into the wheelhouse sturm look at that kitiara said its a village you can see the housetops and chimney smoke and cattle i wonder can the people down there see us wouldnt that be funny to swoop down on their heads and blow a trumpet tata scare them out of ten years growth sturm was still sitting on the deck im not ready to stand up yet he said sheepishly i was never afraid of heights you know trees towers mountaintops never disturbed me but this its wonderful sturm hold the rail and look down i must stand up thought sturm the measure demanded that a knight face danger with honor and courage the knights of solamnia had never considered aerial travel in their code of conduct i must show kit that i am not afraid sturm grasped the rail my father lord angriff brightblade would not be afraid he told himself as he faced the low wall and rose to his haunches blood pounded in sturms ears the power of the sword the discipline of battle were of little help here this was a stronger test this was the unknown sturm stood the world spun beneath him like a ribbon unspooling already the blue waters of the newsea glittered on the horizon kitiara was raving about the boats she could see sturm took a deep breath and let the fear fall from him like a soiled garment wonderful she exclaimed again i tell you sturm i take back all the things i said about the gnomes this flying ship is tremendous we can go anywhere in the world with this anywhere and think of what a general could do with his army in a fleet of these devices no wall would be high enough no arrows could reach you up here theres no spot in the whole of krynn that could be defended against a fleet of flying ships it would be the end of the world sturm said cities looted and burned farms ravaged people slaughtered it would be as bad as the cataclysm trust you to see the dark side of everything she said it happened before you know twice the dragons of krynn tried to subjugate the world from the sky until the great huma used the dragonlance and defeated them kitiara said that was long ago and men are different from dragons sturm was not so sure cutwood and rainspot climbed a ladder to the roof of the wheelhouse from there they launched a large kite it fluttered back in the wind from the wings whipping about on its string like a newcaught trout what are you two doing now kitiara called out testing for lightning cutwood responded he smells it in the clouds isnt that dangerous sturm said eh cutwood put a hand to his ear i said isnt that the brilliant whiteforked bolt hit the kite before sturm could finish though the sun was shining and the air clear lightning leaped from a nearby cloud and blasted the kite to ashes the bolt continued down the string and leaped to the brass ladder the cloudmaster staggered the wings skipped a beat then settled back into their regular rhythm once more they carried the scorched rainspot into the dining room his face and hands were black with soot his shoes had been knocked right off his feet and his stockings had gone with his shoes all the buttons on his vest were melted as well cutwood lowered his ear to rainspots chest still beating he reported the ships alarm went ah oo gah and the speaking tube blared all colleagues and passengers come to the engine room at once stutts and the other gnomes filed toward the door with the humans trailing behind stutts paused what abbout him he indicated the unconscious rainspot we could carry him sighter said we can make a stretcher said cutwood checking his pockets for paper and pencil to draw a stretcher design ill do it sturm said just to end the discussion he scooped the little man up in his arms down in the engine room the ships entire company collected sturm was alarmed to see wingover there who steering the ship he asked i tied the wheel colleagues and passengers flash said i beg to report fault in the engine you neednt beg said roperig well let you report shut up said kitiara how bad is it i cant shut it off the lightning strike has fused the switches in the on position thats not so bad sighter said birdcall warbled in agreement but we cant fly around forever kitiara said no indeed said flash i estimate we have power to fly for oh six and a half weeks six weeks cried sturm and kitiara in unison one thousand eightyone hours twentynine minutes i can work out the exact seconds in a moment hold my arms sturm im going to throttle him hush kit could we unfasten the wings that would bring us down said roperig yes and make a nice big hole when we hit bellcrank observed tartly hmm i wonder how big a hole it would be cutwood flipped open a random slip of parchment and started figuring on it the other gnomes crowded around offering corrections to his arithmetic stop this at once sturm said kitiaras face was scarlet from illconcealed rage when the gnomes paid him not the least heed he snatched the calculations from cutwood the gnomes broke off in midbabble how can such clever fellows be so impractical not one of you has asked the right question flash can you fix the engine a gleam of challenge grew in flashs eyes i can i will he pulled a hammer from one pocket and a spanner from another cmon birdcall lets get at it the chief mechanic chirped happily and followed on flashs heels wingover where will we go if we keep flying as we are now sturm asked the wings are set on climb which means well keep going higher and higher wingover replied the gnome wrinkled his beaky nose it will get cold the air will thin out thats why vultures and eagles can only fly so high their wings are too small the cloudmaster shouldnt have problems with that everyone will have to dress warmly said sturm we have our furs kitiara said having mastered her anger at the situation i dont know what the gnomes can wear oh oh roperig waved a hand to be recognized i can make personal heating apparatuses out of materials i have in the rope locker fine you do that roperig and his apprentice hurried away with their heads together fitter listened so intently that he walked under an engine part and into the door frame rainspot moaned forgetting his burden in the excitement sturm had tucked him under one arm like a loaf of bread the gnome coughed and groaned sturm set him on the deck the first thing rainspot did was to ask for his kite cutwood explained how it was lost and tears welled up in rainspots eyes as they trickled down his cheeks they scored clean tracks in the soot one thing more wingover kitiara said you said the air would get thin do you mean as it does on very high mountaintops exactly like that she planted her hands on her hips and said i once led a troop of cavalry over the high khalkist mountains it was cold all right and worse our ears bled we fainted at the slightest exertion and had the worst headaches a shaman named ning made a potion for us to drink it eased our way what a primitive shaman can do with mmagic a gnome can do with ttechnology said stutts sturm looked out the engine room porthole at the darkening sky a rime of frost was already forming on the outside of the glass i certainly hope so my friend our lives may depend on it chapter hydrodynamics it was quiet on deck sturm worked his way around the starboard side to the bow sighter had mounted a telescope on a spindle there and sturm wanted a look around it wasnt easy moving in his thick fur coat hood and mittens but he decided that it was no worse than being in full body armor the flapping of the wings scarcely could be heard as the cloudmaster climbed steadily upward the flying ship had pierced a layer of soft white clouds which left a coat of snow on the deck and roof once it cleared the cloud layer however the rush of air over the wings swept the snow away great pillars of vapor stood around them fat columns of blue and white that looked as solid as marble in the moons light sturm studied these massive towers of cloud through sighters spyglass but all he could see was their sculpted surfaces as smooth and still as a frozen pond he hadnt seen a gnome in over an hour wingover had tied the steering wheel again and theyd all disappeared below to work on their inventions occasionally he heard or felt bangs and crashes under his feet kitiara fully and fetchingly buried in her fox fur coat had gone to the dining room and stretched out on the table for a nap sturm swung the telescope left over the pointed prow solinari shone between two deep ravines in the clouds silvering the airship with its rays he scanned the strange architecture of the clouds seeing in them a face a wagon a rearing horse it was beautiful but incredibly lonely he felt at that moment like the only man in the world the cold crept through his heavy clothes sturm clapped his hands on his arms to stir his blood it didnt help much finally he abandoned his frosty post and returned to the dining room he watched the sleeping kitiara sway gently with the motion of the ship then he smelled something smoke something was burning sturm coughed and wrinkled his nose kitiara stirred she sat up in time to see the entry of a bizarre apparition it looked like a scarecrow made of tin and rope but this scarecrow had a glass jar on its head and smoke coming out of its back hello said the apparition wingover asked kitiara the little scarecrow reached up and twisted the jar off its head and the hawkish features of wingover emerged what do you think of roperigs invention he asked he calls it the refined personal heating apparatus mark iii mark iii said sturm yes the first two prototypes were not successful poor fitter has a burn on his well hell be standing at dinner for a while that was mark i the mark ii took off most of roperigs whiskers i warned him not to use glue on the perfect observation helmet wingover held out his arms and spun in a circle do you see roperig sewed a continuous coil of rope to a set of long underwear then varnished the whole suit to make it watertight and airtight the heat comes from a tin stove here he strained to point at a miniature potbelly stove mounted on his back a fat tallow candle provides up to four hours of heat and these tin strips carry the warmth all over the suit wingover finally dropped his arms very ingenious said kitiara flatly has anything been done about the engine birdcall and flash cant agree on the cause of the damage birdcall insists the fault lies in flashs lightning bottles while flash says the engine is fused in the on position kitiara sighed by the time those two agree on what to fix well have run out of sky could anything fly as high as we are now theres no reason why another flying ship couldnt get this high its largely a matter of aerodynamic efficiency he thumped a dial or two and added i suppose a dragon might get this high assuming they still existed that is dragons sturm repeated dragons are a special case of course the really big ones reds or golds could achieve very high altitudes how high they had wingspans of feet or more you know said wingover enjoying his lecture im sure i could do a calculation based on a fiftyfoot animal weighing fortyfive tons of course they couldnt glide worth shucks its freezing on the inside now interrupted kitiara scratching the frost off a small pane of glass she breathed on the cleared spot and it instantly turned milky white stutts started up the ladder from below but his personal heating apparatus caught on the ladder and there were some moments of struggle to free him everything shshipshape he inquired the controls are fine wingover responded but were still going up the height gauge has gone off the dial so sighter will have to calculate how high we are stutts clapped his ropewound hands together pperfect that will make him very happy the gnomes leader whistled into the voice tube nnow hear this sighter rreport to the wheelhouse in seconds the little astronomer came banging up the ladder tripped on the top rung and fell on his face kitiara helped him stand and saw why he was so clumsy he had pulled his jarhelmet on in such a way as to cover his face with his long beard stutts and kitiara worked and twisted to get the jar off it came away with a loud pop by reorx sighter gasped i was beginning to think my own whiskers were trying to choke me did you bbring your astrolabe asked stutts when am i without it then ggo up on the roof and shoot the stars we need to know our exact pposition sighter snapped his fingers not a problem he went out of the deckhouse through the dining room they heard his feet stomping across the roof uhoh said wingover staring dead ahead sturm said what is it the clouds are closing in look they had flown into a box canyon of clouds even if wingover put the wheel hard about they would still plow into a cloud bank id better tell sighter sturm said he went to the door meaning to shout up at the gnome on the roof about the time he cracked the door open the cloudmaster bored into a wall of luminous white frost formed quickly on sturms mustache snow swirled around him as he cried sighter sighter come down the frozen mist was so thick that he couldnt see a foot beyond his nose he would have to go get sighter he slipped twice on his way up the ladder the brass rungs were encased in ice but sturm knocked it off with the butt of his dagger as he cleared the roof line a blast of frigid air stung his face sighter he called sighter the rooftop was too treacherous to stand on so sturm crept forward on his hands and knees flakes of snow collected in the gap between his hood and coat collar melted and ran down his neck sturms hand slipped and he almost rolled right off the roof though there was four feet of deck on either side he had the horrible idea that he would tumble right off the ship and fall fall fall cutwood would calculate how big a hole hed make his hand bumped a frostrimed boot and sturm looked up sighter was at his post astrolabe stuck to one eye and completely covered with half an inch of ice snow was already drifting around his feet sturm used his dagger to chip away the ice around sighters shoes his personal heating apparatus mark iii must have blown out for the gnome was now stiff with cold sturm grabbed the little mans feet and pulled sturm sturm where are you kitiara was calling up here what are you doing you and sighter get inside before your faces freeze off its too late for sighter ive almost got him loose wait here he is he passed the stiff gnome over the edge of the roof to kitiaras open arms with commendable agility he then scooted down the ladder and hurried back inside brr and i thought winters at castle brightblade were cold he saw that rainspot was on hand to doctor the frozen sighter how is he asked sturm cold said rainspot he pinched the tip of sighters beard with a pair of wooden tweezers a quick snap of the wrist and the lower half of sighters beard broke off dear dear rainspot said clucking his tongue dear dear he reached for the astrolabe still in place at sighters eye with sighters hands clamped to it no kitiara and sturm yelled trying to break the instrument loose would probably take sighters eye with it ttake him below and thaw him out said stutts sslowly someone will have to carry his feet said rainspot stutts sighed and went over to help hes ggoing to be very angry that yyou broke his bbeard he said dear dear perhaps if we dampened the edge we could stick it back on dont be ststupid youd never get it aligned pproperly i can get some glue from roperig they disappeared down the hatch to the berth deck sturm and kitiara heard a loud crash and both rushed to the opening expecting to see poor sighter broken to bits like a cheap clay vase but no stutts was on the deck sighter cushioned on top of him and rainspot was hanging upside down with his feet tangled in the rungs dear dear he was saying dear dear they couldnt help but laugh it felt good after spending so much time worrying whether they would ever walk the solid soil of krynn again kitiara stopped laughing first that was a crazy stunt sturm she said what rescuing that gnome you might have been frozen yourself and ill wager you wouldnt thaw out as easily as sighter will not with rainspot as my doctor to his surprise she embraced him it was a comradely hug with a clap on the back that staggered him were coming out of it were coming out wingover yelled kitiara broke away and rushed to the gnome he was hopping up and down in delight as the white shroud peeled away from the flying ship the cloudmaster emerged from the top of the snow squall into clear air ahead of them was a vast red globe far larger than the sun ever appeared from the ground below was nothing but an unbroken sheet of cloud tinged scarlet from the moons glow all around stars twinkled the cloudmaster was flying headlong toward the red orb hydrodynamics wingover breathed this was the gnomes strongest oath neither sturm nor kitiara could improve on it just then what is it kitiara finally said if my calculations are accurate and im sure that they are it is lunitari the red moon of krynn said wingover sighter appeared in the hatch his hair was dripping and his brokenoff beard fluttered when he spoke correct thats what i discovered before the snowstorm hit were a hundred thousand miles from home and heading straight for lunitari chapter to the red moon the ships complement assembled in the dining room reactions to sighters announcement were mixed basically the gnomes were delighted while their human passengers were appalled how can we be going to lunitari kitiara demanded its just a red dot in the sky oh no said sighter lunitari is a large globular celestial body just like krynn and the other moons and planets i estimate that it is thirtyfive hundred miles in diameter and at least thousand miles from krynn this is beyond me sturm said wearily how could we possibly have flown so high we havent been gone more than two days actually time references are difficult to make at this altitude we havent seen the sun in a long time but judging from the positions of the moons and stars i would say we have been aloft for fiftyfour hours sighter said making a few jottings on the tabletop and fortytwo minutes any other rreports asked stutts were out of raisins said fitter and flour and bacon and onions added cutwood what does that leave for food kitiara asked birdcall made a very unbirdlike squawk what did he say beans six sacks of dried white beans said roperig what about the engine asked sturm have you figured out how to fix it tweettweedletweet he says no bellcrank translated the lightning bottles are holding up quite well flash reported my theory is the cold thin air offers less resistance to the wings therefore the engine doesnt have to work as hard rot said bellcrank its my ethereal air all that flapping impedes our flight if we lopped off those silly wings we could have flown to lunitari in half the time aerodynamic idiocy that big bag is just a big drag stop it sturm snapped theres no time for these ridiculous disputes i want to know what happens when we reach lunitari ten pairs of gnome eyes looked at him and blinked they do it in unison he thought just to unnerve me well we land said wingover how the engines wont shut off the room fairly buzzed with the brains of gnomes furiously thinking roperig began to shake what does a ship in distress do when its driven toward the shoals asked roperig feverishly crash and sink said bellcrank no no it throws out an anchor sturm and kitiara smiled here was something they could understand never mind lightning bottles and ethereal air throw out an anchor do we have an anchor asked fitter we have a few grappling hooks about this big wingover replied holding his hands out about a foot apart they wont stop cloudmaster ill make a big one bellcrank vowed if we scrap a few ladders and iron fittings but what if we dont get the engine shut down sturm said no anchor in the world will stop us kitiara cocked her head and regarded stutts severely what about it she asked how long will it take you to mmake an anchor asked stutts with help maybe three hours said bellcrank when will we hhit lunitari stutts asked sighter sighter scribbled across the table around one corner and up the other side as it stands now we will hit lunitari in five hours and sixteen minutes flash and bbirdcall will keep working on the engine if nno other course is open we mmay have to smash the engine bbefore we can set down the gnomes erupted with cries of consternation the humans objected too how will we ever get home if you wreck the engine demanded kitiara well be marooned on lunitari forever if we ccrash well be on llunitari a lot longer than that and enjoy it a lot less stutts said wwell be dead fitter and i will make a cable for the anchor said roperig heading below ill fill the deckhouse with our blankets and pillows cutwood offered that way well have something to cushion us when we crash er land the gnomes dispersed to their tasks while sturm and kitiara remained in the dining room the scarlet expanse of the moon was visible through the skylight together they looked up at lunitari sturm said another world i wonder what its like who can say the gnomes could give you theories im just a warrior said kitiara she sighed if we end up marooned there i hope there will be battles to be fought there are always battles every place has its own version of good and evil oh it doesnt matter to me who i fight for battle is my virtue you cant go wrong with a sword in your hand and a good comrade at your side she slipped a thickly gloved hand into sturms he returned her grip but could not dispel the anxiety that her words caused the gnomes when aroused had formidable amounts of energy in less time than it takes to tell bellcrank had forged a monstrous anchor with four flukes and a huge weight made of miscellaneous metal parts from all over the ship in his zeal to add weight to his creation bellcrank took ladder rungs doorknobs spoons from the dining room door hinges and only by threat of force could he be discouraged from removing half of wingovers control knobs roperig and fitter wove an appropriately stout cable indeed their first offering was too thick to thread through the eyelet that bellcrank had fashioned in the anchor cutwood filled the dining room so full of pillows and blankets that it was hard to walk across to the wheelhouse lunitari grew visibly larger with each passing hour from a featureless red globe it had developed dark red mountain peaks purple valleys and wide scarlet plains stutts and wingover debated endlessly as to why the moon was so dominated by red hues as usual they resolved nothing kitiara made the mistake of asking how it was that they seemed to be flying straight down at lunitari when they had been going up since leaving krynn its all a matter of relative reference wingover said our up is down on lunitari and the down on lunitari will be up she set aside her sword which shed taken out to polish and sharpen you mean if i drop a stone from my hand on lunitari it will fly up in the air and eventually fall on krynn wingover opened and closed his mouth silently three times his expression grew more and more puzzled finally kitiara asked what will keep our feet on the moon wont we fall back home wingover looked stricken stutts chuckled the same ppressure that held you to the fertile soil of kkrynn will allow us to walk normally on llunitari he said pressure asked sturm yes the ppressure of the air air has weight you know i see said kitiara but what keeps the air in place now it was stuttss turn to look stricken sturm rescued them from their scientific quandary i want to know if there will be people there he said why not wingover said if the air thickens and gets warmer we might find quite ordinary folk living on lunitari kitiara drew the whetstone down the length of her blade strange she mused to think that people like us live on the moon i wonder what they see when they look up down at our world birdcall whistled for attention from the deck below bellcrank had removed the ladder halfway down so the chirping gnome couldnt reach a rung to pull himself up stutts and sturm reached through the open hatch and hauled him out birdcall twittered a lengthy exposition and stutts translated he says he and fflash have figured out a way to disengage the engine before we land they will ccut the main power cable a hundred feet up and ttime the wing beats so that the wings will lock in their extended position that way we can glide in to a landing and if they dont birdcall held up one hand with the fingers flat together his hand dived into the open palm of his other making a crunching noise when they smacked together we have llittle chchoice but to try the others agreed birdcall dropped to the deck below and hurried down to his engine roperig and fitter pooled the anchor and cable on the deck by the ships tail cutwood sighter and rainspot boxed up their most valuable possessions tools instruments and the big ledger with all the entries on raisin density in muffins and buried them amidst the pillows in the dining room what can i do sturm said to wingover you could throw out the anchor when we say i can do something too kitiara said why dont you go to the engine room and help flash and birdcall they cant tend the engine and cut the power cable at the same time said the gnome she raised her sword until the hilt was level with her chin cut it with this she said certainly right kitiara slipped the sheath over the blade and started down the abbreviated ladder when you want the cable cut hit that crazy horn she said that will be my signal kit sturm said quietly making her pause may paladine guide your hand i doubt that ill need divine aid ive chopped through thicker things than cable she smiled crookedly there was nothing in view now but lunitari though wingover didnt change course the moon seemed to sink from overhead to bowson as the minutes sped by the red landscape spread to every horizon soon the airship was flying with the purple sky above and the red soil below the altitude gauge was working again seventytwo hundred feet four minutes to contact said wingover a line of jagged peaks flashed by wingover spun the wheel hard to port the wings on the starboard side flicked past the sharp spires with scant feet to spare the cloudmaster careened farther almost onto its side soft thumps and muffled yells came from the dining room whoaohohoh wingover cried more bumps coming up the prow smashed into a lofty pinnacle and carried it away a cloud of red grit and dust hit the wheelhouse windows wingover frantically pushed levers and turned the wheel the flying ship went nose up then tail up sturm staggered back and forth he felt like a pea being rattled in a cup the cliffs fell away to reveal a landscape of flat mesas divided by deep ravines the ship was down to a thousand feet sturm opened the door melted ice ran along the deck outside im going aft he said wingover bobbed his head rapidly in reply he stepped out the door just as wingover banked the cloudmaster in that direction sturm almost pitched headfirst over the rail the scarlet world roared past at terrifying speed much faster it seemed than when they were cruising through the high clouds he felt a rush of vertigo but it quickly succumbed to his will sturm staggered aft bouncing from the rail to the wall of the deckhouse he glimpsed a queerly distorted face at one of the dining room portholes it was fitter his bulbous nose and ruddy lips smashed flat against the pane the wind whipped at sturm as he neared the anchor the hinged tail bowed and flexed under wingovers control sturm wrapped an arm around the tails hinge post and held on the tableland was replaced by a featureless plain the dark red soil was smooth and unrippled at least paladine had favored them with an uncluttered place to land the flying ship sturm let go of the rudder post and cradled the anchor in his arms bellcrank had done a good job the big hook weighed nearly as much as sturm he wrestled it to the rail they were very low now the ground resembled a sheet of marble painted the color of blood do it wingover blow the horn now thought sturm they seemed too low hes forgotten he thought were too low he forgot to sound the horn or had he himself failed to hear it in the rush of wind and the pounding of his heart after a second of indecision sturm heaved the anchor over the multicolored rope woven from everything roperig could find cord curtains shirts and gnomish underwear spilled after the hook loop after loop roperig said hed made feet of cable more than enough the skein rapidly shrank with a snap it ran out and the heavy scrap metal anchor streamed out behind the flying ship sturm had dropped it too soon he moved forward watching the hook drop closer and closer to the red soil by the door to the wheelhouse sturm paused expecting the anchor to bounce and shatter as it hit but it did neither the anchor sank into the surface of the moon plowing a wide deep furrow he threw open the door wingover had his hand on the horn cord dont do it sturm yelled the ground below its not solid wingover snatched his hand away from the cord as if it had burned him not solid i dropped the anchor and its flowing through the plain as though it were in water if we land well sink we dont have any time left were less than a hundred feet up now sturm went to the rail staring desperately at the soft ground what to do what to do he saw rocks hard to starboard he sang out solid ground to starboard wingover spun the wheel the right rear wing touched lunitari it dipped into the dust and came out unharmed sturm could smell the dirt in the air the rocks thickened and the smooth scarlet dust gave way to a stony plain aaoogah the cloudmaster quivered like a living thing the leather batwings lifted in a graceful arc and froze there sturm threw himself through the door and landed on his belly he covered his head tightly with his hands the wheels touched spun and snapped off with brittle wrenching sounds when the hull of the flying ship plowed into lunitari the bow bucked rose and jerked to port sturm careened across the deck the cloudmaster tore along trailing a wake of dirt and stones finally as if too tired to continue the flying ship settled to a creaking grinding stop chapter foty pounds of iron ane we dead sturm uncovered his head and lifted it wingover was jammed through the spokes of the steering wheel his short arms squeezed tightly against his chest his eyes were just as tightly closed open your eyes wingover were all right said sturm oh reorx im stuck hold on sturm grabbed the gnomes feet and pulled wingover protested all the way but when he was finally free he forgot his discomfort and said ah lunitari the gnome and the man went out on deck the rear door of the dining room banged open and the other gnomes piled out wordlessly they surveyed the barren landscape aside from a distant hump of hills lunitari was flat all the way to the horizon one gnome gave a high chortle of delight and they all scampered inside sturm heard things flying as they sorted through the pillows for their tools instruments and notebooks kitiara appeared on deck with flash and birdcall they hadnt been able to see from the engine room being too busy to stare out the porthole kitiara had a fine gooseegg bruise over her right eye hello said sturm what happened to you oh i knocked my head against an engine fitting when we crashed landed he corrected did you break the fitting his rare attempt at humor left kitiara silent for a moment then they threw their arms around each other grateful for their lives the ramp in the starboard side of the hull dropped down and the whole gang of gnomes boiled out onto the red turf kitiara said i guess wed better go down and look after them before they hurt themselves the gnomes were lost in their specialties by the time kitiara and sturm joined them sighter scanned the horizon with his spyglass bellcrank and cutwood were filling jars with scoopfuls of red dirt rainspot stood apart from the rest his nose and ears tuned to the weather he reminded kitiara of a hunting dog stutts was rapidly filling pages in his pocket notebook wingover walked around the hull of the cloudmaster kicking the tight wooden planks now and then roperig and fitter examined their anchor line and measured the amount that it had stretched when pulled taut birdcall and flash were in a heated discussion sturm overheard something about wing camber variance and listened no further he scooped up a handful of lunitarian dirt it was flaky not granular like sand as it fell from his fingers it made a tinkling sound do you smell what i smell asked kitiara he sniffed dust itll settle he said no not that its a feeling more than a smell really the air has a tingle to it like a draft of otiks best ale sturm concentrated for a moment i dont feel anything stutts bustled over here are mmy preliminary findings he said air normal temperature ccool but not cold no sign of wwater vegetation or animal life kit says she feels a tingle in the air really i hhadnt noticed anything im not imagining it she said tersely ask rainspot maybe hes noticed the weatherwise gnome came running when called and stutts asked for his impressions the high clouds will dissipate soon said rainspot humidity is very low i dont think it has rained here in a very long time if ever bad news kitiara said we havent much water left on the ship do you sense anything else sturm queried yes actually but its not a weather phenomenon the air is somehow charged with energy like llightning no rainspot pivoted slowly its constant but very low in intensity it doesnt feel harmful just there he shrugged why dont we feel it sturm asked youre not the sensitive type kitiara said like old rainspot and me she clapped her hands so stutts now that were here what do we do explore make mmaps and study local conditions theres nothing here said sturm this is only one small location ssuppose we had landed on the plains of dust on krynn wwould you then say that there is nothing on krynn but ssand stutts asked sturm admitted that he would not stutts called his engineers and flash and birdcall trotted up ststatus report the lightning bottles are twothirds empty if we dont find some way to refill them we wont have enough power to fly home flash said birdcall sang his report and flash translated for the humans he says the engine was shaken loose from its mountings by the hard landing but the cut power cable can be patched i have an idea about that said wingover whod joined them if we install a switch at that juncture we can bypass the fused setting damaged by rainspots lightning my lightning the weather gnome protested since when do i make lightning switch what kind of switch cutwood asked the sound of disputation had drawn him and bellcrank a single throwknife switch said wingover ha listen to the amateur singlethrow whats needed is a rotary pole switch with isolated leads kitiara let out a bloodcurdling battle cry and swung her sword around her head the silence that followed was instant and total you gnomes are driving me mad why dont you just appoint someone to each task and be done with it only one mind on each task sighter was scandalized it would never get done right perhaps bellcrank could make the switch fitter suggested timidly it will be made of metal wont it everyone stared at him mouths open he edged nervously behind roperig wonderful idea kitiara said brilliant idea there isnt much spare metal left wingover said we could salvage some from the anchor rainspot said the other gnomes looked at him and smiled thats a good idea said cutwood fitter and mell pull in the anchor roperig said they picked up the thick cable hanging down from the tail and hauled away fifty feet away where the field of stones gave way to the deep dust the buried anchor leaped ahead in dusty spurts then the hook caught on something the gnomes strained and pulled want some help called sturm no uh we can do it roperig replied roperig slapped fitter on the back and they turned around laying the rope over their shoulders the gnomes dug in their toes and pulled pull roperig heave ho fitter pull pull pull shouted the other gnomes wait said kitiara suddenly the rope is fraying the hastily woven cable was coming undone just behind fitter twine and strands of twisted cloth spun away and the two gnomes oblivious braced their backs against it stop this was all sturm had time to shout before the rope parted roperig and fitter fell on their faces with a plunk the other end of the cable weighted down by the anchor snaked away bellcrank and cutwood took off after it the rolypoly chemist tripped over his own feet and stumbled the ragged end of the cable whisked out of his reach cutwood with surprising verve leaped over his fallen colleague and dived for the fleeing rope to sturms amazement he caught it cutwood weighed no more than fifty or sixty pounds and the anchor weighed two hundred as it continued to sink into the red dust it dragged cutwood along with it let go sturm shouted kitiara and the gnomes echoed him but cutwood was already in the dust then as the others looked on in horror cutwood upended and disappeared they waited and watched for the carpenter gnome to surface but he did not bellcrank got up and took a few steps toward the rim of the rock field he was shouted to a halt youll go in too kitiara said cutwood said bellcrank helplessly cutwood a ripple appeared in the motionless dust it roiled and grew into a hump of crimson grit slowly the hump became a head then developed shoulders arms and a squat torso cutwood was the universal cry the gnome slogged forward heavily and when he was waisthigh out of the dust everyone could see that his pants had ballooned to twice their usual size the waist and legs were packed with lunitarian dust cutwood stepped to firmer ground he lifted one leg and shook it and a torrent of grit poured out bellcrank rushed forward to embrace his dusty friend cutwood cutwood we thought you were lost cutwood responded with a mighty sneeze which got dust on bellcrank who sneezed right back prompting cutwood to sneeze again this went on for some time finally sighter and birdcall came forward with improvised dustfree face filters handkerchiefs the siege of sneezing overcome cutwood lamented my suspenders broke your what asked bellcrank sniffling cutwood pulled up his deflated pants the anchor dragged me under i knew it was taking me down but i couldnt let all our scrap metal get away then my suspenders broke i tried to grab them and the rope jerked out of my hands he sighed my best suspenders roperig walked around cutwood plucking at his baggy trousers give me your pants he said what for i want to do some structural tests there may be an invention in them cutwoods eyes widened he quickly removed his rusty twill trousers and stood by in blue flannel long johns brrr this is a cold moon he said im going for another pair of trousers but dont you invent anything until i get back cutwood hurried to the cloudmaster with showers of dust still cascading from his shoulders sturm took kitiara aside heres a pretty problem he said in a low voice we need metal to repair the engine and all our scrap was lost in a lake of dust maybe bellcrank could salvage a bit more from the flying ship kitiara said maybe but i dont trust him not to ruin the whole ship in the process what we need is more metal he faced the crowd of gnomes who were busy examining cutwoods pants as if they were the find of a lifetime now and then a gnome would turn his head and sneeze oh bellcrank would you come over here please sturm said the gnome scurried over he stopped pulled out a handkerchief stained with grease and chemicals and blew his nose loudly yes sturm just how much metal do you need to fix the engine that depends on what type of switch i make for a double throw rotary pole the very least youll need in any case bellcrank chewed his lip a moment and said thirty pounds of copper or forty pounds of iron copper would be easier to work than iron you see and yes yes kitiara said hastily we dont have forty pounds of anything except beans beans wouldnt work bellcrank offered all right well just have to find some metal sturm looked around the high clouds were beginning to thin and the twilight that had persisted since their landing was beginning to brighten the sun that warmed krynn was rising higher in their sky taking that direction as east for convenience they could see a distant range of hills far off to the north bellcrank would you know iron ore when you saw it said sturm would i know it i know every ore there is can you smelt it the germ of sturms idea spread to the gnome and he smiled widely a fine notion my friend worthy of a gnome kitiara slapped him on the back there you are she said a few days in the air and you start thinking like a gnome never mind the wit weve got to organize an expedition to those hills to see if there is any metal there bellcrank ran back to his fellows to share the news exclamations of joy rang across the empty plain cutwood coming down the ramp from the cloudmaster was nearly bowled over as his fellows charged up he was carried back inside with them the thumps and crashes that always signified gnomish enthusiasm were not long in coming kitiara shook her head now see what youve done the first argument began over who would go on the trek and who would stay with the flying ship everyone cant go sturm said wfhat food and water we have wont sustain us all on a long march ill ststay stutts said cloudmaster is mmy responsibility good fellow who will stay with stutts the gnomes looked at the purple sky the stars their shoes anywhere but at sturm whoever stays will get to work on the ship birdcall whistled his acceptance hearing him agree flash said oh well burn it no one understands the lightning bottles but me ill stay ill stay behind rainspot offered i dont know much about prospecting me too cutwood said hold your horses kitiara objected you cant all stay rainspot we need you well be out in the open and if storms threaten well want to know beforehand the gnome grinned and placed himself by kitiara he gazed happily up at her pleased that someone needed him three should be enough to watch over the ship sturm said the rest of you get your belongings together no one is to take anything more than he can carry on his back the gnomes all nodded vigorous affirmatives after we eat well all get some sleep and start fresh in the morning when is morning asked bellcrank sighter unfolded his tripod and clamped his telescope in place he studied the sky searching for familiar stars after a lengthy perusal he announced sixteen hours maybe more hard to tell he snapped the telescope tube shut sixteen hours said kitiara why so long lunitari doesnt sit in the same part of the heavens as krynn right now the shadow of our home world is over us until we move clear of it this is all the light well get it will have to do sturm said to fitter who as the youngest gnome had permanent kitchen duty he said what is there to eat beans said fitter boiled beans seasoned with their last tiny bit of bacon was dinner and it promised to be their breakfast too sturm squatted under the overhang of the flying ships hull and ate his bowl of beans as he ate he tried to imagine what lay beyond the dust and stones the sky was not black but purple lightening at the horizon to a warm claret everything was wrought in tones of red the dirt the rocks even the white beans seemed vaguely pink was all of lunitari like this lifeless he wondered kitiara sauntered up shed shed her heavy furs for a less confining outfit the hiplength jacket and leggings shed retained and had slung her sword over her left shoulder as the ergothites often did in that position it freed the legs for walking good huh she said dropping down beside sturm beans are beans he replied letting them fall from his spoon back into the bowl ive eaten worse so have i during the siege of silvamori my troops menu was reduced to boiledboot soup and tree leaves and we were the besiegers how did the people in the town fare sturm asked thousands died of starvation she said the memory did not seem to trouble her sturm felt the beans turn to paste in his mouth dont you regret that so many died he asked not really if a thousand more had perished the siege might have ended sooner and fewer of my comrades would have died sturm all but dropped his bowl he stood up and started to walk away kitiara puzzled by his reaction said are you through can i finish your beans he stopped his back to her yes eat them all slaughter spoils my appetite he mounted the ramp and disappeared into the cloudmaster a quick flush of anger welled within kitiara who did he think he was young master brightblade presumed to look down on her for her warriors code the spoon kitiara had clenched in her fist suddenly snapped the pieces fell from her fingers she stared at them her anger dissolving as quickly as it had come the spoon was made of sturdy ash wood but it broke cleanly where her thumb had pressed on it kitiaras eyebrows rose in amazement must be a defect in the wood she thought chapter the first lunitari exploration march the gnomes emerged from the ship after a few hours nap staggering under a burden of tools clothing instruments and other less identifiable rubbish kitiara spied roperig and fitter pushing a fourwheeled cart between them what have you two got there she asked roperig dug in his heels to stop the cart a few essential things he said he had a coil of rope over his left shoulder that was so thick he couldnt turn his head in that direction this is ridiculous where did you get this contraption fitter and me made it its all wood you see no metal roperig thumped the rear wall of the cart with his foot where did the wood come from said kitiara oh we knocked out a few of the inside walls in the ship great suffering gods its a good thing were going on this march otherwise you gnomes would have the whole ship dismantled before long the explorers mustered on the plain below the cloudmasters port side the gnomes in their usual endearing earnestness lined up like an honor guard on parade despite the bleakness of their situation sturm couldnt help but smile at the goofy ingenious little men stutts has asked me to lead this march to the hills in search of ore to repair the flying ship and you all have agreed to follow my directions my ah colleague kitiara is to be equally responsible shes had considerable experience in forays like this and we should all be guided by her wisdom kitiara did not acknowledge his compliment but leaned back against the ships hull and looked on impassively one hand resting on the pommel of her sword sighter estimates the distance to the hills as fifteen miles we should reach them at about the time daylight breaks isnt that right sighter checked a column of numbers scrawled on his shirt cuff fifteen miles in six hours yes thats right sturm looked down the line of his troops he couldnt think of anything else to say well lets get going he said embarrassed so much for his first speech as a leader fitter and roperig ran around their makeshift cart fitting long poles into prepared brackets on the front and back bellcrank and cutwood placed themselves on the pole in front while roperig and fitter took up positions at the rear a fourgnomepower exploratory wagon said wingover admiringly mark i added rainspot move out said kitiara impatiently with no more fanfare than that the first lunitari exploration march began stutts birdcall and flash waved from the roof of the deckhouse as their colleagues marched away from their high perch they watched the expeditions progress long after the cloudmaster was lost to the marchers view in the fluid mauve shadows nope sighter said sound as the slopes of mt nevermind he squinted up at kitiara who still held the brokenoff pole in her hand you broke it with one hand wordlessly she held the pole in both hands straight out in front of her bending her elbows in kitiara bent the pole the wood splintered with a loud crack i had no idea you were so strong said sturm neither did i she replied equally astonished here said bellcrank picking up one of the pieces of the pole from where kitiara had dropped it break it again the piece was less than a foot long kitiara had to use her knee for a brace but she snapped even that short length something is happening here said sighter narrowing his eyes youve gotten undeniably stronger in the twenty hours weve been on lunitari maybe were all getting stronger cutwood said he grasped another bit of the pole and tried to bend it his florid face turned quite purple but the wood did not so much as crack similar efforts by the others including sturm showed no increase in strength kitiara beamed looks like youre the sole beneficiary of this gift whatever it is said sturm evenly at least it will be useful can you free the cart she snapped her fingers and swaggered around the rear of the cart kitiara flattened one hand against the cargo box and shoved the cart leaped out of its ruts almost running fitter and wingover down careful said sturm youve got to learn to handle this newfound strength or you may hurt someone kitiara wasnt listening she ran her hands up and down her arms again and again as if to feel the power radiating from her strangely augmented muscles i dont know why it happened or how but i like it she said sturm noticed a new swagger in her walk first his weird dream it had been so real and now kits new strength all was not natural on the red moon four hours later the hills were well within range close up they had an oddly soft appearance rounded as though a giant hand had smoothed them kitiara took over the lead when sturms step faltered he was tired and his meager breakfast of beans and water wasnt enough to keep him at his best in fact as the marchers approached six and a half hours out from the cloudrnaster kitiara ran ahead to be the first to reach the hills kit wait come back sturm called she waved and sprinted on the gnomes let the cart coast to a stop at the foot of a hill kitiara shouted and waved from the top she skidded down the slope coming to a halt by bumping into sturm he caught her arms panting she smiled at him you can see a long way from up there she gasped the hills go on for miles but there are wide trails running between them you shouldnt go off on your own like that sturm said kitiara lost her smile and shook herself free of his grasp i can take care of myself she said coolly the gnomes flopped down where they stood uphill tramping had considerably dampened their ardor for the march against all advice they rapidly drank up their meager water supply and were soon wishing for more if only we could find a spring said wingover or if it rains we could spread our blankets and catch the water said sighter well rainspot might it rain the weather seer lying flat on his back waved one hand feebly i dont think it has ever rained here he said flatly though i wish to reorx it would at his words a wisp of vapor no denser than steam abruptly formed over the exhausted gnome the vapor expanded thickened and turned into a small white cloud three feet wide the gnomes and humans watched speechless as the white cloud went murky gray a single droplet fell on the motionless rainspot thats not funny he complained rainspots eyes opened in time to catch the tiny shower that fell from his personal rain cloud hydrodynamics he exclaimed the other gnomes crowded in under the little cloud their round upturned faces ecstatic as the raindrops pelted them sturm came over he swept a hand through it and it came out sopping wet then as quickly and mysteriously as it had come the cloud faded away this smacks of magic sturm said i didnt do anything rainspot insisted i just wished it would rain maybe you have the power to grant wishes now said wingover like kitiara has gained strength the gnomes took up this theory and besieged their poor colleague with a barrage of requests wingover wanted a rib roast cutwood asked for a bushel of crisp apples bellcrank wanted a roast pig and apples roperig and fitter wanted muffins with raisins of course stop stop rainspot pleaded tearfully he couldnt bear so many demands at once sturm shooed the shouting gnomes away only sighter remained staring at the weeping rainspot if you can wish for anything wish for a switch to repair the ship with he said sagely the others sturm and kitiara included were surprised by his wise suggestion ii wish for a new switch to repair our engine rainspot said loudly made of copper said cutwood iron muttered bellcrank shhh said kitiara nothing happened maybe you have to use the same formula each time said wingover how exactly did you wish for rain i said something about reorx reorx creator of the gnomish race was the only deity the gnomes worshiped so try again and mention reorx said sighter rainspot drew himself up all thirty inches of him and declared i wish to reorx that we had a copper iron switch to repair our engine with nothing happened youre useless said bellcrank worse than useless added cutwood shut up kitiara snapped he tried didnt he im sorry the weather seer said between sniffles i wish it would rain again then everyone would be happy hardly had he said this than a new cloud formed over his head the rain poured down on rainspot making a puddle in the red dirt of lunitari it seemed insulting somehow as if reorx were teasing the gnome rainspot then did a rare thing he got mad thunder and lightning he cried the cloud flasherd once and a puny clump of thunder sounded ha some storm said roperig it proves one thing said sighter the limits of rainspots power he can make it rain thats all useless useless said bellcrank shut up said kitiara rainspots ability is very useful the gnomes regarded her blankly we need water dont we as usual once the gnomes were sparked off they embraced a new concept with exasperating enthusiasm planks were torn off the sides of the cart and pounded into the ground with cutwoods mallet roperig ripped their blankets into long triangles and sewed these together leaving a hole in the center of the resulting circle of cloth the edges of the blanket were nailed to the upright planks one of fitters canvas buckets was put under the hole in the center of the blanket rainspot sit in the middle and wish for rain said wingover rainspot complied and the water was captured by the improvised funnel and led to the waiting bucket rainspot sat on the soggy blanket soaked and bedraggled wishing over and over for rain i wish for rain the cloud formed and sprinkled him wish for rain water ran in the bucket the gnomes changed buckets and filled it too rain said the sodden tired gnome poor rainspot didnt enjoy it at all but he wished for plenty of water to save them from the agonies of thirst happy to do my part he said flatly when they finally let him off the blanket squishing in his shoes all the way i wonder who will get it next wingover said as they plodded into the first gully get what said bellcrank we seem to be acquiring new powers sighter said kitiaras strength rainspots rainmaking the rest of us may get new abilities too sturm pondered sighters claim his dream if it was a dream had been so vivid was it part of this mysterious process too he asked sighter if he could think of a reason why they should be affected like this hard to say said the gnome likely there is something on lunitari that has done this to them its the air said bellcrank some effluvium in the air piffle its all due to the red rays reflecting off the ground red light always has strange effects on living creatures remember the experiments done by theclumsybutcuriousdoctorwhowearsthetintedlensesinframesonhisface hush said kitiara she held up a hand the others watched expectantly do you feel it rainspot she asked yes maam the suns coming up a brace of shooting stars raced across the heavens from west to east the crests of the red hills glowed and a subtle ringing sensation filled the air they all felt it the line of sunlight crept down the hillsides toward the shadowed ravines as the explorers watched the soft spongy covering of the hills writhed bumps appeared in the turf the bumps moved in an unpleasantly animal fashion twisting and swelling under the crimson carpet the explorers had to hop about to avoid the moving bumps then a single spear of pale pink poked through the turf it grew longer and thicker rotating in slow circles as it pushed itself toward the sunlight what is it breathed fitter i think its a plant cutwood replied more pink spears bored through the ground and climbed on winecolored stalks other bumps erupted into different types of flora fat knobby puffballs sprang up and inflated themselves carmine sticks popped after growing straight out of the turf and dozens of spiderlike flowers floated to the ground from their ruptured stems toadstools with purple spots on top and lovely rose gills underneath emerged and grew visibly as the explorers looked on by the time the sun shone fully into the ravine every inch of the hillsides was covered with weird pulsating life only a narrow track at the bottom of the ravine still shadowed by the surrounding hills was clear of the speedily growing plants an instant forest said sighter more like an instant jungle said sturm observing the clogged path ahead of them he drew his sword well have to cut our way through kitiara drew her sword its an insult to honest steel she said eyeing the garish plants with distaste but it has to be done she raised her arm and slashed into the growth crowding the path on the right with her greater strength she had no difficulty hewing the pink spears and spidersticks cleanly off kitiara stepped back the choppedoff parts lay on the ground wriggling the stumps oozed red sap that looked amazingly like blood she noticed her sword was smeared with the same fluid holding the blade near her nose she sniffed ive been in many battles she said i know the smell of blood whether it be human dwarven or goblin she dropped the blade from her face this is blood the gnomes thought this was terribly interesting they bunched together over the bleeding stumps taking samples of the bloodsap bellcrank picked up the shorn length of a spiderstick it popped and eight white flowers burst out bellcrank yowled in pain each tiny flower had ejected a thorn into his face hold still rainspot said with a pair of bone tweezers he plucked the thorns from his colleagues face the gnomes filled fifteen jars and boxes with specimens of the lunitarian plants sturm and kitiara had a headtohead talk and opted to travel a little farther if they didnt find any ore by nightfall they would return to the ship steeling themselves they started hacking the plants groaned and screamed when severed they bled and twitched horribly after a mile of this kitiara said this is worse than the massacre of valkinord marsh at least they dont appear to suffer long sturm said but the screams and blood were wearing on him the gnomes wandered through the path the humans had cut poking and sniffing and measuring the dying plants for them it was as cutwood said better than a train of gears the trail led down a broad draw being well shaded from the low sun there were fewer plants growing there and sturm called for a break kitiara borrowed a bucket from the gnomes cart and filled it with rainwater she dipped a soft rag in the water and wiped the sticky bloodsap erom her blade the sap dissolved easily she lent sturm the rag and he cleaned his weapon you know she said as he rubbed the sap off his sword hilt im no coward and im certainly no delicate lady who faints at the sight of blood but this place is disgusting what kind of world is it where plants grow before your eyes and bleed when theyre cut hows your sword arm sturm asked how does it feel i noticed that youre not even breathing hard look at me im tired as you should be having swung a heavy sword for more than a mile through that weird jungle i feel fine i feel strong want to wrestle no thank you he said i wouldnt like to trust a broken arm to gnomish medicine i wont hurt you she said mockingly kitiaras smile faded she scraped a shallow line in the turf with her heel what are you so worried about were alive arent we there are strange forces at work here this new strength of yours is not normal kitiara shrugged lunitari isnt my idea of paradise but we havent done badly so far sturm knew this was true so why did he feel such foreboding he said just be wary will you kit question what comes to you especially what seems like a great gift she laughed shortly you make it sound like im in personal danger are you afraid fall into evil ways sturm stood and emptied the sapstained water from the bucket thats exactly what im afraid of he wrung out the rag and left it to dry on a stone then walked away to speak with wingover the empty canvas bucket sat by her boot where sturm had poured out the water the turf was dark and slick it looked like so much blood kitiara wrinkled her nose and kicked the bucket away the toe of her boot split the fabric and sent the bucket soaring over the tops of the pink and crimson foliage chapter the crusty pudding plant the trail wound between the hills in no particular direction among the fastgrowing plants there was no way for the adventurers to identify landmarks or remember where theyd been sturm discovered that the path they had made grew tall again after they had passed the explorers were virtually cut off in the living jungle sturm halted the party finally and announced that they were lost sighter promptly tried to find the latitude by shooting the sun with his astrolabe even though he stood on sturms shoulders the sun was too low for him to sight correctly and he fell over backward trying fitter and rainspot picked sighter up and dusted him off for hed fallen on a puffball and was coated with pink spores useless sighter said spores got up his nose and mouth and he coughed in fits and starts all i can tell you is that the sun is setting weve not had but four or five hours of daylight wingover protested the position of lunitari in the heavens is eccentric the astronomer gnome explained rainspot tried to dab the dust from his face with a damp rag but sighter swatted his hands away the nights are very long and the days very short we havent found any ore yet bellcrank said true said wingover but we havent tried digging either digging said roperig digging said sturm firmly wingovers right pick a spot bellcrank and well dig to see what we can find could we make supper first the tubby gnome asked my stomachs so empty i dont suppose an hour will matter too much said sturm all right well camp here eat then dig the gnomes fell to in their cheerfully scatterbrained way roperig and fitter unpacked the cart in a very simple way they upended it fitter was buried in the mound of junk and came out with his favorite clay kettle supper will be ready in a jiffy he said brightly the other gnomes hooted derisively beans beans beans im sick of beans cutwood said im sick sick sick of beans beans beans shut up you dumb carpenter said sighter ahahah kitiara warned as cutwood picked up a mallet and tiptoed up behind sighter none of that fitter took a hatchet and chopped a plank off the side of the cart bed sturm saw this and said have you been burning pieces of the wagon all along of course said the gnome what else is there why dont you try some of the plants said bellcrank theyre too green wingover said theyd never burn start a fire with the kindling youve got and lay the green plants on top when the fire dries them out theyll burn kitiara said fitter and cutwood scavenged along the trail and returned with double armfuls of chopped lunitarian flora these they dumped on the ground by the wagon fitter built an arch of pink spear plants over the smoky fire within a few minutes a tantalizing aroma filled the air the hungry band surrounded fitter fitter my lad i never wouldve believed it but that bean pot smells just like roast pheasant said wingover your gears are slipping said roperig it smells like freshbaked bread roast venison said sturm wrinkling his nose sausages and gravy bellcrank said licking his lips i havent even put the beans in yet fitter declared and it smells like raisin muffins to me its those things rainspot said pointing to the pink spears the parts nearest the flames had darkened to a rich brown the sap had oozed out and hardened in streaks along the stalk sighter picked up one spear by the raw end he sniffed the cooked tip and very gingerly bit it chewing his suspicious frown inverted pudding he said with a catch in his voice crusty pudding like my mother used to make the gnomes tripped over each other in a rush to try the other spears sturm managed to save one from the first batch with his dagger he sliced the roasted portion in two stabbed a piece and offered it to kitiara it looks like meat she said then nibbled off a bit what does it taste like to you asked sturm otiks fried potatoes she said amazed with lots of salt a most unique experiment sighter commented to each of us this plant tastes like our favorite food how can that be if its all the same plant kitiara asked munching vigorously my theory is it has to do with the same force that has given you your strength and rainspot his rainmaking ability magic asked sturm possibly possibly the word seemed to make sighter uncomfortable we gnomes believe that what is commonly called magic is just another natural force yet to be tamed the rest of the pink spears were rapidly consumed for their size the gnomes were hearty eaters and finished the meal lying about the camp holding their bellies what a feast exclaimed bellcrank one of the finest roperig agreed sturm stood over them fists on his hips a fine lot you are whos going to help dig now nap first cutwood mumbled wiggling around to get comfortable yes must rest said rainspot to ensure proper digestion and adequate relaxation of the muscles soon the little clearing rattled with the highpitched snores of seven sets of lungs the sun sank rapidly below the hill when the light diminished to a deep amber glow the tangle of plants began to wither almost as quickly as they had sprouted with the morning sun they now shriveled spear tips dried and fell off the spider flowers curled up and bored into the soil the puffballs deflated the toadstools crumbled into powder by the time the stars came out nothing remained above the ground but a fresh layer of red flakes kitiara said i think ill stand watch for a while get some sleep why dont you then you can relieve me later good idea he said sturm was suddenly aware of how very tired he was constant wonders had dulled his senses and hacking through the daylight jungle had worn him out he spread his bedroll beside the upturned cart and lay down a full krynnish day theyd marched and still no sign of any ore deposits he wondered what would happen if they dug into one of the hills and still found none there was one desperate measure that they could resort to he and kitiara still carried their swords and armor the gnomes could very likely forge new parts from the steel and iron of these but he wanted that to be their last possible choice the air of lunitari never warm grew chillier sturm shivered and pulled his furry cloak up to his chin the lining was wolf fur he and tanis had hunted in the mountains of qualinost last winter and had done very well tanis was a dead shot with a bow he heard the arrows hum sturm was on krynn suddenly and it was daytime though cold and overcast he was in a forest and there were four men moving through the trees ahead of him two men carried a third between them his arms across their shoulders when sturm got closer he saw why the carried man had an arrow in his thigh come on hurrik you can make it the leader was saying sturm couldnt see the fourth mans face but he heard him urging the others on there was a crackle in the dead brush behind him sturm looked back and saw dim figures in white flitting among the trees they wore wolfskin cowls and carried bows he knew who they were the dreaded trackers of leereach hired huntsmen who would track down anyone or anything for a price stay with us hurrik dont give up the leader whispered urgently leave me my lord the wounded man replied the leader stood with his men ill not leave you to those butchers he said please go my lord they will want to give me to their master and that will give you time to get away hurrik said there was blood on his armor sturm could see it smeared across the mans coif the two men carrying hurrik propped him against a tree they drew his sword for him and wrapped his fingers around the grip sturm could see his face waxen from loss of blood the trackers stopped a snickering whistle rattled through the forest the prey was turning at bay the signal meant close in for the kill the leader his face still hidden from sturm drew a long dagger from his belt and put it in the wounded mans left hand paladine protect you master hurrik he said and you my lord now hurry the three unhurt men ran away as fast as their armor would allow hurrik raised his sword with painfilled effort a wolfs head parted a stand of ripe holly come out said hurrik come out and fight me the tracker was having none of it coolly he nocked an arrow and let fly the broadhead found its mark my lord hurrik cried the leader paused to look back to where his comrade had died sturm saw his face father he returned to lunitari with that scream sturm was lying on his stomach his bedroll in knots wearily he sat up to find kitiara watching him i had a nightmare he said ashamed no she said you were awake i saw you youve been thrashing about and moaning for a long time your eyes were wide open what did you see i was i was on krynn again i dont know where but there were trackers they were after some men one of whom was my father leereach trackers sturm nodded sweat stood out on his lip though the air was cold enough for his breath to show it was real wasnt it he said i think it was this may be your gift sturm visions like my strength this is what lunitari has given you he shuddered visions of what the past the future or am i seeing the present in faraway places how can i tell kit how can i know i dont know she combed through her black curls with her fingers it hurts doesnt it not knowing i think i shall go mad no you wont youre too strong for that she rose and came around the dying fire to sit by him sturm refolded his blanket and lay down these visions which had been thrust upon him were maddening they smacked of magic and tor mented him without warning however sturm found him self trying to fix every detail in his mind going over and over the terrible scene there could be a clue to his fathers fate hidden in these specters kitiara laid a hand on his chest and felt the rapid beating of his heart chapter some of our gnomes are missing the gnomes recovered from their postprandial lethargy and bounced around the camp shouting and toss ing tools to each other bellcrank found a long dowel and scratched a mark on the side of a hill theres where we dig he announced why there asked cutwood why not wouldnt it be better to go to the top and drive a shaft straight down suggested wingover if we wanted to dig a well maybe but not when were prospecting for iron bellcrank said after lengthy discus sion about such esoteric matters as geological strata sedi mentation and the proper diet of miners the gnomes discovered that all they had to dig with was two short handled wooden scoops whose are these asked sighter mine fitter spoke up one for beans one for raisins isnt there a proper shovel or spade in the cart no said roperig of course if we had some iron we could make our own shovels cutwood and wingover pelted him with dirty socks for his suggestion if scoops are what we have scoops itll have to be said bellcrank he offered them to cutwood and wingover why us said cutwood why not i wish hed stop saying that wingover said he shoved his sleeves above his elbows and knelt by the circle that bell crank had scratched in the turf oh rocks he sighed youd better hope to reorx we strike rocks said cut wood else well be digging all day the gnomes gathered around as their two colleagues fell to the upper layers of flaky red fluff were easily scraped away the diggers flung scoopfuls over their shoulders hit ting sighter and rainspot in the face the gnomes withdrew to a cleaner observation point bellcrank bent down and grabbed a handful of the soil that wingover had tossed back no longer dry and spongy this dirt was hard grainy and damp hello he said look at this sand sturm and kitiara examined the ball of damp sand that bellcrank had squeezed in his small fist it was quite ordi nary sand tinged pale red ugh ow heres something cutwood grunted he kicked a large chunk of something out of the tunnel the thing wobbled down the slope a little way and stopped fit ter picked it up feels like glass he said sighter took it from him it is glass crude glass sighter said more bits of glass came out of the hole along with sand sand and more sand wingover and cutwood had tunneled headfirst into the hillside and now only their feet showed in the opening sturm told them to stop digging its no use he said theres no ore here i must agree with master brightblade said bellcrank the whole hill is likely one big pile of sand where does the glass come from kitiara asked any source of heat can melt sand into glass lightning forest fire volcano thats not important sturm said we dug for iron and found glass the question is what do we do now go on looking said fitter timidly what about stutts and the others kitiara asked strip my gears i forgot about our colleagues said roperig what shall we do sturm said well go back itll be daylight again before we reach the flying ship and we can harvest some spear plants for stutts birdcall and flash to eat once were all together we can repair the engine he regarded kit grave ly with the iron that kitiara and i wear on us you gnomes can forge our arms and armor into the parts you need murmurs of approval rippled through the gnomes do you think id allow my sword my mail to be ham mered into machine parts with what will we defend our selves scoops and beans kitiara said furiously all weve used our weapons for so far is chopping weeds sturm countered this could be our only way home kitiara crossed her arms i dont like it nor do i but what choice do we have we can be well armed and marooned or unarmed and on our way home not a handsome choice she had to admit you neednt make up your mind right now whatever you decide we should return to the ship first said sturm no one disputed his decision the gnomes prepared to break camp like their unpacking this was a brisk proce dure each gnome tossed an item into the righted cart sometimes they wrestled over the same item and rainspot and cutwood even got carried away and threw fitter in sturm pulled the littlest gnome out before he was buried with a clear sky and plenty of stars the explorers were able to plot their way back to the plain of stones once they left the chain of hills they beheld a lovely sight on the southwestern horizon a bluewhite glow lit the sky within a few hundred yards walk the source of the glow was revealed to be the world of krynn rising into sight for the firsttime since their arrival on the red moon the party stopped to admire the great azure orb what are the fuzzy white parts asked kitiara clouds said rainspot and the blue is ocean the brown land exactly right lady sturm stood apart from the rest contemplating his home world kitiara peered through the gnomes spyglass squint ing one eye closed and bending far down to sighters level when she was done she went to where sturm stood dont you want to take a look she asked sturm rubbed his newly bearded chin i can see it fine the bright white light of krynn caught on his ring and glim mered the emblem of the knights of solamnias order of the rose caught his eye he inhaled smoke and coughed not again the vision was upon him without any warn ing sturm fought to stay calm something always hap pened to trigger the experience first the moons chill air then the feel of his wolf fur cloak and now the light reflect ing off his ring the only real relic of his solamnic heritage it wasnt his fathers ring but his mothers sturm wore it on his little finger a high dark wall loomed over his back sturm was standing in the shadow of the wall and it was night twenty yards away a fire burned he seemed to be in the courtyard of a castle two men in ragged cloaks stood hunched over the fire a third lay on the ground unmoving sturm came nearer and saw that the tallest man was his father sturms heart raced he held out his hands to angriff brightblade for the first time in thirteen years the old war rior lifted his head and stared right past sturm they cant see me sturm thought was there a way he could make him self known we should not have come here my lord said the other standing man its dangerous the last place our enemies would look for us is in my own sacked castle replied lord brightblade besides we had to get marbred out of the wind the fever has settled in his chest father sturm tried to shout he could not even hear him self lord brightblade squatted by the man on the ground his breath had frozen on his beard making it as white as marbreds how do you feel old friend sturms father asked marbred wheezed fit for any command of my lord angriff squeezed his old retainers arm stood and turned his back on the sick man he may not last the night he said tomorrow there may be only you and i bren what shall we do my lord lord brightblade reached under the tattered layers of cloak and blankets that hung from his broad shoulders he unbuckled his belt and brought out his sword and scabbard i will not allow this blade forged by the first of my ances tors and borne with honor all these years to fall into the hands of the enemy bren grabbed lord brightblades wrist my lord you dont intend you cant mean to destroy it angriff pulled six inches of the sword from its covering the fitful firelight caught on the burnished steel and made it glitter no he said as long as my son lives the bright blade line will continue my sword and armor will be his sturm felt as if his heart would burst then suddenly the pain caused by the scene was replaced by an odd lightness it stole into sturms limbs and though he tried to hold him self in the vision to keep everything in sharp focus the image faded the fire the men his father and the sword of the brightblades wavered and dissolved sturms fingers clenched into tight fists as he tried literally to grasp the scene sturm found himself clenching the nap of kitiaras fur coat im all right sturm said his heart slowly resumed its normal rhythm you were very quiet this time she reported you stared into space as if you were watching a stage play in solace in a way i was he described his fathers vigil it must be the present or the recent past he reasoned the castle was in ruins but my father did not look so old perhaps fif ty years his beard had not grayed he must be alive sturm became aware that he was lying on his back and moving he sat up hastily and almost fell off the gnomes cart howd i get up here he asked i put you there you didnt look as if you could make it on your own said kitiara you picked me up with one hand said wingover sturm looked down all the gnomes but sighter were on the poles pushing the cart along he suddenly felt embarrassed to be such a bur den to his companions and jumped off the cart kitiara slid down too how long was i out sturm asked better part of an hour said sighter referring to the stars the visions are getting longer arent they yes but i think theyre triggered when im reminded of something from the past sturm said if i concentrate on the present perhaps i can avoid episodes like this sturm doesnt approve of the supernatural kitiara explained to the gnomes its part of his knightly code krynn was now high overhead and the terrain around them was as bright as day no plants grew in the brilliant light however all was cold and lifeless under the planets clear glow sighter led his colleagues in another long discus sion kitiara and sturm were trailing behind the cart so no one saw the ditch until the front wheels spilled into it the gnomes on the front pole cutwood fitter and wingover fell on their faces roperig rainspot and bell crank struggled to keep the heavily laden wagon from turn ing over kitiara and sturm rushed in and steadied the sides let it roll down kitiara said let go rainspot and bellcrank stepped back but roperig did not the cart bounded down the side of the ditch with the humans running alongside and roperig bouncing painfully against the pushpole whats the matter with you bellcrank said when the cart halted why didnt you let go ii cant roperig complained my hands are stuck he wallowed to his feet dust poured from his pockets and cuffs his stubby fingers were firmly attached to the push pole rainspot tried prying his colleagues fingers free ow ow roperig yelled youre tearing my fingers off dont be such a crybaby said sighter cutwood did you put glue on this end of the pole asked rainspot absolutely not by gears i would never do that without telling him first cutwoods invocation of the sacred word gears proved that he was telling the truth hmm kitiara drummed her fingers on the cart wheel maybe its more of this crazy lunitari magic you mean ill be stuck to this cart forever dont be distressed master i can saw this pole off fitter said he patted his boss on the back consolingly rot said bellcrank if master brightblade will lend me his knife ill scrape your fingers off in no time roperig blanched you will not then we can saw very carefully around your fingers no ones going to cut or saw anything kitiara said if this stickiness is related to my strength or sturms visions then you ought to give some thought to how it works before you start hacking away on a fellows fingers quite so said sighter now could it be more than coincidence that we acquire abilities connected to our lifes work i rainspot makes rain lady kitiara grows mightier as a warrior and roperig master of cords and knots finds himself bound by his own hands its as though some subtle yet powerful force were enhancing our natural attributes roperig can probably free himself if he wishes to said kitiara just as rainspot can wish for his rain all i wanted to do was keep my grip when we slipped in the ditch roperig said glumly he screwed his eyes tightly shut and wished hard harder concentrate urged sighter cutwood whipped out his magnifying glass and peered intently at roperigs stuck hands slowly with faint sucking sounds his hands peeled off the cart pole ow ow roperig whimpered waving his hands about that stings the cart was shoved to the top of the gully rim the gnomes passed a water bottle around fitter handed it to kitiara who had a short swig before offering it to sturm he held it a long time staring at the ground and not drink ing now what she said taking the bottle back this magic worries me couldnt we refuse it somehow give it back she pushed the plug back into the bottle why should we we ought to get used to it learn to control the effect kitiara flexed a hand into a fist she could feel the strength within her like the warmth of sweet wine in her veins it was intoxicating that taste of power she looked sturm in the eye if we return to krynn penniless weaponless and armorless i hope our powers remain it isnt right he said stubbornly right this is the only right that matters the water bottle exploded when she crushed it in her fingers little fitter stooped to get the glazed shards you broke the bottle lady he said did you cut yourself she showed him her undamaged hand a lot of things may get broken around here before im through she said angrily by the hour krynn had set on the northeast horizon the explorers were more than halfway back to the cloudmaster there was nothing ahead but flat ground rocks and red dust they trod on the humans apart and silent the gnomes once more chattering the pilot of the flying ship walked slower and slower until finally he stopped move along lad said sighter pushing wingover in the back dont want to get left behind do you its gone announced wingover whats gone the ship the cloudmaster youre plain daft were a good eight miles away how could you see from here i dont know but i can see the spot clearly said wingover he squinted into the distance theres a big rut some skid marks and a few broken crates lying around but the ship is gone sturm and kitiara converged on the farseeing gnome are you sure wingover said sturm its gone the gnome insisted sighter and the other gnomes were loudly skeptical but sturm ordered them to quicken their pace the miles rolled aside and still wingover said the flying ship was missing from its landing place he described in precise detail the jet sam left at the scene and his certainty infected the party with apprehension with barely a mile left to go kitiara could stand it no longer she broke into a run and quickly left the rest behind sturm and the gnomes plodded on kitiara came jogging back wingovers right she said the cloudmaster is gone the gnomes immediately surrounded wingover and started poking his face and pulling at his eyelids the gnome pilot slapped at the intruding fingers while his colleagues completely forgetting the news kitiara had brought tried to discover the cause of his remarkable eyesight its the lunitari magic wingover said leave me alone could stutts and company have repaired the ship them selves and flown away sturm asked kitiara loosened her fur collar to let the cool air in there are tracks all over little circular imprints i think the ship was carried off carried off said fitter in awe do you know how much that ship weighs said sighter she put out her chin and replied i dont care if its heavi er than mt nevermind somebody or something picked it up and carried it away sturm said then they are very strong or very numer ous or both said kitiara grimly chapter the walking trees the sun shone over the fiels of stones where the cloudmaster had first met lunitari the exploration party ringed the site gazing helplessly at the empty furrow in the ground as wingover had seen from eight miles away the flying ship and the three gnomes who remained on it were gone the landing wheels that had broken off when they struck the moon were the only part of the ship left behind aside from the wheels there were two empty crates some bean sacks and the remnants of a campfire who could have done this bellcrank asked cutwood crawled about with his lens studying tracks sturm kicked through the pitiful remains of the camp and said at least theres no sign of bloodshed sixty cutwood proclaimed he had dirt on his nose and in his beard at least sixty people were here they mustve carried the cloudmaster away on their shoulders cause there are no marks of the hull being dragged i dont believe it said sighter sixty humans couldnt carry the cloudmaster away on their shoulders even if they were as strong as lady kitiara asked roperig that gave them all pause kitiara squatted by the trail of footprints no human feet made these she said the impressions are round almost like the hooves of unshod horses she noted how closely spaced they were too the clumsy fools must have been treading on each others heels well have to go after them track them down and get the ship back no question about it said sturm kitiara fished the whetstone out of her belt pouch and sat down to hone the edges of her sword sturm gathered the gnomes together were going after your colleagues he announced the gnomes set up a cheer sturm waved for quiet because we dont know how much of a head start they had we have to move as fast as possible that means he saw the anticipa tion in their faces each of you can take along only what you can carry that threw the gnomes into a tumult of preparation and counterpreparation before sturms eyes they tore the fourgnomepower exploratory cart to pieces and began assembling singlegnome exploration packs made of wooden slats and strips of canvas and blanket cloth the packs strapped on like knapsacks but they towered twice as high as the gnomes stood this called for all kinds of sup porting straps and cords and counterload balancing soon each gnome staggered under a complex tent of wood and cloth but in the end they didnt leave one bit of their beloved equipment behind sturm looked them over and groaned inwardly at this rate they would never find the cloudmaster never get back to krynn and never find his father he wanted to rail at the little men but he knew it would do no good gnomes pro ceed at their own rate awkwardly and haphazardly but they do proceed sighter waddled past scribbling his notes under a creak ing canopy of canvas im starting a new log he said swaying from side to side the top of his exploration pack just missed sturms nose this is no longer the lunitari exploratory march he walked on wingover puffed along behind him now we are the lunitari flying ship rescue mission wingover said the trail was wide and plain and as far as anyone could tell no effort had been made to hide it either those who had captured the flying ship were not very smart or else they thought stutts birdcall and flash were the only crew on board kitiara and wingover moved out ahead of the rest she tested his longdistance vision by having the gnome describe arrangements of rocks from as far away as six miles poor wingover got a terrific headache and his short legs were no match for kitiaras long powerful stride she shouldered his exploratory pack its straps were strained to the bursting point and lifted him by the coat collar tucking wingover under her arm kitiara took to sprinting far ahead relying on the gnomes farseeing to keep them from getting lost the trail carried on in an unswerving line due west sturm plodded along with the overburdened gnomes they marched on both sides of the trail arguing over the reasons for wingovers gift of farseeing sturm shaded his eyes from the sun and looked at the footprints they were strikingly regular circular depressions in five distinct columns he said to bellcrank dont these prints seem strange to you undoubtedly yes master brightblade as weve seen no animal life since arriving on the red moon replied the gnome exactly have you noticed how very precise the foot prints are all of them are perfectly aligned i dont follow even a gaited horse will have a little jog a sideways motion now and then that distinguishes its track a machine bellcrank exclaimed master brightblade youve done it bellcrank grasped roperig by his lapels dont you see what else could pick up the cloudmaster and carry it off but another machine by reorx i hadnt thought of that said roperig fitter rattled to rainspot and told him bellcranks theory the idea then leaped the trail to where cutwood and sighter were walking sighter poohpoohed the notion that doesnt solve a thing he said where theres a machine there has to be a machinemaker yes bellcrank opened his mouth to vent his opinion but just then kitiara and wingover came running at them the war rior woman carried the gnome under her arm like a loaf of bread wingovers head bounced and jiggled each time her heels struck the ground in another situation the image might have been comic kitiara braced to a halt in front of sturm theres a vil lage up ahead she said she wasnt even out of breath village what sort of village asked roperig a village village said wingover from under kitiaras arm theres some kind of keep in the center of the place does the trail lead to this village asked sturm kitiara shook her head it veers off to the north avoid ing it completely we ought to inspect this village cutwood called from thirty yards away sturm and the others looked at each oth er then at cutwood can you hear what were saying said wingover in a bare whisper well certainly do you think im deaf cutwood yelled back sighter tapped him on the shoulder i cant hear them he said he grabbed cutwood by the ears and turned his head from side to side peering into the carpenters ears everything looks normal he said does my voice sound loud to you it does when you yell from an inch away sighter took cutwood by the hand to where the others stood its happened again he reported cutwood can hear normal conversation from thirty yards away maybe more really this calls for some tests said rainspot he low ered his pack to the ground and tried to disentangle himself from the cords and straps never mind kitiara said what do we do about the village how close will we have to pass if we follow the trail sturm queried spitting distance he squinted into the sky half the days gone if we start now we can be past the village before nightfall and not lose the trail sighter grumbled about the humans lack of scien tific curiosity but no gnome seriously considered going against sturms plan sturm formed the party single file and sternly admon ished the gnomes to keep quiet i feel trouble coming he said a keep means a lord of some kind and probably armed retainers if he added if this world is anything like krynn looking straight ahead kit said are you afraid afraid no concerned yes our stay here has never been more precarious a pitched battle could destroy us even if we win thats the difference between us sturm you fight to pre serve order and honor i fight for myself if trouble is brew ing the only thing to do is come out on top no matter what happens to the rest of us he scored a touch kitiaras eyes flashed i have never changed sides in a battle nor betrayed a friend the little men need our protection and ill shed my last drops of blood defending them youve no right to imply otherwise sturm walked on silently for a moment then said im sorry kit its becoming harder for me to know your mind i think this magical strength youve gained has affected your outlook my mind you mean trust you to say it the most brutal way life is brutal and so are facts at the rear of the column cutwood could hear every thing and he said i think theyre mad at each other shows how much you know sighter replied human males and females always act strangely toward each other they never want their true feelings to show why is that because they dont want to seem vulnerable humans have a lot of this attitude called pride which is sort of like the satisfaction you get when your machine performs cor rectly pride makes them act contrary to the way they really feel thats silly sighter shrugged under his towering pack and almost fell down unh by reorx of course its silly and these two humans have especially bad cases of pride which means the fiercer they act and the louder they yell the more they care about each other cutwood was dazzled by his colleagues understanding of human behavior where did you learn so much about humans he said i listen and learn said sighter very ungnomishly though he didnt yet realize it that was the change wrought in sighter by the magic of lunitari from an intuitive impetuous gnome he had become a logical thoughtful deductive gnome a creature that had never before existed the field of stones was largely barren of plants even by day so the first sign the marchers had that they were near the village was when stands of scarletcapped mushrooms seven feet tall appeared growing in neat rows between two low stone walls roperig picked a section of wall apart to study it was simply made of loose rocks stacked conven iently together very primitive was his disdainful verdict the mushroom orchard served to screen them from the village itself sturm kitiara wingover and cutwood crept through the rows of fungus to the very edge of the settle ment by krynnish standards it wasnt much of a village there werent any houses at all just a series of concentric stone walls about waist high plus a few cribs filled with harvested food the only fullscale structure was the keep a squat singlestory windowless block in the center of the village walls a lone pole stuck up from the keep and a dirty gray banner hung limply from it not exactly the golden halls of silvanost is it said kiti ara to the gnomes she said can you hear or see anything stirring down there wingover could see nothing moving cutwood squinted one eye shut and listened hard i hear footsteps he said uncertainly pretty faint someones walking around inside the keep fine lets bypass this place said sturm the other gnomes waited patiently on the other side chattering in whispers when wingover cutwood and the humans returned they shouldered their lofty packs and formed a single file again the village looks deserted sturm said so were going past it be quiet anyway the trail of the cloudmaster bent away from the village just beyond the walls of the mushroom orchard as they rounded the tall red stalks kitiara who was leading saw that the path was lined on either side by tall leafless trees odd she said those werent there before did they grow up suddenly like the other plants asked roperig kitiara shook her head and drew her sword v the trees stood about seven feet high their trunks were graduated in bands of color ranging from deep burgundy red at the base to the lightest of pinks at their roundedoff tops all had branches that grew out and bent down ugliest trees i ever saw said cutwood he left the line long enough to chip a piece of the flaky bark off with his twenty tool pocket kit he was examining the fleshy gray wood when the trees left branch flexed and swatted the specimen from his hand hey he said the tree hit me the double row of trees launched into motion they pulled their roots out of the ground and freed their limbs black dishlike eyes opened in the trunks and ragged mouths split apart sturm grabbed for his hilt the gnomes bunched together between him and kitiara suffering bloodstained gods what are these things kitiara exclaimed unless im gravely mistaken these are our villagers they were expecting us sturm replied keeping the tip of his sword moving back and forth to discourage the tree things the treefolk emitted a series of deep hooting sounds like a chorus of rams horns from recesses in their own bodies they produced an array of swords and spears all made of clear red glass the treefolk closed the circle around the besieged band be ready kitiara said her voice taut with anticipation when we break through them everybody run run where asked fitter tremulously one treeman the tallest of the lot broke ranks with its fellows and advanced it did not actually walk rather the tangle of roots that made up its feet flexed and carried the creature forward the treeman raised its crude hiltless glass sword in one barkcovered hand and hooted loudly yah kitiara sprang forward and cut at the glass blade she knocked it aside and swung again this time striking the treeman below its left arm her sword bit deeply into the soft woodflesh so deeply that it would not easily come out kitiara ducked the return cut by the treemans sword and let go of her own she retreated a few steps leaving her blade embedded in the foe the treeman did not appear too much discomforted by the yard of steel stuck in him sturm lend me your sword said kitiara quickly i will not he replied calm down will you that crea ture wasnt attacking it was trying to speak the impaled treeman regarded them with wide unblink ing eyes in a raspy bass voice it said men iron men yes said sturm we are men and were gnomes said bellcrank pleased to meet iron the treeman plucked kitiaras sword from its flank grasping it by the blade he offered the hilt to kitiara iron men she gingerly took the handle and let the point fall to the ground men come said the treeman his eyes and mouth van ished only to reappear on the opposite side men come iron king the treeman reversed direction without turning around the other treefolk did likewise their eyes closed up on one side of their heads and reopened on the other fascinating said cutwood completely saves them the trouble of turning around do we go with them asked rainspot sturm looked away to the trail of the stolen flying ship for now he said we should pay our respects to this iron king maybe he knows what couldve taken our ship the treefolk made straight for the village keep sturm kitiara and the gnomes fell in behind them closer to the village they saw signs of damage to the walls and gardens something had battered down a long section of wall and a crib full of yellow fruit shaped like corkscrews had been plundered slippery pulp and seeds were splashed all over the place the treemens leader the one kitiara had cut halted before the door of the keep the gate consisted of overlap ping slabs of red glass hanging from hinges of the same material the treeman boomed king men iron come without waiting for any reply the treeman leaned on the gate and it swung in the treeman did not enter himself but stood back and with a sweep of his arm indicated that the visitors should go in kitiara slipped in her back pressed against the rough stone wall with a practiced eye for danger she surveyed the scene the interior was well lit as it had no roof the walls rose ten feet and slanted in but no thatch or shingles kept out the sun the room shed entered was actually a cor ridor branching off to the left and right the facing wall was blank though smoothly plastered with gritty mortar painted white its clear she reported her voice was taut and low sturm let the gnomes enter man sturm looked up at the impassive eyes of the tree man iron king him it pointed left i understand thank you the treeman tapped his long jointed finger on the gate and sturm pushed it shut our host will be found down the left corridor he said everyone be on your guard kitiara moved to the end of the line steeled for signs of treachery the hall turned right and widened the high walls and lack of ceiling made sturm feel as if he were in a maze they came upon an unexpectedly familiar artifact a low thick door made of oak and strapped with iron hinges this relic leaned against the wall fitter peeked behind it it doesnt lead anywhere he said theres something familiar about it mused cutwood you silly loon of course its familiar youve seen doors before said bellcrank no its the style thats familiar i have it this is a ships door he announced its not from the cloudmaster is it sturm said alarmed no this door is oak the cloudmasters are pine now how would a ships door get on the red moon wingover asked rhetorically cutwood was composing an answer when kitiara shooed him on they passed more debris from their world empty kegs clay pots and cups tatters of canvas and scraps of leather a rusty broken cutlass some coils of rope were identified by an eager roperig as ships cordage made in southern ergoth excitement mounted as more and more tantalizing things cropped up the corridor turned right again this time into a wide room there standing by an overturned wooden chair was a man a genuine man short and scrawny he was dressed in a dirty tan vest and cutoff pants rope sandals and a peaked canvas cap his face was dirty and his graystreaked beard came down almost to his stomach heh heh heh rasped the man visitors at last ive been wanting visitors for a long long time who are you asked sturm me me why im the king of lunitari proclaimed the tattered scarecrow chapter rapaldo the first you dont believe me said the selfproclaimed monarch you hardly conform to the stereotypical archetype said sighter the king of lunitari cocked his head whatd you say he asked you dont look like a king sturm interpreted well i am rapaldo the first mariner shipwright and absolute ruler of the red moon thats me he approached the band in a nervous hesitant shuffle who are you the gnomes eagerly pushed themselves up to king rapaldo shaking hands in quick succession and rattling off the shorter versions of their impossibly long names rapaldos eyes glazed over from the barrage sturm cleared his throat and gently steered fitter the last gnome away from the bewildered man sturm brightblade of solamnia he said of himself kitiara stepped forward and pushed back her fur collar rapaldo gasped aloud kitiara uth matar she said llady rapaldo stammered i have not seen a real lady in many many years im not sure youre seeing one now kitiara said with a laugh rapaldo gently took her hand he held it carefully looking at the back and palm with embarrassing intentness kitiaras hands were not refined or delicate they were the strong supple hands of a warrior rapaldos reverent inter est amused her as if suddenly aware that he was being foolish rapaldo dropped kitiaras hand and drew himself up to his full height not much more than five and a half feet and announced if you would follow me to the royal audience hall ill hear the story of your coming here and tell the tale of my own shipwreck he went back to his overturned chair and righted it this way said the king of lunitari they followed rapaldo through a series of mostly empty rooms all open to the sky what furniture there was had a nautical cast to it here a seamans chest there a railed cap tains chair other bits of ship were hung on the wall a brass hawse pipe liner some loops of anchor chain a lathe turned rail studded with iron spikes bellcrank tugged on sturms sleeve metal he whis pered lots of it i see it sturm said calmly this way this way rapaldo said gesturing the very center of the keep was the audience hall a square room ten yards wide when rapaldo entered a half dozen treemen snapped glass spears to their nonexistent shoulders in salute they hooted in unison three times and dropped their spears to a ported position my palace guard rapaldo said with pride are they intelligent asked wingover not like you and i are they learn things i teach them remember orders and such like but they werent civilized when i first came here at the far end of the room a crude throne was set up a highbacked chair mounted on a thick rectangle of ruby glass the chair had obviously been cobbled together from ships timbers the peg holes from the trenails were still visi ble rapaldo hopped upon the glass pedestal and picked up his scepter from the seat of the chair he turned around and sat down with a sigh laying the emblem of his office in the crook of his arm it was a broadhead axe hear ye hear ye the royal court of lunitari may begin rapaldo recited in a highpitched voice he coughed once and his skinny chest convulsed i king rapaldo the first am present and speaking in honor of the unexpected guests who have arrived today i king rapaldo will relate the marvelous tale of my coming to this place roperig and fitter sensing that a long story was beginning sat down rapaldo leaped to his feet you will stand in the presence of the king he shouted punctuating the command with a sweep of his scepteraxe the two gnomes stood with alacri ty rapaldo shivered with fury those who do not show respect will be removed by the royal guard sturm flashed kitiara a knowing look she bowed and said forgive us your majesty weve not been in the pres ence of a king for quite some time her intervention had an almost magical effect rapaldo relaxed and sat on his wooden throne again there was a distinct clink as he did so sturm spied a glint of chain around his waist better better whats a king without subjects who pay him respect a captain without a ship a ship without a rud der tara rapaldo gripped the arms of his throne tightly for a moment its been tten years since last i spoke to another human being he said if i rattle and prattle lay it to that fact he drew a deep breath i was born the son and grandson of sailors on the island of enstar in the sirrian sea my father was slain by kernaffi pirates when i was but a lad and the day the word came home i ran away to sea i learned to use the axe and adze cutwood heard this and squirmed to comment sighter and wingover both put hands over his mouth the trade of the shipwright built a man out of a boy heh heh and as the summers passed i stopped going to sea and stayed ashore on enstar making craft that plied the wide green ocean the royal axe slid down to rapaldos lap had i stayed a landbound shipwright though i would not now be the royal person you see before you a frayed sleeve slipped off his bony shoulder absently rapaldo replaced it i would not now be on this moon he mut tered a prosperous ship owner named melvalyn hired me to sail with him to southern ergoth melvalyn planned to buy timber to build a new fleet of merchant ships and he wanted an expert along to grade the available wood we were to depart from enstar for daltigoth on the third day of autumn an illstarred day the soothsayer dirazo the one i always consulted for times of good luck and bad parleyed with the dark spirits and pronounced the sailing date as damned by the rise of nuitari the black moon i tried to beg off but melvalyn insisted the voyage begin as planned heh heh old melvalyn learned what it means to disregard the omens yes he learned cold contrary winds from the southeast blew us west of ergoth we tacked and tacked but made little headway against the kharolis blow then four days out to sea the wind died we were becalmed theres not a more helpless feeling than being at sea with no wind melvalyn tried all the tricks wetting the sails kedging with the anchors and such like but we didnt move enough to measure the sky sort of closed in on us fisheye gray and then the father of all storms broke on us rapaldo caught up in his own monologue stood abrupt ly he made swift jerky gestures to illustrate his story the sea it was running like this and the wind it was blowing like this his hands swung in from opposite directions and clashed in front of his face rain was screeching over the deck flat sideways the tarvolina that was our ship lost her topmast and yards straight away and then and then it came down and grabbed us rapaldo stepped upon his throne and crouched his head ducked to protect himself from the memory what was it rainspot burst out unwittingly rapaldo waiting for this cue didnt get angry this time a waterspout he said shivering a mighty twisting column of water a hundred feet wide at the bottom it sucked up the tarvolina like a dry leaf and we went right through the hollow middle of it up and up and up some of the sailors got scared and jumped overboard those that jumped down the middle fell all the way back to the sea miles and miles but those that hit the wall of twisting water rapaldo stamped his foot on the chair all the gnomes jumped in fright they were ripped to pieces might as well have jumped into an ocean of knife blades the metaphor seemed to please him for he smiled for all his scruffiness the king of lunitari had a fine set of straight white teeth the waterspout carried us so high that the blue went out of the sky only six men out of the full crew of twenty lived to the funnels end the waterspout turned inside out and dropped the tarvolina upside down here on lunitari king rapaldo hopped down to the glass throne base his shaggy eyebrows closed in over his dark brown eyes three men survived the shipwreck melvalyn darnino the navigator and rapaldo the first melvalyn had a bro ken leg and died not long after darnino and i almost starved until we learned to eat the plants that grow by day and drink the dew that collects in the red turf at night thats something we didnt know sturm thought darnino and i stayed together until we met the oud ouhai the treepeople the treefolk had never seen men before and they took us for their dread enemies here rapaldo paused he peered at each member of the group in turn anyway there was a fight and darnino was killed the lunitarians were about to kill me too when i raised my axe he suited the action to the words and they were so awestruck that they proclaimed me oemowaoya supreme ruler of them all and wielder of the holy iron rapaldo finished his story with a giggle unmindful of the guards standing nearby he added the worthless savages had never seen metal before they figured it must have come from the gods and that i was a holy messenger sent to look after them have the lunitarians no metal of their own asked bell crank theres no metal on the whole bloody moon as near as i can tell said rapaldo he flopped into his throne and adjusted his ragged clothes with extreme care and dignity now i would hear of your own coming he said loftily wingover started to speak but the king rapped the side of his axe on the throne let the lady tell it kitiara unhooked her sword belt and stood the weapon in its sheath before her she leaned on the sword and told the tale of how she and sturm had met the gnomes in the rainstorm the flight to the red moon their expedition and the theft of the cloudmaster heh heh heh rapaldo laughed you cant leave things lying about unguarded not even on lunitari the micones have taken your craft micones the enemies i spoke of the oudouhai have no preda tors to fear as there are no animals on lunitari only plants but the micones when directed are a plague indeed but what are they asked kitiara ants ants said sighter giant ants said rapaldo six feet of solid rock crystal the magic in this moon gives them the power to move and work but they havent got a single brain among them who or what directs these micones asked sturm the king of lunitari shrank from the question ive never seen it he said evasively though i once heard it speak sturm saw kitiara ball a fist in frustration rapaldos quirky behavior was getting on her nerves she relaxed her hand slowly and said as evenly as her temper would allow who is their mastermind your majesty the voice in the obelisk some ten miles from my palace sits a great stone obelisk five hundred feet or more high its hollow and a demon dwells within it speaks in a sweet voice to the micones who live in a burrow under the base the demon never comes out of its tower and ive never gone in to see it and these micones have taken our ship asked sturm did i not say it rapaldo answered sulkily two nights ago a host of crystal ants marched past in the dark they tore down one of our walls to clear a path evil i tell you they couldve walked around it must have been your craft that they were carrying why didnt your warriors oppose them because they are trees after all when the sun sets they root themselves where they stand and feed all night long only with the coming of day can they shake off the dirt and walk about rapaldo popped up again he directed a glare at sturm your manners are impertinent i wont answer any more questions the shrillness left his voice and he added we are tired you may leave us now if you follow the corridor to the right you will find rooms you can sleep in kitiara and sturm bowed the gnomes waved and the group filed out of the audience hall a treeman led the way what did you think of that kitiara said in a loud whis per later sturm replied softly the roofless walls were no guarantee of privacy along the corridor that rapaldo had mentioned they found a series of niches some were filled with more wreck age of the lost tarvolina others were empty the treeman indicated that the empty niches were their rooms then departed the gnomes shrugged off their packs and set to work making as much noise and confusion as seven gnomes could make sturm pulled kitiara aside i fear that his majesty is a bit out of the weather sturm whispered hes as crazy as a bug chaser thats another way to say it yes but kit we need him to take us to this obelisk if thats where the giant ants have taken the cloudmaster so well have to humor his royal pose to keep his good will at least till we leave id like to give him a good shaking she said thats what he needs use your head kit there are probably hundreds of treemen around all loyal to king rapaldo how do we kill a tree even with your increased strength all you did was cut a chunk out of one of them youre right she said her expression darkened ill tell you something else hes wearing mail under those rags i heard it clink when he sat down there are two reasons for people to wear mail when they know theyre going to be attacked or when they think theyre going to be attacked mad he may be but old rapaldo is afraid of something she tapped a finger on sturms chest i say its us why us cause were human and weve got metal of our own which probably confuses the lunitarians to death most of all were younger bigger and stronger than his majesty oh let him be king of the treemen if he wants if rapaldos afraid of anything its this mysterious demon of the obelisk have any ideas about it on this crazy moon it could be anything but if the demons got stutts and the others with the flying ship hed better be prepared to give them over or face a fight fitter appeared with two steaming bowls dinner said the gnome pink spears and mushroom gills seasoned with puffball dust fitter handed over the bowls and returned to his colleagues they ate their food in silence for a while sturm said at last ive been thinking about when we get back to krynn optimist she said what were you thinking if my visions so far have been true then the first thing i should do is go to my ancestral home it may be that my father secreted his sword there somewhere he may also have left me a clue as to where he was going kitiara idly stirred her pink soup and what if you cant find it or him what then i shall keep searching he said she set the bowl down on the ground between her feet how long sturm forever havent you thought of any life beyond your family i never faulted you for wanting to find your father it seemed a worthy cause and a great adventure but i see now that theres more to it than that youre not out to restore just the brightblade name and for tune you want to restore the entire knightly order her tone was derisive sturms hands grew cold is that such a terrible goal the world could use a force for good again these are modern times sturm the knights are gone the people cast them off because they couldnt change to meet the changing times theres a new code among war riors power is the only truth he stared at her am i to give up my quest then look beyond will you youre a good fighter and youre smart think of what we could do together you and i if we joined the right mercenary band in a years time wed be the captains then the glory and power would be ours sturm stood up and slung his sword belt over one shoul der i could never live like that kit hey she called to his retreating back sturm continued down the corridor the heat of fury filled kitiaras heart it surged through her and she felt an overwhelming need to smash something how dare he be so righteous what did he know of the world the real world sentimental boring knightly rubbish maam fitter stood before her the stew pot in his hand are you all right the quickening heat in her limbs subsided rapidly she blinked at the gnome and finally said yes what do you want you were pounding on the wall said the gnome sprockets youve cracked it kitiara saw a spiders web of cracks radiating from a shal low hole in the soft sandy mortar there was white dust on her knuckles she didnt remember hitting the wall at all rapaldo the first watched as his royal guard members slowed to rooted immobility and froze where they were their eyes and mouths closed leaving not a trace in the ridged bark seeing them this way no one would ever imag ine that they could walk and talk rapaldo walked over and kicked the nearest lunitarian it hurt his toe and he hopped backward on one foot curs ing the entire pantheon of enstar soon ill be gone and youll have a new king he said to the unheeding treeman flown away thats what in a fly ing ship built by gnomes theres a neat trick i had an accursed whirlwind lift me to this rotten moon and they go and make wings and fly here on purpose tarara they can stay here too theyll stay behind and ill fly home he slipped an arm conspiratorially around the treeman and whispered to him i could take the woman with me yes she is very beautiful though a bit too tall if the king commands it she will go with me yes yes yes how could she resist ill give the big fellow with the mustache to you he can be the new king brightblade the first i appoint him heir apparent remember that for all i care you can make him a god i shall fly fly fly away home the lengthening shadows crept across the royal audience hall rapaldo stared into the darkest corner and shivered he grasped his axe and stalked to the middle of the room i see you there darnino yes its you you always come back to visit dont you dead men should stay dead darnino especially when i kill them with my royal axe he charged into the shadows throwing the axe from side to side the heavy blade clinked off the rock walls striking sparks rapaldo flailed away at the ghost in his mind for some time fatigue chased darnino away more surely than any of the kings axe cuts theres a lesson for you he said panting trifle with rapaldo the first will you he dragged his feet across the hall by the throne he stopped ear cocked to the open sky laughing who said you could laugh he said the lunitarians were still no one laughs at the king rapaldo cried he hurled himself at the nearest lunitarian chopping fiercely with his ship wrights axe chips of gray flew off the treeman who could not resist the unwarranted attack rapaldo yelled and cursed and chopped until the guard was a stump surrounded by scraps of broken woodflesh the axe fell from his hand rapaldo staggered a few feet toward his throne and collapsed sobbing chapter the kings garden sturm awoke to a tapping on his nose he cnacked an eyelid and saw rainspot standing over him his stubby forefinger poised for another tap what do you want he rumbled the gnome withdrew his finger were having a secret meeting whispered rainspot i cant find the lady but we want you to take part sturm sat up it was still night and he could hear hushed murmurs from the gnomes down the hall kitiaras place was empty but he wasnt too concerned sturm knew that she could take care of herself quite well he tightened the lacings on his leggings and went down the hall with rainspot the gnomes flinched in unison when they appeared i told you it was them said the sharpeared cutwood but you didnt say when they were coming objected bellcrank you should learn to be more exact said roperig there was general nodding of small pink heads sturm rubbed his forehead it was too soon after waking to jump into a gnomish conversation whats all this about he asked at normal volume shh seven gnomes said at once wingover waved for sturm to come to their level so he knelt beside sighter were discussing plans to uh abscond with some of king rapaldos scrap metal said wingover wed like to hear your ideas sturm was surprised at such tactics coming from the gnomes my idea is dont steal from your host he said bluntly dont misunderstand master brightblade said bell crank quickly we dont want to steal from the king its just that we havent any gold or silver to pay him with then we must arrange some other method sturm said after all we sorely need his help and it will serve us ill to rob a potential benefactor suppose he wont give us any metal said wingover we have no reason to be so suspicious his majesty seems rather unstable to me sighter said hes completely off his gears said fitter its not our place to judge said sturm if the gods saw fit to take rapaldos wits its because he was so lonely here imagine being on this moon for ten years or more with no one but the treefolk for company you should feel pity for rapaldo sturm looked over the gnomes crestfallen faces why not think of some way to win rapaldos gratitude then he would probably give us the metal we need the gnomes looked ashamedly at the ground after a moments silence wingover said perhaps we could invent something to cheer his majesty up six gnome faces popped up smiling excellent excel lent what shall it be asked bellcrank a musical instrument said roperig suppose he doesnt know how to play it countered sighter well make one that plays itself said cutwood we could give him a personal heating apparatus an automatic bathing device an instrument sturm stood and backed out of the newest wrangle let them figure it out he thought itll keep them occupied he decided to find kit he wandered along the corridor by night the way was dim and confusing and more than once he walked into a dead end this place is a maze he decided he doubled back to what he believed was the main corridor and started again for the outside there was a series of niches along the right again but he didnt hear the gnomes the niches were dusty and empty it was not the same hall at the end the passage turned left sturm swung into the black gap and immediately stumbled over some dry sticks on the floor he fell hard on his chest and banged his head against something solid that skittered away when he hit it the object bounced off the wall and rolled back to sturm he heaved himself up on his hands a wedge of starlight fell across the open end of the niche sturm held up the object that hed knocked his head on it was a dry white human skull the sticks hed tripped over were bones he went back out into the open passage and examined the skull it was broad and well developed certainly a mans the most disturbing feature was the deep cleft in the bone of the forehead the man had died by violence as by an axe stroke sturm carefully replaced the skull in the culdesac out of reflex he checked to see if his sword was hanging in its scabbard the cold hilt was reassuring to his touch he was worried where was kitiara he bumped into kitiara as she came skulking down the passage she had a tousled slightly wild look that made him think shed been drinking but no ale was hard to come by on lunitari kit are you all right yes i am i think he put an arm around her waist to support her and steered her to a low stretch of wall where they sat what happened he asked i went walking she said rapaldos gardens take longer to vanish after dark than the wild plants we saw there were some big toadstools with pink spores coming out they smelled good theyve affected you he said noting the light dusting of pink on her shoulders and hands how do you feel i i feel strong very strong she gripped his free hand and squeezed his wrist pain raced up sturms arm careful he said wincing youll break my arm her grip didnt slacken sturm felt the blood pounding in his fingertips in her present state it wasnt prudent to strug gle she might crush his arm without realizing it kit he said as evenly as the pain would allow youre hurting me let go her hand snapped open and sturms arm dropped out like a dead weight he massaged the bruised arm back to life you mustve inhaled those spores he said why dont you go lie down do you remember the way i remember she said dreamily i never get lost she slipped away like a sleepwalker making unerring turns and avoiding all the wrong passages sturm shook his head such uncontrolled strength was deadly what was happen ing to her to all of them then curious he decided to see those mushrooms from a safe distance he went along the path kitiara had used until he reached the outside wall the neatly boxedin garden beds were empty no trace of the mushrooms remained he stepped over the low wall and dipped his hand into the ever present scarlet dust had she indeed been walking in her sleep or had the mushrooms withered in the short time between her seeing them and his arrival the stars and set ting silver moon offered no clues sturm noticed a dull light moving along the gallery on the north side of the palace he cut across the gardens to inter cept the light it proved to be his majesty carrying a weakly burning oil lamp oh said rapaldo i remember you good evening your majesty said sturm graciously i saw your lamp did you its a feeble thing but the oil i make is not of the best quality heh heh your majesty i wonder if i might have a word with you what word sturm fidgeted this was as bad as trying to talk with the gnomes my friends were wondering sire if we might be able to get some scrap metal from you to fix our flying ship once we find it youll never get it back from the micones said rapaldo we must try sire could we get some metal from your supply what kind and how much asked the king sharply forty pounds of iron forty pounds tara thats a kings ransom and i should know i am the king surely iron is not so precious rapaldo hopped backward the wavering lamp throwing weird shadows behind him iron is the most precious thing of all it was the iron axe i carry that made me master of the red moon do you not see sir knight that there is no metal at all here why do you think my subjects bear swords of glass every scrap of iron is a buttress to my rule and i will not part with any of it sturm waited until rapaldos quivering hands had grown more steady he said slowly sire perhaps you would like to go with us when we leave on the gnomes flying ship eh leave my kingdom if you so desire rapaldos eyes narrowed my subjects would never allow it they wont even let me leave the town ive tried ive tried im their link with the gods you know and they are very jealous of me they wont let me go whats to stop you from leaving at night when the luni tarians are rooted where they stand heh heh heh they would hunt me down by daylight they move very fast when they want to dont worry and theres never been anyplace else to go the ants have your craft and will not let you have it the voice has it now sturm said firmly we intend to ask this voice to return our ship the voice tarara why not ask the high lords of heaven to bear you home on their backs like birdies tweet tweet the voice is evil sir knightblade beware of it sturm felt as if he were swimming against a strong cur rent rapaldos mind could not follow the course of reason that sturm had set out but there were some nuggets of truth in what he said the voice if it existed was a great unknown quantity if it refused them their hopes for getting home were destroyed sturm made one last attempt to persuade rapaldo your majesty if my friends and i can convince the voice to release our flying ship would you then provide us with forty pounds of iron in return well carry you back to krynn to your home island if you wish enstar said rapaldo blinking rapidly tears formed in his eyes home to your very doorstep sturm promised rapaldo set the lamp on the ground his hand flashed to his hip and came back gripping the broad shipwrights axe sturm tensed come said rapaldo i will show you the obelisk he padded away leaving the lamp flickering on the floor sturm looked at the lamp shrugged and followed the mad king of lunitari rapaldos skinny ragwrapped feet made only the faintest thumps as he scampered ahead of sturm this way sir brightsturm i have a map a chart a dia gram heh heh sturm followed him around half a dozen twists and turns when he faltered or felt uncertain rapaldo urged him on the obelisk is in a secret valley very hard to find you must have my map to locate it then rapaldos tread abruptly ceased as did his lunatic cackle your majesty sturm called quietly no reply careful ly sturm drew his sword letting the blade slip through his fingers to deaden the scrape of metal king rapaldo the passage ahead was violet shadows and silence sturm advanced into the darkness sliding his feet along the floor to avoid being tripped rapaldo leaped down from a recess in the wall and brought the axe down on sturms head his helmet saved his skull from the fate of darnino but the blow drove the light from his mind and left him laid out cold on the floor well well said rapaldo breathing quickly a rude dint im sure and not at all fitting for the new king of luni tari eh the treemen would never allow their only king to fly away fly so ill take the flying ship and lady i will and the trees will have their king you ha ha he giggled and picked up sturms helmet the iron pot had taken the axes edge with only a slight dent rapaldo tried the helmet on it was far too large for him and fell over his eyes the mon arch of the red moon stood over his victim spinning the hel met around his head with his hands and laughing ceaselessly chapter the royal axe the long night was almost spent when the gnomes dared wake kitiara she grunted with pain and got to her feet suffering bloodstained gods she muttered what happened i feel like somebodys worked me over with a stick are you sore asked rainspot she worked one shoulder around and grimaced very i have a liniment that may be of comfort to you the gnome searched rapidly through his vest and pants pockets he produced a small leather bag with a tight drawstring here said rainspot kitiara accepted the bag and sniffed the closed mouth what is it she said suspiciously dr fingers efficacious ointment also known as the selfadministered massage balm well ah thanks rainspot ill give it a try she said though she thought it more likely that the liniment would blister her skin than soothe her muscles she tucked it away wheres sturm kitiara asked with sudden realization we saw him several hours ago he was looking for you said cutwood did he find me how should we know he told us we couldnt take any of rapaldos iron without asking permission then he went looking for you said bellcrank peevishly kitiara rubbed her aching temples i remember i went for a walk came back obviously but outside of that my mem ory is dry she coughed sos my throat is there any water rainspot called down a batch this morning said sight er he proffered a full bottle to kitiara and she drank deeply the gnomes watched this process solemnly when kitiara at last lowered the water bottle wingover said lady we are unanimous in our resolve to be gone from here as quickly as possible we think the king is dangerous also the trail of the micones grows colder as we wait kitiara surveyed the serious little faces shed never seen the gnomes so united and intent very well lets see if we can hunt down sturm she said rapaldo was in his audience hall flanked by twenty tall treemen when kitiara and the gnomes arrived he was wearing sturms horned helmet padded out with rags so that it wouldnt fall over his eyes the axe lay nestled in his arms he regarded them idly i didnt send for you go away cut the lip wagging kitiara snapped she recognized the helmet wheres sturm do all of the women of abanasinia have such bad man ners thats what comes of letting them carry swords she drew both weapons sword and dagger and took one step toward rapaldo the lunitarians promptly raised their glass swords and spears and closed ranks around their divine though mad king youll never reach me rapaldo said giggling it might be fun to see you try your majesty said sighter diplomatically what has become of our friend sturm rapaldo leaned forward and waggled a bony finger at the gnome see now thats the proper way to ask a question he slumped back in his high chair and pronounced he is resting shortly he will be the new king of lunitari new king whats going to happen to the old one asked kitiara with barely concealed fury im abdicating ten years is long enough to rule dont you think im going back to krynn and live among my own kind as an honored and respected shipwright he licked his fingers to smooth back his lank gray hair after my sub jects take back the aerial ship you all shall remain here except for whatever gnomes are needed to fly it he cocked his head toward kitiara i was going to take you with me but i see now that you are completely unsuited heh heh completely we wont fly you anywhere said wingover defiantly i think you will if i order my faithful subjects to kill you off one by one i think youll fall in with my plan never said kitiara the rage was rising in her rapaldo looked up at the nearest treeman and said kill one of the gnomes start with the littlest one the gnomes closed in a tight circle around fitter the lunitarian came at them straight on kitiara cried run and moved to meet the treeman she parried his strong but clumsy cuts chips of glass flew each time her steel blade met the glass one but the haft of the treemans weapon was so thick that she didnt think it would snap without a direct crosswise blow the gibbering gnomes retreated in a body to the door none of the other lunitar ians deigned to bother them she had managed to pin the treemans point to the floor and now she raised her foot and smashed the glass sword in two the lunitarian stepped back out of her reach rapaldo applauded tara he crowed what a show there were too many of them though she hated to do it kitiara backed out of the room with her blood boiling rapaldo laughed and whistled loudly out in the passage kitiara halted her face burning furi ously with shame to be whistled out of a room what an insult as if she were some juggler or painted fool were going back in there she said tensely im going to get that lunatic woodcutter if i have to i have an idea said sighter tugging vainly at her trouser leg suffering gods weve got to find sturm we dont have time for a silly gnomish idea the gnomes drew back with expressions of hurt kitiara hastily apologized and sighter went on as this place has no roof why dont we climb the walls we could walk along the top of the walls and peer down into every room kitiara blinked sighter you youre a genius he polished his nails on his vest and said well i am extremely intelligent she turned to the wall and ran a hand over the dry plaster i dont know if we can get enough purchase to climb up she said i can do it said roperig he pressed his hands on the wall and muttered strong grip strong grip to everyones delight his palms stuck and he proceeded to climb right up the wall like a spider the gnomes cheered kitiara hushed them its all right roperig said from atop the wall its just wide enough for me to walk on boost fitter up will you kitiara hoisted fitter up with one hand roperig caught his upstretched hands and pulled his apprentice up beside him cutwood and wingover were next thats enough said sighter well stay with the lady and divert the kings attention you find sturm the four gnomes on the wall set off kitiara went back to the entry of the audience hall banging sword and dagger together for attention bellcrank and sighter stood close behind her filling the doorway youre back happy happy to see you exclaimed rapaldo who was still hooting from his roost we want to negotiate kitiara said it was galling even if it was a lie you touched me with your sword rapaldo said petu lantly thats treason impious blasphemy and treason throw your sword into the hall where i can see it i wont give up my sword not while i still live really the king will see about that rapaldo hooted some words in the lunitarians language the guards in the room took up the message and repeated it again and again louder and louder soon thousands outside were hooting the words roperig and the others could hear the treemen take up rapaldos chant as they fairly flew over the narrow wall tops peeking into every room in the keep cutwood of course stopped to make notes of the contents of every room and passage while wingover kept probing the distant vistas instead of searching the nearer rooms below only fitter took his task to heart the little gnome raced along at blind ing speed running leaping searching he doubled back to his panting boss where did you learn to run so fast roperig gasped i dont know havent i always run this way no indeed oh the magic has gotten to me at last fitter flashed along the wall sidestepping cutwood who was in the midst of compiling his umpteenth catalog cutwood startled by the speedy fitter lost his balance and fell oof said sturm as the fortypound gnome landed in his lap cutwood where did you come from sancrist he called out to roperig and the other three gnomes quickly found them my hands are bound sturm explained he was sitting in an old chair and his feet were tied to the chair legs rapaldo took my knife the lady has the dagger said roperig ill get it said fitter and in an instant he was gone sturm blinked i know ive got the grandfather of all headaches but our friend fitter seems to me to have gotten awfully fast since last i saw him here it is called fitter he dropped the dagger point first cutwood picked it up and started sawing away at sturms bonds the dagger was made for thrusting not cut ting and didnt have much of an edge hurry said fitter breathlessly the others are in big trouble what are we in a pleasant daydream cutwood said sourly dont talk cut said sturm trouble was a mild word for what kitiara and the two gnomes were facing scores of lunitarians had filled the cor ridor behind them and guards from the audience hall had seized each of them rapaldo strutted in front of them tap ping the back of the axe head against the palm of his hand treasonous piglets he said imperiously you are all worthy of death the question is who shall feel the royal axe first kill me you witless scab at least then i wont have to lis ten to you spout on like the gibbering swabby you are kiti ara said she was held by no fewer than seven treemen their wooden limbs were wrapped around her so securely that only her face and feet showed rapaldo smirked and lifted her chin with the handle of his axe oh no pretty i shall spare you heh heh i would make you queen of lunitari if only for a day id rather have my eyes put out he shrugged and stepped in front of sighter held by a sin gle guard shall i kill this one said rapaldo or that kill me pleaded bellcrank im only a metallurgist sighter is the navigator of our flying ship without him youll never reach krynn thats ridiculous sighter argued if you die who will fix the damage to the cloudmaster no one can work iron like bellcrank theyre just gnomes said kitiara kill me rotten rapaldo or ill surely kill you enough enough heh heh i know what to do i do you try to fool me but i am the king he strode away a pace or two and dropped his axe the king of lunitari pulled apart the tied ends of his decrepit tunic under his shirt but over his woolens rapaldo wore chain not chain mail but heavy rusty chain wound around his waist you see i know what it means to live on lunitari rapaldo said he let his shirt fall off and untwisted a bale of wire that held the end of the chain in place he unlooped several turns of chain as the links piled up on the floor rapaldos feet rose soon he was floating two feet in the air and the treefolk were rapt in their devoted attention i fly tara who are you puny mortals to bandy words with me i float if i didnt wear fifty pounds of chain id drift away they wont let me have a ceiling you know the treepeople shade makes them take root without this chain id fly away like a wisp of smoke rapaldo let another loop of chain fall to the floor he pivoted until his feet were floating out behind him i am the king you see the gods have given me this power no sighter tried to explain it must be a consequence of the lunitari magic silence rapaldo made clumsy swimming motions with his hands and drifted over to kitiara you wear armor but you can take it off when you want to i cant i have to wear this chain every hour every day he shoved his dirty bearded face close to hers i renounce the power im going home i am and walk like a man again the trees will not miss me with sir sturmbright as king treason treason youre all guilty rapaldo somer saulted in the air away from kitiara he scooped up his axe and flung it at his chosen victim chapter without honor the last loop of cord gave way and sturms hands were free he snatched the dagger from cutwood and quickly worked through the ropes around his ankles the hemp from the tarvolina was old and quickly parted sturm leaped to his feet lead me back to the audience hall he said to the gnomes atop the wall fitter waved and ran all the way around the room before veering off for the kings audience chamber roperig and wingover trotted behind him come on cutwood sturm shouted hoisting the gnome on his shoulders the sun was going down sturm thanked paladine for that without sunlight the hordes of treemen loyal to the mad rapaldo would soon revert to rooted plants he passed through another opening in the wall and found himself facing a dozen armed treemen they presented a solid front barring his progress sturm had only kitiaras dagger to oppose their long glass swords hold on cutwood he said the gnome gripped sturms head tightly flat shadows climbed the walls the sun was sinking fast already the lower halves of the lunitarians were in shade soon their feet would fix where they stood a treeman thrust the fortyinch span of his scarlet glass sword at sturm though the guard was slow the blade flickered past sturms chin far outreaching his twelveinch dagger woodenness began to claim the lunitarians lower bodies and they took root the edge of night was midway up their trunks now the treemens arms wavered in slow motion like weeds beneath the surface of a pond the guard that sturm faced snagged the tip of his sword on sturms fur hood and ripped through the hide and hair that was the treemans last act bark closed over his eyes leav ing him and the others featureless and inert wingover appeared atop the wall master brightblade come quickly something terrible has happened before the human could ask what the gnome ran back the way hed come he was weeping cutwood noted in astonishment wingover never weeps sturm thrust his arms and shoulder between the trunks of the treemen and heaved himself through their bark scraped and pulled at him but he struggled on until he broke out of the rear rank of guards the passage ahead was clear sturm and cutwood burst into the audience hall the knight looked first to kitiara was it her was she hurt dying or dead the woman and the two gnomes were locked tightly in the embrace of their nowimmobile guards blood stained the knotty fingers of the one that held bell crank bellcrank was dead rapaldo was nowhere to be seen kit are you all right sturm called yes and sighter too but bellcrank i see wheres rapaldo hes nearby be wary sturm hes got that axe the room was thick with immobile treemen the gather ing darkness made the audience hall a forest of shadows out of the uncertain dark came rapaldos snickering laugh who has a lamp to light you to bed who has a chopper to chop off your head rapaldo face me and fight sturm cried heh heh heh something moved overhead from the wall wingover shouted hes up there duck sturm sturm dropped to the floor just as the axe blade whisked through the place his head had been kit wheres your sword rapaldo has mine on the floor in front of sighter she said sturm scrambled forward on his belly as rapaldo flitted through the tops of the treemen kitiara called to sturm explaining the crazed kings ability to levitate hes dropped part of his weights sighter added hes floating about six feet off the ground sturms hand closed over kitiaras sword handle and was up in a flash her blade was light and keen and seemed to slice the air with a will of its own sturm saw rapaldos tat tered pants legs and rope sandals stepping on the heads of the treemen sturm slashed at him but only succeeded in chipping off bits of the lunitarian that rapaldo was stand ing on the king of lunitari bounded away giggling i cant see him sturm complained wingover where is he on your left behind sturm ducked the axe blow and cut at rapaldo he felt the tip of kitiaras sword snag cloth and heard the cloth tear close very close sir sturmbright but youre too heavy on your feet rapaldo said chortling kit id welcome any tactical suggestions you might want to make sturm said his chest heaving in the chill night air what you need is a crossbow kitiara hissed she strained against the enfolded limbs of solid wood that held her because her arms were pinned at her sides she could not get any leverage kitiara tried to twist her shoulders from side to side the treemans arms groaned and cracked but held firm sturm shifted the dagger to his right hand and put the sword in his left the hall was very quiet the gnomes who had been crying for their fallen colleague ceased all noise sturm crouched low and moved to the ramshackle throne he climbed up on the chair and stood erect rapaldo rapaldo im on your throne i spit on it rapaldo youre a petty lunatic carpenter who dreams he is a king the clink of chain warned him a split second later the axe bit deeply into the back of the chair and stuck there wedged tightly by the tough oak of krynn rapaldo tried frantically to free the axe but his spindly arms and lack of leverage prevented him surrender sturm demanded presenting the point of the dagger to rapaldos throat tarara cried the king planting his feet on the back of the throne he heaved the tall chair over backward sending him sturm bare sword axe and dagger down together in a heap there was a mighty crash a scream and silence sturm called kitiara he shook himself free of the shattered chair and stood a gash in his cheek bled but sturm was otherwise unhurt rapaldo was pinned to the floor the dagger through his heart his legs and arms floated above aimlessly drops of blood flowed up the daggers hilt and detached drifting up into the air sturm found the axe in the debris stolidly ignoring the fact that the trees would be living beings again by morning he chopped kitiara and sighter free the other gnomes descended from the wall and helped get bellcrank out of the wooden bonds they laid the stout gnome gently on the floor and covered his face with their kerchiefs fitter began to sob what shall we do asked wingover tearfully kitiara said bellcrank is avenged what more is there to do oughtnt we to bury him said roperig heavily yes of course said sturm he gathered bellcrank in his arms and led the sorrowing band outside the gnomes stood together the only sounds were sniffles and the scuffing of small shoes sighter brushed the wood chips from his clothes and strode off the others fell in behind him he went to the middle of the mushroom garden and stopped pointing to the red fluff he declared that this was the spot the gnomes began to dig kitiara offered to help but cutwood politely declined the gnomes knelt in a circle and dug the grave with their hands when they were satisfied sturm stepped in and with great feeling laid the heroic bellcrank in his final resting place sighter spoke first bellcrank was a fine technician and a good chemist now he is dead the engine has ceased to run the gears have seized and stopped sighter tossed a handful of pale crimson soil over his friend farewell fare well wingover said he was a skilled metallurgist and added another handful of dirt an excellent arguer noted cutwood choking back emotion a dedicated experimenter rainspot said sprinkling his portion the finest of gear makers said roperig sorrowfully when fitters turn came he was too upset to think of any thing to say hehe was a hearty eater the littlest gnome murmured at last roperig managed a fond smile and patted his apprentice on the back they mounded the dirt over their fallen friend wingover went back into the keep and returned with a piece of iron work from rapaldos wrecked ship it was a gear part of the tarvolinas capstan the gnomes set this on the grave as a monument to their colleague kitiara turned her back and headed for the keep after a moment of respectful silence sturm hurried after her you might have found something to say to the gnomes he chid ed we have much to do before the sun rises again weve got to gather our belongings and get as far from here as the night will let us she said why the haste rapaldo is dead kitiara swept an arm around his subjects are very much alive how do you think theyll feel when they awaken and find their godking dead sturm pondered this a moment then said we can hide the body no good she said crossing the outer wall the tree men will assume the worst if were gone and rapaldos miss ing kitiara paused at the door to the throne room all the more reason to get out of here and find the cloudmaster she was right sturm found his dented helmet and put it on kitiara replaced her sword and wrenched the dagger out of the dead mans chest seeing rapaldo bobbing like a cork gave her a macabre idea she knelt on one knee and unwound the remaining chain from rapaldos waist they could use it when they found the flying ship kitiara gripped rapaldos bloody shirt and guided the body toward sturm heres my idea of a quick and easy funeral she said letting go the lifeless body of rapaldo the first rose slowly turning slightly as it went within min utes it was lost from sight in the violet vault of the sky sturm was aghast it could just as easily have been me he killed you know she said flatly my only regret is that you got to him instead of me he was a demented wretch there was no honor in slay ing such a person honor one day youll face a foe without your concept of honor and that will be the end of sturm brightblade they went back to the mushroom garden the gnomes were waiting their tall expedition packs were weighed down even further with bits of metal salvaged from rapaldos cache kitiara announced her intention to follow the path that the micones had been on before their tracks were lost in the rocks sighter looked to sturm what do you say master brightblade i have no better plan he replied simply a chill was growing in his heart the woman who dealt so harshly with a dead foe was more and more like a stranger to him this was their darkest hour since leaving krynn one of their own was dead buried in the cold moon soil and a poor insane king spiraled ever upward a weightless corpse with no place to land it would be a long unhappy night and yet when the sun next shone over rapaldos garden a giant mushroom grew out of the grave of bellcrank unlike the scarlet fungi around it this one was pure and shining white sturm had another vision it came to him while he walked yet his step never faltered a horse neighed sturm saw four bony beasts tied to a charred post it was day but heavy shadows lay over every thing sturm looked up and recognized the ruined battle ments of his fathers castle across the courtyard he saw a broken wagon lying with one wheel off a man was lashed to the remaining wheel his wrists cruelly bound to its rim sturm closed on this desperate figure he prayed to pala dine that it was not his father the man lifted his eyes through the wild growth of beard and the bruises of a brutal beating sturm recognized bren his fathers companion in exile as in sturms last vision bren looked right through sturm the younger brightblade was a phantom a thing of no substance four men shuffled out of the shadows on sturms right they were lean roughlooking men of a type sturm had often seen on the road vagabonds brigands killers when is we moving on touk said one of the men this here castle is haunted i tell you you afraid of ghosts said the dirtyfaced fellow with the brass earring im afraid of anything i cant stick my billhook through when are we leavin asked the last brigand in line dirtyface laughed showing yellow teeth when im sure there aint no more swag herebout thats when touk spat in the dirt lets have a word wi our honored guest the bandit and two of his men stood over the prisoner touk grabbed bren by his matted hair and lifted his head sturm ached to help him but he could do nothing wheres the treasure old man asked touk flashing a wicked knife under the old soldiers chin theres no treasure bren gasped the castle was sacked years ago come on do you take us for fools theres always a few coins tucked away somewhere eh so where are they he pressed the tip of the blade into brens throat iill tell he said weakly below the great hall a secret room i can show you touk removed the knife this better be a straight story no tricks ill take you right to it they cut him loose and dragged him along sturm fol lowed on their heels close enough to smell the mingled stench of sweat grime fear and greed bren guided them to the cellar beneath the great hall there in a long corridor he counted the torch sconces on the right side at number eight he said thats it thats the one one of the brigands lit the stump in the sconce with the brand he carried the bracket turns said bren touk seized the stout iron holder and shook it it swung to the left and stayed there a section of the tiled floor lifted with a loud grinding sound touk tossed his torch into the widening gap it bounced down a steep stone staircase and came to rest still burning at the bottom something shiny gleamed in the torch light good work touk said grinning without another word he shoved his knife between brens ribs angriff brightblades loyal man groaned and slid down the wall his head sagged as the dark stain spread over his chest cmon lads lets collect our reward touk led his two cronies down the steps sturm bent to see brens face though his skin had gone waxen brens eyes still glittered with life young master he said blood flecked his lips sturm recoiled bren could see him slowly with terrible effort the old soldier gripped the rough stone wall and dragged himself to his feet master sturm youve come back i always knew you would bren reached out to sturm hand swaying sturm tried to clasp his hand but of course he had no substance brens fin gers passed through him and closed on the sconce as death claimed him bren fell and his weight bore the bracket back to its original position the trap door lowered noisily one robber gave a yell and dashed to safety at the top of the steps he stopped riveted staring at sturm ahh he screamed ghost he stumbled back bowl ing over touk and the other brigand the slab of stone descended cutting off their screams for help the world went red sturm shook his head where the screams of touk and the other robbers still rang he was plodding across the plains of lunitari as before back with us asked kitiara sturm made inarticulate sounds this had been his longest vision yet and somehow near the end the men on krynn had been able to see him he told his companions his tale hmm its said that dying men have second sight kiti ara mused bren and the thief were both facing death may be thats why they could see you but i couldnt help them sturm complained i had to watch them die bren was a good man he served my father well did you see or hear of your father at all asked sighter sturm shook his head that very omission preyed on his mind what had separated bren from lord brightblade was his father well where was he wingover let out a yell i see the tracks he cried where the slabs of winecolored sandstone broke into fingers of rock crimson sand had drifted in between and there were the circular prints as regular as clockwork kitiaras notion had been right the micones had come this way chapter the valley of the voice at last wingover spied the great obelisk the band had come to a place where the rocky ledges reared up as low jagged peaks kitiara and wingover climbed this saw toothed barrier and reported that beyond lay a magnificent bowlshaped valley that stretched far beyond the limits of the horizon kitiara could not see the obelisk but wingover assured them that a single tall spire stood forty miles away in the exact center of the valley the gnomes took heart from the news they had been uncommonly subdued on the trek from the village bellcranks death has them hanging their heads kitiara said privately to sturm i guess the little fellows have never faced death before sturm agreed what the gnomes needed was a problem to stimulate their imaginations he called them together heres the situation sturm began wingover estimates the obelisk is forty miles away forty miles is a tenhour march if we dont stop for food or rest fifteen hours is a more reasonable estimate but by then the sun will be up and the lunitarians can be on the move too if only we had some way to get down in a hurry said kitiara horses oxen anything or carts for that matter sturm mused kitiara shot him a knowing glance yes the slope down from the sawtoothed ridge is steep but fairly smooth we could roll quite a ways the spirit of technical challenge was infectious and ideas wild gnomish ideas began flashing about the little group the gnomes dumped their packs into one big heap and went into a close huddle their rapid patter made no sense to sturm or kitiara but the humans saw it as a good sign as suddenly as the gnomes had put their heads together they broke apart tools appeared and the gnomes pro ceeded to knock their wooden backpacks to pieces what are you making this time sturm asked cutwood sleds was the simple reply did he say sleds asked kitiara within half an hour each gnome had constructed according to his lights a sled that is a singlegnome iner tia transport device by these we expect to descend the cliff slope at prodigious speed announced sighter and break your reckless little necks said kitiara under her breath these are for you and master sturm said roperig he and fitter pushed two flimsy sleds to the humans feet hav ing only short slats of wood to work with the gnomes held their inventions together with nails screws glue string wire and in rainspots case his suspenders wingover had designed his sled to let him ride on his belly sighters allowed the rider to gracefully recline because of their rela tive size sturms and kitiaras sleds allowed them only a wide bit of plank for a seat you cant be serious kitiara said dubiously ride that down there it will be fast encouraged sighter and fun fitter exclaimed weve calculated all the available data on stress and strength of materials cutwood noted he brandished his notebook as proof there were five pages covered with tiny closely spaced letters and numbers in all cases except yours therell be a safety factor of three what do you mean in all cases except yours kitiara felt obliged to ask cutwood stowed his notebook in his vest pocket being larger and heavier you will naturally put more stress on the singlegnome inertia transport devices your chances of reaching the bottom of the hill without crashing are no more than even kitiara opened her mouth to protest but sturm fore stalled her with a tolerant glance those are better odds than the lunitarians will give us he had to admit he boosted the flimsy sled to his shoulder are you coming she looked more than doubtful why dont we stay here and break each others necks then well at least save the trouble of tumbling and rolling are you afraid he knew just how to provoke her kitiara flushed and took up her sled want towager who gets to the bottom first she said why not he replied i havent any money what good is money here how about if the loser has to carry the winners bedroll all the way to the obelisk its a wager they shook hands wingover was giving his colleagues an impromptu course on steering and braking mostly you steer by leaning in the direction you want to go he advised for stopping use the heels of your shoes not the toes the downhill momentum can turn your feet under and break your toes rainspot and cutwood flipped open their notebooks and scribbled furiously given a maximum velocity of fiftysix miles per hour and feet approximately seven inches long one can expect to break three toes on the left foot and four on the right said rainspot the gnomes applauded wingover just told us not to use our toes so why in the name of the suffering gods do you calculate something no one in his right mind would try kitiara asked the principle of scientific inquiry should not be limited to merely the practical or the possible explained sighter only by investigating the unlikely and the unthoughtof is the sum total of knowledge advanced sturm was looking at his feet what i dont understand is why more toes on the right foot would break than on the left dont encourage them kitiara told sturm she dragged her shaky bundle of slats to the edge of the cliff the glass smooth slope plunged down at a breathtaking angle kitiara inhaled sharply and looked back the gnomes crowded for ward to the edge quite unafraid obviously an example of vitreous concretion observed cutwood running a hand over the smooth bubbly surface do you think volcanic wingover said hardly i should say this entire valley constitutes a ther moflexic astrobleme theorized sighter kitiara uttered an angry snort that cut off further gnom ish theorizing she dropped her sled and straddled it when she let her weight down on it the slats creaked ominously you did say even odds she said to cutwood the gnome babbled something about within two standard deviations and kitiara decided not to query further she pulled herself forward by hands and heels until she teetered on the brink cmon sturm or do you want to pack my bedroll for the next forty miles sturm laid his sled on the ground he told wingover that he and kit were going to race wingover replied oh then youll need someone at the bottom to see who wins wait wait ill go down first and when im in place ill call you all right with you kit she waved a casual affirmative all right lads here i go said wingover for science he proclaimed and slid over immediately the other gnomes lined up and went right after him cutwood called for sancrist and went over for technology cried rainspot as he tipped over the edge for the cloudmaster was roperigs toast for raisin muffins fitter followed close behind his boss sighter the last pushed his sled forward and slipped into the seat for bellcrank he said softly the gnomes sleds bounded down the hill swaying and leaping over bumps in the glasslike rock wingover lying prone on his mount steered skillfully around the worst obstacles hed built a front yoke on his sled and weaved a serpentine course down the slope on his heels cutwood howled straight down knees tight against his chin his silky beard clamped firmly between them sturm and kitiara heard his highpitched woohaa as he hit bump after bump rainspot had a dragbrake on the tail of his sled and he coasted along at a relatively mild rate roperig who had designed his sled to be ridden in a standing crouch whistled by the weather seer frantically waving his outstretched arms in an effort to keep his balance his apprentice was having all sorts of trouble fitters mount was wider than it was long and it tended to rotate as it slid this made his progress somewhat slower than the others but the spinning threatened to turn his stomach sighter cool and rational proceeded under perfect control he would touch his heels to the ground at specific points to correct the direction he was taking all was going fairly well until wingover reached bottom four hundred feet away there the glass cliff face changed to dry red gravel and wingovers sled stopped dead on its run ners his stop was so sudden that the trailing gnomes piled right into him cutwood and roperig immediately fitter and rainspot a little later slats and tools and gnomes flew through the air after a series of hairraising crashes sturm saw sighter move unflinching toward the pile but averted his eyes and missed sighters sharp turn which left him two feet to the right of the scrambled group kitiara burst out laughing acres of slope and they all have to stop on the same spot sturm frowned i hope no ones hurt feet and legs and wreckage untangled into six shaky gnomes sighter helped them untangle themselves wingover finally waved to the humans that means go kitiara shouted and pushed herself off sturm was caught off guard not fair he cried but dug in his heels and tipped over the cliff lip in hot pursuit he immediately lost control the sled careened sharply to the right and sturm leaned away from the turn there was a sickening snap and his seat sagged under him sturm less ened his lean and the sled slowly corrected itself kitiara barreled straight down the slope at full speed her feet pressed together and her knees poking out on either side yahahaha she crowed she was far out in front of sturm who couldnt seem to get his sled to run in a straight line for more than a few feet at a time kitiara hit a hump and bounced several inches off her seat instead of frightening her the bump only increased her delight a whole series of bumps approached and she didnt slacken speed at all it wasnt until she hit the fourth bump that she realized she was in trouble that bump slammed her hard against the flimsy seat struts the left runner splintered along its length kitiara put her left boot down to slow herself the hobnails in her shoe sole bit and her left leg was yanked back mind ful of what cutwood had said about breaking toes she didnt resist the pulling and was swept off the sled she land ed hard on her right shoulder and rolled over and over sturm didnt dare try to stop his sled and coasted to the bot tom the second his runners stuck in the gravel he was on his feet kitiara lay motionless on her stomach sturm ran to her closely followed by the gnomes he dropped on one knee and gently turned her over her face was contorted and she uttered a ferocious curse where does it hurt he said my shoulder she hissed through clenched teeth could be a broken collarbone said rainspot is there any way to tell for sure ask her to touch her left shoulder with her right hand suggested roperig if she can the bone must not be bro ken such anatomical ignorance said sighter one must probe with ones fingers in order to find the ends of the sepa rated bone dont let them touch me kitiara whispered if they cant prove it any other way they may decide to cut me open to examine my bones just then sturm heard cut wood saying something about exploratory surgery wingover who was standing by kitiaras feet said no bones are broken how do you know asked cutwood i can see them he replied there dont even seem to be any cracks its probably a sprain you can see through flesh nowt sturm asked incredu lously put so bluntly wingover suddenly realized what he was doing by reorx he said this is terrific i wonder what else i can see through the gnomes crowded around him kitiara forgotten they took turns having wingover peer through their bodies and describing what he saw cries of hydro dynamics filled the air kitiara tried to sit up but the pain took her breath away keep still sturm cautioned ill have to find something to bind up your shoulder he rummaged through his belongings and found his only change of shirt a white linen blouse made by the best tailor in solace regretfully he tore it into inchwide strips and tied their ends into one long bandage youll have to get your arm out of the sleeve he said cut the seams said kitiara sturm checked the seams are underneath youll still have to slip it off all right help me up as easily as he could sturm helped kitiara to sit up her face went pale and as he tried to loosen the sleeve from her right arm tears of pain trickled down her face you know ive never seen you cry before he said in a low voice ah ah whats the matter didnt you think i could sturm kept his mouth shut and turned her fur coat the leather he could cut away but underneath she still wore her mail shirt ill have to bind you over the mail he said yes yes she said pain made her impatient he sat down facing her and carefully lifted her right arm until she could rest it on his shoulder sturm wound the lin en bandage over kitiaras shoulder and under her arm tight enough gasp yes ill leave enough cloth to make a sling he said sympa thetically whatever she lowered her head into her left hand her face was flushed i thought shed be stronger than this sturm thought as he wrapped surely shes been wounded in battle worse than this aloud he said with all your combat experience you must be an old hand at field dressings am i doing this right ive never been wounded kitiara murmured through her hand a few cuts and scrapes thats all youve been lucky sturm was amazed i dont let enemies get close enough to hurt me sturm helped her stand he draped the empty sleeve over kitiaras shoulder the gnomes were energetically debating the nature of wingovers expanding talent obviously he is seeing a subtle variety of light that nor mal eyes cannot detect said cutwood obvious to any fool sighter countered the method is this wingover is now emitting rays from his eyes that pierce flesh and clothing the source of his sight must be his own eyes ahem interrupted sturm could you manage this argument while walking we have a long way to go and a short night to do it in how is the lady asked roperig can she walk i can run how about youl said kitiara challengingly there wasnt much left to salvage from the smashed remains of the sleds sturm realized that for the first time the gnomes were going to have to travel light they had no means left by which to carry their heavy useless gear they dithered over what to take and what to abandon the gnomes were about to adopt roperigs suggestion that they assign numerical values to each item and then choose a total value of items not to exceed two hundred points per gnome im going kitiara said shortly she tried to sling her and sturms bedrolls on her good shoulder sturm caught the straps and took both rolls away from her i lost the bet she admitted dont be a fool he said ill carry them they walked about half a mile and stopped to let the gnomes catch up how they rattled and jingled each gnome had a workshops worth of tools dangling from his vest and belt i hope we dont have to sneak up on anybody muttered kitiara the weary but steadfast party formed again and set out for the great obelisk and the voice that inhabited it ten miles had passed beneath their feet when cutwood started complaining of a pounding in his head his col leagues made jokes at his expense until sturm shushed them rainspot gave cutwood a cursory examination i see nothing out of the ordinary he said you neednt shout cutwood said wincing rainspot raised his wispy white eyebrows in surprise whos shouting he asked mildly sighter dropped back behind cutwood and when he was out of his sight snapped his fingers cutwood ducked his head and put his hands up to ward off some unseen blow did you hear that crack of lightning he said his voice wavering most interesting cutwoods hearing has intensified just as wingovers vision has said sighter does this mean were getting more of the power won dered rainspot it would seem so sighter said gravely stop screaming begged cutwood in a whisper roperig quickly made a crude pair of earmuffs for cut wood out of strips of rattan from his water bottle and a wad of old socks ears muffled cutwood smiled the pounding is much less now thank you dont mention it roperig said in a slightly lower than normal voice cutwood beamed and clapped his colleague on the back do you feel any different sturm asked kitiara my shoulder still hurts you dont feel any new access of strength she shook her head all i feel is a crying need for a mug of otiks best ale sturm had to smile it seemed eons since theyd all sat at the inn and enjoyed otiks brew it felt as if it would be eons before they could do so again at the twelvemile mark the gnomes were trailing out in a long line behind kitiara and sturm their short legs sim ply couldnt maintain the humans rapid pace reluctantly sturm called for a break the gnomes dropped where they stood as though felled by a shower of arrows the air stirred glimmers of roseate light showed in the east the direction theyd decided was east sunrise kiti ara said flatly westward toward the center of the valley an answering flicker of light greeted the sunrise sighter tried to get his spyglass trained on the source of this second dawn wingover moved over to him its the obelisk he said he squinted into the far dis tance i can see a glow surrounding the peak brilliant white streaks more shooting stars sprayed across the heavens a bright steady glow in the east was soon mimicked in the west the sun was coming up over the cliffs yellow and warm the glow from the obelisk was a stubborn and muddy scarlet the rim of the sun broke over the cliffs there was a clap of thunder and bolts of red fire snapped from the faroff obelisk toward the surrounding chain of hills the explorers put their faces to the ground and all felt a blast of burning as the red beams crackled overhead five times the scarlet lightning lashed out and the resulting thunder pounded the sky with ringing blows when the sun was fully above the valley walls the strange storm ceased sturm sat up the ground around them steamed lightly kitiara struggled to her feet and surveyed the valley by day light plants were beginning to emerge from the flaky soil wingover dusted himself off and looked back at the cliff they had sledded down now i understand how the sides got to be as hard and smooth as glass he said the lightning must hit them ev ery morning the gentlest gnome said shakily those were not pluvial discharges he tried to stand and failed the atmosphere is charged with another power magic sturm felt his face harden with distaste as he practically spat the word though hardly unexpected the sudden onset of such enormous magical power left him feel ing vulnerable exposed and tainted chapter cupelix the vegetation in the valley was much the same as elsewhere on lunitari but it grew less thickly and to greater size the pink spears topped twelve feet in an hours growth and the toadstools towered twenty and thirty feet one new species the explorers found was a fivefootwide puffball after seeing one such puffball explode sending a shower of javelinsharp spikes in all directions the marchers gave them a very wide berth the sky seemed brighter too and a steady hum filled their ears cutwood complained constantly of a loud buzz ing despite his makeshift earmuffs wingover took to shielding his eyes with his hands just to cut down on the intense glare he saw everywhere the other gnomes found their special attributes becoming more and more onerous roperig couldnt touch anything without his hands sticking he once accidentally scratched his nose and it took an hour to free his fingers fitter fidgeted about like a hovering hum mingbird moving with such speed that he seemed little more than a blur he fell down a lot and continually bumped into other members of the party rainspot walked in a perpetual haze a real fog that clung to his head and shoulders his own private cloud moisture condensed on his face and his ears and beard dripped nonstop of all the gnomes only sighter exhibited no obvious ill effects but sturm noticed a subtle change in his expression sighters usually incisive gaze had given way to a hard smirk as if he were listening to some lurid tale being whis pered in his ear sturm wasnt certain that the world was ready for a logical gnome sturm worried about kitiara too she kept ahead of the others walking purposefully toward the waiting obelisk her right arm was still slung across her chest but her left hand firmly clenched in a fist rose and fell with each deter mined step each strike of her heels left a deep notch in the ground sturm wondered how much power she could bear he lost sight of kitiara for a time among the pink spears and spidersticks hello he called kit wait for us there was no answer but the hivehum that surrounded them sturm spied kitiara standing under an enormous toad stool pink spores rained lightly over her her hand was at her throat and she was looking at something kit he said touching her shoulder she flinched sturm i just noticed this it was tirolans gem the amethyst arrowhead that had turned clear after kit had used it to free herself from the spell of the goblin rob bers she held the crystal out for sturm to see it was blood red like a heartsfire ruby when did that happen he asked at rapaldos palace i saw that the gem was turning pale pink the color has deepened since sunrise get rid of it kit its a receptacle of magic it too may be affected by the atmosphere of lunitari nothing good can come of it no she said slipping the gem back under her mail shirt i intend to keep it have you so soon forgotten how tirolan helped us no i havent forgotten but the gem may be filled with a different power now a power you know nothing about drop it on the ground kit please if you dont the conse quences may be horrible i will not she said her dark eyes flashing youre a fool sturm brightblade a frightened little boy im not afraid of power i welcome it sturm was about to argue back but the file of gnomes appeared he was not willing to provoke a confrontation in front of the little people there was a thinly veiled rage in kitiara and to push her at this juncture would lead nowhere wingover says the obelisk should soon be in view for all of us said roperig his right hand was stuck to fitters back the apprentice was running in place his short legs nearly invisible with motion roperig saw sturms startled expression and added fit ters having a hard time standing still im the only one who can keep hold of him how are the rest of you sturm asked cutwood and wingover muffled and blindfolded respectively gallantly waved their good spirits rainspot looked sodden and for lorn under his cloud but avowed that he felt well sighter cleared his throat and arched an eyebrow in a maddeningly superior way it is evident that the closer we get to the obelisk the more intensely the neutral power of lunitari infects us he said lets push on said sturm they continued on for about an hour when they came upon a path cleared from the strange jungle and where the cleared path met the horizon there stood a tall spire the mysterious obelisk of lunitari they were still some ten miles away but the land sloped downward toward the obe lisk at an easy grade there were no other features to over shadow it looks like were expected said sturm the voice fitter wondered who else sighter replied he hooked his thumbs under his suspenders if im right were going to meet a very remarkable being someone wholl make all the other won ders of lunitari seem like cheap carnival tricks the obelisk grew from a slim red line to a robust tower five hundred feet tall it had a curiously striped appearance caused by thin black bands that alternated with the red stone of its walls the closer the explorers came the higher the grand tower seemed to thrust into the sky cutwood broke the long silence he said have you noticed how the plants lean toward the tower it was true all of them even the spiny puffballs were bent so that they faced the great obelisk like lilies turned to the sun surmised kitiara they halted fifty yards from the base of the obelisk the red marble sides were beautifully dressed and squared unlike the crude masonry of the treemens village the black bands between the courses of marble were mortar of some kind on ground level facing the explorers was an open entrance a notch cut in the smooth stone inside was only darkness at regular intervals the obelisks walls were pierced by long narrow windows what do we do now asked fitter in a very small voice come closer sturm and kitiara stepped back reaching for their weap ons who said that called sturm i the keeper of the new lives said a soothing bass voice within their own heads where are you kitiara demanded in the edifice before you come closer well stay right here thank you said cutwood ah you are afraid is mortal flesh so dear that you would ignore the opportunity to feast your eyes on a rare and won derful sight namely myself that the humans would be afraid i did not doubt but i expected better of you gnomes we saw a colleague die not long ago so youll excuse us if were a bit cautious wingover said you require proof of my good will behold a small shape stirred in the dim doorway it emerged into the light of day stopped and waved it looked like stutts gears and sprockets fitter crowed dashing forward of course he dragged roperig with him cutwood and wingover stumbled after them while rainspot wandered over in a fog with sighter chuckling at his side wait said sturm it could be an illusion but it was not an illusion the gnomes engulfed stutts yelling with unrestrained delight birdcall and flash appeared in the door and leaped on the pile of happy gnomes after a heartily bruising hello stutts extricated himself from the press and toddled to sturm and kitiara he shook sturms hand solidly and expressed concern for kiti aras bandaged shoulder it is you she said pinching his ear it is and i am quite well thank you weve been waiting for you all for days what happened to your stutter sturm asked suspi cion made him blunt oh that its gone you know poof the keeper says its due to the leveling effect of the magic forces present on luni tari stutts peered behind the humans wheres bell crank sturm laid a hand on the gnomes shoulder i fear that we have grave news my friend grave how are your fears alleviated intruded the voice for now kitiara said may we have our flying ship back please dont be so hasty weve not been properly introduced please come in wont you explain later stutts said quickly he took kitiaras and sturms hands and led them to the door weve had the most tremendous adventure since you left to prospect for ore he reported the keeper has treated us marvelously who is this keeper where is he asked kitiara come and see for yourselves stutts let go of their hands sturm and kitiara stepped through the deep doornotch into the shadowed interior of the grand obelisk sunlight filtered down from the slit windows higher up in the obelisk in the center of the floor illuminated by the sunlight sat the flying ship cloudmaster the ethereal air bag had shrunk to half its previous size just a soft lump in many folds of loose netting the wings had been detached from the hull no doubt to allow the craft to fit through the door in the obelisk the leather wings were neatly folded and lying on the red marble floor beside the ship clicking in the darkness beyond the cloudmaster proved the presence of micones inevitably the warriors gazes were lifted by the soaring hollowness of the interior as sturm and kitiara raised their eyes they saw a series of ledges and horizontal pillars set into the immensely thick walls perched about fifty feet above the floor was the occupant of the obelisk the keeper a dragon where blades of sunlight struck him his scales shone greenish gold no dragon had been seen on krynn in centuries so long in fact that their actual existence was a sorely debated point among historians clerics and natural philosophers sturm believed from boyhood that there had been dragons but face to face with a living example he felt so much fear that he thought hed faint be a man a knight he admonished himself men had faced dragons before huma had done it so while sturms head swam from this newest and greatest revelation he kept his feet firmly under him kitiara too was stunned her eyes were huge and white in the dim light she recovered more quickly than sturm however and said are you the keeper who spoke to us yes or do you prefer spoken language asked the dragon its voice was not as booming as sturm had expected it to be considering its size thirtyfive feet from nose to tail and the distance to it it was quite softspoken spoken is best that way i can be sure of what im hear ing answered kitiara as you wish i do enjoy speaking and ive gone such a long time without having anyone to speak to the ants you see respond best to telepathy the dragon shook its broad angular head with a noise of clanging brass it lifted its feet off the ledge and dropped to a lower perch with a single fluff of its wings the breeze washed over the amazed explorers where are my manners i am cupelix trisfendamir keeper of the new lives and resident of this obelisk the gnomes had retreated behind the humans when the dragon appeared now they spread out and began to bombard him with questions keeper of what new lives how much do you weigh how did you get here how long have you been here do you have any raisins the dragon was amused by this barrage but he dismissed the gnomes with a wave of one giant foreclaw you are kiti ara uth matar and sturm brightblade are you not he asked the two nodded dumbly your small friend stutts speaks very highly of you both apparently you have impressed him with many sterling qualities apparently said kitiara dryly i have only the evidence of stuttss impressions be that as it may i am very glad you are here followed your prog ress along the trail i had the micones make cupelix tilted his burnished head and peered at sturm with dagger eyes yes sir knight the trail was deliberate you read minds sturm said uncomfortably not deeply only when a thought is so clearly on the tip of ones tongue stutts introduced his colleagues to the dragon cupelix exchanged witty banter with each one until sighters turn came you are a bronze dragons questioned the gnome brass if you must know but enough of these trivialities you have come a long way and labored hard to recover your flying craft now that you have found it and each other once more enjoy a moment of repose at my expense wed rather be on our way said sturm but i insist said the dragon he slid along the edge of his perch his rear legs gripping the stone ledge and his wings flaring out for balance cupelix worked his way around to just over the door the only way out sturm didnt like what was happening by instinct his hand strayed to the pommel of his sword which changed to a chicken drumstick when he touched it the gnomes looked popeyed and kitiaras jaw fell open in surprise please excuse my little joke said cupelix in the wink of an eye the poultry leg was gone and the sword was back your weapons are unnecessary here that was just my way of showing you the truth of it men so often have to be shown the truth before they believe something r and now said cupelix drawing himself erect let there be victuals his eyes flashed with an inner light that seemed to leave bright sparkles in the air the sparkles col lected in the open space before the bow of the cloudmaster when they faded they left behind a broad oak table groan ing under the weight of food and drink eat my friends drink and we shall tell each other tales of great doings intoned the dragon the gnomes fell upon the table with squeals of delight kitiara eyed the pitchers of foaming ale and sauntered over though the spear plants could taste like any food she wished kitiara had missed the sight of real food only sturm remained where he stood his hands folded at his waist you do not eat master brightblade said cupelix the fruits of magic are not fit victuals sturm said the reptilian nostrils twitched you have poor manners for one who styles himself a knight sturm answered carefully there are higher directives than mere manners the measure tells us to reject magic in all its forms for example the brass jaws widened reveal ing sabersized teeth and a forked black tongue flecked with gold for a second sturms heart contracted to a tight knot in his chest for he knew he could not withstand this mon sters attack then he realized cupelix was grinning at him oh how boring it has been these centuries past without creatures to dispute with bless your stiff neck sturm brightblade what pleasure you give me the jaws closed with a metallic clank but come now surely you have heard of huma the lancer of course he got along quite well with some types of dragons did he not so the histories say i can only point out that while huma was a brave warrior and a great hero he was not a model knight cupelix burst out laughing it sounded like a chorus of mighty gongs do as you please then i would not want to be responsible for undermining such formidable virtue with that cupelix sprang from his stand and beating his wings furiously flew up to the highest recesses of the hollow obelisk sturm went to the sumptuous table the gnomes were gorging themselves on baked apples dove stuffed with bacon and chestnuts wild rice with saffron whole sweet onions glazed with honey venison steaks blood pudding pickled eggs breads punch wine and ale kitiara had taken her injured arm out of its sling and let it rest on the table with her coat falling off one shoulder and the flush of new ale on her cheeks she looked quite wanton she sniffed when her eyes met sturms and she popped a whole pickled egg in her mouth youre missing a feast she said after swallowing the old emperors of ergoth never ate so well i wonder what its made from sturm said picking up a warm roll and letting it fall back into its tray sand poi sonous mushrooms sometimes you are tiresome beyond belief said kitiara and quaffed a threegulp swallow of ale if the dragon wanted to kill us he could do it without resorting to the sub tleties of poison actually cutwood said leaning across the table and spewing bread crumbs with every syllable brass dragons traditionally are not aligned with evil have we nothing to fear from this creature sturm asked the table at large he glanced up at the darkness that held the dragon and lowered his voice our ancestors on krynn fought long and hard to eliminate dragons from the world were they all wrong the situation here is completely different said stutts lunitari is this dragons home he has taken a kindly inter est in our plight we shouldnt refuse his help because of ancient prejudices that have no application at the present time what does he want from us he hasnt told us yet stutts admitted but he ah wont let us leave what do you mean sturm said sharply birdcall flash and i wanted to go searching for you we rerouted the engine control sufficiently to make short ascents hops really but cupelix refused to allow us out of the obelisk he claimed it wasnt safe and that he was taking steps to bring you all here well were here now said kitiara reaching for another broiled dove and well soon be on our way will we sturm asked craning his neck again to peer into the dim heights of the obelisk now that he has us all will he let us go chapter a new age aften kitiara and thee gnomes had their fill they stole off to the cloudmaster for a nap only stutts remained with sturm the two of them strolled around the interior of the vast obelisk and sturm related the story of bellcranks death it was pure chance that bellcrank died instead of kit or sighter they paused in their walk as stutts plucked a handkerchief from his vest pocket and dabbed at his nose sturm told of rapaldos death and how they placed bell crank in the middle of the mushroom garden he and i were at gearmaking school together you know stutts said softly ill miss him a great deal they passed under the bow of the flying ship and sturm saw a smooth round hole eight feet wide bored in the hard mar ble floor he asked stutts what it was the micones live in a cavern below stutts said they enter and leave by these holes he indicated two others not far away sturm stood on the lip of one of the holes and looked down there was a feeble bluish glow below and he could see the jagged shapes of stalagmites a faintly bitter smell wafted up from the depths did the micones build this place sturm asked not as far as i can tell stutts replied resuming his walk the micones are a rather new addition to this place cupe lix hints that he created them but i dont believe hes that powerful but to address your question the obelisk was here even before the dragon how do you know that by observing cupelix while a healthy adult specimen of a brass dragon his features are in many ways molded by the fact that he grew up inside this obelisk notice for example his short wings and powerful legs he spends all his time perching on the ledges rather than flying he can jump tre mendous distances even straight up stutts stopped seeing that sturm was studying him what asked the gnome youre so changed said sturm not just the lack of a stutter you seem so calm and collected stutts blushed pink under his neatly trimmed beard i suppose we gnomes must appear awfully disorganized and impractical to you humans sturm smiled not at all stutts returned the grin he said being on lunitari has changed me all of us the flight of the cloudmaster while erratic has been the first true success in my life i spent years in the workshops of mt nevermind building flying machines they all failed it wasnt until i learned of bell cranks experiments with ethereal air that the cloudmaster became possible mention of the lost chemist quelled con versation for a moment be at peace sturm finally said he was avenged they passed below the tail of the flying ship a mixed chorus of snores issued from the open portholes stutts ges tured toward the sound they are a fine band of colleagues he said they deserve to go home to the cheers of all sancrist do you think well ever see krynn again sturm asked that all depends on cupelix and what he wants i have a theory a wind flowed over them with a customary metallic ringing the dragon alighted on the lowest sill perhaps fif teen feet above sturm and stutts the gnome sidled away from cupelix i trust you are satiated cupelix said to stutts the meal was excellent as always stutts replied he yawned it weighs a bit heavy on my stomach though i think i shall join my colleagues with a polite nod stutts returned to the ship cupelix loomed over sturm so it is you and i master brightblade what shall we talk about l let us debate our philosophies knight to dragon what do you say no magic cupelix laid a burnished claw on his breast dragons honor how is it sturm wondered that you speak so fluently the krynnish tongue books replied the dragon my nest on high is plentiful ly supplied with books by authors mortal and immortal now i shall ask a question what is it you seek from life to live honorably and in the manner befitting an oathtaken knight my turn have you always lived inside this tower from the days when i was a dragonlet no larger than a gnome i have been the keeper i have never seen outside these walls save what i spy by the doors and windows his broad pupils narrowed do you ever question the tenets of the knights oath or measure after all the order of solamnus was not revived after the cataclysm sturm folded his arms across his chest if you are well read then you know the cataclysm was not caused by any thing the knights did they accepted the blame of the com mon people as all preservers of order must do when that order breaks down where did the micones come from they were created to serve me the lunitarian treefolk did not prove reliable cupelix flicked out his tongue are you in love with the woman kitiara cupelixs pointed query threw sturm off guard i have some affection for her but im not in love with her if you understand the difference the dragon nodded human fashion sturm continued so the treemen and the micones were created in succession as your servants the treemen being a failed effort who created them higher powers replied cupelix evasively this is won derful i wish people had come to lunitari centuries ago but hark now if youre not in love with the woman why is she so predominant in your thoughts behind many of your spoken thoughts is an image of her drops of sweat broke out on sturms face im very con cerned about her the magical force that pervades this moon has invested her with enormous physical strength her temper has sharpened too i worry about the power getting control of her yes magic can cause problems i studied stutts birdcall and flash as the power changed them it was most interest ing so the woman has become very strong that must complicate your feelings ive never yet heard of a human male who relished a female being stronger than he thats ridiculous i dont care sturm halted his out burst blast that sly dragon he was deliberately probing for a sore point my turn to ask something sturm said why does a powerful magicusing dragon like yourself need servants what can they do that you cant i cannot leave the obelisk isnt that obvious the door and windows are far too small to permit me to pass through ah but a skillful magicuser could overcome a problem of mere size cupelixs tail swept back thwack against the marble wall im not allowed to leave i cannot pass the windows or door and have not been able to break cut or bore through the walls nor magic them aside i am keeper of the new lives and such is my lot until darkness claims me what new lives all in good time sir knight a more pressing matter engages my attention the matter of my freedom you need us to get you out sturm said a wisp of fine vapor trickled from the dragons nostrils yes i need you only clever machines can release me from this stifling prison treemen could not do it the micones will not the gnomes can you shall have your flying ship when i am free the vaporous threads thickened until they enveloped sturm he felt the strength drain from his limbs his eyelids drooped a sleeping mist sturms legs buckled he mumbled no magic you said not magic exactly cupelix said soothingly merely a soporific vapor i have at my disposal my dear fellow youre so full of suspicions this will help you sleep and you will not remember this distressing conversation sleep rest dream sleep rest dream forget kitiara woke up she had that vaguely troubled feeling that often went with a sudden return to consciousness as though shed been having a bad dream that she couldnt remember she was lying on the deck of the dining room aboard the cloudmaster below the gnomes snored with the regularity of a waterdriven mill kitiara combed through her short curls with her fingers her skin was clam my and her hair damp with sweat outside the air was cool she inhaled deeply but her breath caught when she saw sturm lying crumpled on the stone floor some yards away kitiara hurried down the ramp and ran to where he lay sturm breathed strong and steady soundly asleep kitiara became aware that she was being watched she whirled and saw cupelix lying on his side along the lower ledge his neck was bowed and he held his tail off the stone when he saw that she saw him his tail came down and began to twitch from side to side in a very feline manner when did this happen she asked gesturing to sturm a short time ago its not a natural sleep said the dragon hes been having visions since coming to lunitari weve all been affected by the magic here truly visions of what kitiara firmed her lips unwilling to say come my dear master brightblade has no secrets from you does he a man always tells his lover of his dreams we are not lovers that sounds definite i see im guilty of inferring too much no matter he has told you what he visualizes hasnt he she shrugged scenes of home on krynn his father mostly whom he hasnt seen in twelve years cupelix let out a dragonsized sigh that swirled dust in kitiaras face ah krynn where once thousands of my kind lived to fly the broad skies in absolute freedom youve never been to krynn alas never my entire span of days has been spent with in the stone walls of this structure sad isnt it confining at any rate the tip of cupelixs forked tongue flickered out youre not afraid of me are you kitiara lifted her chin should i be most mortals would find me awesome when youve been around as much as i have you get used to new things that and the fact that those who cant adjust quickly die youre a survivor said cupelix i do what i can the black tongue protruded farther how did you hurt yourself asked the dragon kitiara described the sled ride down the cliff ho ho i see very clever those gnomes i can heal your hurt can you really its simply done youll have to remove the wrapping why not kitiara thought she fiddled with the knot that sturm had tied but couldnt untie it with her left hand she pulled her dagger and slit the linen with a few deft strokes the mail too said cupelix she raised one eyebrow but put the point of the dagger under the rawhide lacing on her shoulder the slightly rusty mail peeled back kitiara pulled her shirt off her injured shoulder exposing a hideous purpleblack bruise come closer said cupelix she stepped forward once and was prepared to go farther when the dragon swung his head down on his long supple neck the black tongue lanced out just barely touching the bruised area a shock jolted through kitiara cupelix flicked his tongue again and a harder shock rocked her back on her heels cupelix reared back done he said kitiara ran her hand over the site of the sprain not a trace of discoloration or soreness remained she worked her right arm around in a wide circle and felt no twinges wonderful she exclaimed many thanks dragon it was nothing a simple healing spell he said modestly kitiara stretched luxuriously i feel like a new woman i could best a hundred goblins in a fair fight im glad you are pleased said cupelix the time may soon come when you can repay the favor she stopped in mid armswing what is it you want good company some philosophy and words with heat in them small things so talk to me i have time to spare ah but the life of a mortal is a star falling from the heav ens i have lived twentynine hundred years in this tower can you converse for even half that time a quarter no of course you cant but there is a way to help me do these things to the end of my days kitiara folded her arms and that is free me from this obelisk set me loose that i might fly to krynn and live as a dragon should men and elves would try to slay you cupelix said it is a chance i would willingly take there are great changes in the offing deep stirrings in the tide of heaven you have felt them yourself havent you even before you flew here didnt you notice a new tide rising in the affairs of krynn fragments of thought came back to kitiara tirolan and his elves on the high seas in direct defiance of their elders robbers and wicked clerics plundering the countryside strange bands of warriors monstrous inhuman warriors crossing the land intent on some mission and a word muttered by the elvish seamen draconians you see it dont you asked cupelix softly our time is coming again a new age of dragons is about to begin chapter wood to burn as kitiara pondered cupelixs words wingover appeared yawning at the ship railing gmorning whens breckfiss he asked thicktongued you ate not five hours ago kitiara chided she slipped her shirt and mail back on her shoulder roperig and fitter stood in the hull door roperigs hand was still firmly fixed to his apprentices back hello dragon he said heartily hello added fitter did you sleep well little friends asked cupelix very well indeed thank you i we thought we might go outside and take in a bit of fresh air said roperig stay close kitiara warned every time one of you gnomes does something on his own he ends up putting us to no end of trouble roperig promised not to stray and fitter had no choice but to agree they strolled to the door of the obelisk in hilar ious misstep small cyclones of wind swirled through the hollow interior of the obelisk kitiara realized that this was cupelix laughing she couldnt resist small chuckles burst out of her and changed to fullfledged guffaws sturm braced himself on his arms and shook his head he heard laughter his head cleared though his memory seemed adrift in fog he got to his feet turned to the sound of laughter and was bowled down by roperig and fitter kitiara hauled the gnomes off sturm and held them up at arms length whats the matter with you two didnt you see sturm standing there butbutbut stuttered fitter she shook them well out with it it was an accident kit said sturm getting to his feet once more poor fitter was running in midair his short legs churning kitiara set the gnomes on their feet treemen roperig exploded outside what how many see for yourself they rushed to the door even as sturm appeared in the outer opening a red glass spear hit the pavement in front of him and shattered into a thousand razorsharp slivers kiti ara grabbed him by his sword belt and hauled him back with one hand better stay back kitiara suggested i can keep myself out of harms way sturm pressed close to the right wall and peered out the valley floor around the obelisk was thick with treemen thousands if not tens of thousands of them they began to hoot oustoom laud oustoom laud what are they saying kitiara asked behind him how should i know rouse all the gnomes he told kiti ara ill speak to cupelix kitiara got roperig fitter and wingover to help her cupelix sturm called for the dragon had vanished into the top of the tower again cupelix come down theres trouble outside trouble i dare say there is trouble a great rustle of brassy wings sounded and the dragon alighted on one of the crossing pillars that ran from one side of the obelisk to the other cupelixs metallic claws closed over the marble pillar with a clack he furled his wings and started preening himself along either wing you dont seem very disturbed by this development sturm said planting his fists on his hips should i be asked the dragon considering the tower is besieged i would think yes the lunitarians are not very intelligent they would never have come here if you hadnt killed that fool of a mor tal they made their king rapaldo was mad he killed one of the gnomes and wouldve killed others if we hadnt resisted said sturm you should feel flattered that they have come all this way to kill you that uncouth phrase they keep repeating do you know what it means sturm must die sturms hand tightened around his sword handle i am prepared to fight he said grimly your kind is always ready to fight relax my knightly friend the treefolk will not attack are you so certain cupelix yawned exposing teeth green with verdigris i am the keeper of the new lives only a severe trauma would have compelled the lunitarians to come here in the first place however they are not so bold as to trifle with me le cant just let them blockade us sturm insisted shortly the sun will set and the treefolk will take root the micones will awaken and clear them away the micones come out only at night no but they are practically blind in sunlight cupelix pricked up his ears when kitiara returned herding the gnomes ahead of her the dragon reassured them all that they were in no danger from the lunitarians perhaps we should prepare a barricade just the same said stutts i think our time would be better spent repairing the cloudmaster said sighter with the scrap metal we brought from rapaldos keep we ought to be able to make repairs in a few hours birdcall whistled a sharp note stutts nodded saying we havent the fire needed to work iron i may be able to help you there cupelix said smoothly how much wood will you need youre being awfully helpful sturm said why the beasts eyes narrowed to vertical slits do you ques tion my motives he asked with his long ears laid back cupelix looked quite fierce frankly yes the dragon relaxed ho ho very good i blink first master brightblade i do have a favor to ask of you all but first we shall see to the repair of your ingenious vessel already the light in the obelisk had subsided to a dusty rose the hooting of the treemen muffled by the thick walls faded with the sunlight it was soon quite dark inside the obelisk kit iara complained to cupelix while the gnomes ranged noisily through the cloudmaster in search of tools oh very well said the dragon i forget your mortal eyes cannot pierce the simple veil of darkness he spread his wings until the tips scraped the surrounding walls and bowed his neck in a swanlike curve ahbiray solem creatures of the dark bring forth a fair and living spark to light the tower bright as day come micones solem ahbiray the glassy clicking that they all associated with the giant ants arose from the holes in the obelisk floor it grew quite loud as though hundreds of the formidable creatures were stirring below their feet something stroked sturms leg he was near one of the large holes in the floor and a micone had poked its head out to touch sturm with one of its antennae he recoiled and the giant ant emerged to be followed immediately by another and another the floor rapidly filled with micones all clicking and gently waving their crystalline feelers to your places my pets ordered cupelixthe ants nearest the walls climbed up to the lowest ledge and hung there their broad plumshaped abdomens poised off the edge when the entire interior was ringed with hanging ant bodies the micones began rubbing their bellies against the smooth marble shelf as they did their translucent abdo mens glowed first a dull red then warmer and brighter like a mass of living lanterns the ants gradually illuminated the whole lower half of the obelisk sturm and kitiara stared no matter how jaded they thought theyd become to the strange wonders of the red moon something new and startling was always happening better said cupelix smugly tolerable said kitiara sauntering away sturm went to the door the lunitarians were a true for est now still and tall in the starlight this forest though was arranged in perfect concentric circles around the great obelisk that shielded the killers of their iron king cupelix withdrew to his lofty sanctum not long after he did sturm returned to the cloudmaster where the gnomes were up to their elbows in repair work when he descended to the engine room he found to his shock that flash birdcall and stutts had torn apart the entire engine searching for defects the deck was covered with cogs and gears copper rods that wingover called armatures and hundreds of other examples of gnomish technology sturm was afraid to enter for fear of stepping on and crushing some delicate vital component uh how goes it he ventured oh not to worry not to worry stutts said blithely all is in good order he snatched a metal curlicue from cutwood and snapped at flash stay away from the indis pensable inductor coil it mustnt be magnetized lunitari had finally bestowed its gift upon flash he was intensely magnetic bits of iron and steel had begun to cling to him flash meekly stepped away from the indispensable inductor coil were trying to find what parts were damaged by the lightning strike stutts went on so they can be fixed too keep at it sturm said trying not to smile he knew the gnomes would find an answer of sorts eventually he found kitiara in the wheelhouse sitting in stuttss chair she had one leg cocked over the arm of the chair and was drinking from a tall clay tankard dragon ale asked sturm umm want some no of course you dont she drank some more all the more for me then the gnomes are hard at it he said le could be on our way home in a day or two cant be too soon for me she replied oh do you have plans kitiara cradled the tankard in her lap do you really want to know i feel a bit useless with the gnomes working and the micones working and us not doing anything she let her head fall back as she slouched lower in the small chair i was thinking how i would like to raise an army of my own and not be a mercenary any longer my own troops loyal to me and what would you do with your own army make myself a kingdom seize an existing one in a weak ened state or carve one out of a larger country kitiara looked sturm in the eye what do you think of that he sensed she was baiting him he merely replied do you think youre up to commanding an entire army she made a fist im almost an army on my own with my new strength and my old experience yes im up to it would you like a commission in my guard youre pretty decent with a sword if i could break you of your foolish notions of honor youd be even better no thank you kit he spoke seriously i have a duty to my heritage i know that one day in my lifetime the knights of solamnia will recover from their disgrace i shall be there when they do he turned away to the wide windows and i have other obligations theres still my father to find hes alive ive seen that he has left a legacy for me at our castle and i intend to claim it his voice trailed off is that your final word she asked sturm nodded i dont understand you dont you ever think of yourself of course i do entirely too much sometimes kitiara let the tankard dangle from her fingers name an occasion it cant have been since ive known you sturm opened his mouth to speak but before he could a shadow fell across the bow of the cloudmaster kitiara jumped up it was the shadow of the dragon will you come out a moment my friends he thought at them kitiara and sturm went down the ramp and descended to the obelisk floor what is it asked kitiara i have set the micones to building a rampart that will impede the treefolk from entering the obelisk cupelix said he preened himself with a foreclaw as if proud of his ingenuity i thought you said they didnt dare come in sturm said sharply cupelix stopped in midpreen that was true of ordinary times but you dear fellow have incited the lunitarians to overcome their fear of me their presence here is proof of that it does not take deep wisdom to deduce they may soon decide to go where they have never been we cant have that said kitiara folding her arms bellig erently no indeed so i thought you might like to inspect my defenses as it is your lives they will defend sturm roused the gnomes from their current work sal vaging scraps of wood from the cloudmaster to burn in the forge fire everyone trooped to the open door to see what cupelix had set the micones doing the giant ants were lined up in echelon parallel to the door of the obelisk at some invisible inaudible signal the micones lowered their triangular heads to the ground they pushed the red soil forward in a long heap and repeated this process many times thus they created a trench around the obelisk the dirt they piled into a high rampart satisfactory asked the dragon from his perch kitiara shrugged and sauntered back to the ship the gnomes followed in twos and threes as they grew bored with watching the mighty micones shift the red earth soon only sturm was left he watched until all the gaps in the rampart were filled the loose dirt spilled down from the top of the wall burying the nearest treemen until only their jagged tops protruded from the crimson soil chapter keeper of the new lives the forge fines making shgowed the party yet another of cupelixs powers with scavenged stones they erected a crude hearth kitiara stripped to her shirt and with her pants legs rolled up stood by sweating as the last of the stones was put in place now she said whos got the flint stutts put his hand out to wingover wingover stared at the open palm come come give me the flint stutts said i havent got the flint his colleague replied i gave it to you when you went off on your march no you didnt maybe you gave it to one of the others a quick poll of the remaining gnomes failed to turn up any flint this is ridiculous who made the fires while we were on our own asked kitiara fitter raised a hand timidly bellcrank he said stutts clapped a hand to his head he had the flint i think so said wingover looking at his dusty worn out shoes not to worry little friends said a voice from above with amazing silence cupelix drifted down the shaft to alight on the nearest ledge fire is what we dragons do best kitiara and the gnomes took shelter in the far corner of the obelisk after first taking the precaution of dragging the cloudmaster aside as well cupelix raised his long scaly neck and inhaled so sharply that the air shrieked into his nostrils the gnomes flattened themselves against the wall cupelix raked his wing claws back and forth across his brass cheeks throwing out cascades of sparks then cupelix exhaled hard through the fountain of sparks his breath caught fire with a dull whuffing sound and streamed down over the kindling thick smoke roiled out of the hearth fol lowed by lighter white smoke then flame his great convex chest almost inverted from the exhalation cupelix ceased his firemaking smoke drifted in the still air rising to hid den heights of the tower come along said stutts with a cheer the gnomes hur ried to their tools they laid out all the scrap metal theyd liberated from rapaldos horde copper tree nails and iron brackets bronze chain and tin buckets all of it was going under the hammer to be recast and reforged into engine parts the interior of the obelisk rang with the sound of steel and iron melding together the firelight cast distorted mon strous shapes on the marble walls the monsters were the gnomes toiling around the fire kitiara slipped past the busy little men and went outside the cool air washed over her like a splash of fresh water over the headhigh wall that the micones had built she could see the cold stars faint streaks of haze crossed the sky lit by a distant light source she walked slowly around the obelisks massive base and found sturm gazing up at the bluewhite splendor of krynn rather pretty she said stopping behind him yes it is he said noncommittally i keep wondering if we will ever get back there we will i feel it here sturm tapped his chest and it i confirmed by these visions of mine they seem to show the future kitiara managed a mildly crooked grin you didnt hap pen to see me on krynn while you were perusing the future did you id like to know that ill make it back too sturm tried to summon up an image of kit from his mem ory all he got for his effort was a stabbing pain in the chest he coughed and said im worried kit are we right to deal with this dragon the gods and heroes of ancient times were wise they knew men and dragons could not coexist thats why the beasts were killed or banished chill forgotten kitiara planted a foot in the rising bank of red soil you surprise me she said you who are edu cated and tolerant of most creatures advocating hatred for all dragons even one of good lineage like cupelix im not advocating hatred i just dont trust him he wants something from us should he help us for nothing sturm tugged fitfully at the ends of his mustache you just dont see kit anyone with power be he dragon gob lin gnome or human is not going to relinquish that power merely to help others thats the evil of power and anyone or anything who has it is tainted by it youre wrong she said with verve wrong a cruel man is cruel no matter what his station in life but many dragons skilled in magic were aligned with good it is the heart and soul that are the seats of good or evil power is something else to have power is to live to lose it is to exist as something less than you are he listened to this short tirade in mute astonishment where was the kit he once knew the funloving passionate woman who could laugh at danger the kit who carried herself with the pride of a queen even when she had only a few coppers in her pocket where is she he said aloud kitiara asked him what he meant the kit i knew in solace the good companion the friend hurt and anger flowered in her eyes she is with you he could sense the anger radiating from her like heat from a hearthstone she turned and disappeared around the corner of the obelisk the gnomes forged a massive lever switch of iron and copper and converted the rest of the scrap into huge coup lings that could be clamped over the severed cables in the cloudmaster and closed by great iron hooks this work took most of the night and when it was done rainspot pre cipitated a short shower inside the obelisk to quench the fire and dispel the pall of smoke that hung over everything cupelix watched it all from his perch never questioning hardly even moving for nine and a half hours afterward the tired gnomes climbed the ramp into the ship for a rest leaving cupelix to admire their work sturm looked over the metalwork too as he idly ate his supper of dried spear plant and cold beans cupelix teased him with magically produced haunches of roast pig and pitchers of sweet cream but sturm stolidly ignored the proffered treats youre a stubborn fellow said the dragon as sturm con tinued to munch his meager fare principles are not to be cast aside whenever they become inconvenient he replied principles dont fill empty belly nor does magic salve an empty heart very good exclaimed cupelix let us trade proverbs that contradict each other thats a worthy entertainment some other time im not in the mood for games said sturm with a sigh ah i see the fair face of mistress kitiara in this said the dragon with a mischievous lilt in his voice do you pine for her my boy shall i put in a good word for you no sturm snapped you really are quite irritating sometimes inasmuch as ive had no one to talk to for nearly three millennia i admit my etiquette is sorely underdeveloped still said cupelix this presents you with the opportunity to inform me i would be as polite and genteel as a knight will you teach me sturm stifled a yawn it isnt manners or gentility taught by the fireside that makes a knight its long study and train ing living by the oath and the measure such things cannot be taught in light conversation besides i doubt that you genuinely want to learn anything youre just looking for diversion youre so untrusting said cupelix no dont deny it i can hear it in your mind before you speak how can i con vince you of my true good will sir doubter answer me this why are you a fully grown brass dragon permanently confined to this tower on this strange and magicridden moon i am keeper of the new lives said cupelix what does that mean the dragon darted his snaky neck from side to side as though looking for nonexistent eavesdroppers i guard the repository of my race when sturm continued to look blank cupelix said loudly eggs my dear ignorant mor tal the eggs of dragons lie in caverns beneath this obelisk it is my task to watch over them and protect them from insensate brutes like yourself his great mouth widened in a grin no offense intended of course none taken sturm looked at the floor light red and veined with dark wine streaks he tried to imagine the nest of dragon eggs below but he could not grasp it how do they come to be here l the eggs i mean he said i do not know for certain i was born here you see and grew from dragonlet to maturity within these walls out of eggs mine was chosen to hatch and live as guardian as the keeper of the new lives sturms mind boggled he lowered himself to the floor who deposited the eggs and built the tower he asked i have a theory said cupelix consciously mimicking the gnomes three thousand years ago when dragons were banished from krynn the evil ones were driven by paladine to the great nullity the negative plane where they were to remain until doomsday the dragons aligned with the forces of good left the lands of man as well paladine made a pact with gilean a neutral god who was sympathetic to our plight and arranged for a number of good dragon eggs to be collected and deposited here to serve as sentinels for when the evil ones returned he caused the tower to be raised and hatched me how many types of dragon eggs lie below some of the brass bronze and copper clans in the num ber of it is the collected spirit of these unborn dragons that provides the magic that saturates lunitari four sturm shifted on his haunches as if he could feel the movement of so many creatures below the thick marble slab so many when will they hatch asked sturm tomorrow or never sturm pressed for a better answer and cupelix said a veil of dormancy laid down by gilean lies over the entire cache it will take a god or a mighty spell to lift the veil and cause the eggs to hatch now you know all about me added cupelix do you trust me almost could i see the eggs cupelix scratched his shiny chest with one of his fore claws and sturm winced at the screeching sound i dont know about that dont you trust me asked sturm true touch mortal you shall see them then a sight no mortal eye has ever beheld hmm the dragon lifted one treesized leg and flexed his birdlike toes ill have to warn the micones they live in the caverns and keep the eggs clean turning them every day so the yolks dont settle they would certainly slay you if you ventured down there without my permission cupelix settled again and fluffed out his wings i will inform the micones but you must be sure not to touch the eggs the protective instinct runs so deeply in them that not even my intervention would pre vent the micones from ripping you limb from limb if you touched an egg ill keep that in mind said sturm he stood to go may i invite the others why not im sure the little men will be fascinated thank you dragon sturm nodded and made for the quiet ship once the human was inside cupelix spread his wings and telepathi cally ordered the illuminating ants to cease their glow the light went out of their bodies and one by one the micones dropped off and scuttled back into their holes in the floor kitiara reentered the darkened obelisk where is every body she called out in the flying machine said cupelix unseen above her in the shadows she flinched at the sound of his voice you should give a person warning that youre there she chided is there anything left to eat a table set with candles appeared before her delicate cutlets of veal bread and melted sweet butter awaited her a tall clear glass goblet brimmed with rich red wine kiti ara pulled out the velvetcushioned highbacked chair and sat down whats the occasion she asked no occasion replied the dragon from on high a ges ture of friendship are we friends said kitiara forking up a slice of veal oh yes and i hope we shall be better friends still a woman could do worse she said sipping the wine it wasnt grape wine at all but some sort of berry tart and cleansing on the tongue good she said not quite sure how else to characterize the wine im glad you like it its pleasing to me to do things for you kitiara may i call you kitiara you appreciate my lit tle gifts unlike that brightblade fellow hes so stiff and proper its a wonder he doesnt chip himself when he shaves kitiara laughed at the dragons very apt image you have a very charming laugh said cupelix careful she said if i were less mindful id think you were trying to cozen me i merely delight in your company there was a heavy rustle as the dragon flew from one side of the obelisk to the other the candle flames on kitiaras table wavered in the disturbed air soon master brightblade and his gnomish companions will make a descent into the caverns below the tower cupelix said and further explained about the cache of dragon eggs while they are down there i should like you to visit me in my private sanctum the bulk of the brass dragon dropped from the darkness landing with infinite grace and lightness in front of kitiaras table what for she said not quite suppressing the catch in her throat up close at a range of no more than six feet cupelixs eyes were green orbs three hands wide the vertical black pupils were cracks into the deepest abyss his eyes nar rowed as the dragon scrutinized the woman i would hear of your life and philosophy and you may pry into my secrets as well he said only dont tell the oth ers it would make them jealous not a word kitiara said she winked at the dragon and cupelix flicked his tongue out it touched her hand and a warm tingle spread up her arm until then cupelix spread his wings until they whisked the far walls he sprang off the floor with one thrust of his powerful hind legs and vanished into the darkness above kitiaras heartbeat slowly resumed its normal rhythm the tingle in her arm slowly faded kitiara reached for her wine glass to her surprise her hand was shaking so much that she knocked the goblet off the table and it shattered on the red marble floor damn she said clenching her fist chapter caverns deep the gnomes responded to cupelixs invitation with characteristic enthusiasm the new metal parts for the cloudmaster had to cool a while longer before they could be fitted into place and the proposed descent into the caverns suited them very well they turned the ship upside down hunting for proper equipment pens and paper of course rope and tape measures and transits for surveying the lay out of the caverns cutwood brought out a large balance scale to weigh representative specimens of dragon eggs oh no sturm warned no one is to touch the eggs not the least little bit but why asked rainspot who was wearing his oilcloth slicker fulltime now the micones are under orders to kill anyone who touch es them sturm said not even cupelix can countermand that order cutwood reluctantly abandoned his scale two hours before dawn sturm and the gnomes presented themselves before one of the large round holes in the obe lisk floor cupelix was poised on his ledge above them and kitiara lingered in the doorway watching the comic mar shaling of the gnome explorers some of them particularly fitter were so laden with gear that they could scarcely stand sturms only special item was a long hank of rope secured at one shoulder and draped across his chest i hope you dont intend to climb down said the dragon mildly the way presents many difficulties how else shall we get down there asked stutts by allowing the micones to take you sturms eyes narrowed how will they do that its very simple said cupelix he shut his mouth and lowered his head as he usually did when communicating telepathically with the ants hard armored heads appeared in all the holes and before sturm could protest six micones presented themselves to the exploration party the ants are quite capable of carrying two gnomes apiece and the sixth will be master brightblades mount sturm turned to kitiara are you certain you wont change your mind and go with us she shook her head ive explored enough of this moon thank you the gnomes were already scrambling over their mounts measuring touching and tapping the crystalline creatures from mandible to stinger the glasssmooth ants presented no footholds or handholds for mounting and riding after some discussion cut short by sturms impatient sigh the gnomes tied lengths of rope together into reasonable halters and bridles the micones stood stockstill through all this indignity even their restless antennae were motionless flash bent down on his hands and knees and stutts stepped on his back to reach his seat on the micone he was still too short to reach the ants arched thorax sighter tried to boost stutts up he planted both hands and one shoulder in the seat of stuttss pants and shoved with all his might stutts rose up the curving carapace of crystal up and up and over he slid headfirst over the ants body and thumped down on the other side fortunately something soft broke his fall it was birdcall sturm made a stirrup loop in his rope and levered himself onto the creatures back its like sitting on a statue he said wiggling to situate himself cold and hard the gnomes emulated sturms rope stirrup and with only a few minor bruises managed to mount their ants the pairs were stutts and flash birdcall and sighter cutwood and rainspot roperig and fitter naturally with wingover by himself g how do we steer these things cutwood muttered the makeshift halter ran around the giant ants neck but there was no way to control an animal that didnt breathe theres no need for that said the dragon i have told them to take you to the cavern wait there and bring you back they will not deviate from my instructions so dont try to get around them hold on and enjoy the ride ready colleagues asked stutts with a wave ready were ready lets go were the replies sturm wrapped the rope around his clenched fist and nod ded the micones were set in motion and they were off v the giant ant below sturm was rock steady on its six spin dly legs though its sidetoside motion was a bit odd to him who was used to the upanddown gait of a fourfooted horse sturms feet were only a few inches off the floor but the micone bore him strongly to the nearest hole he expect ed the ant to enter and descend like a man going down a spi ral stair but no the creature entered the hole headfirst and kept bending tipping sturm farther and farther forward he leaned down until his chest was pressed against the ants domed back and clamped his arms and legs around its body the micone walked down the holes vertical wall and emerged upside down in the vaulted cavern below with the astonished sturm hanging on for all he was worth the gnomes mounts entered the same way and the squeals of delight and terror that followed rang off the milky china blue walls huge stalactites thirty and forty feet long and ten feet wide at their bases reached down to the floor the pale blue formations shone with a dim light of their own the walls and ceiling which sturm found him self staring at were likewise encrusted with a coating of the hard bluewhite crystal it looked as smooth as ice but the ants barbed feet clung tenaciously to it and never slipped sturms mount followed a wellworn path amid the cold spires the micone walked thirty yards across the caverns ceiling then abruptly turned and descended straight down the wall a hundred feet below the ant righted itself and moved across the cavern floor which was littered with what resembled large scraps of old parchment and red leather this debris was kicked up around the ants feet until they halted in a precise straight line directly below the holes in the obelisk floor now high above their heads all around them the vaulted cavern glowed with faint luminescence it was like solinari in wane but glowed from all directions and cast no shadows when sturm and the gnomes had departed for the caverns kitiara waited nervously by the bow of the cloud master the gnomes shrieks half delight half terror faded as the ants carried them into the hollows below cupelix alighted on the floor beside the flying ship well my dear are you ready asked the dragon kitiara bit her lip and rubbed the palms of her hands on her sleeves sure she said how do i get up there the simplest way is for me to carry you she eyed him uncertainly cupelixs forelegs were small compared to his massive hind legs which could easily crush an ox noting her hesitation the dragon said if you climb upon my back and sit astride my neck ill fly very carefully to the top of the tower so saying he laid his chin on the cold floor kitiara threw one leg over the beasts long sin ewy neck his scales were as cold and hard as shed thought they would be they were living flesh but felt very much like true brass cupelix raised his head and kitiara felt taut muscles surge under the burnished scales she leaned for ward and grasped the edges of two scales to secure a grip as cupelix spread his wings and launched straight into the air j the obelisk walls were square on its lowest third where one particularly heavy platform ringed the walls they slanted inward constricting the dragons movement cupe lix flared his wings and grabbed hold of the ledge with his powerful hind legs he hopped sideways sliding his four toed feet along the sill which was deeply worn by centuries of such movement kitiara looked over the dragons shoul der and down the cloudmaster looked like a toy and the holes that had so recently swallowed sturm and the gnomes were mere ink blots on a crimson page cupelix reached a horizontal pillar that crossed from the north ledge to the east side he sidled on out onto this until he was almost centered in the shaft again hold on he said and leaped there was not enough room that high to allow him to fly so he kept his wings furled cupelix leaped thirty yards up to where the obelisk was very cramped indeed kitiara opened her eyes the floor four hundred feet below was a vague pink square above the obelisk came to an abrupt end at a flat stone ceiling she tightened her hold on the dragons neck a shiver ran through the great elephantine body youre tickling me he said in a very undragonlike man ner a wickedly hooked claw set on the leading edge of cupelixs right wing nudged against her it scraped along the spot where kitiara had held on scratching the ticklish spot are you going to do any more jumping she asked try ing not to let her anxiety show in her voice oh no from here on its all climbing by claw and muscular leg the dragon climbed the remaining few yards with deft deliberation he stopped when his horned head bumped the flat ceiling separating them from the obelisks uppermost section kitiara expected him to utter some magic word that would open the way but instead cupelix planted his angular head against a stone slab and pushed his neck bowed under the pressure and kitiara was pinned between the massive wing muscles she was about to protest when a large section of the slab gave way grudgingly cupelix shoved it upward until it stood on edge he lowered his neck and kitiara dismounted inside the dragons inner sanctum her feet slipped on the marble and for a second the distant floor below seemed ready to rush to her kitiara stepped farther away from the opening and breathed a silent sigh of relief arryas shirak said the dragon a globe fully eight feet across set in the very apex of the obelisk roof blazed with light the details of cupelixs lair leaped out at her heaps of old books and scrolls candle stands censers braziers and other magical apparatus all wrought in heavy gold four tapestries covered the walls tapestries so old that the lowest edges were crumbling to dust one hanging fifteen feet wide by fifteen feet high showed huma the lancer astride a firebreathing dragon impaling a denizen of the dark queens domain the heros armor was worked in gold and silver thread the second great tapestry was a map of krynn it showed not only the continent of ansalon as kitiara knew it but other land masses to the north and west the third hanging showed a conclave of the gods they were all there the good the neutral and the evil but the image that truly arrested her was that of the dark queen takhisis stood apart from the assembled gods of good and neutrality regal and scornful the weaver had made her not only beauti ful but also terrible with scaly legs and a barbed tail as kiti ara moved past the great figure the expression on the dark queens face was by turns cruel contemptuous bitter and bewitching kitiara might have stood there forever staring at her had not cupelix levered the stone slab back into place restoring it for a floor the several tons of marble thunked down and broke kitiaras trance the last tapestry was the most enigmatic it was a depic tion of a balance like the constellation hiddukel except that this scale was unbroken in the right pan of the scales was an egg on the left was the silhouette of a man cupelix clomped across the slab his nails clicking on the stone do you understand the picture he asked im not sure kitiara replied what sort of egg is that supposed to be what kind do you think it is well if its a dragon egg then i guess the picture repre sents the world in balance between humans and dragons as long as the dragons are just eggs cupelix said thats very good its also the most obvi ous interpretation there are many others who made the hangings i dont know the gods perhaps they were here before i was the dragon went to the largest pile of books and lay back against them drawing his tail around in front kitiara cast about for a convenient place to sit she upended a black iron cauldron inlaid with silver runes and sat on that so here i am she said why did you want to talk with me especially because you are different from the others the man sturm i enjoy debating but one can talk to him for five minutes and know his entire mind he is very plainspoken and singleminded isnt he she shrugged hes a good fellow when he doesnt inflict his narrow values on others its hard to like him sometimes and love asked the dragon slyly hardly oh hes not bad looking well made and all but itll take a different sort of woman from me to capture sturm brightblades heart cupelix cocked his head to one side in what way innocent unworldly someone who fits his knightly version of purity ah said the dragon a female untainted by lust kitiara smiled crookedly well not completely ha cupelix gave a hoot of laughter thumping a six foot stack of tomes dust puffed from between the yellowed vellum pages thats what i like about you my dear youre so frank yet unpredictable ive not yet been able to read your mind but youve tried oh yes its important to know what dangerous mortals are thinking kitiara laughed am i dangerous very as i explained master brightblade is an open book to me and the gnomes thoughts fly about like mad butter flies but you you my dear kitiara bear much watching the time has come for you to answer some questions frankly dragon she said planting her hands on her knees what is it you want from us from me i told you said cupelix twisting his neck from side to side i want to leave this tower and go to krynn im sick of being cooped up in here with no one to talk to and nothing to eat but the leavings the micones can scrounge for me you feed us quite well kitiara objected you do not understand the essential formula of magic a small amount of matter can be changed by a large amount of energy that is how it is done what you consider a large meal would not be a snack for me youre big and strong she said why dont you claw your way out and bring the stones down upon my head cupelix preened his purplish cheeks that would hardly accom plish my purpose besides his eyes narrowed vertically there is geas a magical prohibition against my damaging the structure i have tried many times using many formu lae to convince the micones to demolish the tower but they would not there is a higher power at work here which requires the attention of a third force to overcome your ingenious little friends are that third force my dear their fertile little brains can conceive a hundred schemes for every one you or i may devise and none of them practical really you surprise me again dear mortal girl did these same gnomes not get you to lunitari in the first place she objected that that had been an accident accidents are only unexpected probabilities said the dragon they can be encouraged when cupelix said that kitiara looked over her left shoulder and saw the dark queen glaring down haughtily from her tapestry what she began before taking her eyes off the mesmerizing visage will you do if we can get you out of here fly to krynn and take up residence there of course i am very keen to sample the mortal world with all its gaudy and vigorous life she gave a derisive snort why do you do that asked cupelix you think life on krynn is strange what do you call the creatures who dwell around you she said to me they are normal they are all i have known you see and they bore me have you ever tried to talk philoso phy with a treeman one might as well talk to a stone did you know that the vegetable life that grows on lunitari is so feeble and transient it has no magical aura of its own it is only because of the pervasive force of my eggbound com patriots that there is life here at all cupelix mustered a massive sigh i want to see oceans and forests and moun tains i want to converse with wise mortals of every race and so increase my knowledge beyond the boundaries set by these ancient books now she understood you want power said kitiara cupelix clenched his foreclaw into a fist if knowledge is power then the answer is yes i ache to be free of this perfect prison when my micone scouts discovered the gnomes fly ing ship for the first time i hoped that i might escape kitiara was silent for a moment choosing her words care fully she said do you fear retribution should you escape the dragons head pulled back in surprise retribution from whom those who made the obelisk if a prison stands then there likely is a warden somewhere the gods sleep gilean the gray voyager sirrion and reorx have laid down the reins of destiny the way is clear for action the very fact of your voyage to lunitari bears this out in the days of huma such a thing would not have been tolerated cupelix said the gods sleep kitiara mused the way is clear for action these thoughts stirred deep within her it must be true a dragon would know tell me your thoughts cupelix said i grow uneasy when you are so quiet a daring notion began to form in her head have you considered what you will do once you reach krynn she asked your books are old you could use a guide do you have anyone in mind my dear few know ansalon as i do kitiara repliedmy travels have taken me far together we could tour the world and reap what benefits would come to us she looked the dragon in the eye as partners cupelix wheezed and whistled like a boiling teapot he clapped his forearms against his sides he really was quite good at parodying human gestures oh my dear woman you wound me with mirth i am killed he exclaimed kitiara frowned why do you laugh you speak of partnership with a dragon as casually as i speak of my servants the micones do you imagine that you and i are equals that is a rich jest indeed cupelix rocked so hard with merriment that he banged his head sharply on the wall behind him that calmed him but kiti ara was already offended she sprang to her feet i wish to leave she exclaimed i see no reason to sit here and be laughed at sit down cupelix said genially when she struck a defi ant pose the dragon swept his tail in behind her and down she went to the marble floor let us be clear about one thing my dear girl on the scale of life i sit far higher than you and i will have good manners from my guests yes kitiara rubbed her bruised posterior and said nothing facetoface with one of the greatest creatures that ever existed you are insolent what makes you so proud i am what i have made myself kitiara said tersely in a world where most are ignorant peasants i made myself a warrior i take what i can and give when i like i dont need you dragon i dont need anyone not even tanis kitiaras face darkened dramatically be at ease even your mortal friend sturm could have heard your heart cry out his name just then who is this man and why do you love him hes halfelf not human if you must know kitiara took a deep breath and i dont love him indeed can my sense for such things be so wrong i would hear the tale of tanis cupelix said he curled back his lips in a waggish imitation of a human smile please you only want to hear so you can mock me no no human relationships fascinate me i need to understand kitiara slipped back onto the overturned cauldron she gazed into space marshaling images of her past id like to understand tanis myself she said being a woman in a mans game war throws you in with all sorts of men most of them are a scurvy lot of bullies and cutthroats in my younger days i must have fought a hundred duels with men who tried to push me around take advantage of me until i became as hard and cold as the blade i carried kiti ara fingered the hilt of her sword then came tanis i was on my way back to solace one autumn a few years back the summer campaigning season was done and id been paid off by my most recent commander with a pocket full of silver i rode south in the forest i was ambushed by a pack of goblins an arrow took out my horse and i was thrown down the goblins came out of the brush with axes and clubs to finish me off but i lay in wait for them when they got close i was on them before they could blink i killed two right away and settled down to toy with the last pair goblins are startlingly bad thieves and even worse in standup combat one of them tripped and managed to impale itself on its own weapon i carved my mark on the last one and it screamed its bloody head off i was ready to finish the pest when out of the bushes bounded this beauti ful fellow with a bow he scared me for a second i thought he was with the goblins before i could move hed put a graygoose shaft into the last goblin it was then i realized he thought he was rescuing me she paused and the ghost of a smile played about her lips its funny but at the time i was mad that goblin was mine to kill you see and tanis had taken that away from me i went after him but he stood me off long enough for the bloodanger to leave me how we laughed after that he made me feel good tanis did no one had done that for a long long time sure we were lovers soon enough but we were more than that we rode and hunted and played pranks together we lived you understand we lived why did this love not continue asked cupelix quietly he wanted me to stay in solace i couldnt do that i tried to get him to go on the road with me but he wouldnt fight for pay hes halfelf as i said some rogue mercenary molested his elf mother to conceive him and hes ever had a cold place in his heart for soldiers kitiara made a fist if tanis had fought by my side i would never have left him till the last drop of blood spilled from my body she slapped her knee tanis was great fun and in that he was far better as a companion than sturm whos always serious but the time came when i had to choose between his way of living and mine i chose and here i am im glad said cupelix will you help liberate me back to that are we what is it worth to you cupelix raised his ears making the veined webbing behind them stand up dont you worry about your own safety he asked in a rumbling voice dont bluff me dragon if you were going to use threats youd have threatened stutts birdcall and flash before we got here you cant force us to help youre not the sort of dragon to do it the dragons threatening posture collapsed and the the atrical menace left his voice true true cupelix said you are a razor kit you cut deep with little effort kitiara flipped a hand in salute mockingly im not new to the game of threat and bluff she said standing a slim band of new light fell across her shoulder from a slit window in the obelisk wall consider what i said about partnership dragon it neednt be for life just a year or two do that for me and ill speak for you sunlight brightened the room the magic globe at the ceilings apex dimmed and went out by the natural light kitiara could see that the dragons books and scrolls were more decayed than she thought the tapestries were rotten too in the midst of this decay the dragons predicament was more obvious someday cupelix would have nothing to read or study but a heap of mildewed pulp how many more centuries will you live kitiara asked the dragons eyes narrowed a great many well maybe someone else will show up and help you escape but think how lonely it will be soon no more books no tapestries no company partnership one year said cupelix two years kitiara said firmly a very short span in the life of a dragon true true cupelix gave his word that he would travel with kitiara for two years upon their return to krynn she stretched smiling expansively kitiara felt good she would come out of this crazy voyage to the red moon with more than increased muscle power a dragon a living dragon as her companion for two whole years itll be a great adventure she said to him cupelix snapped his jaws indubitably kitiara went to the window to take in the fresh air light ning crackled from the obelisk peak as the magic essence dis charged into the red moons sky when the flashes ended kitiara looked down at the valley below the lunitarians are moving she exclaimed of course its day their time to move said cupelix but theyre forming ranks i think theyre going to attack the micones showed no signs of moving so sturm announced that theyd best proceed on foot the gnomes were already untied and sliding off the backs of their mounts sturm got down and patted the micone on the head a habit hed always had since owning his first horse the giant ant cocked its wedgeshaped head and clacked its mandibles together a response of pleasure sturm wonder ed it was hard to tell the rubbish around them was kneedeep to sturm and chestdeep to the gnomes sturm found sighter examining a piece of the red leather with his magnifying glass hm doesnt look like vegetable material said sighter cutwood tried writing on the soft brown parchmentstuff but it wouldnt take a pencil mark it was too soft and supple sturm tried to tear a sheet of it in two but couldnt do it this would make admirable boot tops he said i won der what it is i would say its some form of animal hide said sighter snapping his glass back into its case we havent found any animals on lunitari except the dragon stutts objected even the micones are more min eral than animal maybe wingover said slowly there are other kinds of animals in these caves animals we havent seen before rainspot swallowed audibly gnomeeating animals bosh said sighter the micones wouldnt allow any thing dangerous to live near the dragon eggs stop scaring yourselves flash was off a little ways touching the white crust on the walls he plucked a tack hammer from his toolladen belt and butted a cold steel chisel against the wall back swung the hammer bong the little hammer hit the chisel and the whole cavern reverberated with the sound so powerful were the vibrations that the gnomes lost their footing and fell in the thick rubbish sturm braced himself against a squat stalag mite until the ringing ceased dont do that cutwood said plaintively with his aug mented hearing the tone had been enough to start his nose bleeding all the micones were clicking their mandibles and shaking their heads fascinating said stutts a perfect resonant chamber ah it makes sense what does asked roperig this extraneous jetsam its padding to deaden the ants footsteps on the floor they waded though the rubbish toward the end of the oblong chamber the ceiling level fell and the floor rose to form a tight circular opening the rim of the opening had been notched with jagged spikes of quartz probably by the micones anything softer than a giant ant would be cut to pieces if it tried to walk or crawl over the spikes the gnomes held back and proposed many solutions to the problem of the entrance sturm planted his fists on his hips and sighed he turned back and gathered up an armful of the tough parchmentlike shreds then laid them across the spikes he put his hands on the parchment and pushed the spikes poked through three or four layers but the top layers remained unpierced allow me said sturm he lifted stutts and sat him on the padding stutts slid through the opening to the chamber beyond one by one the other gnomes followed sturm went last the gnomes plunged ahead in their bumbling fearless way and he had to catch up with them sturm hurried down the narrow slit in the rock and into another large chamber here veins of wine red crystal oozed out of fissures in the rock when the soft crystal touched the warmer moister air of the cavern it lightened to clear crim son and began to take more exact form around them were dozens of halfformed micones some only heads some whole bodies but without legs and some so complete that their antennae wiggled so this is the ant hatchery said wingover hatchery isnt the right word for it said roperig living rock crystal said stutts breathlessly i wonder what influences it to take on an ant shape the dragon i would think said sighter turning a com plete circle to see all the budding micones remember he said he tried to make the treefolk into servants but failed he must have uncovered this living crystal and decided to use it to make perfectly obedient and hardworking slaves they walked in single file down the center of the high narrow cavern as before bluish stalactites on the ceiling shed a weak light on the scene flash approached one of the nearly finished micones and tried to measure the width of its head the ant moved like lightning and clamped its power ful jaws on the gnomes arm flash let out a yell get back sturm cried drawing his sword he tried to lever the jaws open but the creatures grip was too strong the cruel sawtoothed jaws could easily cut through flesh and bone sturm noticed that flashs arm wasnt bleeding the gnome struggled beating the stonehard ant on the head with his flimsy folding rule has he got you by the arm sturm asked uh agh yes what do you think this is my foot sturm eased his hand forward and felt flashs arm the micones jaws had missed the gnomes flesh all it had was his jacket sleeve take your jacket off sturm said calmly uh argh eeel i cant ill help you sturm reached in front of the gnome and undid the complex series of buttons and lacings on his jack et he pulled flashs left arm out then his right the empty jacket dangled in the micones jaws the halfformed micone did not move my jacket flash howled never mind just thank your gods that your arm didnt get caught in that things pincers sturm said thank you reorx said the gnome he looked longing ly at the lost jacket a big tear rolled down his cheek i designed that jacket myself the one size fits all wind proof jacket mark iii you can make another wingover said consolingly an even better one with detachable sleeves in case you ever get in such a predicament again yes yes what a splendid notion detachable sleeves flash made a hasty sketch on his white shirt cuff beyond the ant hatchery the cavern wound off in several directions and there was no clear indication which way the explorers should go cutwood suggested that they split up and try all the tunnels but stutts vetoed that and sturm agreed weve no idea how large this caverns is and if you go off on your own you stand a good chance of getting lost forever we also dont know how the micrones will react to us if we split up sturm said they do seem very literalminded sighter said sepa rate pairs may not mean the same thing to them as a band of ten the sight of flashs jacket locked in the unbreakable grip of the micones jaws was a powerful inducement to stay together nothing more was said about splitting up they chose the widest straightest path onward the floor sloped down from the micones birth chamber at such a steep angle that the gnomes gave up trying to walk down and instead sat down to slide sturm would have preferred to walk down but the floor was slick with dew so it didnt take him long to decide to do as the gnomes did sturm slid gently into another lower cavern it was very much warmer and wetter here the air was steamy water trickled down the walls and dripped from overhead as he stood up he saw the gnomes dark shapes strolling through the wispy white clouds of steam stutts sighter where are all of you he called right here sturm walked uncertainly into the mist the cavern was well lit from above from a large number of the glowing stalactites and considerable heat radiated from the floor mind the magma said cutwood appearing in the steam in front of him the gnome pointed to a raised funnel of glazed rock in their path a fiery halo hung over the wide mouth sturm bent over it and saw that the natural bowl was full of a bright orange liquid a bubble burst wetly in its center molten rock cutwood explained thats why the cave is so warm sturm had an almost irresistible urge to touch the bub bling stuff but the glare of heat on his face told him quite plainly how hot the magma was another gnome wingover appeared in the swirling steam this way he cried they wended their way through a garden of seething cauldrons each one emitting gurgles as the molten rock boiled the air around them became sulfurous and hard to take in sturm coughed and held a kerchief to his face the vapors abated somewhat near the cavern wall the remaining gnomes were clustered by a small hole in the wall sturm raised his head and saw that the hole was dark is that it sturm wondered aloud must be said sighter seems to be no other way out perhaps one of the other tunnels we missed roperig suggested the black circle was not very inviting the established path clearly leads here said stutts as senior colleague it is up to me to go first no you dont sturm said im armed go first to make sure its safe oh excellent idea said rainspot well if you insist said stutts you will need a light said flash he unbuttoned one of the capacious pockets on the front of his trouser legs give me a moment and ill lend you my collapsing selfigniting pocket lamp mark xvi flash unfolded a flattish box of tin and set it on the floor from a separate wooden case he extracted a bit of gooey stuff that resembled axle grease he put a dollop of this in the lamp from a different pocket flash produced a slender glass vial tightly stoppered he broke the wax seal and popped the cork a sharp volatile aroma filled the cavern flash crouched down and extended his arm cautiously to the lamp one eye clenched shut as a single drop of the fluid fell from the vial the droplet hit the plug of grease and went poof the flash lit up the whole area and the grease burned merrily sturm reached for it and the lamp popped and sputtered sending bits of flaming grease in all directions are you sure this is safe he asked well after a few minutes the tin will melt flash said but it should be all right until then wonderful he picked up the violent little lamp by its slim metal ring and started through the hole the gnomes clustered around the opening their pink faces and white beards facing upward like so many daisies seeking the sun sturm walked up a curving ramp and soon entered a chamber of profound silence even the lamps sputtering declined to a fitful flicker he stepped off the ramp and onto the roughly cleared stone floor and beheld a sight that no mortal had seen in millennia dragon eggs row upon row of carved niches each hold ing a single melonsized egg row after row tier upon tier stretching far beyond the feeble range of light from the col lapsing selfigniting pocket lamp mark xvi the lips of each niche glittered with dew formed when the steamy air below met the cooler air of this chamber a gnomish voice drifted to sturm what do you see this is it he called back hand cupped to his mouth the great egg chamber the gnomes scrambled up the ramp and spilled into the cavern jostling past sturm for a better view they oohed and aahed and uttered fervent exclamations to their holy trio reorx gears and hydrodynamics how many eggs do you suppose there are breathed fit ter sturm shot a glance at sighter in view there are eight tiers said sighter and sixty two per tier for a total of cutwood figured frantically said sturm recalling the figure that cupelix had given him thats right said stutts totting up his numbers they walked forward with sturm leading wingover hovered at the rear since the lamp dazzled his piercing eye sight he could see through the velvet darkness so he was able to keep their entry hole in sight ow sturm muttered shifting the lamp to his other hand the ring was getting very hot this way turn this way said roperig suddenly sturm turned to his left what was it he asked something moved over there i didnt see it very clearly a jet black thing scuttled out of the niche behind the eggs and leaped into the air toward sturms light he recoiled clumsily and dropped the lamp something small and furry feeling brushed over his foot and was gone the gnomes were all yelling and stamping their feet silence silence i say sturm roared he found the lost lamp its fuel was almost extinguished only a faint corona of blue flame circled the lump of grease sturm sheltered the tiny fire with his hands and it grew brighter he picked up the lamp and faced the gnomes they were not scared in the least wingover had bounded forward from his place in line and planted his foot on the thing that had burst from the egg niche it squirmed under his toes trying to get away at first sight it resembled a fat hairy spider but as sturm brought the lamp nearer they all recognized it its a glove said stutts one of kits gloves said sturm recognizing the pattern of stitching on the back its one of a pair she left behind on the cloudmaster when we went off on our ore expedition howd it get here asked rainspot birdcall twittered a question of his own he says why is it alive stutts added rainspot grasped the glove by its fingers and told wingover to lift his foot the weather seer brought the wriggling thing to eye level and grunted strong little thing sighter glared through his everpresent lens this glove is made of cowhide and rabbit fur but the seams have disap peared he pressed a finger into the soft leather side it has a heartbeat ridiculous flash said gloves dont come to life on lunitari said stutts why not sturm remembered cupelixs remark about the cumula tive life force of all the dragon eggs being responsible for the intense aura of magical power on lunitari he offered this bit of information to the gnomes ah said sighter with a sage expression the level of magical force must be particularly high in these caverns dare say any animal or vegetable product left down here long enough might develop a life of its own roperig looked down at his own pigskin boots you mean my shoes might take on life and run away with me we shant be down here long enough for that to happen stutts assured him rainspot put the glove down on its back and pinned it with his foot cutwood suggested that they dissect it to see what internal organs it had let it go its harmless said sturm we dont have time to fool around with it rainspot raised his foot and the glove flipped over it scampered into the recesses of the egg niches i wonder said flash what a living glove eats finger food said fitter roperig cuffed him lightly on the head and his hand promptly stuck there are you finished sturm said impatiently theres more of the cave to see and i dont think the lamp will last much longer indeed even as he spoke silver drops of mol ten tin dripped off the lamps front end they hurried down the tunnel sounds of movement came to them and they halted the rear legs and teardrop abdomen of a working micone maneuvered out of the dark ness the micone sensed their light and scuttled around to face the intruders its antennae almost straightened while it studied the man and gnomes sturm had a momentary flash of fear if the micone attacked his lone sword would never prevail the micone kinked its feelers again and turned away sturm and the gnomes let out a collective sigh of relief they inched past the giant who was busy chipping away glassy dew from the shelf below a row of eggs a fragment of the clear encrustation landed at rainspots feet and he pounced on it he dropped it in a tiny silk bag and pulled the drawstring for later analysis he said the caverns gave no sign of ending and after penetrating a hundred yards or so into them sturm called a halt the place they stopped was thick with micones and the giant ants swept past the explorers without any heed cupelix had told the ants to ignore them and the ants obeyed in their precise unswerving way wed best go back before we get trampled sturm said dodging a flurry of micone legs rainspot drifted away from the others to where the ants were engaged in cleaning the dragon eggs as they chipped and anointed and turned the blockish eggs the ants exposed the undersides of the eggs to the air some of the shells had a scabrous layer peeling off and the ants scrupulously removed this dead layer it was this castoff shell that made the parchmentlike skin theyd found in the first chamber rainspot picked up a sheaf of castoffs below the lowest egg shelf a micone turned sharply toward him and snatched the leathery shell fragment with its mandibles no said rainspot stubbornly its mine you threw it away the gnome dug in his toes and pulled the shell wouldnt yield and neither would the ant rainspot got angry his enveloping cloud thickened and lightning flashed within it rainspot leave it well take samples from the outer cave said wingover but the micones implacable resist ance made the usually mild gnome madder and madder a cyclone four feet wide lashed at the ant and miniature claps of thunder reverberated through the cave sturm entered rainspots tiny tempest to his surprise the whirling rain was hot rainspot he said grabbing the little fellow by the shoulders let go a bolt of lightning diminutive by natures standards yet still five feet long struck the micone in the center of its head the strike knocked sturm and rainspot backward at least six feet the gnome landed on sturm shook his head and found that he was holding the scrap of eggshell i have it he said triumphantly sturm flat on his back and not happy said do you mind rainspot blushed and rolled off the mans stomach look at that cutwood said in awe the gnomes ringed the lightningstruck ant the bolt had split the createatures head in half with the pre cision of a diamond cutter the micones headless body col lapsed the thorax sagging to the floor immediately two more micones appeared and began to clean up they nipped the shattered ants carcass apart and carried each bit away at least we know they can be killed said roperig and our rainspot did it said fitter the gentle weather seer was mortified ive never lost my temper like that he said im sorry it was unforgivable the poor myrmidon was only doing its appointed task and i killed it you very thoroughly killed it sturm said impressed remind me not to make you angry rainspot i hope cupelix wont be angry rainspot said worriedly it wasnt intentional said roperig consolingly i doubt any single ant is that important to him sturm said now can we go back l the lamp failed before they were all up the ramp to the steam chamber wingover took the lead and each one held the hand of the person in front and behind him they avoid ed the budding giants in the birthing cave though flash cast a longing look at his jacket still dangling from the micones jaws and soon they were back in the rubbish filled grand cavern the six micones who had brought them were just as theyd left them unmoved by as much as an inch sturm and the gnomes mounted and without a word or gesture needed the giant ants lurched into motion chapter little fitters pants the drnagon with kitiara clinging to his neck dropped like a stone from his lair flaring out his wings to ease his landing kitiara discarded her cloak and reached the notchshaped doorway just as the micones bearing sturm and the gnomes appeared its about time you got back she yelled stand to arms all of you the lunitarians are forming to attack a barrage of glass javelins arced through the doorway to shatter on the marble floor the gnomes though curious retreated under a shower of red glass splinters the lunitar ians were hooting wildly they mean to have you cupelix said theyre calling for your blood surely they cant get in rainspot said the treemen are beyond reason the dragon replied so theyre coming sturm said grimlyhe shucked off his outer garb and made ready his armor and helmet kiti ara marched recklessly back and forth before the door drawing the treemens attention shall we sting them a little she said to sturm it does seem necessary to discourage them he admitted to the dragon he said can you lend us some micones they would even the odds for us they would be of little use said cupelix a glass hatchet whistled in and thumped against his scaly belly it bounced off harmlessly and broke on the floor cupelix regarded the ruined weapon idly the micones are almost totally blind in daylight he said if i unleashed them they would as likely cut you two to pieces as any treeman enough talk kitiara barked she hitched her shield up on her forearm im going to swing some steel sturm cinched his sword belt tighter kit wait for me he was shieldless but his mail was heavier than kits he drew his sword and ran to the door the treemen had scaled the earthen rampart turned up by the micones and were using its height to gain velocity for their spear casts kitiara held her shield to her face as missile after missile crashed against it cmon you barkcovered devils she shouted throw on kitiara uth matar is com ing for you she started up the slope it was hard going what with the steep angle and the loose soil sturm more circumspect worked his way around the obelisk to where the rampart was not so steep he gained the top at nearly the same time kitiara did though there were forty yards and twentyodd treemen between them sturm had to fence with the lunitarians on the mound and dodge spears hurled from the ground below the luni tarians were hooting at the top of their voices and it didnt take much imagination to see the anger distorting their sim ple faces kitiara plowed into a trio of treemen all of whom tow ered over her she did little more than inflict deep chips on them with her sword she did catch one treeman with his arm down and lopped it off with a single stroke the sev ered limb hit the ground and crawled about seeking its former owner it got tangled up in kitiaras legs and she tripped falling backward amid a flurry of spear thrusts the treemen converged on the fallen woman and sturm could only think that shed been wounded he roared at the foe and cut at their backs unable to strike through a heart and kill them he concentrated on their stumpy legs a glass blade swept over his face the hot line it left dripped blood he ignored it lunitarians toppled off the dirt wall rolling down to bowl over their fellows on the ground there was a terrible tearing sensation in sturms right leg he looked back and saw a spear embedded in the back of his thigh blood welling around the already crimson shaft he swung his sword back snapping the spear shaft off and leaving the head in his leg he couldnt see kitiara at all he went down weak from the pain and loss of blood he slid down the rampart on the side nearest the obelisk whoop ing treemen skidded after him shouting their version of his name finished he thought this is how it ends the expected spear points did not descend on his unar mored face and neck the sounds of battle raged over him though he fancied that he heard highpitched cries of delight and triumph the gnomes surely they hadnt ventured forth theyd be slaughtered the hooting of the berserk lunitarians receded sturm lifted his head with great effort and tried to see what was happening a treeman stood atop the rampart waving his sword before him trying to ward off some unseen foe a dark object whipped into view and hit the treeman in the face thunk the lunitarian disappeared over the rampart amid shouts of gnomish laughter someone turned sturm over the red dirt was dusted from his eyes kitiara looks like you caught one she said in a friendly way her face was scratched and her hands cut up but she was otherwise unhurt are you well he asked weakly kitiara nodded and put the neck of her water bottle to his lips the trickle of rainwa ter was the most delicious thing hed ever tasted ho master sturm mistress kitiara we have won stutts declared he stuck his thumbs under his suspenders and threw out his chest the improvised trouser flail mark i was a success the what never mind kitiara said lets get you inside she scooped him up as easily as sturm would pick up an infant and carried him into the obelisk the gnomes were pounding each other on the back and talking as fast and as loudly as they could sturm saw a weird contraption to one side of the passage an upright col lection of posts and gears from which dangled three pairs of gnomesized pants stuffed tightly with something heavy probably dirt cupelix was on his lowest perch watching intently when he saw that sturm was wounded he offered to help treat the injury no magic sturm said stubbornly his whole leg was achingly numb it was cold very cold the dragons broad brass face swooped down close to his no magic even if it means your life said the polished reptilian voice no magic sturm insisted rainspot turned sturms face away and put a bitter tasting root in his mouth the gnome said chew please confident that he was in the thoroughly nonmagical care of the gnomes sturm did as he was told numbness spread through his body he didnt fall asleep sturm quite distinctly heard the gnomes consulting over his wound heard rather than felt the glass spear tip being removed from his flesh heard the dragon offering advice on how best to close the gaping hole then he was lying on his stomach the numbness gone sturms leg throbbed unmercifully he lifted himself up on his hands if you say where am i ill hit you said kitiara genially what happened he said you were injured said sighter who was squatting near sturms head that i recall well who repelled the treefolk i wish i could say that i did kitiara said we did it stutts declared coming up behind sighter cupelix rumbled something that sturm couldnt make out stutts blanched and said with help from the dragon that is we adapted a gnomeflinger design wingover said he knelt alongside stutts and peeked over sighters shoulder we used cutwoods pants filled with dirt as a test subject for flinging birdcall suggested hurling the pants at the luni tarians but that would have sufficed for only one shot so me and roperig gave up ours said fitter who squirmed into view his striped long johns were eloquent proof of the truth of his statement we filled em with dirt and tied em to the throwing arms and used the gear system to pummel the enemy off the wall roperig finished for his apprentice very clever sturm admitted but why should fiercely angry treefolk flee when thumped with a few pairs of pants why didnt they swarm all over you that was my doing said cupelix modestly i wove a spell of illusion over the gnomes and their machine the lunitarians saw a huge flamebreathing red dragon attack ing them its terrible claws snatching them one by one from the rampart the physical effect combined with the vivid illusion was quite effective the treemen have fled whats to prevent them from recovering their nerve and coming back said kitiara at sunset i shall send the micones to harry them back to their village once and for all their story told the gnomes dispersed sturm called stutts back to him yes said the senior gnome have you inspected the repairs on the cloudmaster not yet urge your colleagues forward my friend we must be off this world soon said sturm stutts stroked his short silky beard whats the hurry the new engine components ought to be tested first sturm lowered his voice the dragon may believe the treemen will not come back but i dont want to take the chance of being besieged in here again besides cupelix will he closed his mouth when he saw kitiara coming well speak later sturm finished stutts nodded and strolled back to the cloudmaster his thumbs hooked in his vest pockets kitiara paid no attention to his exaggerated nonchalance kitiara dropped down beside sturm does it hurt much only when i dance he said uncharacteristically she snorted youll live she said she poked around the bandaged area and added probably wont even have a limp what made you charge into those treemen you werent carrying a shield or wearing leg armor i saw you go down he said i was going to help you kitiara was silent for a moment thank you sturm gingerly eased himself onto his good side and sat up thats better i was getting a headache lying like that you know what the most unforgivable thing is dont you that you and i two fighters soundly trained in the warrior arts should fall to a bunch of savages and be saved by a band of nutty gnomes using pants full of dirt as flails kitiara started to laugh all the tensions and suspicions sur faced and flew away in her laughter tears welled in her eyes and she couldnt stop little fitters pants sturm said feeling the guffaws building deep inside little fitters pants disguised as the claws of a red dragon kitiara nodded helplessly her face contorted with hysterical mirth great rolling laughs boomed out of sturm his shaking jounced painfully his tightly wrapped wound but he couldnt stop when he tried to speak all he could gasp was trouser flail before erupt ing into fresh gales kitiara leaned against him forcing herself to breathe in the tooshort intervals between new merry convulsions her head rested on sturms shoulder she draped an arm around his neck above them cupelix perched in a shadowed corner of the tower a shaft of amber sunlight falling across the enfolding tips of his leathery wings illuminated from behind the brass dragons skin shone like gold despite his earlier protests when kitiara had brought sturm a bowl of venison stew that cupelix had made he ate without a second glance there was something more he accepted her offer to make a backres out of her fur cloak and blanket ordinarily sturm would have stoically reject ed such treatment the gnomes ate heartily as usual under the gentle glow of the four micones who remained behind when the bulk of them went out to chase the lunitarians away the ants hung overhead by their forelegs like grotesque paper lanterns the ominous barbed stingers the only threatening aspect of their otherwise benign posture the new parts showed no sign of cracking or fatigue flash said ladling gravy over his roast if we can get a decent charge of lightning i dont see why we couldnt fly home right away he tried to set the metal ladle back in its bowl but it clung to his magnetic hands cutwood plucked it off for him you know sighter said stirring his pudding idly with the proper angle of flight we could very likely fly from here to one of the other moons this option was greeted with thunderous silence solinari or the dark moon what do you think birdcall answered for all of them he put two fingers to his lips and made a very rude noise sighter grumbled no need to be insulting the important thing is to return to mt nevermind and announce our success said stutts aerial navigation is now a fact and the gnomish people must not delay in exploring all the possibilities it presents sturm reclining on the floor by the dinner table spoke up what possibilities do you foresee exploring and mapping can be done easily from the air these would be a boon to navigation all the heavy work of transport now done by ships could be more efficiently done in the skies i can see a time when great aerial galleons with six or eight pairs of wings ply trade routes in the clouds bringing goods to and from every corner of krynn stutts got quite lost in the grandness of his conception then theres war said sighter ominously what war asked kitiara any war theres always a war someplace isnt there can you see the cavalry of the clouds swooping down to destroy field and farm town temple and castle alike it would be easy yes very easy to fling down fire and stone on the heads of the foe in the workshops of mt nevermind there are stranger things still weapons that require no mag ic power to destroy the entire world his morose vision quelled all conversation then from above cupelix said it sounds as though you gnomes are planning to create your own race of dragons mechanical dragons completely obedient to their masters hand all those things master sighter describes happened a thousand or more years ago when dragons served in the great wars perhaps we shouldnt share the secret of aerial naviga tion fitter said hesitantly knowledge must be shared stutts declared there is no evil in pure knowledge its how its put to use that deter mines what good or ill comes of it knowledge is power said the dragon catching kitiaras eye she buried her nose in her cup when it was empty she set it down on the table with a loud thump were forgetting one important thing she said wiping her lips on the back of her hand we owe a debt here we oughtnt leave without paying it debt said cutwood to whom our host kitiara replied the excellent dragon cupe lix the gnomes broke into polite applause thank you youre very kind said the dragon we would long ago have fallen into the hands of the lunitarians had it not been for the intervention of cupelix kitiara went on now were safe the flying ship is repaired and we have a debt to pay how shall we do it would you care for some fresh water asked rainspot kind but unnecessary said the dragon the micones bring me water from the cavern depths do you have any machines to be repaired asked flash thoughtfully none whatsoever the remaining gnomes all tried suggestions which the dragon politely dismissed as unneeded or inapplicable what can we do said wingover frustrated cupelix launched into a compressed description of his sit uation inside the obelisk and how he very much wanted to escape it the gnomes just looked up at him and blinked is that all said roperig nothing else added birdcall by translation just this one simple task answered the dragon sturm pushed himself up to a seated position mindful of the pressure this put on his injured leg have you consid ered dragon that a higher power intended for you to live out your life within these walls would we be committing an act of impiety by releasing you the gods raised these walls and brought these many eggs here but in all the thousands of years ive been resident in the obelisk no god demigod or spirit has deigned to reveal any such divine plan to me said cupelix he shifted from one massive foot to the other you seem to think my being kept here like a rooster in a coop is a good thing can you not see it as i do that i am in fact a prisoner is it an evil deed to free an innocent captive what will happen to all the dragon eggs if you leave asked roperig the micones will tend them and guard the caverns for ever no egg will hatch without deliberate inducement at this point i am totally superfluous i say we help him said kitiara with conviction she leaned forward to the table and gave each gnome a piercing look who can honestly say the dragon hasnt earned our help all was silent until sturm said i will agree if the dragon answers one question what will he do once he is free revel in my liberty of course i shall travel thereafter wherever the winds of heaven carry me sturm folded his arms to krynn he said sharply why not is there a fairer land betwixt here and the stars dragons were driven out of krynn long ago because their power was used to scheme and control the affairs of mortals you cannot return to krynn sturm said cupelix is not an evil dragon kitiara argued do you think he could live so long on the moon of neutral magic and not be moderated by its influence and what if sturm said slowly cupelix is no danger to krynn he is still a dragon my ancestors fought and died to rid our world of dragons how can i dishonor them by aid ing a dragon even a benign one to return kitiara stood so suddenly that her chair fell over suffer ing gods who do you think you are sturm brightblade my ancestors fought in the dragon wars too it was a dif ferent time and different circumstances she turned to the gnomes i put it to you shall we repay the dragons hospi tality with indifference will we fill our bellies with his food and drink fix the ship with his help and depart without so much as attempting to help him be free she had them now all nine little faces paler in the short faint days of lunitari were rapt with attention kitiara raised her hand to the silent cupelix who contrived to look forlorn and desolate atop his marble perch put yourself in his place she said grandly which one of us asked cutwood it doesnt matter any or all of you think of how youd feel spending all your life inside this tower unable to even walk outdoors and consider that a dragons life is not fifty years or two hundred years but twenty times two hun dred how would you feel imprisoned in a lonely tower with no one to talk to and no tools either roperig and fitter gasped no tools yes and no wood or metal to work with no gears or valves or pulleys horrible said flash birdcall seconded him with a steady descending note and we you have the chance to correct this wrong you have the inventive powers to devise some way to allow cupelix to fly free will you do it she asked wingover leaped to his feet we will we will rainspot and fitter wept for the injustice inflicted on the dragon while stutts and sighter were already bombarding each oth er with first schemes to open the obelisk wingover got up on his chair and then on the table pointing dramatically to the wingless hull of the cloudmaster to the ship he cried we must make plans yes yes the tools are there said cutwood and parchment and pencils chemicals and crucibles rope and rigging raisins the gnomes surged away from the table a tiny tide of boisterous idealism and ramshackle ingenuity when the last gnome had disappeared up the ramp kitiara turned smiling to sturm very clever he said at last you did that well did what she replied guilelessly we both know how impulsive the gnomes are between your passionate call for freedom and the prospect of a major engineering project the obelisk hasnt got a chance i hope youre right said cupelix it was uncanny how easy it was to forget him when he stayed quiet above their line of sight sturm frowned dont be so suspicious chid ed the dragon if my intentions were black do you think i would have resorted to banquets and cajoling my micones could have held the ship indefinitely until you agreed to help or i could have left you to the treemen no one ever said you were evil cupelix sturm persist ed subtle you are and very much concerned with getting your way if you could have gotten out of your prison by sacrificing kit myself or the gnomes i dont think you would have dallied long in giving us up cupelix spread his wings and coiled his legs to spring into the air be at ease master brightblade no one need be sac rificed we shall all see krynn again i promise chapter gnomeplans the gnomes divied into two groups the first group which consisted of stutts flash wingover sighter and birdcall was to study the problem of breaching the walls of the obelisk the other four gnomes had as their task the safe removal of the contents of the tower including cupelix himself the cloudmaster sturm and kitiara the micones returned with the night half gone and on the dragons orders leveled out the dirt rampart theyd piled up some days before because there were more than fifty of the powerful giants at work the land around the base of the obelisk was soon smooth and passable again kitiara and the breaching group as they called themselves went out side to survey the structure the walls at ground level are marble no less than eleven feet thick stutts reported reading off his calculations with the best steel picks and mattocks it would take a dig ging gang days and days to hack through all that rock and furthermore said sighter my analysis of the stone shows it to be extremely hard much harder in fact than regular marble its glazed glazed hmm kitiara looked to the obelisks high pin nacle a flickering red aura wavered about the top she reminded the gnomes of the violent discharges theyd seen when the sun came up all that energy must have hard ened the stone she said stutts reached to touch the cold stone between the wide courses was a band of shiny black colder even than the scarlet marble metal he mused metal for mortar really said flash what sort of metal is it stutts scraped at the sixinchwide band with his thumb nail the color did not scratch off its soft he said lead perhaps sighter and birdcall examined the mortar too birdcall confirmed with a twitter that the metal was indeed lead pretty solid said wingover slapping the wall i have an idea kitiara announced the gnomes looked at her as if shed said she was growing another head well i do here it is ive seen lots of castle waills fall to besieging armies and they are often as thick if not as hard as these walls the besiegers brought them down by tunneling under the foundations and undermining the wall consternation spread on the faces in the breaching party why thats bloody simple stutts declared why didnt we think of that asked flash all we have to do is dig away the sand said wingover they fell on their knees and crimson dirt flew kitiara shaking her head went inside to the ship sturm was on his feet leaning on a crutch that cutwood had fashioned for him he was keeping aloof from the preparations but he asked what the gnomes had decided to do were digging now kitiara remarked she appropriated a wrecking bar from the store of tools and returned to the frantic diggers sturm hobbled after her the gnomes carved out a crater deeper than their own height in a very short time below grade the foundation of the obelisk showed no alteration from the structure above more massive marble blocks joined with lead kitiara cleared them out of the hole and swung the iron bar at the stone wait said wingover thats solid she drew the bar back in a deep arc and struck the foun dation with all her extra strength there was a crack like the breaking of a great tree branch and a single chip of mar ble flew off it landed at sturms feet a lost petal from a stone rose he stooped awkwardly to pick it up look at the bar said flash kitiara held up the inchthick rod the flat prying edge had mushroomed out from the blow and the whole bar was bent in a graceful curve kitiara braced the bar against her knee and tried to straighten it but only succeeded in bend ing it the opposite way she tossed it aside in disgust i tried to tell you wingover said as kitiara climbed out of the hole the base of the tower rests on the roof of the cavern its solid stone there are holes through it said sighter the micones holes we went through them ourselves to visit the egg chamber mining wont work stutts said sadly were no more able to bore through the foundation than the upper walls kitiara clambered out of the hole and dusted off her hands and leggings her breath showed white in the night air its up to you gnomes now the little men faced each other for a few minutes and talked in their lightning patter finally stutts poked his face out and said well have to consult with our colleagues do you have a plan asked sturm the rudiments of one but we need the wisdom of our fellows inside the gnomes trooped off sturm pushed the wrecking bar around with his toe that much strength is hard to control isnt it when kiti ara didnt answer he went on are you getting stronger all the time kit is that why you move as if the world were made of glass she snatched up the iron bar and holding it in one hand steadily bent the rod into a right angle using only her thumb she dropped the bar and said is that what you wanted to see cupelix and the humans sat attentively on one side of the obelisk which is to say sturm and kitiara sat on crates while the dragon sat on his ledge above them the gnomes sat on a bench facing them cutwood had rigged up an easel which was shrouded with a loose cloth stutts stood by the easel a long pointed stick in his hand lady gentleman and beast he began the dragons gusty sigh sent stuttss beard whipping over his shoulder lady gentleman and dragon stutts said smoothly may i present the obelisk escape auger mark i he whisked the cloth away revealing a large sheet of parchment tacked to the easel a fantasticlooking device was drawn in brown ink supported by a massive timber frame was an enormous helical auger a grossly enlarged version of the tool used by carpenters to bore holes according to the figures on the parchment the bit alone was fifteen feet wide the optimum diameter stutts said to allow cupelix to pass through very ingenious said the dragon eyeing the peculiar cre ation with evident skepticism how is it operated by this eccentric crank here the pointer tapped the drawing all eleven of us will man the crank according to our best estimates the auger will bore through the wall in sixtyseven hours of work thats almost three days kitiara said on lunitari only two days and nights said sighter never mind that sturm said where will the steel come from to make the bit where will you get the timber to build the frame ah said cutwood except for the bit blades and a few points of stress such as the bearings all parts of the obelisk escape auger will be made of wood what wood why the hull and frame of the cloudmaster ai said kitiara she let her head fall forward into her hands sturm sighed if you dismantle the flying ship how will we get home he said with as much patience as he could muster the gnomes looked from one to another surprised very faintly fitter said something about putting the ship back together once the dragon was out no said kitiara youll never get the timbers back together as a ship you fellows must do better not to worry stutts rejoinedhe whipped the elabo rate drawing of the obelisk escape auger off the easel beneath it was another equally detailed diagramthis i am proud to say is the obelisk arch doorway widener said stutts reasoning that the doorway represents a natural point of entry we came up with this alternative scheme these screw jacks again the pointer flew to the diagram will be fitted in the doorway by tightening them with these turnbuckles here here and here the rams will be forced apart cracking the door wide open it took exactly one minute for sturm and kitiara to demolish the arch doorway widener mostly for the same reasons as the obelisk escape auger lack of quality materi als there was just no wood or metal to be had except what the cloudmaster and its crew had brought with them it seems hopeless said the dragon with a profound sigh never vowed wingover he pushed the bandages up from his face so that everyone could see his eyes they had turned completely black wingover shielded them futilely with his hands you see what has happened to me he said i no longer can shut out anything i have to sleep face down to the ground where i count strata all the way down to the moons core he pointed with a thumb at cutwood next to him my good colleague hears every grain of sand rubbing against another roperigs hands are almost sealed together arent they roperig rainspots clothes are beginning to rot from the constant damp all the rest of us have problems too but we wont leave until we solve this problem sturm heard these words carefully he said as long as we are discussing our gifts let me show you this he tore the cloth bandage from his leg where two nights and a day before there had been an ugly gaping wound there was now only smooth unscarred skin the same magic that makes trees walk and fight has healed my wound i did not ask for it to be done but it has convinced me of one thing this is no place for mortals ill lend my aid dragon for that reason alone the longer we remain on lunitari the more the magic will affect us since my companions have resolved to help you my resistance only impedes their progress welcome to the struggle said cupelix wingover kitiara said if you can see into the ground we stand on can you see any deposits of iron or copper anything we can use alas lady nothing this entire moon seems made of sand granite and more sand sand said sighter musing he hopped down from the bench and strolled to the far wall and back he traced a stubby finger along the lead seams where two marble cours es lay on top of each other sand he shouted sand sand sand look out said rainspot hes slipped his gears sighter took a deep breath and strode to stutts with grave dignity sand he said is the one thing this world provides in abundance yes uh yes said stutts sighter snapped his spyglass open and laid it across his colleagues palm what are lenses made of glass roperig said promptly sighter whirled pointing to the adhesive gnome and what do the lunitarians make their weapons out of glass said sturm and kitiara together yes and what is glass made of sighter cried no one said a word finally fitter said sand but sand glass lenses dont you see we can cast a giant lens and with that concentrate the rays of the sun into a burning beam the focal point of the rays will be far hotter than the melting point of lead so the wall will come tumbling down said cupelix do you think you can do it nothing is for certain sighter said with ungnomish cau tion well need a continuous source of heat for the melting of the sand what about the heat source we found in the caverns said sturm would that be hot enough for you hmm magma is more than hot enough to melt sand said flash the micones can gather any amount of sand youll need said cupelix shall i get them started wed better push the cloudmaster outside stutts said well need the floor space in here to work cupelix summoned two ants and the gnomes harnessed them to the bow of the flying ship the micones pulled the creaking craft through the doorway and out to the smoothed soil the gnomes carried the detached wings and laid them in the shadow of the hull cupelix fell into a lengthy telepathic commune with his minions and soon the micones were mustered in the valley they surrounded the obelisk on all sides an army of mute clicking creatures intent on a voice no one heard but them without as much as a nod the three score giant ants turned their backs to the tower and began to plow the soil with their heads furrows of dull red sand turned up to the starry sky and other micones pushed the sand into convenient mounds sighter showed off his hasty design for a burning lens twentytwo feet in diameter and five feet seven inches thick in the center do you think it will work kitiara said if the lens can be cast in one piece the polishing shouldnt take long theres plenty of sand after all said sighter he rolled up his parchment drawing and tucked it under his arm outside the micones slaved on the ground trembling against the force of their unyielding heads chapter the lens to refine the sanb awd eliminate any impurities the gnomes resorted to washing it poor rainspot was hauled up to the lowest of cupelixs ledges and instructed to make it rain for several hours the floor of the obelisk grew quite grimy with wet sand and sodden vegetable muck the dragon descended from his sanctum with the news that clouds were forming up there too a gentle rain was falling feet above rainspot midget streaks of lightning flick ered through the hollow shaft glancing off the marble like minnows in a racing brook far from being annoyed cupe lix was delighted with all this he had read of the mysterious thing called weather but had never experienced it it doesnt naturally occur indoors sturm said sourly he was wet to the skin as the gnomes had appropriated his oil cloth slicker to make buckets for the clean sand micones were fitted with pairs of big buckets which were draped like saddlebags on each side of their globular thoraxes they scuttled down to the cavern with their loads where sighter birdcall and flash were preparing the vat in which the sand would be melted this like the mold in which the lens would be cast was simply and roughly made from mud the disintegrated plant fluff that coated the entire red moon mixed with dry dirt made an admirable clay the gnomes in the cavern slapped together a wide tub of mud reinforced with just a few laths borrowed from the cloudmaster at about dawn the vat was ready with a micone as a draft beast the gnomes shifted the vat into place over one of the volcanic vents then they sat back and waited for the clay to harden flashs head popped up through one of the holes in the floor were ready for the sand he cried roperig moved closer to the hole and said whats hold ing you up nothing said the mudcaked gnome i said were ready for the sand he means whats holding you up in the hole said sturm oh im standing on a micone the giant ant was cling ing upside down under the opening and flash was standing on its belly the whole crew save kitiara and rainspot descended to the great cavern there the train of micones saddled with hoppers of sand stood in a line like a cavalry troop on parade each time birdcall poked his head through the toothed passage in the rock and whistled an ant detached and followed him farther in past the micones birthing chamber the gnomes labored over the glass vat sturm watched as they emptied bucket after bucket into the baked mud bowl spreading the sand evenly across the bottom and sprinkling in various unnamed powders theyd brought down from the flying ship the heat in the chamber was terrific on cupe lixs orders the micones had broken open one of the magma flues allowing more of the rock to well out of the ground the giant creatures seemed unaffected by the heat the vat was precariously perched above the magma pool on piers of stones the little men walked nonchalantly along the edge of the fiery pit hardly noticing painful death could claim them if they slipped not for the first time sturm felt an admiration for the gnomes they were foolish and trying at times but in their element they were indomitable the sand grew hot and steamed in a process too sudden and subtle to see the hard grains softened into a smooth mass first bright orange and then nearly white as the heat rose to its highest level the glare was too much for the gnomes and sturm and they drew back to the cooler end of the chamber how will you get the melted glass up to the lens mold asked sturm we shant said stutts mopping his florid pink brow were casting the rough lens down here even as he said this micones laden with fresh mud clicked into the chamber birdcall who seemed to have a particular rapport with the ants directed them to dump their loads in a natural hollow in the cavern floor birdcall and sighter fell to with trowels sweeping the crimson mud about in smooth swirls forming a round bowl when the mud was firm though not entirely dry stutts and sighter conferred everyone waited for the word the gnomes sturm the micones even kitiara and cupelix in the obelisk above stutts tapped his fingers together and talked far too fast for sturm to follow sighter nodded four micones took up positions around the glass vat birdcall sat astride one ant warbling and waving his hands to conduct the giants efforts the micones clamped their pincer jaws on the studs the gnomes left poking through the mud walls and lifted the vat easily off the magma furnace supported by twentyfour individual legs the vat was maneuvered over the rocky floor to the mold are you ready stutts called to birdcall the whistling gnome gave the high sign and stutts called out you may pour now two ants lifted the vat up whitehot molten glass slipped over the rim of the vat and splashed heavily into the mold torrents of steam billowed out as the water was driven from the stilldamp mud higher stutts cried tip the end up higher parts of the vats outside began to crumble and break off the molten mass of glass surged against the weakening walls cracks developed in the lip keep them back sturm admonished stutts the gnomes in their boundless urge to see everything had crowded close to the lens mold if the vat broke open they would all be swamped with melted glass stutts pushed his colleagues to a safer distance the vat was vertical now and the last gobs fell into the mold there was more molten glass than the mold would hold so it lapped over the edges as the micones lowered the vat to horizontal the cracked sides fell to pieces phew said stutts his forehead was raw from constant wiping that was none too soon the mold being solidly bound by rock was holding well already the edges of the lens were turning red cooling from incandescent white bubbles popped in the center as steam forced its way out from the mud liner sighter frowned at the sight hadnt planned on that he said bubbles will distort the glass it doesnt need to be of the first water said stutts how long will it take to cool asked sturm the shim mering heat from the poured glass was mesmerizing fully cooled twelve hours or more said sighter itll be hard a lot sooner than that but we cant crack the mold until were sure the core is cooled maybe we could get rainspot to sprinkle it with water cutwood suggested no it would shatter into a million pieces with nothing else to do but wait sturm and all the gnomes but sighter left the cavern there was still some daylight left on the surface and the gnomes wanted to get the cloudmaster back into flying trim the flying ship posed proudly on the level valley floor and once the wings were restored to the hull it gained a majestic air the obelisks long shadow moved swiftly around with the rapidly setting sun ready for wing test wingover hallooed in the voice pipe a squawky muffled yes returned from the engine room engage engine kitiara sensed a deep grinding vibration under her feet the wing tips lifted flexed and started down again but balked an agonizing shudder ran the length of the ship the wings hung down where they were and quivered no no shut off wingover yelled the door of the din ing room banged open and flash emerged coughing wingover stuck his head out the wheelhouse window what happened he said that stupid birdcall installed the armature switch upside down when i fed lightning to the engine it flashed back through the cable and burned out the storage jar we have no power flash exclaimed close to tears kitiara grabbed the gnome by the shoulder and spun him around no power she said what does that mean it means we cant fly home chapter the invaders gloom settled in with the night birdcall was sound ly berated for his sloppy work but once the reproaches were finished the gnomes went right back to their usual goodnatured camaraderie kitiara was furious sturm resigned the dragon tried to lighten their spirits be of stout heart he admonished if worse comes to worst i shall fly to mt nevermind and notify the gnomish authorities of your plight they will of course mount a res cue expedition assuming i get clear of this tower that is yes assuming that sturm said he went away to com miserate with the gnomes kitiara sidled over to where cupelix was perched can you hear me she said in the lowest of whispers certainly the dragons telepathic voice caressed her mind when we get you out i want you to take me with you she muttered and leave your friends behind you said yourself the gnomes on sancrist can be notified it may take some months but theyll try to reach their col leagues marooned on lunitari since the ruin of the cloud masters engine kitiara had begun to understand how the dragon felt trapped on this moon also once cupelix was free she feared he would not linger on lunitari while the gnomes struggled to repair the flying ship her dreams of partnership would be over and what of sturm someone has to look after the little fellows she said dont think me uncaring im just eager to be gone from here fortunes to find wars to win not to forget showing you around too yes of course still i wonder dear kit if you could fly and i could not would you leave me here also she grinned up at the huge creature youre far too big for me to carry she said supper was a subdued affair and they all turned in soon after eating cupelix withdrew to his tower top and the humans and gnomes slept scattered about the obelisks now spacious floor sturm was awake he lay on his back staring up into the towers black recesses it well matched his mood was this his ultimate fate to be marooned on the red moon forever the dragon had said something about things never dying here would he live on and on bitter lonely forever denied his heritage as a knight the dark space above him closed in the odd displaced sensation flooded over him yet again he sat up and heard crickets chirruping in the bushes a canopy of trees almost closed out the sky of krynn sturm could see the sculpted outline of a high wall in the distance and knew that it was castle brightblade he drifted across the nightcloaked land to the castles main gate to his surprise torches flamed in the side brack ets and two imposing figures in armor flanked the entrance he moved in closer uh what goes said the guard on sturms right he lev eled his poleaxe directly at sturm he can see me sturm held up his hand and said i am sturm brightblade this castle belongs to my father fool nothing goes said the other guard put axe away i say is the righthand guard took a torch down from its holder and stomped toward and through sturm by the blazing pine knot sturm saw the guards face it was not human nor dwarven elven kender or gnome the pro truding snout was green and scaly and toothy horns sprout ed from a wide mouth his eyes were vertical slits like cupelixs draconians he was furious that these ugly brutes were in his ancestral home sturm pushed through the gate into the bailey there were wagons and carts parked there groaning with swords spears battleaxes and sheafs of arrows the draconians were turning castle brightblade into an arsenal but for whom in the great hall he found a crackling fire built camp stools were set up before the hearth and a trestle table was covered with scrolls sturm hovered by the table the scrolls were maps primarily of solamnia and abanasinia steel rang on stone and sturm started forgetting that he could not be seen a tall powerful figure strode out of the dark hall he was helmetless his face hard and expression less long smooth locks of white hair fell over his shoul ders the man crossed between the fire and the table and sat on one of the stools he set his helmet down beside him sturm had never seen such a helmet before tusks protruded from the visor and the whole form was shaped like the head of a predatory insect come and sit down said the man whom sturm thought of as the general a second figure stirred in the shadows he it did not come into the circle of firelight a thin hand sleeved in dark gray reached out and dragged a camp chair into a dimmer corner of the hall i forget you do not care for fire said the general pity fire is such a useful force fire and light shall be my undoing some day rasped the robed figure i have seen my demise in flames i am not eager to meet my end just yet not with so much to do replied the general he perused the map of solamnia when do you hear from your mis tress that red wing will be here the arms grow rusty in this damp old castle patience merinsaard the dark queen has well gauged the temper of the land and she will set the armies in motion when the auspices are most favorable the general snorted you speak of signs and portents as if they determined everything its the charge of the lance the shock of cavalry that decides the fate of battles and empires sorotin the hidden sorcerer chuckled a moldering decayed sound that chilled sturm men of action always like to think that their fate is in their hands it comforts them and makes them feel important merinsaard said nothing he leaned to the hearth plucked out a burning brand and thrust it toward his shad owed compatriot sturm got a glimpse of a face that sur prised him it mightve been handsome but for its deathly paleness and the evil that emanated from burning eyes set in it the magicuser sorotin groaned and shrank away from the flame merinsaard tossed the burning twig after him mind your tongue merinsaard said and remember i command here if you displease me or fail in your necro mancy ill feed you to the fire myself the sorcerer panted raggedly with fear be not too bold my lord for one is here now who watches and is no friend to our cause sturms heart skipped a beat what said the general he reached under the pile of maps and pulled out a viciously curved dagger a sticky coating of greenish poison showed on the cutting edge where is this intruder where standing between us great general he did mean sturm merinsaard slashed through the empty air you fool theres no one there not in the fleshly sense my lord he is a spirit from far away very far by the aura he emits perhaps as far as lunitari that is far indeed get rid of it whatever it is said merinsaard kill the spy no one must know of our plans calm yourself my lord our visitor is not here to spy i sense that this was once his home dotard no one has lived here for twenty years the last lord of the castle was hounded out of the country true enough mighty merinsaard said sorotin shall i bring this spirit here in body or bid him go back where he came sturm struggled with his feelings for a moment he tried to will himself to solidity so that he might challenge these evil men but he could sense no change in his state can he speak to the living of this world asked merin saard i think not he is too attenuated by the vast distance he has traveled i sense no knowledge of magic in him then hurl him back to his wretched body and keep him there i have no time for ghostly ambassadors sturm saw a glint in the darkness he heard a sweet chime the sorcerer had struck the silver bell he carried hear me spirit as i ring this magic bell thrice you will depart from this castle this land this world never to return the bell chimed once argon twice hrar three times in the name of the dragonqueen every muscle in sturms body jolted at once he literally felt as though hed fallen from a height but he was awake and in his body in the obelisk on lunitari he sat up breathing hard and shaking the entire vision had passed without any new clue to his fathers whereabouts that was distressing enough but the machinations of this merinsaard and sorotin in castle brightblade filled him with out rage someone must be told the alarm must be given he roused sighter from his blanket wake up he said lets have a look at that lens of yours now said the gnome through a jawcracking yawn yes why not its been hours a micone was standing by as per orders and it allowed sturm and sighter to mount for a ride down to the casting chamber the whole cavern was filled with dripping patches of mist the giant ant didnt like the dampness at all once or twice its barbed feet slipped on the vitreous wall making sturm cling tightly to the rope harness and causing sighter to cling even more tightly to sturm the lens was still ruby red but very little heat radiated from it sturm tapped his fingers lightly on the edge of the mold the fourth tap broke loose a chunk of mud now dry and brittle the inward sloping side of the lens was exposed sighter stood on his toes to examine the glass no he muttered out came the magnifying glass he peered into the scarlet casting broken gears and slipped pulleys he exclaimed the lens is worthless what the glass the glass its nearly opaque it cant be sturm said sighter handed him his magnify ing glass sturm peered into the lens all he could see were millions of tiny white bubbles trapped in the solidified glass that and the dark red color made it obvious that the lens would be useless for focusing the suns rays into a burning beam perhaps when its polished sturm said hopefully never sighter sputtered youd have more chance try ing to focus sunbeams through a cedar tree he threw his pocket glass on the rocks and stamped it until it shattered whats the matter asked a voice stutts and the others had also come to inspect the giant lens sighter bitterly explained that their work had been for nothing the crest fallen gnomes ringed the mold and stared down at the lens in disbelief worthless said fitter useless said roperig a waste of time and effort cutwood added now what do we do asked rainspot try to explain it to the dragon said the crushed sighter no one said much about the lens failure except cupelix the otherwise genial wellmannered dragon had a dragon sized tantrum thundering incompetents witless inept a tremen dous telepathic fools made them all flinch do be still kitiara said severely a dragon your age carrying on like a spoiled child do you think the little fel lows guarantee success sturm watched the effect of kitiaras chiding on the beast cupelixs ears which had been flattened on his head slowly lifted and the jets of acrid vapor stopped puffing from his nostrils i had such hopes cupelix allowed well it looks like were going to be here a long while kitiara said so we shall have plenty of time to think up new ways to get you out of this marble cell mollified the dragon prepared them a cold repast and retired to his high sanctum to meditate on his problems sturm kitiara and the gnomes went outside and stared at the cloudmaster poor lifeless hulk an immobile derelict gracing the red turf of lunitari sturm put a hand to his chin and pondered what he understood from wingovers explanation of how the cloud master flewi the wings were useless without lightning to turn the engine all that remained was the halfempty bag of ethereal air he said what about the ethereal air what about it asked wingover sturm rather abashed to be making technical arguments to the gnomes said bellcrank used to say that when full the ethereal air bag was sufficient to lift the ship with all due respect to our late colleague the lifting power of the bag is much less than the total weight of the hull of the ship stutts said they lapsed into silence once again sturm thought some more kitiaras eyes narrowed as she too concentrated what if we lightened the ship said fitter what said sturm what said stutts wingover sighter rainspot and flash what said cutwood roperig and translated bird call kitiara grinned her offcenter grin something she did all too rarely these days lighten the ship she declared now thats something i can understand she picked little fitter up and shook him so hard that his teeth rattled then she boosted him up to the rail the gnome went below deck and opened the side boarding ramp the other gnomes swarmed aboard fired with the zeal of desperation before sturm and kitiara had even mounted the ramp loud crash es and splintering creaks sounded within the ship they may rip everything out stuim said wryly deck celing planks and posts the gnomes formed a chain from the lowest deck to the top rail and began flinging everything they could lay their hands on over the side they ransacked their cabins and brought forth all their personal belongings sturm was astounded by the mass and variety of it blankets books tools clothing barrels pots plates rope cord twine sail cloth a crate of ink pens bars of soap two harmonicas a fiddle a flute sixteen pairs of boots all sized too big for sturm much less any gnome that ever lived gloves belts and a stuffed billy goat that cutwood kept in his cabin some items couldnt be manhandled to the upper deck kitiara found roperig and fitter lying prostrate beside a large keg we cant budge it roperig panted ill do it she turned the keg around to see if there was a bung attached liquid sloshed inside and a single word in gnomish block letters was stenciled on the staves kitiara said whats in this anyway fitter squinted at the label oil of vitriol must have been bellcranks he said a slight quiver invaded his chin vitriol eh she recalled the mess that the acid had made of bellcranks excellent mouthless siphon back on krynn why hasnt it eaten through the keg oh its probably lined with some resistant coating said roperig he wiped the back of his neck with his hand and it promptly stuck there oh dry roti kitiara drummed her fingers on the barrel head hmm thats worth knowing so this stuff dissolves some things but not others yes roperig tried to free his hand and succeeded in sticking his other hand to his own arm double dry rot i will oil of vitriol dissolve marble she asked maybe it doesnt affect many glassy substances what about lead yes definitely fitter stop fidgeting and help met she left the two gnomes locked in a stmlle against roperigs adhesive palms the gnome she sought stutts was outside the ship sorting through the heap of goods that the gnomes had discarded kitiara pulled stutts free of a pile of clothing and said i know how to get the dragon out what said the gnome how bellcranks vitriol she gestured vaguely back toward the ship theres a whole barrelful of it on board if we let it eat up the mortar in the lowest course of the obelisk the walls are bound to collapse arent theyd understanding gradually lightened stuttss face then it hit him full force hydrodynamicst it will work the gnomes heard stuttss cry and rallied around with extravagant hand motions and frequent compliments to kitiara stutts explained her idea the gnomes positively exploded with excitement it was so simple so elegant theyd been fixated on a mechanical solution and here the human woman had come up with a chemical answer sturm heard the commotion and hustled down the ramp he agreed that the plan was a good one but saw one impor tant consideration what happens to cupelix when the tower falls he asked not even a brass dragon can with stand tons of marble masonry falling on him there has to be a way around that said kitiara why dont we ask the dragon said sturm thats what they did at first the dragon was sulky and refused to come down from his aerie kitiara scolaed him for his petulance and still there was no response then she alone heard i dont wish to be disappointed again were not making any promises she proclaimed loudly we have a new scheme that were pretty sure will work but it has an awkward problem freeing you may kill you a unique solution i would not be a prisoner any longer oh shut upi if you cant come down and talk to us like a reasonable dragon well just bring the obelisk down around you kitiara jerked her head to the others lets go were not really going to use the vitriol with him still up there are we maam said fitter why not you want to see if itll work dont you she replied but the dragon will get hurt cutwood chewed thoughtfully on the tip of his pencil i wonder he mused what the tensile strength of dragon hide and flesh is sighter produced some vellum we can do a calculation chapter breakthomough the cloudmaster freed of several hundred pounds of useless weight buoyed a bit off the ground wingover had a fine time lifting the big ship up with his hands roperig advised staking the hull to the ground so wooden stakes were pounded into the turf and the flying ship was secured besides stacks of food and water there isnt a scrap of anything left on board stutts reported most of the interi or partitions have been tjrn out too what about the engine asked sturm it must weigh as much as the rest of the hull put together it does said flash not without pride then we must dump it not our beautiful enginel there isnt another machine like it anywhere sturm could make no headway so he went to where kiti ara cutwood and sighter were studying the matter of dis solving the obelisks lead mortar well need ladders to reach those higher courses kitiara was saying scaffolding would be better sighter argued theres some scrap lumber from the ship how will we get the vitriol up there asked cutwood glass vials and beakers said sighter that stuff will eat through anything else sturm cleared his throat loudly kitiara said impatiently speak up sturm the ship is almost light enough to float but birdcall and flash wont agree to discard the useless engine he reported so what take a hammer and knock it to pieces she said thats the way to get things done cutwood and sighter looked at her in some surprise and sturm prudently refrained from commenting instead he asked if theyd heard from cupelix not a peep hes being very stubborn sturm went inside the vast open floor was deserted the ship the gnomes and their gear had all been removed only the three gaping holes for the micones were the same cupelix he called cupelix i know you can hear me come down his voice echoed through the empty space kitiara is going ahead with this vitriol scheme of hers shell bring this tower down about your ears just to prove she can do it he felt the faint but distinct touch of the dragons mental voice l trust you brightblade you tell the truth a mans truthfulness is his duty to the measure sturm replied i made a bargain with dear kit if she would advocate my cause to the gnomes i would accompany her for two years upon our return to krynn sturm frowned for what purpose i know not but it was important enough that she was whilling to abandon you and your friends to reach krynll you must be jesting kitiara wouldnt do that t i am very serious brightblade when she believed the ship ruined she pressed me to take her away when i left why are you telling me this her ambition worries me every living thing has an aura have you heard this it is true the aura reveals the spark of life that animates the body without yours for example is a golden yellow strong radiant and unvarying but kitiaras is fiery red and streaked with black the black is growing in her sturm waved dismissively i dont know what youre talking about kit is strongwilled and impetuous thats all you are wrong my virtuous friend jcome down dragon and help us with your release thats all i have to say sturm marched out the gnomes had the lowest stages of a scaffold lashed together sturm noted the brightening sky sunrise he said better come inside till after the tower discharges there was a rumble overhead the sun peeked over the valley wall and the early rays hit the marble tower the rumble deepened the first crackles of lightning were arcing from the obelisks peak the whole valley shook with the force another brief day began on lunitari you dont have to shake the tower so i intend to join in the group broke into relieved laughter gives us a lot of credit doesnt he kitiara said they streamed back to the unfinished scaffold stutts explained in great detail the vitriol plan to cupe lix the dragon was not sanguine about it he was more interested in taking the top off the tower but there was not enough wood to erect a scaffold five hundred feet high its too bad you cant go down to the cavern said wingover youd be safe there who says i cant the dragon answered the holes in the floor arent big enough to let you pass the gnome objected then we shall make them bigger will this corrosive of yours eat through marble ah were not certain said stutts i wish id studied alchemy more closelyl then i could tell you why dont we try a more direct approach lets apply vitriol to the floor stones offered cupelix the flying ships erstwhile china milk pitcher was pressed into service as a vitriol vessel they breached the keg head and dipped the pitcher in until it was full careful said stutts kitiara nodded tightlipped as drops fell from the pitchers lip and landed sizzling on the ground leaving black smoking scorch marks kitiara walked very slowly to the obelisk gnomes danc ing attendance on each side prattling on with useless but wellintended advice sturm hurried ahead to clear the way cupelix had come all the way down to the floor to be as close as possible to the experiment holding the pitcher at aims length kitiara dribbled a thin stream of vitriol on the rim of one of the micones holes the corrosive hissed and sizzled villainously and after a few minutes the bubbling stopped whewf said kitiara this stuff stinksl wingover tapped the doused area with a slender mineral hammer the stone has definitely decayed he announced though not by much it would take gallons and gallons of oil of vitriol to eat through this thick marble we havent got an endless supply kitiara reminded him fifty gallons thats as much as we have then its picks and mattocks said sturm hand work i knew it would come down to sweat and blisters eventually the gnomes returned outside to work on extending the scaffolding around three sides of the obelisk kitiara and sturm found the heaviest digging tools the gnomes had and set to work it was hard going the floor was tough and the tools were small what amounted to a fullsized pick for a gnome was little bigger than a hand adze to a human it was hot inside the tower as they chipped away at the marble kitiara stripped off her cloak and mail shirt and worked in her light blouse sturm set aside his armor and quilted tunic too cupelix did what he could to make their labor easier he fanned them with his broad wings and flushed the chips and dust out of their way he told clever stories that hed garnered from his reading sturm discovered that cupelix was a devotee of the elven bard quivalen soth the dragon knew the song of huma by heart even more interesting was a lost cycle of songs by quivalen about huma and the silver dragon kitiara had not heard the tale of humas love for the silver dragon and was fascinated a true tragedy said cupelix fanning a breeze over them that a dragon should descend from its noble natural form to that of a mortal tsk tsk sturm traded his small pick for an equally small sledge hammer it hit the floor with a crack that stung his hands you think dragons are better than people he asked without a doubt dragons are bigger stronger have more abilities and powers live longer do more and have unequaled mental qualities said cupelix what can humans do that dragons cant walk out of here said kitiara leaning on her pick the fanning wings missed a beat then started up again too bad you cant change into a man even briefly sturm said then all this digging would be unnecessary alas shapeshifting has never been a talent known among brass dragons there are texts on the matter that of the elf wizard dromondothalas being the most famous but my library is completely lacking in such books kitiara kicked a wide wedge of stone loose it slipped through the hole seconds later a distant thud revealed that it had landed in the cavern below she said where did your books come from what books i have i had from the beginning the maker of the obelisk provided them i believe so that the keeper of the new lives would have some knowledge of the wider worlds beyond lunitari there are tomes of history geogra phy letters medicine alchemy and magic said sturm bringing the hammer down half the scrolls are related to magic agreed cupelix in two hours work the humans succeeded in widening the hole by several inches all around cupelix expressed sat isfaction with their progress but kitiara was disgusted at this rate well be too old to lift the tools by the time we cut a hole big enough for you she said to the dragon i think were going about this the hard way sturm said his alms and back ached and his head pounded from the strain of working so hard in the thin air i remember the masons at the castle cleaving stones as thick as this floor with one or two blows let me have some cool water and ill think about it a while he took the water bottle from kitiara and slumped by the near wall kitiara went out to her unconcealed surprise the gnomes had already wrapped their rickety platform around three sides of the obelisk to a height of six feet boards posts tool handles and beams were pegged and lashed together wherever space allowed how goes it she said turning away and almost bowl ing over stutts were ratcheting right along he said are you making any progress on the floor very little im afraid she fingered her left biceps all this extra muscle power is going to waste if i swing too hard only break the tool i see stutts squinted at the midday sun only two and a half hours of light left lets have a look at your progress they entered and found sturm kneeling on the floor star ing at the water pitcher he looked from it to one of the areas where theyd scarred away the polished surface then he stared once more at the water pitcher cupelix had hopped back up to his perch what are you doing kitiara asked sturm i remember how they did it sturm replied the masons at castle brightblade used to quarry out enormous blocks of granite with just four men how did they do it asked stutts they bored holes along the block they wanted to free and drove in thick wooden pegs then they soaked the pegs in water the swelling wood cracked the stone stutts looked at sturm and blinked thats ingenious kitiara said but can we bore holes in the marble we have some steel augers said the gnome with your strength and the right approach yes easily stutts ran back to the pile of goods discarded from the fly ing ship and returned with a large brace and bit he explained quickly how when boring stone it was impor tant to keep the bit cool and lubricated sturm would trickle water around the bit while kit turned the brace they tried it and bored through the twentyinchthick floor in thirty minutes flushed with success they bored more holes connecting the first micone hole with the sec ond about twelve feet away using this line as the base of a triangle sturm and kitiara angled out into the main floor space they were well into the triangles second arm when the sun went down and the gnomes came streaming in flash announced that the scaffold was done then find a bit and join in kitiara said more water sturm the handle feels hot it was well past midnight when they finished thirtysix holes in all cupelix worked up an especially bracing repast with thick soup and lots of bread they had mined four bits and kitiaras hands were blistered rainspot offered her some soothing salve but she declined lets get on with it she said get the pegs the gnomes did the peg work they cut lengths from the remaining scrap wood and sturm banged these home with the sledge everyone cleared out of the triangle area formed by the bored holes kitiara filled a canvas bucket with water and handed it to sturm your honor she said your idea he took the handle this is for the good yeoman of cas tle brightblade he answered dousing each peg in turn refilling the bucket and dousing them all again nothing happened well said kitiara bracing one hand on her hip it takes a while said sturm the pegs have to swell wed better have some more water sturm poured water on the pegs three more times the tops of the pegs clearly swelled above the level of the floor but little else appeared to happen wonderful kitiara said sarcastically she loped out snorting with illconcealed contempt one by one the gnomes gave up and went outside sturm shook his head it worked for my fathers masons he said masonry is an arcane art cupelix said its secrets are not easily adapted by the untrained then the floor went crack near the hole that sturm and kitiara had so laboriously enlarged a hairline crack reached from the first peg across the marble to the peg on the other side of the hole sturm laid the sledge on his shoulder and hurried to the scene he was about to smite the splitting stone when he heard another crack and a fissure slowly zigzagged from the tri angles far point to its base sturm raised the hammer no wait said the fascinated dragon the line between the micone holes jumped apart and sturm started backward a section of stone larger than any theyd released by hand broke free and plunged into the cavern below that opened the floodgates and the entire triangle collapsed into the cavern with a rush the obelisk rang with the concussion as a ton of marble hit the resonant floor a hundred feet down kitiara burst in the gnomes at her heels great suffering gods what was that she cried sturm dusted his hands and pointed dramatically to the gaping hole in the floor the way is clear for cupelix to descend he said the gnomes were all for going on and bringing the obelisk down that very night but sturm and kitiara were both exhausted and begged off cupelix supported them saying that he had many items he wished to save from destruction before the tower was demolished he flew up to his private aerie and left the mortals to take their ease the gnomes quieted after the initial rush of success wore off they burrowed into the cloudmasters jetsam and slept their tinny snores sounding like an operatic war between bullfrogs and crickets sturm stretched out on a blanket surrounded by stacked crates the sky was bril liantly clear as usual and he counted stars to make himself drowsy kitiara sauntered around the crates asleep she asked huh no not yet she slipped down opposite him her back braced by a boxthis may be our last night on lunitari sounds good to me you know ive been trying to figure out how long weve been here in local terms weve seen about fortyfour days and fortyfive nights how long does that make it back home i dont know he admitted suppose we get back to krynn and find that years have passed he almost laughed at the idea but stopped himself sturm couldnt prove that years hadnt elapsed while they were on the red moon there are so many old tales about humans who went off to elf realms and returned in what they thought were a few months to find their children grown and their friends dead of old age kitiara said sturm thought she was just musing over possibilities but then he realized that she was seriously concerned what are you afraid of kit he asked gently the fiveyear reunion its important that i not miss it and tanis yes do you intend to go back to him kitiara shifted uncomfortably no thats not it we didnt part on the best of terms and i want to patch things up before she started to say something but stopped before what sturm prompted before i begin my travels with cupelix so she was owning up to it are you giving up trying to find your father and his people my father always said his family had disowned him and his forever she said much as id love to ride up to their front door and spit in their faces partnership with a dragon promises to be more exciting she shrugged i say to the abyss with the uth matars the quiet interval grew long and sturm felt his eyelids droop with sleep he was about to nod off when kitiara said sturm if you see tanis before i do will you tell him im sorry and that he was right sturm was too much of a gentleman to inquire what she had to be sorry about he promised upon his honor as a brightblade to bear her mes sage back to tanis halfelven chapter the obelisk falls the dragon caled to them rousing them from their slumber the gnomes bounced up eager to be about their business sturm rubbed his eyes and looked about kitiara was not in sight he stretched and hunted around for a drink of water as he was gulping a cool drink kitiara appeared she tossed aside a handsaw and said whats the beast yelling about i couldnt quite make it out he wants us to get on with the demolition said sturm fine im ready all the glass and porcelain jars and cups they had were to be used to pour vitriol on the lead mortar seams the gnomes lined up like soldiers mugs and cream pitchers in hand like swords kitiara gave them a mocking salute and told them to bide their time inside cupelix was nervously hopping from one massive leg to the other all my books and manuscripts are safe he said the micones have transferred everything to a safe place in the cave there was no longer reason to delay cupelix put his threetoed feet into the hole and curled his tail up close to his chest it would be a tight fit get your wings in sturm said closer thats it good thing i am a svelte example of my race cupelix said his massive body was in the hole only his head showed inside the obelisk i believe i shall miss this place he said go on kitiara shouted cupelixs head disappeared he fell forty feet before getting his wings open he hit the cavern floor with enough force to rock the tower on its foundations but to the dragon it was a minor tumble he telepathed his good health and told the mortals to proceed cupelix is safely in the cavern sturm said to stutts when they were outside stutts put two fingers to his mouth and blew a shrieking whistle begin pouring he cried the gnomes spaced around the three sides of the obelisk applied vitriol to the lead wisps of noxious vapor coiled off the walls choking all the gnomes but roperig and fitter who had invented caustic smoke filters for noses and mouths mark ii keen observers would have recognized the filters as being made of old bandannas and suspenders right now clear off the top level and pour on the sec ond stutts called convenient beakers of vitriol were posi tioned on the lower platforms of the scaffold flash climbed down the spindly collection of poles and planks he swung to the second level and promptly kicked over his beaker oil of vitriol streamed down the scaffold eating away the wood and rope lashing with as much vigor as it consumed the lead look out said sturm the poles under flash sagged and came apart the gnome wavered back and forth on his toes and toppled from the planking kitiara gauged his fall and stepped below him she held up her arms and caught the plummeting gnome thank you so much he said certainly she asked the walls of the obelisk steamed with vitriol vapor streaks of black showed on the flawless red marble where the liquified lead ran down the corrosive fluid ate into the joints between the courses of stone with alacrity and half an hour after starting the gnomes were down to the fourth level of their scaffold it looks like its weeping sturm observed of the struc ture but i dont think its suffering much damage the effect should be cumulative said stutts without the lead support each course will sag under the weight of the upper blocks by the time we get down to ground level the whole structure may be leaning as much as three feet out of plumb the remaining fourth wall cannot support such an imbalance and the obelisk will collapse the winepurple sky segued into claret red sturm frowned sunrise he said will the discharges affect the process how can they not kitiara replied they may bring the whole thing down on our heads she went to the foot of the scaffold and yelled get a move on dawn is coming there were accidents gnomes being gnomes with the imminent sunrise pressing on them vitriol burns falls and sprained ankles multiplied the stars faded from view as the heavens changed from claret to rose the usual streak of meteors ricocheted from one horizon to another and the intense stillness was broken by a stirring in the air that kiti ara felt though sturm could not hurry the gnomes tumbled off the scaffold like mice from a burning building the platform groaned and curled up wherever the vitriol dropped on it and the lower third of the obelisk was coated with sickly gray steam run sturm said run as far and as fast as you can he grabbed cutwood who was slow and dragged him off his feet kitiara scooped up roperig and flash the last ones off the scaffold and they ran past the point at which theyd left cloudmaster on the unscarred side of the tower as far as where the valley began to rise in elevation a hor rendous grinding noise filled the valley overpowering even the first crackle of the morning discharge from under kitiaras arm flash twisted around to see the blocks are giving way he cheered the grinding sound arrested their mad flight everyone stopped turned and stared bolts of blue lightning sizzled from the obelisks peak not to the distant cliffs that defined the valley but into the dry red soil a hundred yards from the monuments base the obelisk leaned appreciably and whole courses of stained marble tumbled to the ground it seemed for a moment that the tower might withstand the loss of those blocks but the weight of the upper reaches was too much for the under mined base the fivehundredfoot obelisk slowly grace fully leaned over stones shattered under the unbearable pressure the top broke apart in midfall the stones separat ing with the tumult of a hundred thunderstormsblocks twelve feet long six feet high and three feet thick hurtled to the ground gouging out deep craters in the soft turf the obelisk lay down like a falling tree pieces weighing several tons bounced off each other breaking crushing and com ing to rest at last as though too tired to leap any farther the great pyramid capstone crashed with blue and white sparkles dancing around it willothewisps rose above the swelling cloud of dust and vanished silent witnesses to the mighty structures fall there was silence the rumble died away my said stutts solemnly it worked said wingover did it ever work said rainspot suddenly kitiara gave out a loud long whoop of tri umph yaaahaaah she cried leaping up into the air we did it we did it sturm found himself grinning from ear to ear but as the members of the little party moved slowly toward the fallen giant an awed silence settled over them large blocks stood upright buried to a third of their length sturm looked on and marveled the shape of the obelisk proper could still be recognized as a heavier concentration of broken masonry sturm climbed to a pile of blocks near the erstwhile base of the obelisk the dust thrown up by the collapse had risen making a dull red ring in the sky he had an odd thought would stargazers on krynn be able to see the ring of dust it was miles and miles across and darker than the surface soil would the astronomers see it theorize about it make learned discourses on the cause and meaning of it everyone gathered at the base a dome of blocks had fallen over the hole in the obelisk floor and only a very small person could wriggle through the resulting gap kiti ara called for fitter go in and call to the dragon she said see if hes all right i cant get him to answer yes maam fitter scampered into the arch of stone in answer to his call they all heard a telepathic success hes alive stutts said well have to clear these stones away sturm said get clear little fitter im coming out fitter crawled out and the mortals drew back the mass of blocks flew apart and cupelix emerged his massive face was split by a wide smile huge teeth gleamed dully in the light as he flung back his head and expanded his chest rejoice mortal friends i am free he cried you had no trouble shifting those blocks kitiara said none at all my dear kit when the structure was bro ken so was its protective spell cupelix inhaled deeply sucking in the tepid air in dragonsized gulps it is sweet is it not the first breath of freedom no one was sure what to do next i suppose said stutts reflectively we ought to prepare to depart ourselves he folded his hands over his round belly that is assuming the cloudmaster can rise on its ethereal air alone im confident kitiara said sturm shot her a question ing look she winked and smiled just like the old kit then moved away toward the top end of the wreckage without warning cupelix unfurled his wings to their fullest extent never in the close confines of the obelisk had he been able to spread his wings in all their glory now he groaned with pleasure at the stretching of his leathery wings cupelix launched himself in the air with one spring and flapped leisurely luxuriously gaining height with each pass over the site of his deliverance he rolled stalled hov ered wings bellying full and emptying in rapid sweeps he climbed so high that he was a golden dot in the sky and dived with such wild abandon that it seemed certain he would crash into the obelisks ruins sturm turned his gaze from the joyous dragon and real ized that everyone had left him kitiara had nearly reached the top of the ruins and the gnomes were scattered through out the debris measuring arguing and enjoying their tri umph immensely kitiara found amidst the rubble the wonderful tapes tries she had seen in cupelixs private aerie they were tom to shreds but here and there whole portions were identifi able cupelix hadnt bothered to save the moldering tapes tries and she wondered why she found a patch from the assembly of the gods tapestry the patch with the face of the dark queen on it the woven face was nearly as wide as kitiara was tall but she rolled the fragment up and tied it around her waist as a belt she felt she had to save it care for a ride said cupelix kitiara looked up the dragon hovered above her the sweep of his wings sending dust swirling around the ruins kitiara thought a brief moment then said warily yes but no acrobatics certainly not cupelixs mouth was wide in one of his unnerving grins he landed and kitiara mounted his neck she took hold of the brass plates and said ready he launched them straight up and kitiara felt the breath snatched from her body with slow lazy sweeps of his wings cupelix circled the ruins and the flying ship kitiara again felt the exhilaration shed experienced those first few minutes on the cloudmaster when the whole of krynn had been spread out below her with the wind whipping her short hair kitiara grinned down at sturms astonished face hai sturm brightblade haiyah she waved one hand at him you should try this the gnomes set up a cheer as cupelix banked into a steep climb sturm watched the dragon soar away with kitiara he felt a strange uneasiness he wasnt afraid for kit there was something about the image of a human riding on the back of a dragon that chilled him deep inside well im glad theyre enjoying themselves sighter said sourly but can we get underway ourselves sturm waved to kitiara and called for her to come down after several mock diving attacks at the rubble the gnomes and sturm cupelix landed and kitiara jumped to the ground thank you dragon she said her face was flushed she pounded sturm on the shoulder and said well lets get going no need to stand around here all day the humans and the gnomes trekked to the tethered fly ing ship in a moment of creative vandalism flash and bird call had agreed to sever the useless wings and tail so the ship presented an austere clipped appearance kitiara was smiling and humming a marching song pick up your feet soldier she said linking an arm in sturm s what are you so pleased about he said the ship may not take flight believe that we will fly and we will ill think lightheaded if it will help she laughed at his morose tone the ship was reloaded with what food and water the gnomes collected and a few items for emergency use spare lumber tools nails and so forth sturm bent down and saw that the keel was firmly set in the red dirt the gnomes filed up the ramp sturm and kitiara paused each with one foot at the ramp the other on the soil of the red moon will anyone ever believe we were here he asked tak ing in the panoramait all seems like a wild dream what difference does it make kiiiara replied we know what weve done and where weve been even if we never tell another soul well know they walked up the ramp and hauled it up behind them when the hatch was secure sturm went up to the main deck kitiara disappeared into the hold cupelix swooped in beat his wings hard and alighted gently beside the cloudmaster glorious my friends i am reborn no born for the first time freed of the stone sar cophagus in which i dwelt i am a new dragon henceforth i am no longer cupelix but pteriol the fly er pleased to meet you pteriol said fitter wed best be off interrupted sturm while its still light yes yes said stutts listen all of you each fellow is to stand by the mooring ropes when i give the word slip the knots and let us rise tell them to pull in the ropes theyre all weve got advised roperig and pull in the ropes stutts said everyone ready the gnomes piped their readiness very good all hands slip your ropes they managed to get most of the lines loose at the same time though rainspot at the stern had a hard knot and lagged behind the ship rolled sideways the hull planks groaning were too heavy wingover shouted the distinct sound of splitting wood erupted below their feet the starboard side rose throwing everyone to port sturm banged the back of his head against the deck house then with an earpiercing crack the cloudmaster righted itself and lifted into the air halloo called pteriol youve lost something sturm and the gnomes filled the rail they were rising very slowly but from a height of fifty feet they could see a wide section of the hull planking and a mass of dark metal on the ground the engine flash cried birdcall uttered a hawkish scream of dismay they rushed from the ladder down to the hold near the deck hatch flash fell into the arms of kitiara she was whis tling a solacian dance tune quickly said the excited gnome weve lost the engine we must go back and get it kitiara stopped whistling no she said no no i dont know anything about aerial navigation but i do know this ship was too heavy to get off the ground so i arranged for the extra weight to stay behind howd you do that sturm asked sawed through the hull around the engine she said its not fair its not right flash said blinking through angry tears birdcall made similar noises sturm patted the two on their shoulders it may not be fair but it was the only thing to do he said gently you can always build another engine once you get back to sancrist stutts and wingover squeezed past kitiara and started down the ladder wed better inspect the hole said stutts the hull may be seriously weakened not to mention drafty drafty was an understatement a yawning hole twelve feet by eight feet showed where the lightningpowered engine had been my said stutts peering down at the receding ground they were already a hundred feet up this is rather inter esting we should have built a window into the bottom of the ship from the first keep that in mind sturm said who kept well back from the hole well have to patch this somehow if only to keep ourselves from tumbling out he wasnt too surprised by kitiaras deed it was typical of her quick direct and a bit ruthless still they were off the ground at last pteriols brass scales glistened as he passed under the ship the dragon circled in a rising spiral wings flapping slowly the cloudmaster moved very slowly westward away from the fallen obelisk wingover stepped forward until his toes were off the edge of the hull timbers he pushed back the swath of bandages that shrouded his head his disturbing black eyes focused on something far below what is that he asked pointing at the distant ground i cant see anything stutts said theres someone down there walking a treeman suggested sturm it is daylight too small it walks differently more like wingover scrubbed his eyes with his small fists no it cant be what what it looks like a gnome like bellcrank sturm frowned bellcrank is dead i know i know but it looks just like him his ears have this funny shape wingover brushed his own ears but now hes red all over there was a shout from the upper deck sighter had spot ted the walking figure with his spyglass sturm stutts and wingover hurried up the astronomer gnome identified the figure as bellcrank too fitter shivered is it a ghost he asked plaintively hardly sighter responded it just stumbled on the turf then hes alive said cutwood we have to go back for him flash roperig and birdcall all seconded this notion stutts cleared his throat to get their attention we cant go back he said sadly weve no control over direction or altitude rainspot began to sniffle and cut wood dabbed his eyes on his sleeve isnt there anything we can do sturm asked just then pteriol flashed by the port side banked steeply and rolled over the top of the bag everyone on the cloud master felt his telepathic whoops of delight the dragon the dragon can fetch him said rainspot he might said kitiara youre his favorite you ask him said cutwood the brass form arrowed past the starboard rail the wind from his wings stirring the drifting ship into a slow eddy hai dragon cupelix suffering gods i mean pteriol kiti ara yelled the dragon swept under the stern and raced along the underside of the ship he cant hear me she said peeved big dumb brute hes drunk with freedom sturm said cant blame him after all the centuries he spent in that obelisk were losing bellcrank fitter cried as the ship floated over the valley cliff walls the tiny red figure shrank from even wingovers power ful sight and was lost in the scarlet terrain the gnomes watched wordless as the cloudmaster drew away from their lost friend amid quiet weeping cutwood broke away and went below deck he returned shortly with a hammer a saw and a pair of pliers he threw these items overboard why did you do that i sturm said cutwood turned his round pink face up to the taller man bellcrank will need tools he said sighter stutts and wingover left the rail flash and bird call lingered a while longer then they too departed roperig pulled fitter away rainspot and cutwood stayed even as the valley fell farther and farther behind its so hard to believe rainspot said bellcrank was dead we buried him perhaps theres some truth to what the dragon said kiti ara offered cutwood asked what she meant he said noth ing ever died on lunitari you mean that wasnt bellcrank down there just some thing that looked like him i dont know im no cleric or philosopher she said the dead have been known to walk even on krynn with all the magic rampant on lunitari it doesnt seem too strange that bellcrank should return no one could answer her kitiara turned up the collar of her cloak and went below leaving rainspot and cutwood alone at the rail they flew over many of the places theyd crossed on foot the field of stones alive with growth by daylight and the oreless range of hills from above the shortlived jungle had a disquieting appearance the plants writhed and undu lated like swells in a windtossed sea even that grew boring after a while and sturm went below to see what was being done to the hole in the ships belly he almost choked when he saw what the gnomes were doing cutwood and fitter were lying on their bellies on thin lengths of planking stretched across the gap lessthan inchthick wood was all that stood between them and a long long fall rainspot and flash passed them other short er pieces of wood to nail crosswise in this knockabout trialanderror style the gnomes were repairing the hole from the stern kitiara looked down at the red moon three hours aloft and the land had fallen away far enough to lose its surface features now it was just a rolling bolt of red velvet no more real than the permanent black of the sky cupelix for kitiara scoffed at the dragons new name was behind and slightly below them the continuous effort of flying was tiring him out and he no longer swooped and danced through the air now it was long slow steady work how do you do it how do i do what said kitiara how do you in the ship fly so effortlessly the ethereal air holds us up she said thats all i know shall i fetch stutts so he can explain no gnomish explanations give me a headache she laughed me too a thin veil fell between the ship and the flying dragon clouds said kitiara were getting pretty high my chest aches i am not used to so much exertion its a long way to krynn how long many days at this rate maybe weeks did you think krynn was just over the horizon there is not much sympathy in your tone my dear youre not master of your own world anymore take this as a lesson in discipline you are a hard woman lifes hard said kitiara she turned away from the rail the air was growing steadily colder and thinner and she needed to don her gloves in the former dining room now without table or benches kitiara slipped into her boots she did up her leggings and drew the string tight around her calves the old knot passed by in the drawstring shed lost weight no matter she thought ive traded ten pounds for the strength of ten men kitiara tied a bow in the drawstring distracted she pulled too hard and one end fell out making a hard knot she stared at the result puzzled not for mistying the bow but because she hadnt snapped the string like a cobweb no one was around kitiara grasped the woven silk cord in both hands and pulled harder it did not break chapter little red man on high the air was as clean and sharp as an elvem sword without the constant beating of wings there was no sensation of movement aboard the cloudmaster quite to the contrary it seemed as if the sun stars and lunitari itself were moving while the ship stood anchored in the sky the effect of this mode of flight was curiously timeless only the windup clock in the wheelhouse showed that time was passing at all after they had been airborne almost five hours lunitari was far enough below them to resemble a sphere again of krynn there was no sign and that worried the travelers sighter assured them that their home world would appear as lunitari turned on its course through the heavens we have a better than even chance of reaching krynn he said severely as the largest body in the heavens it naturally has the greatest attraction for us just as it attracts a greater amount of sunlight than lunitari still we must be wary and release the proper amount of ethereal air when the pro pitious moment comes so that we can descend homeward the strange motionless flight bothered sturm so he kept below deck there the hull and deck creaked as a proper ship should and it comforted him hed always been fond of sailing ships the patch over the hole in the hull was finished but it was not the finest example of the shipwrights art planks and laths and blocks of wood were nailed and mortised over the gap wherever they could fit the gnomes strolled across the patch without a care but sturm did not trust it to support his weight he prowled on past the patch to the forward end of the ship which at sea would have been the forecastle the hull there was barren of gear and all the interior parti tions had long since been ripped away there was nothing forward at all but beams and planking it was like being inside the skeleton of some great beast all bones and no flesh sturm ascended the fore ladder into the wheelhouse there was no wheel for there was no tail to be turned by a wheel all the finely wrought brass fixtures had been ripped out for scrap or merely to lighten the ship only stuttss chair remained though its plump velvet cushions were gone kitiara was there sitting on the deck gazing out the win dows at nothing are you ill kit do i look ill no sturm sat down on the deck opposite her kitiara looked away toying with the drawstring of her leggings sturm are you still having visions no not for some time do you remember them she asked of course i do what was the first one why it was the when i saw a perplexed look came over sturms face something about my father his high forehead became a mass of wrinkles as he tried to recall what hed seen what about the last one kitiara asked he shook his head there was a sorcerer i think weve lost it kitiara said softly the effect the natural magic of lunitari had on each of us youve forgotten the substance of your visions im losing my strength here look she took out her dagger and planted her thumbs on the back of the blade fingers knotting kitiara slowly bent the slim steel blade to a blunt angle you seem very strong to me said sturm yesterday i couldve folded this blade in half with two fingers she tossed the bent dagger aside were better off without the powers sturm said thats easy for you to say i like being strong powerful mighty fighters live and die in every generation the past ones forgotten by the present the present destined to vanish in the memories of the future virtue not ferocity or cun ning are what make a fighter a hero kit kitiara straightened her stooped shoulders and said reso lutely youre wrong sturm only success is remembered nothing else matters but success he opened his mouth to reply but the wheelhouse door flew open and a blast of icy air rushed in cutwood swathed to the top of his pink bald head in flannel rags and quilting posed dramatically in the doorway one stubby arm flung out pointing astern the dragon he said cupelix is faltering the whole crew was assembled aft when sturm and kiti ara joined them the concentration of weight made the ship tip steeply back stutts said spread out we cant all stand in the same ppplace wingover shook his head you stuttered he said never mind that now said kitiara cupelix was far back and nearly fifty feet below the rising cloudmaster he was holding his wings out in glide posi tion flapping only once every few seconds his long neck was arched down his head low the dragons large hind legs normally held tightly against his belly when in flight likewise dangled limply cupelix cupelix can you hear me kitiara called through cupped hands yes my dear you can make it beast do you hear me you can make it no done in too weak the dragons tail dropped making him waver flap damn you dont give up remember youre a brass dragon she cried this is your chance cupelix your chance to come to krynn cant fly not meant to be dear kit sturm called is there anything we can do tell others i live tell others to visit lunitari we will shouted rainspot bring books bring philosophers bring his thought trailed off cupelix was flapping weakly now kitiara grabbed wingover by his collar why cant he fly why does he keep going down she demanded the air is too thin his wings arent big enough to sup port him this high said the wideeyed gnome sturm broke her grip and put wingover back on his feet the gnome exhaled gustily cloudmaster was able to stay aloft because we had two sets of wings and the ethereal air bag to hold us up the dragon has neither farewell kitiara flung herself at the rail the crimson orb of luni tari looked no bigger than a dinner plate against the light colored moon the dark figure of the dragon moved an agonized silhouette cupelix the illnamed pteriol was going down wingover gave his colleagues a running com mentary on the dragons failing flight the massive muscles in the dragons back writhed in ferocious cramps his wings spasmed sending him into a heartstopping plummet with great effort and much obvious pain he regained his balance and slowed his descent trailing behind him in the wind was a steady swirl of brass scales torn off by his terrible exer tions cupelix dont leave me our bargain kitiara cried desperately my strength is fading do you hear i need you our plans sturm took hold of her shoulders and pulled her firmly away from the rail her fingers clutched at the smooth wood farewell dear kit was all they heard and the tickling touch of the dragons telepathic voice was gone sighter climbed up on the rail and scanned the moon with his spy glass he could see nothing goodbye dragon he said sighter snapped his telescope shut and slipped back to the deck the little men quietly dispersed kitiara sobbed against sturms chest im sorry he said her tears unsettled him more than cupelixs tragic failure she pushed him away suddenly and snapped stupid beast he and i had a deal our plans our great plans sud denly ashamed kitiara scrubbed the tears from her cheeks and sniffed loudly everyone leaves me theres no one i can rely on sturm felt his sympathy for kit drain away no one you can rely on he said coldly no one at all when she didnt answer sturm turned his back and left kitiara alone cupelix defeated by the heights he had hoped to con quer glided down in a wide spiral to the moon that had been and always would be his home his flying muscles burned with fatigue and the invidious cold of the upper air numbed his heart and soul he skimmed over familiar land scapes now cloaked in night until the cliffs of his valley dropped away beneath his hanging feet striking heavily cupelixs horned head plowed into the red dust he raised his head and sneezed a voice said bless you thank you replied the dragon weakly wait who said that a diminutive figure appeared from behind a pile of goods left behind by the gnomes it resembled a gnome itself except that it was as hairless as an egg and colored red skin eyes clothes everything i said it said the little red creature its a common wish to express when someone sneezes i know that said the dragon peevishly he was far too tired to play gnomish games who are you i was hoping you might know said the little red fellow i woke up a day ago and ive been wandering since cupelix raised himself on his hind legs and carefully furled his wings the bending of his joints caused him con siderable pain and he hissed louder than a hundred snakes does it hurt asked the red man very much i saw a bottle of liniment over there perhaps that would help a small red hand went to the dark red lips though im not sure what liniment is never mind little red man said cupelix fetch it if you would is that my name if you like it it is seems to fit doesnt it the little red man trotted off to find the bottle of dr fingers efficacious ointment he stopped and called back whats your name cupelix said the dragon he was here to stay all right but at least he had someone to talk to all things considered it wasnt too bad a state of affairs little red man cupelix called across the valley would you like something to eat chapter highgold the second voyage of the cloudmaster was very different from the first the engines incessant turning and the great wings wafting had given those on board a sense of passage of activity the silent drift of the ship now sup ported only by the ethereal air was not like that a perva sive lethargy invaded everyone on board there was little to do in the way of managing the ship and the less there was to do the less anyone cared to do the gnomes quarreled too in the past they had traded scoffing remarks and mild blows with equanimity ten sec onds afterward no one remembered or cared but now cooped up in the bare hull of the cloudmaster the gnomes lost their generous natures roperig and fitter squabbled over the correct way to store the small supply of rope they had left cutwood grew deafer and deafer as he adjusted to his normal level of hearing flash yelled at him all the time and sighter yelled at flash for yelling wingover had a slap ping match with birdcall that left red welts on both their faces for hours and rainspot poor gentle rainspot sat in the tween decks and wept stutts sought out sturm things are sseriously wrong he said my ccolleagues are behaving like a band of gully dwarves they are bbored now theres no great task to bc accomplished llike toppling the obelisk what can i do about it asked sturm we mmust give them a task something that will ttake their minds off the slowness of our ppassage what sort of task stutts said pperhaps sighter could enlist their help in nnaming all the stars they would only argue sturm replied hmm we ccould make a batch of mmuffins no flour sturm reminded him try again well you ccould get seriously ill oh no your good colleagues would want to cut me open and find out what was wrong try again the gnomes shoulders sagged in defeat that was mmy last idea this is serious sturm thought who ever heard of a gnome out of ideas you know he said smoothing out his mustache perhaps there is some way to make this ship move faster without an enengine ships girdle the world without engines sturm observed how do they do it lets ssee stutts twined his fingers together and thought hard oars ssails draft animals on shore magic here he traded a disapproving look with sturm muscleturned ppaddle wheels towing by whales or sea sserpents a light kindled in his pale blue eyes excuse me i mmust confer with my colleagues good man said sturm he watched the gnome hurry away almost skipping with delight a cheer penetrated the deck from below as stutts explained his notion to the other gnomes thumps and squeaks told only too well that the gnomes idleness had vanished sturm smiled he went looking for kitiara she was not in the dining room so he went below the gnomes were gathered in the berth decks aft cabin he peeked in the doorless doorway to see flash and wingover sketching madly on the deck planks with lumps of charcoal no no sighter was saying you must increase the degree of camber relative to the angle of incidence what a lot of goat cheese any fool knows you have to decrease the planar surface argued as rapping his fist on the deck yes any fool sturm withdrew the gnomes were happy again he descended the short ladder to the hold it was bitterly cold down there since the flimsy patch in the hull scarcely kept out the wind much less the cold it was there that sturm found kitiara perched on one of the stout hull ribs sipping from her water bottle you look comfortable he said oh i am care for some said kitiara she handed sturm the bottle he raised it to his lips but before taking a swallow smelled the sweet tang of wine he lowered the bottle where did you get this cupelix made it for me wine of ergoth sturm took the smallest sip it was extremely sweet and as the few drops flowed down his throat they burned strongly his face must have reddened for kitiara chuckled at him deceptive isnt it tastes like syrup at first then it kicks like a beestung mule he gave the bottle back to her i thought you preferred ale he said kitiara drank ale is for good times good meals and good company sweet wine of ergoth is for melancholy hours loneliness and funerals sturm knelt beside her you shouldnt be melancholy he said were on our way home at last kitiara leaned back against the curving rib sometimes i envy you your patience other times it sets my teeth on edge she closed her eyes do you ever wonder what the rest of your life will be like she asked only in a very basic way sturm replied part of knighthood is acceptance of the fate the gods mete out i could never think that way i want to make it happen thats what hurts so much about lost opportunities i had strength and now its fading i had a dragon for an ally and now hes gone too and tanis kitiara shot him a cold look yes damn your honesty tanis is gone too and my father she swirled the bottle around it was almost empty im tired kitiara said ill make a resolu tion sturm and you can be my witness from now on i shall contemplate plan reason and calculate whatever serves my purpose will be good and whatever impedes me will be evil ill not rely on anyone but myself not share with anyone except my most loyal comrades in arms ill be queen of my own realm this she patted herself on the leg and not fear any thing but failure she turned her rather bleary eyes to him what do you think of my resolution i think youve had too much wine he rose to go but she called for him to stop its cold down here she complained so come up to the berth deck kitiara held out her arms and tried to stand she didnt get very far before sagging back to the hull rib im better off not trying she said come here sturm stood over her she grabbed hold of his sleeve still quite strong kitiara easily pulled sturm down to her level he tried to protest but she pushed him back against the curving planks and nestled in close just stay here a while she said eyes closed to keep me warm so sturm found himself lying very still in the coldest part of the ship kitiara nestled under his left arm her breathing grew soft and regular he studied the face showing under her furtrimmed hood kitiaras tan had lightened over the past weeks but her dark lashes and curls seemed out of place on so rugged a warrior her dark lips were parted slightly and her breath smelled of sweet wine the gnomes presented their grand design for improving the drifting cloudmasters speed a few hours later in the former dining room birdcall had drawn the whole plan on the wall in chalk and charcoal sturm sat on the floor listen ing attentively kitiara leaned on the wall several feet away tightlipped she was experiencing ill effects from the wine as you can see wingover began our plan calls for rig ging the cloudmaster with sails on each side of the ethereal air bag that and trimming the hull with the excess of weight well in the bow should increase our speed by ah how much did you estimate sighter the astronomer gnome studied the scribbles on his shirt cuff sixty percent or to about twelve knots what will you make the sails out of asked sturm what clothing we can spare you and mistress kitiara will have to contribute what you have as well ahem well if there are no more questions what about spars and masts and rigging sturm said cutwood waved his hand to be recognized wingover relinquished the floor i thought of an answer to that the gnome said importantly with chisels and planes well be able to slice off long pieces from the beams and rails of the ships these lashed together will serve as spars let me tell about the rigging said roperig i know about it too cutwood complained let roperig tell it ordered fitter cutwood flopped down in a snit we have some store of rope already roperig said and some cord twine string thread get on with it said wingover silly knowitall muttered cutwood these can be braided into whatever thickness of rope we need roperig snapped his fingers and sat down only fit ter applauded his report shall we get to it sturm asked bracing himself to rise they formed the cloudmaster sewing circle on the dining room floor a fairsized heap of clothes grew up in the cen ter around which everyone sat it was not an easy process sturm could not sew and kitiara steadfastly refused to even attempt it confining her contribution to slitting the seams of the sacrificed clothes with her bentbladed dagger of the gnomes only roperig and fitter not too surprisingly proved to be adept sewers they were so adept in fact that they sewed the clothes they were wearing into the sail which then had to be cut apart again after a break for food and rest the work resumed some hours later it was hard to judge time in the constant night the ragged flimsy sails were done cutwood and flash had by this time chiseled out spars from the largest beams in the ship it was time then to rig the cloudmaster for sail they tied the ends of the spars to the air bags rigging and the sails stretched between them the sails were simple rec tangles that overlapped the deck rail by several feet once they were set the flying ship did come slowly about in a new direction how do we steer this thing kitiara asked ordinary ships had rudders the cloudmaster had none well have to manage by trimming the sails sturm said he was cheered by the sight of wind filling the funny patch work sails they shifted all their loose baggage forward and the fly ing ship surged ahead with noticeable vigor it was possible to feel the wind now out on deck and the ship rolled fore and aft like a rocking horse kitiara was a bit green from the motion the rigging creaked and stretched the stars and moons coursed by at an increasing rate clouds loomed ahead and the ship quickly overtook them streams of warm mist flowed over the ship thawing the frost that coated the windows and ports and made the upper deck treacherous they sailed through the clouds for only a short time when they burst through the wall of white a glorious sight greeted them the brilliant blue globe of krynn hung before them a bau ble of silver and glass it looked so small and fragile this far away a marble in a childs hand other cloud banks towered around them but by luffing the sails the cloudmasters crew weaved the ship through them some of the banks flickered with lightning rainspot eyed these with longing he hadnt experienced any real weather in months unlike kitiara he was genuinely pleased to have lost his gift no one should always walk about in a rainstorm he had decided an odd thing happened as they steered cautiously through the maze of storm and cloud faint echoes of thun der rolled by and in the dying claps sturm heard another sound a distant bleat like the call of a trumpet did you hear that he said to flash who was by his elbow no said the gnome what was it the noise sounded again louder and nearer thats it said sturm funny it sounds like a before flash could finish a green and gold mallard hurtled into the sail above their heads a duck flash said hastily the mallard was a goodsized bird and it halftore the flimsy sail from the twig spars duck and spar tangled and fell to the deck at flashs feet halloo weve caught a duck he shouted what did he say roperig asked he said to duck fitter replied face down on the deck no by reorx hes snared a duck cried wingover flash folded the sail back and the mallard poked its head out its beady black eyes regarded the cloudmasters crew with pure hostility wonder where it came from said rainspot an egg dumbhead said cutwood hold on to it said kitiara ducks are good eating just as her strength had faded as they left the influence of luni tari so too had the spear plants lost their magical variety of flavors they had become rubbery tasteless kitiara smacked her lips at the thought of crisply browned duck meat not much meat for eleven sturm said if only there were more ducks ahoy roperig sang out over the starboard rail black against the gray clouds came a great flock of ducks bring us about sturm shouted theyll wreck us if they hit usl gnomes scampered into the juryrigging collapsing the sails on the port side the ship heeled away from the flock swinging under the air bag like a pendulum some of the mallards hit the hull and bounced off a few swept across the deck squawking loudly they veered and banked in panic thudding on the sides of the deckhouse fortunately none hit the air bag or the sails this is crazy kitiara declared what are ducks doing so far from home flash stood up from behind the railing the first duck was still firmly under his arm maybe this is where ducks go when they migrate he posited interesting theory sighter said do they just fly around for three months or do they have a destination kitiara hobbled the duck with a loop of twine around its feet and pinioned its wings with a length of cord fitter watched her every move unnerved she said would you rather do this no i just dont want you to hurt it hurt it i plan to eat it oh no its so pretty those green and gold feathers yes and itll look even better roasting on a spit she said the ducks whod been lying senseless on deck chose that moment to rouse and take wing quacking loudly in sec onds they were all gone save for the mallard that kitiara had trussed up it honked forlornly at its departing com rades fitter stared at the mallard in his hands with two large tears rolling down his face he held the duck out ro kitiara kitiaras hands closed on the duck and a loud sob came from fitter suffering gods she exclaimed keep it fitter enjoy it yourself oh i will fitter dashed to the deckhouse door ive already named him highgold because he flew so high and has gold feathers the door banged shut behind him so instead of a duck dinner we have another mouth to feed said kitiara dont worry sturm said the duck is one of us flying too high and too far from home chapter the lost caravel it was hard to say just when the change occurred it came on slowly with no dramatic oscillations or warnings somewhere in the billowing white clouds the cloudmaster stopped rising toward krynn and began falling toward it sturm asked sighter just how this worked but the astrono mer mumbled something about density of matter in rela tion to air and left it at that sighter plainly didnt understand the effect himself nevertheless the blue face of krynn moved from over their heads to under their feet the closer they got to their home world the livelier the winds grew and the faster they flew we cant land too soon for me kitiara commented if i have to eat pink spears and drink water much longer toad stools will sprout from my ears some txt missing the air grew warmer and wetter while the warmth was appreciated the denser moister air proved a hardship for them all after being used to lunitaris thin air the weighti ness oppressed them for a time it was hard to do anything strenuous by the gods sturm remarked panting as he helped cut wood and flash trim the port sails i havent been this winded since flint and i had to flee the forest dwarves after tasslehoff borrowed some of their silver day and night fell into a more even rhythm again and sturm found himself sleeping longer and more soundly as the days slipped by sighter recorded that the cloudmaster had been airborne for nineteen days and estimated that it would make landfall in two more days the sky changed from black to blue and the horizon filled with clouds through puffy gaps they could see for ests fields mountains and seas below they were still high but at least they had a sense of solid ground beneath them again the morning of what was to be their last day aloft dawned sultry and wet the sails hung from their spars and dew stood in puddles on deck a clinging mist held to the flying ship and nothing was visible ten feet beyond the rail halloo wingover shouted halloo cant see a thing kitiara reported squinting hard i cant even tell how high we are sturm said the cloudmaster seemed to be adrift in a box of wet fleece stutts appeared with the rope and grapnel we should ddrop this over the side he advised it m may hook a tree and ddrag us to a stop he lowered the grapnel from the bowsprit and tied it off when he returned amidships kitiara asked him when they ought to open the bag and release the ethereal air only when wwere certain were about to lland she stared at the wallowing bag overhead the dirty can vas sack had shrunk steadily as it got warmer now it hung against the rope netting rolling about furtively like a caged beast trying to escape kitiara fingered the hilt of her bent dagger no more nonsense she thought when conditions look good ill open the bag myself wingover still entwined in the rigging pointed off the starboard bow fire he cried sighter clicked open his telescope and swung it toward the orange glow far off in the mist his mouth dropped open for a second then he lowered his glass and shut it you dolt he said to wingover havent you ever seen a sunrise before what sunrise said kitiara a sunrise could only mean they were low enough to the ground for the sun to appear as the ball of fire they remembered and not as the yellow disk it looked like from between the red moon and krynn the sun waxed hotter and brighter and the fog dispersed a thousand feet below lay only ocean as far as every eye could see nothing but oily green sea the salty smell rose to greet them as the sun heated up the water a north wind pushed them along at an idle six knots as the day wore on the humidity rose and all the furs and cold weather gear came off the gnomes stripped down to sus penders and trousers the deck thumped with nine pairs of bare pink feet as protection from sunburn fitter made them all bandannas from their shirts and soon the gnomes looked like a band of pirates shrunk to half size kitiara joyously discarded her heavy clothes keeping only her riding breeches and a leather vest sturm alone refused to shed his longsleeved tunic and boots kitiara noted the dark sweat stains on his chest and arms dignity she decided could be an uncomfortable burden by angling the sails they were able to drive the ship down closer to the sea the grapnel dipped and leaped from wave crest to wave crest slinging back from the impacts sighter worked hard with his astrolabe to determine their location without a compass and accurate charts he could make only a rough estimate but he tried the deck from the door of the wheelhouse aft to the stern post was cov ered with his figures sweat collected in his bushy brows and dripped annoyingly from the tip of his nose kitiara and sturm surveyed the vast calculations and finally kit asked well were on krynn said sighter kitiara counted to twen ty silently my best guess is were somewhere in the sir rion sea either four hundred eight hundred or twelve hundred miles from sancrist four eight or twelve hundred sturm said lacking a compass its very hard to be precise sighter flicked off a drop of sweat that had stubbornly clung to his nose im certain its one of those multiples of four hundred kitiara threw up her hands wonderful we may cruise into thalan bay in four days or we may starve to death try ing to reach an island a thousand miles away i dont think well starve said wingover oh what makes you so certain theres a ship he said quietly pointing out to sea sighters precious figures were trampled in the rush to the rail off the port they saw bow masts and snowy sails pok ing above the horizon out came the telescope kitiara plucked it from sighters grasp what he said but she already had the glass to her eye the ship was a twomasted caravel of uncertain origin there was no figurehead or name scribed on the forecastle the mastheads were bare of pennants or flags though the deck was clean and the brightwork shined can you make out where shes from asked sturm no kitiara said cant see any crew try in the rigging theyre running with the wind so theres bound to be somebody aloft i looked theres nobody to be seen the cloudmaster slowed as it entered a lower stratum of air the direction changed and the patchwork sails luffed and flapped impotently while sturm and four gnomes saw to resetting them kitiara studied the unidentified ship pirate maybe or smuggler she mused there were plenty of reasons to hide a ships name few legitimate sturm sturm she called what is it could we catch that ship and board it he came to the edge of the deckhouse and shaded his eyes to look down at her why they might have food and fresh water it was a powerful argument sturm was as sick of beans and lunitarian fungi as the rest of them i suppose we could he said the grappling hook is still out well have to be careful not to snarl their rigging or rip their sails the unknown ship drove on with all sails set there was no one on deck and as the cloudmaster flew around to the ships port beam kitiara could see that the caravels wheel was lashed the sterncastle lights were shuttered and all the hull ports were closed on a hot still day like this the tween decks must be stifling she thought let them out now sturm said birdcall and roperig let the sails unfurl and the flying ship spurted ahead the swinging grapnel snagged the chain stays of the mainmast and the cloudmaster jerked to a stop they pivoted with the drag and found themselves flying tailfirst into the wind towed by the far heavier caravel now what said wingover leaning over the side someone has to go down and tie us off suggested sturm i would go but the grapnel rope is too thin for me dont look my way kitiara said ive had all the rope climbing i care for on this trip fitter agreed to go since he was small and nimble he shinnied down the rope to the masthead standing on the crosstree he waved up to his friends find a heavier line and tie us off sturm bawled fitter nodded and slipped down the rigging to the ships deck a fat hawser line lay coiled behind the foremast fitter shoul dered this burden and climbed back to the cloudmaster thats my apprentice said roperig proudly did you see any signs of life down there asked kitiara fitter dumped the hawser off his shoulder no maam everythings neat as can be but there isnt a soul around sturm went down into the deckhouse and returned with his sword he draped the belt over his shoulder and threw one leg over the rail id better be first to look around ill come behind you said kitiara me too volunteered fitter the other gnomes chimed in in quick succession someone has to stay on board sturm said you gnomes work it out but dont all of you come a hundred feet is a long way to climb down a rope the heat was so bad that sturm got dizzy halfway along and had to stop to mop the sweat from his eyes how will i ever climb back uphe wondered it was a relief when the dark varnished oak of the yardarm touched his feet kitiara wrapped her bare legs around the hawser and started down deck level was just as fitter had described tidy and ship shape sturm had a bad feeling about it sailors did not abandon a wellfounded vessel without good reason kitiara dropped down to the deck sturm whirled sword coming out with a whisk of steel easy she said im on your side remember sorry this ship has me spooked go up the starboard side to the bow take port they met at the bow finding nothing amiss except the complete lack of visible crew there was a hatch behind the bowsprit kitiara suggested they go below deck not yet said sturm lets chec aft sighter and stutts arrived on deck sighter carried a car penters square and stutts a hammer these were the only weapons they could find more than ever they resembled diminutive pirates boarding an unlucky ship from above ffind anything said stutts nothing the ships wheel was firmly tied it creaked an inch or two left and right as the wind and waves fought against the rud der sturm was trying to tell how long the wheel had been fixed when kitiara drew in her breath sharply look here she said nailed to the wall of the sterncastle was a crow a stuffed dead crow with its tail and wings spread ive seen these before someone has cast a spell over this ship and to ward off the evil magic someone put this crow here said kitiara weve got to get out of here take it easy sturm said quietly weve seen no signs of magic at work lets go inside and see if we can at least iden tify this vessel the louvered door creaked back on bright brass hinges within the sterncastle it was hot and dim slivers of light cast weird shadows across the room stutts open the shutters will you the gnome made for the row of shades on his right there was a rustle as he wrestled with the latch the shutters fell open flooding the cabin with light so heres the captain said kitiara grimly the master of the caravel still sat at his table gazing sight lessly through ivory eye sockets his skull was clean and dry and the skeletal fingers lying on the tabletop were still joined together the captain wore a richly made coat of blue brocade embellished with gold tassels and braid a final macabre touch was the skeleton of his last meal still on the plate before him stutts poked through the tiny bones chicken he announced a hhen i should say sturm sniffed the pewter goblet by the dead mans right hand there was no obvious trace of poison in the empty cup he put it down and noticed a slim silver ring around one of the bony fingers gently he lifted the skeletons hand despite his care the bones fell apart at his touch sturm held the ring up to the light trying to find an inscription or makers mark it was a simple beaded silver band slightly grimy it could have been made anywhere by anyone kitiara looked under the table ho she said whats this she stood up with a second skull in her hands this was between captain boness feet she flipped the skull around someone chopped this fellows head off you can see the axe mark there she set the gruesome relic on the table and bent over again nice boots she reported sil ver buckles deerskin tops he was a dandy i wonder who he was sturm said mmy stutts was over near the stern lights hed found a large leatherbound chest and sprung the simple lock inside were gold coins and scattered jewels kitiara whistled and fished out an especially fine emerald now i understand she said this must be a pirate ship are you so certain said sighter you dont lay in swag like this trading fish and dry goods she threw open a second chest it was filled to the brim with small wooden boxes she pried the lid off one and leaned in to see what treasure it contained kitiara screwed up her face and gave a mighty sneeze mmercy said stutts what is it spice pepper she wheezed snapping the lid back on sturm peered over her shoulder spices are rarer than gold he said this chest is proba bly more valuable than the other just the same when we divvy it up ill take my share in gold and jewels kitiara said divvy i thought you were concerned about the curse with enough gold in my pocket ill face up to all the curses in the world suiting action to her words she began to fill her pockets with gems and gold the cabin door flew open and they all jumped it was only rainspot i thought i ought to come down and warn you he said theres a storm brewing it feels like a strong cyclone just enough time for a little salvage said kitiara she leaned against the treasure chest and tried to shift it toward the door it squeaked a scant inch out of place dont just stand there help me we dont have time for treasure sturm said weve got to get back to the cloudmaster she stopped shoving and stood up do we she said do we what have to go back to the flying ship why cant we stay on board this one we dont know anything about it sturm protested for all we know it could founder in the first squall we hit so could the cloudmaster stutts fidgeted as the two humans argued pplease i am returning nnow he hurried out the door sighter shrugged id like to explore this vessel some more but my place is with my colleagues he bowed and pushed rainspot out the door ahead of him alone with kitiara sturm said with annoyance are you going or staying she crossed her arms stubbornly staying then youre staying by yourself sturm went out on deck a cool wind was blowing in from the south and the caravel was heeled under sail to the north purpleblack clouds closed to sea level and charged with the wind in minutes both ships would be engulfed sighter and stutts shinnied up the rope with little trouble by the time sturm had reached the top of the mainmast they were climbing over the flying ships rail the cloud master was whipping about like a fish on a hook and sturm watched the bouncing rope with trepidation he took hold rain light and warm puffed ahead of the storm sturm shook it out of his face the gnomes had sheeted in all the cloudmasters sails but the air bag itself caught the wind dragging the flying ship behind it sturm hauled himself hand over hand toward the bobbing craft trying not to think about the tossing waves eighty feet below the first blow of rain hit like a wall soaking sturm to the skin in a second he continued to inch higher but the cloudmaster scarcely grew closer the longer he climbed halloo sturm halloo wingover is that you he shouted in reply sturm can you hear me the rope is wet and stretching under your weight the strain is too much cried the unseen gnome ill go back sturm could barely see the cloudmasters gray outline well try to come back for you then faintly may reorx guard you well wingover cried sturm all but slid down the hawser to the waving mast the stout oak yard swung into him hitting him hard in the ribs his breath rushed out and he lost his grip on the rope sturm landed against the sail and clamped on as hard as he could the powdery soft canvas gave way under his grip and tore slowly down to the deck sturm landed blind wet and breathless in the caravels waist the gnomes cut the rope at their end the cloudmaster soared into the driving clouds and was lost from sight kitiara rolled sturm over can you stand can you walk she cried above the howling wind he nodded dumbly she dragged him to his feet and together they stag gered aft to the sterncastle sturm collapsed on the deck by the captains table to collect his breath kitiara circled the room closing the shutters and cranking the louvers tight you all right she asked out of the darkness yes are the gnomes gone they had to cut loose to save the ship he coughed painfully kitiara struck sparks from the sea captains flint and lit a fat candle on the table the wavering flame threw weird highlights on the dead captains skull sturm wrung out his kerchief and draped it over the skull he does tend to stare at you doesnt he said kitiara she put out a hand to steady herself the deck was rising and falling with the regularity of a water wheel well have to trim the sails sturm said if the right gust hits us well capsize im not going up any rigging in that blow she replied out came his sword you wont have to ill cut all the stays on the lowest sails theyll blow away and that should do it he went to the cabin door wait she said she found a painter line in the captains locker and brought it over hold your arms up he did and kitiara reached around his chest and tied the line dont do any swimming while youre gone she said he lowered his arms ill try not to sturm threw open the door and received the storms full blast he staggered to the mainmast and slashed the lines to the mainsail the torn canvas flopped like a live thing crackling out from the main yard he ducked under it and pushed on to the foremast likewise hacking away the stays there with only topsails and spritsail set the going was eas ier sturm made it back to the sterncastle it is steadier kitiara said what do we do now asked sturm as water dripped from his clothes and hair lets explore below kit suggested have you forgotten the curse her amusement evaporated i havent forgotten but if this is a sample of whats on board im not much worried she patted the captains kerchiefcovered skull the head toppled off the neck bones and hit the table with a thump it lay eyes up staring at the mortal intruders on its ship chapter the wizards seal a narrow hatch covered a ladder that led down into the caravels dark bowels kitiara lay flat on her belly and poked the candle into the hole warm stagnant air waft ed out but no obvious danger loomed she climbed down and sturm followed hand on the pommel of his sword theyd entered nothing more interesting than the ships rope locker it contained only rope sailcloth and chain kitiara poked around looking for more treasure all she found were dead rats like everything else dead on the ship the rats were a mere jumble of bones isnt it strange sturm whispered that all we ever find are bones they passed through a light wooden partition into a larg er space a cargo area here kitiaras candle shone on some thing more sinister than rope and cloth they had found an armory replete with swords spears shields bronze breast plates shirts of mail lances bows blocks of lead for sling pellets enough to equip a small army these are dwarfforged shields sturm said pushing a round buckler aside with his toe see they have the mark of the thorbardin armorers guild that breastplate bears the mark of the thanes of zhaman he picked up the breastplate the cold iron was polished to a finish like mir rored silver and though fully a third of an inch thick it was remarkably light these are firstquality arms why would pirates need so many weapons he said maybe they are captured stocks maybe but space is precious aboard a ship they might keep good items for their own use but not this many whats through there kitiara hissed pointing forward forecastle where the crew sleeps they stepped over the door sill and beheld a terrible sight the forecastle was full of skeletons row upon row of clean white bones lay huddled on either side of the ship some were stretched out others knotted with the agony they had borne until death not all the bones were human some by their shape and size belonged to dwarves others smaller bones may have been kender or gnomes there was one thing the skeletons had in common they were all chained together at the ankles i dont like this there has been great evil here sturm hissed come he backed out whats up front of that room kitiara wondered the bury of the bowsprit where the anchors are kept in the center of the armory was a large square hatch which sturm said led to the hold removing the hatch was not easy someone had secured it to the deck with a dozen large iron bolts sturm tried to figure out the best way to remove them but kitiara simply took a battle axe from the cache of weapons and bashed the heads off several bolts stop he demanded did you ever think that hatch might be fastened down to keep something in she paused in midswing no she said and brought the axe down on the next bolt some txt those poor dev ils died of plague or something you and i are the first living souls on board in months maybe so what we find is ours by right of salvage she decapitated the last bolt if you want a share youd better help me reluctantly sturm got his fingers under the hatchs flange and together they lifted it off the stout lid of oak and copper fell aside landing on a pile of armor the ringing boom echoed through the caravel kitiara thrust her candle into the opening a cold draft flowed out so she shielded the flame with her hand the weak amber globe of light fell over the open hold it was empty a wide set of plank steps led down kitiara lowered a foot to the first step dont warned sturm whats the matter with you a few skulls and bones and suddenly youre afraid of your own shadow wheres your curiosity wheres your knightly valor alive and well thank you she dropped down a few more steps coming then sturm held up one finger and went to the pile of shields he found a buckler of good dwarven make and slipped it over his arm thus reinforced he followed kitiara into the hold its very black in here she said a post at the foot of the steps proved to be coated with a greasy black powder soot she said hmm yes sturm went down on one knee the deck was charred there was a fire down here he brushed off his fingertips this ships lucky to be afloat fire at sea was one of the worst fates a ship could face is there anything below this floor kitiara asked just the bilge something caught the candlelight sturm waved her to him bring the light here he whispered what is it on the deck a few feet to the right of the steps were four long scratches so deep that they scored through the charred woods surface to the lighter unburned wood beneath the scratches were three inches apart and almost a foot long what do you make of that sturm asked kitiara drew her sword claw marks she said grimly toward the bow a massive half cylinder descending from the ceiling divided the bulkhead in two this was the lower end of the mainmast on each side of the mast were doors both had been hastily but solidly blocked with boards the barricade on the right of the mast was intact the one on the left was burst asunder from the other side whatever it was it came through here said kitiara it she didnt answer but stepped carefully through the shat tered barrier into the forward hold sturm couldnt fit through the hole so he broke out a few more boards the charred planks split loudly the forward hold was even colder than the aft one it was not sooted by fire they found more bones broken swords and cutlasses and smashed helmets the remnants of a fierce fight kitiara almost tripped over another form this one still clad in a moldering brown robe where she had dis turbed the robe there was a glint of gold this was a cleric sturm said the robe the amulets are the kind a holy man would wear he groped in the folds of the robe and pulled out a necklace wrought in copper he held it to the candle a rose the symbol of majere at least he served a good god he laid the necklace down rev erently on the dusky cloth kitiara moved on to the facing wall a ladder was set in the wall going up to the forecastle halfway up someone had sawed the rungs off the stout base of the foremast intruded into the hold here too and beside it was another boardedup door this one was intact sturm come here he stepped over the clerics skeleton kitiara thrust her candle to the battened door scarlet threads were woven back and forth across the rough barrier and gathered in a knot in the center of the door a blob of sealing wax held the threads together and in the wax was the impression of a ring seal can you read it she asked sturm squinted at the image majere protect us and obey the will of novantumus he looked back at the cler ics remains he must have been novantumus kitiara put the point of her sword to the wax seal what do you think youre doing he said theres something valuable on the other side of this door she said i want to see what it is it could be what killed all these men she rapped on the door hello any monsters in there the only sounds were the steady muffled roar of the storm outside and the creaking of the ships timbers see no danger sturm pulled her roughly away i wont let you tamper with it you wont she snatched her arm free of his grasp since when do you give me orders sturm brightblade i wont let you break that seal it could mean our deaths kitiara cut at the door sturm flung the shield out and deflected the blow kitiara uttered an angry snort she set the candle down and assumed fighting stance out of my way she declared will you think what youre doing do you want to fight just to open that door look around kit do you think plague smashed up these armed men so they killed each other fighting over the treasure out of the way sturm started to reply but kitiara lunged at him he backed away unwilling to use his own sword sturm kept the shield up fending off her cuts this went on until kitiara grew frustrated she aimed a wild overhand slash at his head her blade hit the shield a glancing blow and skidded off the arc of her cut ended against the door and shattered the brittle wax seal now youve done it he said panting kitiara flung herself sword and all at the door sturm stared in amazement as she pressed herself against the wood at last she said at last there was a split second of silence then a tremendous crash kitiaras sword was knocked from her hand as she flew backward and landed with a clatter among the bones the center board was bowed outward and cracked sturm tossed the shield aside and went to help kitiara stand from inside there came another crash and the board above the first one flexed out what is it kitiara cried i dont know but its coming out of there lets go they fled in such haste that they forgot the candle through the sooty midnight of the aft hold they ran and stumbled up the stairs to the armory kitiara made for the rope locker sturm called her back help me with the hatch he said they wrestled the heavy hatch into place and dropped it then it was through the rope locker and up the ladder to the captains cabin kitiara dragged some heavy chests over to block the ladder well rain drummed on the poop deck above them and wind whistled around the louvered shut ters they stood close together in the dark breathing hard and listening the deck trembled beneath their feet and they heard wood breaking the thing whatever it was was smashing its way out i lost my sword she said deeply ashamed she a sea soned warrior had lost her only weapon when she fell among the skeletons it doesnt matter sturm said swords didnt save the crew of this ship thanks she said wryly some txt missing metal rang and rattled it was in the armory sturm flexed his damp hand around the handle of his sword the uproar below got worse as the thing expended its anger on the store of weapons from the crash and clang it sounded like every item in the cache was being battered twisted and crushed then abruptly all the noise ceased sturm and kitiara by some common impulse drew clos er together their arms touched in the dark can you hear anything he whispered just you shh they strained to catch any stray sound the cabin door blew open with a bang rain poured in sturm struggled to close the door against the press of wind by the greenish gray light that filtered in through the cyclone he saw that the main hatch cover forward of the mainmast was blasted off its gone out on deck he shouted above the wind it could be anywhere well have to close that hatch she said or the ship will flood yes he nodded sturm felt exhausted at that moment he wondered what silliness the gnomes were up to and fervently wished he was with them to see it ready said kitiara she threw the bolt back and they plunged out onto the stormswept deck they were soaked with sea water before they took two steps the heel of the ship with the waves was more notice able on deck mountains of green water rose and fell and the horizon swung from below eye level to nearly the masthead holding hands sturm and kitiara staggered to the main mast the hatch cover was not just thrown open gaping rents were torn in it sturm lost his footing twice as foaming sea swept over him finally on their knees they managed to get the hatch back over its coaming high above the rumble of the churning sea a shrill cackle reached them sturm looked left and right for the source of the sound kitiara looked up and down she spied the thing clinging to the rigging high over their heads s it was a horridlooking thing ghastly white and gaunt except for its abnormal size it might have been a man starved and sallow but this creature was seven feet tall its protruding eyes were like red burning coals and its hands were clawed with silver nails two inches long the head was round and hairless the ears tall and pointed the creature threw back its head and howled showing long yellow fangs and a pointed black tongue suffering gods what is it i dont know look out the creature sprang from the rigging to the stays hanging from the foremast it swung under the spar and flipped over until its feet were on top of the yard there it howled at them again they backed cautiously across the wet deck ignoring the lashing rain and pounding sea once inside the cabin they slammed the door and bolted it kitiara turned a strange white glow filled the rear of the cabin they were no longer alone there either chappter pyrthiss tale the cold white light collected into a human form six feet tall kitiara pointed her sadly bent dagger at the appari tion but sturm pushed the weapon down in the name of paladine and all the gods of good depart in peace spirit he said the cabin filled with a deep long sigh would that i could depart said a low voice for i am tired beyond mea sure and desire rest who are you asked kitiara in life i was master of this vessel my name is pyrthis he doesnt seem dangerous kitiara muttered to sturm but lets find a safer spot from that creature outside the gharm will not enter this cabin the ghost said as long as i am here outside the hellish thing shrieked acknowledging the truth of the dead captains words what is the gharm asked sturm the indistinct figure drew closer and became more defined its legs did not move and its arms stayed firmly by its sides the ghost glided forward until sturm and kit could see deep hollow eyes and a jaw that hung open as slack as the face of a corpse the voice issued from the mouth with out the lips moving at all once he was my friend and then a curse laid us all low he became the gharm i a walking spirit and the crew of the werival died in torment spirits walk for two reasons to right an unavenged wrong and to give warning to the living which is it cap tain why do you remain on this mortal plane asked sturm another mournful sigh know my friends that i bar gained with the forces of evil and lost the ghost came clos er still enough for kitiara to see its dead white eyes and corpse pallor i was a merchant captain bold and enterprising who never turned down a cargo for money i plied the sirrion sea and traded north and east to the blood sea maelstrom in my time i carried all goods from spices to slaves sturm frowned you trafficked in misery he said flatly aye i did thank your gods that you still live and can make amends for any evil deeds you have committed i am past saving now the poop deck overhead resounded with the tramp of feet kitiara listened nervously as the gharm stamped on the boards what is that thing she demanded once my first mate and friend drott who i trained in all the wily ways i knew our coffers grew fat and heavy with gold and i grew satisfied as men in their waning years are wont to do but drott was young and keen and always searching for the richest commission to be made it was a fateful day when he fell in with the scaled warriors sturm had a glimmer of recognition do you mean dra conians he asked aye some have called them thus pyrthiss ghost loomed over sturm though seemingly benign its presence was oppressive and sturm began to sweat the dragonmen had a rich proposition that we carry a shipment of weapons and money for them from nordmaar to coastlund there to rendezvous with other dragonmen arriving from the northern seas drott accepted their com mission and their money thus damning us all the ghost made a horrible rasping sound i am so weary the dead mans left arm came loose from his shoulder and fell silently to the floor kitiara flinched at the sight more from surprise than disgust she bent to pick up the gently glowing limb but her hand passed right through it we loaded sixty hundredweight of arms and weighed anchor for coastlund we had a fair wind and made a swift passage on the way drott schemed and plotted he drew me into his plan which was this since the dragonmen were barbarians and invaders why should we not hold them up for as much gold as we could they would pay doubly or triply for their swords and we would have nothing to fear who could they complain to their purpose was even more illicit than ours i fell in with drotts scheme in truth i despised the scaly killers and feared them greatly to cheat them seemed both just and profitable the ghost paused and the silence grew long sturm finally said what happened when you reached coastlund rasp a dragonship was there waiting the leader of the dragonmen came aboard to accept transfer of the weap ons drott laid out his demand for more money the leader must have expected such a ploy for he readily offered to pay half again the original price drott insisted on double the amount the lizard resisted for a time then conceded he departed for his ship and returned with a second chest of treasure this time a human came with him a dark cleric wearing a metal mask that mimicked a dragons face this one frightened me very much he stood by watching and saying nothing drott laughed and joked as the second box of money came on board he was drunk with success and when i ordered the crew to begin transferring the cargo to the dragonship he drew me aside and whispered another wicked design in my ear shall we not keep some part of the cargo ourselves he said could we not wring a bit more sil ver from these flush pigeons that was pretty stupid kitiara said with a boatload of draconians alongside we did not fear their force for our crew was numerous and skilled in the use of saber and pike we did not sail the pirateinfested seas unprepared but the dark cleric that was someone you werent able to counter said sturm indeed mortal man the ghosts right arm dropped off part of the unreal flesh touched sturms booted foot he withdrew it hastily and shivered the ghosts touch was more frigid than the wind off the ice wall we held back five hundredweight of arms the dragon mens leader discovered the shortage and complained drott jeered at him from the rail saying there was a tax on illegal weapons and the dragonfolk had yet to pay the dragon man threatened to storm the werival and slaughter us all the crew manned the rail with bare blades and taunted them to try the dragonmen less than a third our number began to arm i wanted to weigh anchor and be off but drott said we should stay and fight after we killed the scaly folk he said we could take back all the weapons wed sold them and sell them again there was no battle the dark cleric came from his place on the stern of the dragonship and threw his arms wide go greedy vermin and take away your dishonored gold i curse you and yours forever those who lust for gold shall lust for the flesh of their fellows those who jeer at the min ions of the dark queen shall know her wrath they shall hear her mocking laughter forever he said it was a terrible curse and the full weight of it did not fall on us for some weeks we left the shores of coastlund for sancrist but never saw land again strange circular winds blew us farther and farther from land the crew began to hear voices a woman laughing and they slowly went mad the few healthy sailors that remained chained the mad ones below decks food and water dwindled but try as we might we could not bring the werival to shore drott changed he had always been a vain man proud of his quick mind and good looks now he ceased to care for himself allowing his beard to grow and his clothes to fall to tatters the meat shrank on his bones and his skin whitened to a ghastly color as the days passed my first mate and friend perished as the hideous curse worked upon his wretched body drott prowled below snaring rats in his hands and eating them alive soon rats were not enough for him he had become a gharm a ravenous ghoul that feeds on the flesh of men why didnt you kill him kitiara said sharply the drumming of feet had stopped but they could still hear the gharms cackle as the monster capered madly in the rigging i could not for as much as his new form disgusted me i pitied my lost friend the crew poor wretches learned to keep him at bay by giving him those who died of madness and starvation when there were only five sound men left they decided to try to put an end to the gharm our young cleric novantumus wove a temporary protective spell the sailors armed themselves and drove the gharm to the fore end of the ship with fire and sword novantumus meant to imprison the fiend in the anchor locker and he fashioned a magic seal to keep it in the gharm attacked the men savagely and killed them one by one with his lifes blood spilling on the deck the brave novantumus succeed ed in compelling the gharm into the locker i alone lived and here at my table i died of hunger thirst and despair the ghost had shrunk throughout his telling and the cold glare that it cast had diminished to a fireflys sparkle sturm was deeply sorry for the captain one question said kitiara she picked up the skull that had been set between the captains feet who is this that was drotts head one of the sailors cut it off before the gharm killed him but that thing out there has a head a new one it grew afterward sturm said can the gharm be killed the ghost shriveled to a slender coil of white mist not by steel iron or bronze it said a tiny faroff voice only purifying fire will make this ship clean with those final words the ghost vanished this is wonderful kitiara said bitterly a monster we cant kill unless we burn up the ship thats keeping us out of the water what we must do is stay alive until the storm ends sturm said the gnomes will be looking for us and well be able to leave this cursed ship a splintering sound halted sturm in midsentence the gharm had rammed one bony clawed arm through the thin louvered panel of the cabin door something tells me our moment of immunity is over kitiara said sturm leaped up from the table drawing his sword in one smooth motion he brought the keen blade down hard on the grasping talons the gharm roared in pain and withdrew the stump of its left arm suffering gods kitiara kicked the severed arm away the limb rapidly decayed to bone and then to dust the gharm put one of its baleful eyes to the hole that it had made and glared at them sturm raised his sword again and the monster backpedaled kitiara went to the cabins rear and started tearing through the captains bunk kit what are you doing he called dont worry just keep that damned thing away a minute longer he heard wood being split behind him then felt heat on the back of his neck sturm turned and saw that kitiara had made a torch from a bunk slat and a strip of ticking doused with oil from the captains lamp and ignited by flint it blazed furiously ha try this ghoul she shouted brandishing the flame before the door the gharm howled and hissed its fangs dripping saliva ill give you something to chew on kiti ara kicked the smashed door frame open the rain had almost stopped but a fierce wind still raged across the open deck kitiara dashed out whipping the torch to and fro like a fencing blade the gharm crouched back on its railthin haunches spitting and hissing kit be careful its my fault this thing is out i intend to kill it she moved on the ghoul again forcing it to retreat up the rigging it hung twenty feet above the deck giggling in an obscene parody of humanity kitiara paced below it wav ing the torch to keep it bright and hot sturm closed behind her dont let it drop down on you he counseled if it does itll go back up a lot faster than it came down the ceiling of black clouds scattered into streams of dirty white as the blue of clear sky shone through the wind had died down but did not cease they were in the eye of the cyclone the calm center of a mileswide storm the gharm swung over to the port side rigging kitiara followed across the deck she was so intent on keeping the fiend in view that she missed the end of the mainsail sturm had cut free the heavy flapping canvas was soaked with rain and one corner of it whipped around and slapped kiti ara between the eyes she fell backward and lost the torch as the sail struck her the gharm pounced no sturm cried he was on the fiends back in a flash slashing at its pale leathery hide the ghoul had one set of talons deep in kitiaras shoulder but sturms attack made it let go he inflicted wounds that would have killed a mortal foe but the gharm wasnt slowed a detached part of sturms mind noted that the ghoul already had grown back the arm that hed chopped off kitiara pushed herself away from the duel between sturm and the gharm her shoulder wound burned like bell cranks vitriol she crawled to where the torch lay charring the deck in her pants pocket she still had the tin can of oil from the captains storm lamp at the right moment when sturm gave ground to the monster she flung the oil over the gharm and with it the torch it was scarcely a cupful of oil but it burned rapidly and the gharm yowled in unimaginable pain it threw itself on the deck and rolled to put out the flames failing that it leaped up and ran forward burning as it went and tore off the hatch cover the gharm disappeared below trailing a thin plume of putrid smoke sturm knelt and put an arm around kitiara her teeth chattered she had been poisoned by the ghouls vile talons kitl kit her eyes were almost completely white they had rolled so far back in her head kit listen to me dont give up fight it fight it her hand came trembling to her throat there under the thin fabric of her blouse was the amethyst arrowhead pen dant that tirolan ambrodel had given her so many weeks before drained of color before they met the gnomes the crystals magic had been restored by the days theyd spent on lunitari for it now was a rich royal purple the stone had not surrendered its power upon its return to krynn kitiaras fingers would not grasp the amethyst they were already stiff and cold sturm gently lifted the magic crystal was there enough power in it to save kits life did he a sworn opponent of magic dare use it to heal her her breath came short in hard ragged gasps death had kitiara in its grasp there was no time to debate sturm closed the amethyst in his fist and placed his other hand on kitiaras injured shoulder forgive me father he whispered this is for her life the stone was hot for the merest second but not enough to burn him kitiara gave a sharp cry and then went limp in his arms he thought he was too late that she was dead sturm opened his fingers to see that the amethyst was clear again he peeled back the bloody cloth over kits wound and saw that it was healed smoke from the hatch was getting thicker sturm put an arm under kitiaras legs and staggered to his feet muffled screams filtering through the open hatch proved that the gharm hadnt yet overcome the fire the smoke got so bad that sturm retreated to the poop deck carrying kitiara the wind switched from port to star board never allowing the ship to drive clear of the fumes when the first tongues of flame licked out of the hold sturm felt real fear how could they escape if the ship was on fire the werivals longboat was missing at that moment the wall of rain off the starboard bow parted and out came the brown hull of the cloudmaster the flying ship was skimming over the waves so low that a few high swells lapped the bottom of her hull sturm saw the gnomes at the bow waving white handkerchiefs a great shout of triumph escaped his throat kit wake up he cried kit the gnomes are coming were saved fire blasted out of the fore hatch and with it the figure of the gharm blazing from head to toe the hideous ghoul bounced from bulwark to bulwark shrieking its cursed life away unable to bear the burning any longer the ghoul finally dived into the churning waves the bows were burning now and the foremast was begin ning to smolder the cloudmaster drifted past the stern sturm left kitiara lying on the deck and grabbed a boat hook from the rail as the gnome ship coasted slowly along the port side sturm hooked it and drew it tightly to the car avel the gnomes clutched the werivals sides as sturm lifted the limp kitiara over his shoulder he sprinted for the rail and leaped one foot kicking the rail top as he went the gnomes let go and the cloudmaster sank toward the sea too much weight wingover cried out ballast amidships sighter cutwood and birdcall threw doors window glass and other loose objects over the side the ship rose again into the low clouds wwelcome aboard stutts said heartily glad to be here sturm said with genuine relief he lay sprawled on the deck what happened down there asked wingover its a long story is the lady well she seems unconscious said sighter he lifted one of her arms and let it fall shell be all right sturm said the cloudmaster broke through the top of the clouds below the cyclones whirling mass spread out in all its glory the gnomes set the sails and put the setting sun to their backs it was very clever of you to start a signal fire wingover said but it got out of hand didnt it i mean you might have destroyed the whole ship before we ever arrived sturm felt a crazy desire to laugh instead he said thats not the way things went he paused to yawn prodi giously did you find anything useful on that vessel sighter asked but by then sturm was already fast asleep chapter the road to garnet sturm smelled land wet soil and flowers and fresh ly turned fields the sun was in his eyes he sat up he was in the wheelhouse alone the windows and doors were gone as was most of the roof he went out on deck at the bow was sighter surveying the ground below with his tele scope aft by the former tail post sat kitiara stutts fitter and rainspot kitiara was talking rapidly and making wild gestures with her hands and then sturm stepped in and chopped the monsters arm off the gnomes all went ohh and kitiara described how the arm had withered before their very eyes stutts saw sturm approach ah master bbrightblade youre awake we are just hearing about your ttremendous adventure on board the cursed ccaravel sturm grunted something noncommittal and looked at kitiara how do you feel he asked fit as can be howre you rested he said how long have i been asleep ttwo nights and a day said stutts two nights and a day added fitter i came to about an hour ago kitiara saidi slept like a dead woman but now i feel better than i have in ten sum mers you almost were a dead woman sturm explained how the gharm had poisoned her and told her that the elven pen dant had saved her once again kitiara brought the ame thyst out of her blouse not only was it clear once more but it was seamed with hundreds of tiny cracks i dont remember using it she said puzzled you didnt i did said sturm kitiaras eyes widened in surprise he turned and went into the dining room there the water barrel sat almost empty sturm downed a dipper of tepid water outside wingover said i thought men of his order would not use magic under any circumstance theyre not supposed to kitiara said she began to tuck the pendant back under her blouse but as she did it crum bled into dust she stared sadly at the flakes on her tunic tirolan ambrodels gift was no more then brushing them away she rose and said to the gnomes excuse me fellows i need to have a word with sturm kitiara found sturm standing by the port rail staring at the green land below northern ergoth she said wingover spotted a flock of terns and followed them the birds led them to land sturm stared on saying nothing not very scientific i thought but wingover says anything that yields good results is scientific i am tainted sturm said quietly in what way i used magic such a thing is forbidden how am i ever going to become a knight thats ridiculous you used magic on lunitari when you had those visions she said those were inflicted on me i had no choice on the ship i used the power of the pendant to heal your wound i call that a right proper thing to do are you sorry you didnt let me die she asked sarcastically of course not but youre tainted nevertheless i am then you are a fool sturm brightblade a hidebound fool do you honestly believe that an ancient set of rules for knightly conduct is more important than a comrades life my life he did not answer theres something twisted about such thinking sturm sturm shook his head vigorously no kit i would have given my life to save yours but it is a cruel turning of fate that made me break the measure her jaw clenched in anger and she said stiffly i never realized how little value you place on friendship you want me to believe in your dusty old code just like tanis he tried to make me into something i wasnt he couldnt con trol me and neither can you she stamped the deck barely containing her fury sturm folded his hands and regarded them carefully vir tue is a hard master kit the measure and the oath were never meant to be easy burdens to bear a knight carries them like ponderous stones on his back and their weight makes him strong and upright he lifted his gaze until their eyes met you will never understand because all you want from life is to give your burden over to someone else a lov er a servant even a brass dragon as long as someone else can bear the burden of honor for you you dont have to feel guilt or face the consequences of your acts color drained from her face no one had ever spoken to her like that not even tanis then this is the end she said coldly from the moment this soap bubble touches the ground were finished kitiara left him watching the canopy of trees unroll they did not speak to each other again careful careful watch those branches the cloudmaster pushed into a forest clearing elm ash and birch branches clawed at them wingover was atop the deckhouse trying to direct the landing flash and birdcall had opened the neck of the ethereal air bag letting some of the lifting power out the flying ship had scraped over a few bald hills before the wind carried it down sturm stood at the bow fending off dangerous limbs with the boat hook from the werival his only souvenir of the perilous hours on the cursed ship they had no anchor no grapnel to fix them in place only timing and control of the air bag flash and birdcall clung to the rope that held the halfempty bag shut branches scraped the length of the deck snapping when the gaping windows of the deckhouse caught them birds fled chirping when the ship disturbed their treetop homes clearing ahead sturm called get ready wingover cried the bow dipped once the trees were out of the way the keel gently touched the meadows grass dragged a few yards and stopped sturm jammed the boat hook into the ground and swung over the rail he landed on the soil of krynn with both feet praise paladine he said solid ground at last the boarding ramp fell and seven gnomes boiled out wingover was inhaling deep breaths and patting himself on the chest when he heard birdcall whistle questioningly can we open the bag now asked flash yes yes were landed the two gnomes pulled the zigzag stitching loose a gust of sulfurous air fled the bag and the exhausted craft settled finally and heavily kitiara descended the ramp and dumped what belongings she had left on the ground in spite of the bitterness of their parting sturm couldnt stop his eyes from following her she paid no one the slightest heed but stood a ways off hanging her water bottle and leather pouch on opposite hips to balance the load she slung her bedroll over one shoulder by its strap sturm had an urge to speak to say something conciliatory but her hard expression forestalled him well wingover its been a long strange voyage kiti ara said shaking the little mans hand ill never forget it we couldnt have made it without you lady she moved on to cutwood sighter birdcall and flash keep thinking up new ideas she said amiably that way the world will never get dull she turned to roperig and fit ter and chucked the littlest gnome under the chin so long boys stick together you make a good team we will said the two in unison finally she approached rainspot and stutts youre a very lucky fellow stutts she said warmly not many peo ple get to realize their lifes dream as completely as you have keep flying old fellow i hope you will have many more adventures my said stutts it ddoesnt seem likely i have so many reports to write and sso many lectures to give after all the gnomish patent office must be satisfied that we have ddone what we have done he bowed formally farewell mistress you were a ttower of strength i was wasnt i where are you off to wingover asked wherever the trail takes me she replied kitiaras crooked smile almost appeared she squinted into the sky it was not yet noon the sun warmed her face sturm stood apart from her leavetaking he felt the weight of his own resolve and knew that what kitiara had said was true they were finished and yet he knew he would miss the old kit the brash funloving companion kitiara crossed the warm meadow briskly and did not look back sunlight burnished her black curls as she cut a swath through the high grass sturm bent over to shoulder his own gear when he straightened again kitiara had van ished among the closely growing elms and birches at the fields far end arent you going after her said fitter why should i do that sturm said he tied a thready piece of twine around his bedroll and tucked it under his arm she can take care of herself its what she does best i dont understand fitter said scratching his nose i thought you two were going to get married one day sturm dropped his cooking kit at that remark the clay pot banged him smartly on the toe where in the world did you get an idea like that he asked flabbergasted weve always heard how human men and women fight and yell at each other but always end up married and you know fitter blushed having babies sturm picked up the spilled contents of his kit it will take a man with more riches and power than ill ever have to claim her hand he hung the kit bag around his neck the man who wins kitiara uth matar had better have the patience of paladine and the wisdom of majere to keep her the gnomes gathered around him as he adjusted the last of his equipment where will you go asked wingover solamnia as before there are things i must investigate the visions i had on the red moon have faded from my memory but i know my fathers trail begins at my ancestral home castle brightblade that is my destination small hands patted him on the back we wish you every bit of luck master brightblade said cutwood youre very smart for a human that means a lot coming from you sturm answered wryly wwe would offer to fly you on tto solamnia stutts said but we are on ffoot now ourselves that hadnt occurred to him sturm said would you like me to escort you home to sancrist it seemed the least he could do no no weve delayed you long enough said sighter well get to gwynned all right therell be ships there for sancrist i shall miss you said rainspot fondly he held out his small hand with great solemnity sturm shook rainspots hand and each of the other gnomes hands in succession then he hitched up his gear and started out funny he thought to have traveled so far and walked so little his feet were more tender now than before he went to lunitari walking will be good penance he decided he could shed some of the stain of magic by walking and con templating his transgression perhaps he could also come to grips with the difficult choices he faced as he tried to live by the code and the measure goodbye goodbye called the gnomes sturm snapped out of his reverie and waved to them they were good fellows indeed he hoped they would not have any more trouble but being gnomes they probably would he entered the humid forest and plunged through thicket after thicket of dense greenery it cheered him to see vines and bushes with honest green leaves plants that didnt bleed or cry when he tramped over them lunitari was such an unnatural world two miles of woods later he found a clear creek and filled his bottle the water was cold and had a mineral taste it was a welcome change after weeks of drinking soft rain water sturm paralleled the creek bank for four miles until he came to an arched stone bridge he climbed the bank to the road that wended away north and south a road marker was fixed to the corner of the bridge on its south face it read caergoth leagues and on its east face garnet leagues sturm laughed until tears came the gnomes had landed in solamnia not twenty miles from where theyd left in the first place and he laughed for other reasons to be home again not merely on krynn though that was good but in solamnia he felt light and free without the gnomes to wor ry about without the constant apprehension of what strange things might be around the next corner and free of his curious relationship with kitiara their separation was like the pulling of an aching tooth a definite feeling of relief yet tinged with an underlying sense of loss of a void in him self sturm took the road for garnet the roads in this prov ince converged on the city so it was the best way to get to the northern plains he set himself a good pace with his light burden and no dependents to herd he ought to make garnet by the next morning he thought as he marched he took in the sights and sounds and smells of his native land the scrub pastures and rolling hills peasants ranging through the dales chasing cattle and driving them with sticks to tumbledown pens made of fieldstone once the brightblade family had owned a vast herd of cattle but those had been quickly lost in the upheavals that toppled the great knightly estates throughout the country who knew but that the scrawny illtended beasts that sturm now saw shuffling over the hills were offspring of the prime brightblade herd it wasnt cattle or land that bothered sturm about the fall of the solamnic knights such things were not the true mea sure of a knights worth it was the injustice of it the com mon folk blamed the cataclysm and the troubles that followed on the arrogant pride of the knights as if the knights of solamnia could turn the whole world on its ear and split the land asunder sturm stopped in his tracks his hands were clenched into fists so tight that his knuckles were blanched white he let go of his anger and slowly opened his fists patience he admonished himself a knight must have selfcontrol or he is no better than a barbarian berserker from the time sturm gained the road at the stone bridge to late afternoon of the following day he met no other trav elers this struck him as ominous especially as he got near er to garnet drovers and merchant caravans always moved from town to town timing their arrivals to the local market day an empty road indicated that something or someone was keeping the travelers at home the road began to rise and wind as the hills of garnet grew out of the plain here he found signs of traffic hoof prints wheel tracks and marks of bare and booted feet the prints multiplied until it seemed a small army had marched through not long before sturm saw smoke rising from around a bend he shifted the pommel of his sword forward to be convenient to his hand he could smell the smoke now slowly the scene came into view several heavy wagons were overturned and burning in the road from the extent of the damage already done the fire must have started hours before crows and other carrion birds stirred at his approach between two gutted wagons sturm found bodies one thickwaisted and richly dressed obviously was a successful merchant he had two arrows in his chest beside him was a younger man with the stump of a broken mace still clutched in his hand a groan brought sturm running a few yards away a big wellmuscled man sat with his back against a scrub pine he was a warrior his body bled from a dozen wounds and arrayed at the warriors feet were six dead goblins water moaned the fighter sturm put a hand behind the warriors head and raised his bottle to the mans parched lips what happened here asked sturm bandits attacked wagons we fought the big man coughed too many sturm examined the fighters wounds he didnt have to be a healer to know the warrior was doomed and because the man was a warrior sturm told him so thank you he said sturm asked if he could do any thing to make the man more comfortable no but pala dine bless you for your mercy something rustled behind the pine sturm reached for his sword then saw the broad brown muzzle of a horse poke through the branches the dying warrior called the animal by name brumbar he said good fellow the horse pushed through the scrub he was an enormous animal as black as coal brumbar dropped his nose to nuzzle his mas ters face i see that you are a man of arms rasped the warrior to sturm i beg you take brumbar as your mount when i am dead i will sturm said gently is there anyone in garnet i can tell about your fated the man slowly closed his eyes no one but do not go to garnet if you value your life his chin fell to his chest but why sturm asked why shouldnt i go to the city loosen my breastplate sturm undid the sraps and pulled the steel cuirass aside beneath the armor the man wore a quilted shirt embroi dered over his heart was a small red rose sturm stared the dying man was a knight of the orders highest rank the order of the rose only solamnic knights of noble lineage could enter that exalted brotherhood the forces that destroyed the knights control garnet the man said his breath came in ragged gasps i know you are one of us it would not be safe for you there assassins who are you what is your name sturm asked franti cally but the knight of the rose would never again speak sturm gave the brave fighter an honorable burial it was well after sundown when he finished he collected brumbar and went through the saddlebags thrown across the horses rump there were dried rations in one bag and in the other surprisingly were hundreds of coins all of them small cop per pieces sturm understood the dead knight was living incognito because of the widespread hatred of the order hed adopted the guise of a guard for hire and took his wages in copper no one would ever expect a knight of the rose to live so humbly sturm left the garnet road he chose another trail through the highlands one not frequented by traders or he hoped bandits garnet he passed in the night he saw the glow of its street lamps in the distance reining in brumbar he listened wind whirled around the mountain passes a wolf gave voice far away chapter solamnia his new horse was a steady plodding beast brum bar in old dwarvish meant black bear black he was and bearishly stolid sturm didnt mind the kind of traveling he was doing now was better suited to a steady animal rath er than some excitable fragile charger brumbar had a back so broad that sturm imagined he could put his feet up on the animals nodding neck and take a nap festooned with sturms pack and other belongings brumbar kept a jingling pace all day long the lemish forest thinned out to a few spindly pines growing weakly amid the grassy undergrowth it was hot on the plain and very dry sturm began to ration his water when the streams and springs started getting fewer and far ther between being off the road he saw few people this southernmost finger of the solamnic plain thrust between the garnet mountains and the lemish forest was too dry for cattle and farming there were no robbers here either there was nothing to steal alone sturm took time to reflect on things since he and kitiara had left solace so many weeks ago hed come to realize that there was danger on the horizon everywhere the strange lizardlike mercenaries he had heard called dra conians had been seen in port cities caches of weapons being moved about large numbers of brigands infesting the roads of the northern countries dark magic at work gob lins led by a human magician what was the common thread in all this he wondered war invasion evil magic sturm gave brumbar a kick and the big horse shuffled into a trot a welter of vague impressions and shrouded memories surfaced in his mind the visions hed had on lunitari were lost to him in detail but shadows of them remained dimly the strongest of these was that his father was alive somewhere there was something about the old castle too and death that was somehow linked to lingering impressions of kitiaras oh kit where are you now the days shimmering heat built towers of black clouds in the sky lightning danced far away and peals of thunder crossed the grassland long after the flashes of lightning were gone the smell of rain pulled brumbar toward the storm and sturm let him go he was thirsty too the storm seemed to retreat from them even as they rode to meet it brumbar splashed through gullies running fast with rainwater the air was wet oppressive yet the edge of the rain receded from sturms approach the lightning played about a stand of pines to the east sturm reined away from the dangerous display but brumbar had other ideas puffing hard through his dry throat the horse headed straight for the trees light steamy drops of rain began to hit them brumbar cantered heavily through the widely spaced trees the rain fell harder ahead sturm saw a dark shape flit between the pines he blotted water from his eyes and looked again a rider in a flowing cape was weaving among the trees now and then the pale oval of a face turned back as if the rider were peering over his shoulder at sturm he seemed to have a long mustache much like sturms own brumbar slowed by a shallow pool of water but sturm spurred him on he was curious about the other rider and wanted to catch up to him hello called sturm could i talk to you a bolt from the churning sky struck the ground a score of yards away leaving a smoking crater in the grass the rider didnt respond to sturms call but continued to weave around the pines sturm slapped the reins across his horses neck and brumbar launched into a jarring gallop they were closing on the stranger the riders dark hair was slicked down by the driving rain he did indeed have a long mustache symbol of the knights of solamnia the strangers horse was light and agile but it must have been running hard too long brumbar closed rapidly only the passing of a tree between them kept sturm from reach ing out to grab the other mans lashing cape wait sturm shouted stop i want to talk to you the strangers horse went hard to the left circling around sturm the man drew up and stopped thirty yards away brumbar shuddered to a halt the wind was up and blowing rain into sturms face so he turned his horse around the stranger was waiting for him i didnt mean to chase you sturm called out but he never heard the stroke of lightning that hit the ground between him and the stranger nor did he feel it in one instant he was talking and in the next he was lying on the muddy grass with rain pattering on his face his arms and legs were leaden and weak a dark form loomed over him for a second he was afraid lying there helpless sturm was easy prey for a thief or assassin the stranger still horsed towered over him against the gray sky with the rain in his eyes all sturm could see of him was dark hair high forehead and drooping mustache the cape was close about the mans shoulders which were wide and powerful the stranger sat in the saddle looking down at sturm and saying nothing sturm managed to gasp who are you the man parted the cape revealing the hilt of a large sword sturm made out the shape of the pommel and some of the filigree work with a start he realized that he knew that sword it was his fathers beware of merinsaard said the man in a voice sturm didnt recognize with tremendous effort sturm got to his knees who are you he reached out a muddy hand to the stranger where he should have touched the leg of the mans horse he met nothing horse and rider vanished silently and com pletely sturm staggered to his feet the rain was over already the sun was poking through the tattered clouds brumbar was several yards away drinking from a puddle nearby a pine tree had been blasted to smoking splinters by lightning sturm put his face in his hands had he seen what he thought hed seen who was the phantom rider and what was merinsaard a person a place wearily he mounted brumbar the big horse shifted under sturms weight and his broad hooves squelched in the mud sturm looked around there were no other hoof prints in sight besides brumbars though described as a plain the country of solamnia was not perfectly flat as were say the plains of dust there were ridges and gullies dry creek beds and small stands of trees that grew like islands in the midst of the grassy steppe land sturm rode north at an easy pace eating wild pears off the trees and filling his water bottle from the herders wells he soon found himself moving among small herds of cat tle tended and guarded by hardlooking peasants with mauls and bows they watched him closely as he rode by raiders were common and in their eyes he might have been a scout for a larger band of rustlers also sturm wore the mustache and horned helmet of a solamnic knight items not calculated to make him popular among the people who had overthrown the order sturm didnt care he rode proudly sword turned out to show that he was ready for trouble at night he took special care with polishing his hel met boots and sword to make them shine he decided to avoid the city of solanthus after the over throw solanthus had proclaimed itself a free city not sub ordinate to anyone but its own guildmasters sturm had heard of several knights friends and compatriots of his father who had been imprisoned and executed in solan thus while he was willing to proclaim his heritage in open country he saw no reason to walk into the city and put his head into a noose the country beyond solanthus sloped gently down to the vingaard river it was rich land the clods turned up by brumbars ironshod hooves were black and fertile the herds were thicker the closer to the river he got he spent an entire day guiding brumbar through ranks of rusty brown cows and calves the heat and dust were so bad that he traded his helmet for a cloth bandanna like the herd riders wore the herds converged on the ford of kerdu an artificial shallows created centuries before by the solamnic knights another benefit that the common folk had forgotten thousands of small stones were dumped into the vingaard river to make a fording place as the river slowly scoured the stones away each new generation on the river banks had to renew the ford with its own gathering of stones a sort of winter festival had developed around the collecting and dumping of rocks in the river it soon became too congested for sturm to ride so he got off brumbar and led the horse by his bridle here by the river the days heat rapidly dispersed after sunset sturm walked down to the river bank where a hundred campfires blazed the herders were settling for the night a halfdozen sunbrowned faces turned up as sturm approached the nearest camphe raised his palm and said my hands are open the traditional herders greeting sit said the herd leader identified by the carved steer horn that he wore on a thong around his neck sturm tied brumbar to a small tree and joined the men sturm he said sitting onthar said the leader he pointed to the other men in turn rorin frijje ostimar and belingen sturm nodded to each one share the pot said onthar a black kettle hung over the fire each man had to provide some ingredient in order to share the common meal herders stew an expression known throughout krynn as meaning a little bit of every thing sturm lifted the flap of his pack and saw the last of his provisions an inchthick slab of salt pork two carrots and a stoppered gourd half full of rye flour he squatted by the kettle took out his knife and started slicing the meat been a good season he asked politely dry said onthar too dry fodder on the lower plain is blowing away no sickness though observed frijje whose straw colored hair hung in two long braids we havent lost a sin gle calf to screwfoot or blue blister shoving wispy red hair from his eyes rorin said lot of raiders he whetted a wickedlooking axe on a smooth gray stone men and goblins together in the same gang ive seen that too sturm said farther south in caergoth and garnet onthar regarded him with one thin brown eyebrow raised youre not from around here are you sturm finished the salt pork and started slicing the car rots i was born in solamnia but grew up in solace raise a lot of pigs down there i hear ostimar said his voice was deep and resonant seemingly at odds with his small height and skinny body yes quite a lot where you headed sturm asked onthar north looking for work he stopped cutting why not if i can get some he said ever drive cattle before no but i can ride ostimar and belingen snorted derisively but onthar said we lost a man to goblin raiders two weeks ago and that left us with a hole in our drag line all you have to do is keep the beasts going ahead well be crossing the vingaard tomorrow heading for the keep the keep but its been deserted for years sturm said buyer there sounds fine whats the pay four coppers a day payable when you leave us sturm knew he was supposed to haggle so he said i couldnt do it for less than eight coppers a day eight exclaimed frijje and him a show rider five might be possible said onthar sturm shook the gourd to break up the lumps of flour six onthar grinned showing several missing teeth six it is not too much flour now were cooking stew not baking bread sturm stirred in a handful of gray rye flour rorin gave him a copper bowl and spoon the stew was dished up and the men ate quickly and silently then they passed a skin around sturm took a swig he almost choked the bag held a potent fermented cider he swallowed and passed the skin on whos buying cattle at the keep he said after everyone had eaten and drunk dont know onthar admitted men have been coming back from vingaard keep for weeks with tales of gold say ing there is a buyer up there paying top coin for good beasts so the keep is where were going the fire died down frijje produced a handwhittled flute and began to blow lonely lilting notes the herders curled up on their single blankets and went to sleep sturm unsad dled brumbar and curried him he led the horse to the river for a drink and returned him to the sapling that done he made a bed with his blanket and the saddle the sky was clear the silver moon was low in the south while lunitari was climbing toward its zenith sturm gazed at the distant red globe had he really trod its crimson soil had he really fought treemen seen and ridden giant ants and freed a chatter box dragon from an obelisk of red marble here on krynn among the simple direct herdsmen such memories were like a mad dream fevered images now banished by the more practical concerns of sturms life the young knight slept and dreamed that he was gallop ing through solace pursuing a caped man who carried his fathers sword he never gained on the stranger the vallen wood trees were bathed in a red glow and all around sturm felt the cold air echo with the sound of a womans laughter chapter the ford of kerdu sturm was roughly shaken awake before the sun was up all along the rivers south bank the herders were stirring packing their meager possessions on their horses and preparing for another days move sturm had no time for anything other than a brief cup of water frijje thrust some jerky in his hand and told him to mount up belingen galloped to him and tossed him a light wooden pole with a bronze leafshaped head this was his herd goad when the cows were balky or wanted to wander in the wrong direction he was to poke them with the goad to set them straight and woe to you if you cut the hide belingen said onthar prides himself on his herd not being scarred with an arrogant toss of his head belingen spurred his horse back to the front of the herd the cattle more than nine hundred head sensed the rise in activity and surged from side to side against the fringe riders two other herds had rightofway over onthars so the men had to bide their time as the other two swarms of cattle forded the river ahead of them the kerdu passage was a quartermile wide and more than half a mile across to the other bank the fords edges fell away sharply and osti mar warned sturm not to stray off the stones ive seen men and horses drop off the edge and never come up he cautioned nothing ever found but their goads and bandannas floating on the water ill keep that in mind sturm replied the herd settled into a standard oval formation sturm couched his goad under his left arm the bar was eight feet long and he could easily touch the ground with it even from as high a perch as brumbars back indeed sturms own height placed on the broad back of the garnet horse made him taller than any other rider in the group he could see far across the tight mass of cows their dusty coats and long horns always shifting always moving even when the herd itself was not in forward motion a horn blasted from the far shore signaling that the pre vious herd had cleared the ford onthar stood in his stirrups and whipped his goad back and forth there was a black pennant fixed to the tip the riders whistled and shouted to stir the beasts forward a wall of beef surged toward sturm but he yelled and waved the goad before the cows faces the animals turned away to follow those in front the track down to the river was a morass thousands of cattle and horses had churned it up and under the rising sun the mud stank onthar and the front riders splashed into the vingaard with the herd bulls the steers and cows came after and the rear riders were last of all the stench and bit ing flies over the river were ferocious brumbar put his heavy feet into the water his iron shoes suited to paved roads did not provide a very sure grip on the round wet rocks despite the uncertain footing brum bar went on unperturbed and then perhaps twenty yards into the river sturms horse slid sideways off the rocky ford water rushed over sturms head he immediately kicked free of the stirrups and thrust up for the surface his head burst into the air and he took a deep breath brumbar was out in the stream swimming steadily for the south shore frijje reined up and shouted you all right sturm yes the stupid horse slid off the ford he swam a few strokes toward the herdsman frijje extended the butt of this goad for sturm to grab and hauled the soaked knight to the fords sloping edge sturm stood up atop the stones the water was only kneedeep can you ride me across frijje he asked cant leave the herd was the reply youll just have to catch up frijje rode on long braids bouncing on his back sturm slogged through the muddy water back to the south bank where brumbar had climbed out and was drying off in the morning sun come here you ignorant brute sturm said then smiled an ignorant brute brumbar might be but the horse stood quietly after his watery ordeal calmly awaiting his riders pleasure sturm swung into the saddle and twisted brumbars head onthars herd was almost to the other shore sturm had lost his goad and his pride had taken a beating too but he wasnt finished heyah he cried snapping the reins on brumbars neck the horse took off big feet pounding down the bank and into the river straight down the center of the ford they went brumbar kicking up an impressive froth as he gal loped they gained the north side just as the last herder rorin was leaving the water have a good swim rorin asked grinning not too bad sturm responded sheepishly lend me a goad will you ive got to get back to my place rorin yanked an extra pole from a boot on his horses neck and tossed it to sturm sturm caught it neatly the cattle churned over the sandy flood plain on the vin gaards north side here at last brumbars shoes proved their worth while the herders unshod ponies floundered in the loose sand sturm and brumbar headed off a dangerous side movement by the rear third of the herd like some huge living tapestry the herd and its riders climbed the bank to the drier grasscovered plain of northern solamnia once they were well clear of the river crossing onthar led them into a wide gully and halted the herd keep your place he said as he rode up to sturm onthar scanned the river for stragglers i hear you fell in he add ed iron horseshoes and wet rocks dont make for a firm grip sturm said uhhuh you lose the goad i gave you yes onthar sturm said rorin lent me another lost goad costs two coppers ill deduct it from your pay onthar swung around and rode on to speak with rorin the more sturm thought about it the angrier he got with onthar to charge for the lost goad seemed downright petty then the teachings of the measure reminded sturm to see the situation from onthars point of view maybe they hadnt known brumbar was shod ostimar did advise him to stay away from the fords edge onthar had originally paid for the goad hed lost given the scarcity of hard money in a life like herding charging two coppers for a lost stick wasnt petty it was absolutely necessary sturm pulled off his bandanna and wrung it out his clothes would dry rapidly in the sun and there was a long days ride still to go he straightened in the saddle and thought of himself as being on a war foray alert yet relaxed thats the way his old friend soren had practiced soldiering as sergeant of the castle guard for sturms father a braver more devoted man had never lived onthar circumnavigated the herd and when he was satis fied that all was in order he returned to the head and sig naled to resume the drive the bawling calves and cows slowly came about as onthar led them north and east toward vingaard keep some sixty miles away it was a long hard day and the herders spent every min ute of it in the saddle sturm had always thought of himself as an accomplished longdistance rider but compared to onthars men he was a tenderfoot after all except that it wasnt his feet that grew tender the herders rotated positions moving slowly counter clockwise around the herd the midday meal such as it was was eaten when a man reached the front then there were no cows to watch only the lay of the land ahead sad dle food was jerky and cheese and raw onions all washed down with bitter cider the sun was still well up when onthar called a halt sturm estimated that theyd covered twentyfive miles since crossing the river frijje belingen and rorin pushed the herd into a shallow ravine in the middle of the grassland judging by the trampled grass and scoured ground this pit had been used by previous herds on their way north osti mar and onthar took sturm on a circuit of the pit and showed him how to set up the fence that would keep the ani mals from wandering in the night fence sturm said he hadnt seen anyone carrying anything as bulky as a fence onthar pulled a wooden stake about two feet long with a fork at the top from a canvas satchel and stuck it in the ground he tied the end of a length of rope to the fork and stretched it out eight or ten feet where ostimar set another stake on and on this went until the whole herd was sur rounded by a single thickness of rope and this flimsy barrier will keep them in asked sturm cows and steers arent real wise ostimar explained theyll think they cant push through the rope so they wont try course if a real panic set in a stone wall wouldnt stop em what would frighten them that much wolves noted ostimar or men the herders camped on the highest ground overlooking the pit rorin and frijje scythed down sheafs of tall grass for cattle fodder but the herd would get no water until the next day when they reached branthas pond onthar built a fire from windblown twigs gleaned from the grass the fire drew the other herders in the common kettle was brought out and hung from its peg over the flames each man stooped over the pot and added something water cheese flour bits of meat vegetables and fruit when the pot was full frijje knelt by the fire and stirred it not a bad day said rorin hot ostimar pointed out should rain some of us dont mind taking a swim instead of work ing belingen cracked sturm sensed a challenge in his eyes some of us ought to get wet more often he parried it would help to cut the smell frijje stopped stirring the pot the herders looked at sturm intently belingen said coldly only a city fool would ride a shod horse across a river ford true enough sturm countered how many times did you do it belingen before you thought to remove your horses shoes he saw the estwilder close one hand into a fist sturm knew that the only way he could keep the respect of these rough simple men was to match belingen insult for insult if he showed any softness real or imagined they would let belingen treat sturm any way he liked the next thing sturm knew onthar was on his feet shouting get up get up you idiots raiders raiders are after the herd a rumble of massed hooves and screams proved that onthar was telling the truth get my sword sturm said running to find brumbar the herders vaulted onto their short ponies and pulled their goads out of the ground sturm climbed heavily onto brumbar drawing his sword he spurred after his com rades in the twilight he could see that the attackers outnum bered onthar and his men perhaps a dozen the raiders wore fantastic masks with glaring painted eyes and horns tusks and garish frills made of wildly painted leather they were armed with sabers and short bows several steers were already down lying on their sides with arrows sticking out onthar charged into the pack of yelling thieves his goad took one raider in the chest but the slim shaft snapped the cattle thief toppled off his horse with thirty inches of goad buried in his chest onthar shouted to rorin who slapped a new weapon into his leaders hand sturm angled to the other side of the raider band brum bar burst through the ranks of the raiders lighter beasts overturning two of them sturm cut down one bowarmed thief wearing a horrible leering mask another took his place slashing hard with a crudely forged saber sturm turned the thin curved blade and thrust home through the raiders throat the thiefs body fell forward but was caught in the stirrups the horse galloped away from the fight the dead man dragging behind the mounted thieves seemed to be getting the worst of it until sturm realized that there were foes on foot as well masked figures stole out of the grass and fell on the arrow shot animals as the battle raged around them they swiftly skinned and butchered the steers the raiders left hide and carcass but carried away whole sides of beef frijje cut off one pairs escape by spearing one and trampling the other it was a brutal nasty fight sturm felt a sharp blow on his back as he pivoted brum bar he felt a short arrow sticking from his back the raider who had loosed it was only a few yards away the popeyed face on the leather mask reflected its wearers obvious sur prise that sturm hadnt fallen the raider couldnt know that sturm still wore his mail shirt under his riding tunic sturm flew at the archer the raider turned to flee but brumbars long legs rapidly outgained the thiefs short legged pony some instinct for mercy made sturm turn away his sword edge and he brought the flat of the tem pered blade down on the raiders head the thief threw up his hands and slid sideways off his pony the other raiders were in hot flight onthars men chased them some way but quickly returned to guard the rest of the herd sturm dismounted and dragged the unconscious raid er to brumbar he threw the light body across the horse and led them back to onthar filthy dirteating swine onthar said spitting they got four the robbers eat well tonight not all of them sturm said at least four of the raiders were dead i caught one the herders clustered around frijje grabbed the raider by his characteristic ponytail and jerked his head back still out cold frijje tore the painted mask away haw its a girl he grunted it was indeed a girl of maybe fifteen or sixteen years her blond hair was greasy and limp and her face was smeared with paint from the mask phew said rorin she stinks sturm hadnt noticed the herders themselves were rather pungent slit her throat and leave her on the steppe for the others to find belingen advised theyll learn not to steal from onthars herd no said sturm interposing himself between the uncon scious girl and the others shes a thief ostimar protested shes unarmed and unconscious sturm insisted hes right onthar said after a moments reflection shes worth more to us alive anyway how so onthar asked rorin hostage keep the others of her band away maybe too much trouble belingen grumbled i say just kill her and be done with it its not for you to say onthar replied sturm caught her shes his now he can do whatever he wants with her sturm flushed slightly when rorin and frijje laughed but he said i shall follow your advice onthar well keep her as a hostage the herd leader nodded shes your problem then you are responsible for anything she does and what she eats comes out of your pay hed expected that agreed said sturm the girl groaned rorin grabbed her by the back of her hairy hide chaps and dragged her off brumbar he held her up by the scruff of the neck the girl shook her head and opened her eyes matroya she cried upon seeing her captors she tried to run but rorin held her feet off the ground she kicked him on the shin until he threw her to the ground her hand flashed to her waist and came up with a short doubleedged knife sturm clamped his strong hand over hers and plucked the little skinning knife away matroya the girl repeated helplessly what is she saying sturm asked thats an eastern dialect onthar said but wager she speaks our tongue dont you girl the girls dark blue eyes flickered with recognition yes i see you do sturm lifted the girl gently to her feet whats your name he said quietly tervy she pronounced this with a ch sound like tchairvee well tervy youre going to be staying with the herd a lot longer than you expected you kill me now i dont think so sturm said dryly they want kill me gasped the girl her eyes darting at the herders be still sturm said no one will hurt you if you do as youre told onthar dislodged the arrow from sturms tunic and hand ed it to the young knight a souvenir he said tervy regarded the arrow quizzically then looked up at sturm i shoot you you not bleed not die why so he pulled up his tunic and showed her the hiplength shirt of mail he wore tervy had never seen armor before she hesitantly put out a dirty hand to touch the metal mesh iron skin she uttered with awe yes iron skin it stops arrows and most swords now ive captured you and youre going to stay with me if you behave ill feed and take care of you if youre wicked ill hobble you and make you walk behind the cattle i do as you say ironskin thus sturm acquired a prisoner a hostage a servant and a nickname from that time on the herders called him ironskin chapter tervy and ironskin by the time the herders returned from repulsing the raiders dinner was congealed it was too dark to hunt for more kindling so onthar ordered frijje to collect some chips from the cattle pit faw he grumbled thats a dirty job i know make the girl do it onthar deferred to sturm i doubt she could get much filthier sturm admitted ill go with her tervy showed no sign of displeasure when sturm explained what she was to do she plunged into the herd shoving aside yearling calves and cows she filled a bandan na with the few pats that were dry enough and came back out showing them to sturm she said enough enough take them to frijje the coals were stirred and the fire blazed up again the stew was dished out tervy watched expectantly licking her lips sturm asked for another bowl there are none ostimar said sullenly not for raider scum sturm ate only a third of his portion and gave the rest to tervy she ate wolfishly slapping gobs of thick stew into her mouth with her dirty fingers even rorin the least clean of the herders was disgusted when it was time to bed down sturm asked should someone stay awake in case the raiders return they wont come back onthar assured him some other band might not at night grunted rorin hunkering down on his blanket and why is that raiders dont move at night ostimar explained wolvesll get em in the dark he pulled his horsehair blan ket up to his chin and slipped his rolled bandanna down over his eyes wolves the herdsmen didnt seem worried about wolves sturm mentioned as much to frijje the last one awake onthar has a charm against wolves he said he hasnt lost a beast to wolves in three years gnight soon the circle around the campfire was filled with soft snores and wheezes sturm watched tervy sitting with her knees tucked under her chin staring at the dying fire do i have to tie you up he said to her or will you behave i not run tervy replied out there is tyinsk wolves he smiled at her how old are you tervy say how many years have you lived she looked back over her shoulder her brow furrowed with incomprehension how long ago were you born sturm said baby doesnt know when born maybe her people were too primitive to count the years or perhaps it wasnt important probably few of them survived to middle years do you have a family mother brothers and sisters only uncle he dead out there you cut here to here she said running a finger across her throat he felt a twinge of shame im sorry sturm said regretfully i didnt know she shrugged indifferently he kicked his bedroll so that it opened feet to the fire sturm lay down dont worry tervy ill look after you youre my responsibility but for how long he wondered ironskin keep tervy tervy not run away sturm pillowed his head on his arm and dropped off to sleep hours later the sharp howl of a wolf roused him from slumber he tried to sit up but found that a weight held him down it was tervy she had crawled atop sturm and gone to sleep her arms draped over him sturm eased the girl to one side she fought sleepily say ing if charm fail wolves come have to get me before get you protection smiling he ordered her in hushed tones to do as he said i can protect myself he assured her tervy curled up on a narrow strip of his blanket and returned to sleep tervy spent half the morning trotting alongside sturm and brumbar he had offered to let her ride but she insisted on keeping pace on foot however as the northern plains summer sun took its toll tervy relented and hopped on brumbars rump behind sturm this the biggest horse in the world she declared he laughed no not very likely her conclusion wasnt difficult to understand considering that brumbar was half again as tall and twice as heavy as the average plains pony at midday the herd caught wind of branthas pond the pond had been built by brantha of kallimar yet another solamnic knight years before the pool was two hun dred yards across a perfect circle whose shore was paved with blocks of granite from the vingaard mountains the thirsty cattle quickened their pace the herders had to concentrate at the head of the moving mass to discourage the animals from breaking into a dangerous stampede at first sturm was mystified by their haste but tervy sniffed the air and informed him that she too could smell the water within an hour the silverblue disk of branthas pond came into view another herd far larger than onthars was being driven away horses wagons carts and their occu pants clustered around the ponds edge sturms own interest quickened stimulated by the impending contact with new people the herdsmen were good fellows well there was belingen but they were taci turn and rather dull in conversation sturm had actually begun to miss the distracting talk of the gnomes the travelers abandoned the ponds edge when they heard the massed mooing of onthars herd the cattle broke ranks and lined the shore burying their peeling pink noses in the green water sturm pulled brumbar up short tervy threw a leg over and dropped off she ran toward the pond hey what are you doing sturm called before his eyes the girl stripped off her collection of skins and vaulted onto the back of a drinking cow she stood up and walked across the hind ends of two more beasts then dived into the water sturm urged brumbar down to the granite paving the girl swam in short quick strokes to the center of the pond and disappeared sturm watched the green surface no bubbles no turbulence other than that created by the drinking cattle then tervy burst out of the water not ten feet from sturm scattering the cows who were drinking there give hand she said and sturm leaned down to pull her out of the water i not stink now hey not as much he admitted he handed her clothes to her and tried not to let his embarrassment show did you jump in because we said you smelled i not care what they speak tervy said tossing her shoulder at onthar and his men i not want ironskin to smell me bad he was touched by her gesture sturm turned brumbar around and rode out of the congested pond bank he teth ered his horse with onthars ponies and saw the herders squatted on the ground eating whatever they could scrounge from their rucksacks tervy was hungry too she snitched a flake of jerky from belingens bag he caught her at it and boxed her ears she promptly put a thumb in his eye belingen howled with rage and groped for his skinning knife put it away said sturm belingen found himself staring up thirtyfour inches of polished steel that raider wench nearly put my eye out he snarled you punched her pretty good that should satisfy you or are you fighting with girls now sturm decided to take the girl to the caravan wagons and see what he could buy to eat tervys ponytail dripped water down her back as she eagerly trotted along beside him ironskin will truly buy food with money she said incredulous of course i dont steal sturm said you have much money not so much he said im not rich that i figure rich man always steal tervy said sturm had to smile at the blunt wisdom of her statement he was smiling a lot lately he suddenly realized sturm found an abanasinian group that was journeying to palanthas besides the hired driver there was a merce nary a woman soothsayer and an elderly tanner and his apprentice sturm swapped stories of solace with them for a while then came away with slices of dried apple beaded on a string some pressed raisins and a whole smoked chicken for the fine victuals he dipped into the purse that the knight of the rose had given him and paid twenty coppers well more than his total wages as a herdsman tervy danced around him fairly bursting to get at the food the apples didnt interest her but she devoured most of the chicken down to some of the small bones sturm untied the cheesecloth bundle that held the raisins what that tervy said chicken grease smeared across her face raisins sturm said dried grapes try some she grabbed a handful and stuffed them into her mouth umm sweet spilling raisins all around she finished the first handful and reached for another sturm swatted her hand you eat all those she said wideeyed no he said you can eat them if you do it in a civilized manner like this he picked up four raisins put them in the palm of his left hand and ate them one by one with his right openmouthed with curiosity tervy duplicated his artions precisely except when it came to getting the raisins from her hand to her mouth one at a time too slow she declared and crammed them all in at once sturm pulled her wrist down people will stop treating you like a savage when you stop acting like one he said now do it the way i showed you this time she did it just right you eat like this all time asked tervy i do said sturm ah she exclaimed knowingly you big man nobody steal your food i little eat fast so nobody steal my food no ones going to take food away from you here take your time and enjoy it when they had finished their meal they strolled back to the herders camp tervy gazed at sturm with a mixture of awe and amusement onthar announced that it would take only two more days to reach vingaard keep once the cattle were sold each man would be paid his wages and could sign on for another drive if he so desired sturm was the only one to decline i have other business in the north he stated frijje asked him what im looking for my father oh whats his name asked onthar angriff brightblade none of the herders responded to this disclosure however behind sturm belingen stiffened his mouth dropped open to speak but he closed it without saying a word well i hope you find him onthar said youre a fair hand with cattle and good with that sword these others they dont know a sword from a sharpened stick thank you onthar sturm said traveling compan ions help shorten the journey frijje played his pipe a while tervy who had been sitting by sturms side arms wrapped around her shins was won derstruck by the funny noises that the young herdsman was making seeing her interest frijje handed her the flute ter vy blew in the end as frijje had done but could only make a faint unmusical rasp she flung the pipe back to frijje magic she stated flatly no my girl its all skill he dusted the dirt from the mouthpiece and trilled a fast scale you move fingers like a cleverman she pointed out believe what you want frijje lay back and played a slow ballad sturm put his head down but tervy continued to watch frijje as long as he played in the days that followed tervys command of language increased dramatically she told sturm that among her peo ple no one spoke without leave from the head man so that by habit they all spoke in clipped short sentences she had learned the common tongue in order to be a scout tervys raider band had stalked onthars herd for more than eight hours before striking we didnt know you had a sword she said if we know if we had known wed have used another plan such as she grinned wouldve jumped you first these conversations took place while sturm worked the herd and tervy rode behind him the resilient tervy wasnt the least bit worn from riding the hard pillion all day and in the evening when the communal stew pot came out she earned her portion of sturms meal by cleaning and oiling his boots his sword and sword belt youve picked up a squire belingen said as tervy dili gently buffed sturms boots with a piece of sheepskin um and in a year or two shell be a fine companion on cold nights ostimar added with a wicked grin why wait so long rorin said the herders laughed roughly what do they mean tervy asked never mind sturm said for all her toughness tervy was completely innocent and sturm saw no reason for her to change chapter the trader at vingaard keep the squat fortifications of vingaard keep loomed over the lowlying plain with a presence that far exceeded its modest height onthar led the herd up out of a floodcut gully and the keep stood out like a mountain peak though they were still miles away sturm was near the front position then and the sight of the ancient knightly fortress filled him with excitement and longing from vingaard castle bright blade was only a days ride why do people build such places tervy asked from behind him a keep is a stronghold to live in and defend against attacks sturm said lived in by other ironskins yes and their families ironskins have families well of course where do you think little ironski knights come from he asked amused a haze hung over the old keep which was little more than a ruin these days after the cataclysm marauders had burned the keep the walls still stood but the tower was an empty shell closer in the haze proved to be dust and smoke from tramping feet and campfires a sizable body of troops was encamped around the outer wall no banners flew sturm could not tell whose troops they were but their presence explained the need for large numbers of cattle such an army needed huge amounts of food riders slipped in on both sides observing the oncoming herd sturm scrutinized them in return their armor was plain undistinguished as to origin or age the cavalry men wore barred visors on their helmets and carried long lances their proportions appeared human but they kept to such a distance that it was impossible to be sure tervy was intrigued more ironskins she breathed sturm corrected her not all men in armor are knights he said you be very careful around them they may be evil he felt her thin arms tighten a little around his waist whatever her failings in education tervy knew evil the keep grew larger as the day wore on and the outrid ers thickened on the herds flanks sturm rode past onthar while making his circuit what do you make of those men asked sturm cavalry onthar said he chewed a long blade of grass glad to see em wont be any raiders about with them out there onthar halted at midday for a word with his men i do the talking and i do the dealing any man speaks out of turn at a parley like this loses his head i dont know if these are mercenaries or some warlords new army but i dont want any trouble so keep your mouths closed and your hands empty half a mile from the keep a column of horsemen galloped out to meet the herd sturm was on the right edge of the for mation then and he saw the men ride out onthar met them and the cattle milled to a stop and fell to cropping the grass sturm couldnt hear what was being said but tervy mumbled something he said what did you say im catching their words she replied youre what catching their words if you watch their mouths move you can catch the words they speak even if youre too far away to hear them sturm turned sharply to her youre jesting with me cut my heart out if i lie ironskin the man onthar said he has brought his animals because he heard a great lord was buying cattle for top coin and the man in the iron hat said yes they can use all the fresh meat they can get can you really tell what they are saying i can if you let me look sturm wheeled brumbar around so that tervy had the best view of the parley onthar says he will bargain with the great lord himself no one else iron hat says i speak for the great lord in small things listen to me onthar says my herd is not a small thing either the great lord speaks to me or i will drive the cattle over the mountains to palanthas where beef always commands a high price iron hat is angry but he says i will go and speak to the great lord wait and i will return with his tidings she smiled at sturm how was that the cavalry officer did in fact bring his horse around and gallop back to the keep sturm asked where did you learn such a trick an old man in our band practiced this art he was the best scout on the plain he could catch words true from a bowshot away he taught me before he died where did he learn it from a kender he said they waited in the broiling sun until the cavalryman returned his fine mount pranced out to where onthar sat slouched on his stubby pony tervy squinted into the glare and caught their words again he says to drive the herd into the baney the bailey bailey sturm said the courtyard inside the keep yes and the great lord will treat with you personally onthar agrees le with many whistles and pricks of the goad the herders got the cattle moving again the nine hundred beasts fun neled into the keeps gate the bailey easily accommodated the animals when the last calves were spanked bawling into the gate soldiers drew the bars shut there were clusters of tents all along the outer wall onthar and his men tethered their horses on a picket line and followed a plumed soldier along the tent line are these all the men you have said the soldier his face was hidden by his visor i would have thought such a large herd would require more handlers not if the men are good onthar said sturm was counting tents four men per tent sixty tents so far he had an uncomfortable feeling about this they came upon a very large tent trimmed with dark blue brocade and golden fringe guards snapped to atten tion and crossed halberds at their approach the visored soldier spoke to them presenting onthar and his company the guards resumed normal positions the plumed officer extended his hand and the herders went in alone the interior was sumptuous carpets covered the ground and tapestries hanging from the ridge poles gave the illusion of being in a solid building while the others were gawking at the richness of their surroundings sturm was staring at the designs of the rugs and wall hangings the recurring motif was that of a rampant red dragon clutching a sheaf of spears in one claw and a crown in the other ironskin tervy said too loudly not now a curtain of shimmering red beads closed the corridor onthar feigned disinterest and swept the curtain aside sturm thought the red beads looked very much like rubies two halberds swung down to bar onthars progress he regarded the guards idly as if hed seen such beings many times and they bored him beyond the guards a large pow erfully built man sat at a threelegged table that was draped with a golden cloth he wore scale armor enameled in red and blue and a fearsome helmet sat facing outward on the goldtopped table the man looked up his hair was white though he was by no means elderly it swept back from his massive brow to fall around his shoulders his skin was pale come in you are onthar the herdsman are you not said the man i am my lord may i ask what i shall call you i am merinsaard lord of bayarn sturm clenched his fists tightly at his sides merinsaard the name spoken by sturms storm phantom sturm con centrated on the hard face and long white hair danger ema nated from this man sturm tried to catch onthars eye but could not there were no chairs for onthar and his men ordinary folk did not sit in the presence of the great lord merinsaard stated i am pleased that you chose to drive your fine cattle here it was been some weeks since our last supply of fresh meat was consumed how many head did you bring nine hundred more or less six hundred steers two hundred cows and one hundred yearling calves what bulls we brought we will drive back with us onthar said he crossed his hands at his waist and did not appear at all excited the great lord took out a ledger book and opened it with a sharp quill he made a notation and how much are you asking master onthar twelve coppers per calf fifteen per steer and one silver piece per cow he said firmly a high price but fair considering the quality of the beasts in the bailey onthar permitted himself a smile merinsaard snapped his fingers and two more soldiers entered from a door in the wall behind his table they car ried a chest into the room and set it down your payment said the great lord onthar reached out with steady hands this was a for tune his household would celebrate for days when he returned with such a bounty he lifted the lid and let it fall back on its hinges the chest was empty what onthar said sturm snapped his sword out take them merinsaard barked soldiers poured into the room from two sides treachery treachery the herders scattered sturm gathered tervy to him stay behind me he said a soldier thrust the point of his halberd at sturm but the knight parried the heavy steel head away the herders with only their flimsy goads were quickly subdued by the soldiers ironskin tervy shouted at your back sturm whirled in time to dodge a savage cut by another halberd he stabbed home hitting the fellow below his breastplate bleeding heavily the man fell tervy rolled the body over and snatched a small axe from the mans belt hai tirima she yelled tervy no too late sturm saw her scamper through the press of struggling men and jump upon merinsaards golden table by paladine she was brave the great lord stood back from the table as the girl threatened him with the hatchet he donned his helmet and raised his hands over his head he shouted at tervy to get out but she didnt instead she whipped her arm back and hurled the hatchet at the great lord the puny weapon struck his armored chest and glanced off merinsaards voice filled the tent with a booming incan tation the air seemed to solidify around sturms limbs and his sword grew impossibly heavy to lift then with a single silent burst a white light dazzled him completely sturm sagged to his knees the sword was torn from his hand and the enemy soldiers bore him immobile to the richly car peted floor someone was groaning sturm opened his eyes and found that he still couldnt see anything there was no blindfold around his head the effect of the dazzling light spell was lingering oh im blind someone groaned shut up sturm said be quiet all of you whos here onthar is here said the herd leader and frijje im here sturm asked who i was ostimar was the sheepish reply they were all present except tervy all of them were sitting on the ground in a circle hands tied behind their backs to a stout wooden post frijje said she hit the lord with an axe did she really rorin asked yes right on the wishbone didnt even scratch him quiet sturm said the light spell is beginning to wear off i can see my legs within a few minutes they could all see again onthar apologized in his blunt clipped way for getting them into this fix its not your fault sturm said merinsaard must have lured other herds here after starting those rumors about a rich buyer at the keep what does he need all those cattle for asked frijje he doesnt have more than a couple hundred men hes no mere cattle thief said sturm i think hes pro curing food for a much larger army what army asked onthar well i think the wall flap turned in and merinsaard walked in wearing his fearsome dragonlike helmet it had just the effect he wanted please dont kill us belingen whined were poor men we have no ransom to pay be silent the tusked face circled the room studying each man in turn which of you is the one the girl calls ironskin no one said anything merinsaard drew a dagger and tapped the flat of the blade against his palm he circled around stopping by belingen he pushed the tip of his dag ger against belingens chest there is a simple way to find out which of you wears mail he said i shall run this dag ger through each of your chests merinsaard leaned on the dagger belingen inhaled sharply no dont do it ill tell shut your mouth fool onthar yelled merinsaard went to the herd leader and struck him on the head with the butt of his dagger onthar slumped forward the next man to speak will die said merinsaard except you my friend belingen managed a sweaty smile its him the mustached one yes him sturm stared at the floor merinsaards thighhigh boots moved into his line of sight the lord called for his guards and a squad of hal berdiers cut sturm loose from the post that man too merinsaard said indicating belingen the guards marched sturm and belingen through the court yard wheres tervy sturm said at last she is safe the great lord said i have not harmed her you can kill her my lord shes only a raider brat belingen said sturm shot him a fierce look without sparing him a glance merinsaard replied she has considerable wit and courage which is more than i can say for you they entered the rear of the same room theyd fought in an unknown time before tervy was sitting on the rug in front of the table she saw sturm and jumped to her feet a clank announced that she was fettered to a table leg ironskin i knew youd come for me she said things are not so simple said merinsaard the guards brought sturm and belingen in and forced them to kneel before the great lords golddecked table the soldiers stood at their backs with halberds leveled and merinsaard sat in his chair there is a problem he said removing his dragon mask among a group of simple herdsmen i find a young stal wart a swordsman and warrior who wears mail and rides a garnetbred warhorse now i ask why would such a man be here tending cows its a living said sturm sullenly i know who he is master said belingen merinsaard leaned forward on his elbows yes his name is sturm brightblade hes a knight the great lord didnt blink how do you know this i heard him tell his name was brightblade and i remem bered that name from my younger days when i helped sack his fathers castle sturm leaped up you did what a guard struck him smartly on the back of his knees and sturm collapsed on the carpet i see is there anything else you can tell me hes looking for his father but his fathers dead i was with the band that breached the inner keep we set fire to it and all the knights threw themselves from the battlement rather than burn up sturms face paled and belingen grinned they was scared of a little fire thank you ah what is your name belingen master your devoted slave yes merinsaard nodded and the soldier standing behind belingen raised his halberd down went the axe blade and off came belingens astonished head it rolled to tervys feet and she kicked it away spitting chuyest sturm needed no translation he grimaced at the severed head with regret and disgust belingen might have been a worthless fool but he might also have had further information about sturms father remove the debris declared merinsaard two soldiers dragged the body out by the heels a man so easily per suaded to betray his comrades is of no use to anyone said merinsaard he stood so you are sturm brightblade of the house of brightblade i am he said defiantly merinsaard signaled again and a stool was brought in for sturm to sit on the soldiers withdrew leaving sturm and tervy with the great lord i would very much like for you to join my company of men said merinsaard i can use a young trained warrior like you too many of the scum i pick up are no better than the fool i just shortened by a head he folded his hands across his flat stomach and looked sturm in the eye in a very short time you could have your own command of picked troops cavalry or infantry what do you say the blood was still fresh on the floor so sturm consid ered his reply i have never worked as a mercenary before he said equivocally he pointed to tervy and said will you release the girl if she behaves merinsaard placed a key on the table sturm picked it up and unlocked the fetter that enclosed ter vys slender ankle before i commit myself may i ask a question said sturm merinsaard inclined his head affirmatively in this army to whom would i be responsible to me and no one else and from whom do you take your orders i am supreme rumbled merinsaard sturm glanced at tervy the chain lay by her foot she ran a hand over the crudely forged iron fetter i dont believe you sturm said calmly merinsaard bolted to his feet you question me he roared supreme commanders do not sit in lonely keeps confis cating cattle like skulking freebooters said sturm rage purpled the great lords face sturm wondered if hed gone too far in his next breath would merinsaard order both their deaths no the color slowly left his face and merinsaard leaned on the table you are wise for a young man he said at last i have been given the task of collecting food and arms for a great host that will invade northern ansalon soon it is a task i undertake with total devotion as to my leader she he paused conscious of revealing an important fact she leaves all the handling of mundane affairs to me i see sturm said what now ah what would be the terms of my service terms i cannot offer you a contract if that is what you mean but know this master brightblade join with us and all manner of power and glory shall be yours you will com mand and conquer among men you will be as a king merinsaard sat down sturm looked to tervy which put his face away from the warlords their eyes met tervy gave a very slight nod merinsaard looked expectant so sturm said this is my answer the great lord leaned forward now tervy stood and pulled the chain as hard as she could the folding table leg popped loose and the heavy tabletop collapsed on merinsaards legs sturm sprang over the fallen table knocking merinsaard down and pinning his hands there would be no blinding incantation this time tervy grabbed the shiny helmet from the floor and scam pered behind the struggling men she whacked merinsaard on the head and the big man howled under sturms clench ing hand tervy smote him again and again thats enough sturm said hes out shall we kill him she said by the gods youre a bloodthirsty child no were not going to kill him were not assassins the sight of the unconscious merinsaard gave sturm a dangerous idea help me get his armor off oh you want to skin him tervy said sturm rolled his eyes and hurried to untie the lacings of the warlords armor the great lord merinsaard threw back the wall flap guards in the corridor stiffened to attention the fierce dragon highlord mask turned to them i have immobilized brightblade he said he will remain here until i return no one is to enter that room before me do you understand the paralysis spell will be broken if anyone does is that clear yes lord the guards shouted in unison very good merinsaard beckoned to tervy come along girl tervy walked toward him looking miserable chain dragged between her feet she was hobbled with heavy iron fetters when you prove your loyalty i will remove them merinsaard said loftily oh thank you great lord tervy replied the masked man swept on with the girl close on his heels in the corridor beyond earshot of the guards sturm said softly you did that very well oh thank you great lord you can stop now in the maze of silk walls sturm found the flap leading to the room where onthar and his men were kept he burst in ostimar raised his sagging head and when he saw the dragon mask his expression ran from fear to hatred what now onthar said im going to let you go said sturm he handed merin saards dagger to tervy who busied herself freeing the astonished herders where are sturm and belingen said frijje belingen betrayed his honor and died for it sturm removed the stifling helmet and sturm is with you it was all sturm could do to restrain the herders from cheering even the normally taciturn onthar grinned and thumped sturm on the back theres no time for celebration sturm said hastily you must get to your horses and get out of here rorin said youre not riding with us i cant my destiny lies farther north besides the only chance you fellows have is if merinsaard wants to avenge himself on me rather than recapture all of you the realization of what this meant quickly sank in onthar grasped sturms arms well face the hordes of takhisis if you say so ironskin you may have that opportunity sturm said grimly so go warn all your people about merinsaard make sure that no one else brings him cattle or sheep or other supplies they would meet with the same treatment you did i will spread the word across the plains onthar vowed not even a partridge will get to merinsaards stores the herders gathered up their few belongings and started for the exit sturm added theres just one other thing what asked onthar sturm paused i want you to take tervy with you no she said loudly i stay with youl you cant do that ive got to travel fast and light and it will be too dangerous for you to remain with me sturm said solemnly it wasnt too dangerous in merinsaards room when i spilled the table and thumped him on the head sturm laid a hand on the girls shoulder youre braver than ten men tervy but theres going to be more than just swords or arrows coming at me there is evil magic abroad in the land and the full weight of it may fall on me in the coming days her lips quivered i dont care i do youre a fine girl tervy you deserve a long and happy life he turned to frijje youll look after her wont you the herder still amazed to hear that the girl had subdued the mighty merinsaard replied i think shell end up look ing after me it was agreed then though not without some tears sturm hesitated a moment then kissed her smudged forehead and sent her way with the herders the pang of regret he felt was like a fresh wound but sturm knew that in the coming days his own odds of survival would be slim the guards tensed when onthar and his party walked into view sturm mask in place ordered the soldiers to let them pass these men are to return with more provender he boomed the herders ponies were brought out and they mounted frijje hauled tervy up behind him you will bring the next herd to this same spot sturm said loudly aye my lord onthar replied a thousand head i promise onthar swung his pony southward and kicked its dusty hide he galloped away with the others strung out behind frijje and tervy were last the girl looked back until they were lost from sight she held her right fist clenched to her chest the temptation to wave farewell was strong hands clasped behind his back sturm strode down the center passage acting like a general at inspection he glanced into several rooms until he found what he wanted merinsaards wardrobe quickly he shed the armor merinsaard was thicker through the chest and waist than sturm but otherwise they were nearly the same size he donned a woolen tunic scarf and gloves though it was warm on the plain in the higher elevations it would be cold at night sturm retained the dragon mask and threw an anklelength cloak around his shoulders the hood hid his dark hair there was no time to search for the sword that had been taken from him so he borrowed one of merinsaards tas would be proud of him he thought ruefully the simplehilted weapon was plated with mirrorfinished silver and fitted with a black leather scabbard sturm buckled the sword belt under the cloak at the entrance of the grand tent he shouted my horse a soldier ran to the picket line and returned with a magnificent white charger the apothecary reports the poultice has healed maitats hoof the soldier said in a rapid breathless voice the man begs your lordship to spare him why not i give him his life sturm said in what he hoped was a convincingly arrogant manner he put a foot in the stirrup and swung onto maitat the spirited charger pranced in a halfcircle causing the soldier to retreat sturm opened his mouth to explain his departure then quickly realized that merinsaard would likely do no such thing i shall return before morning he said the usual guard postings remain said the man whod brought the horse yes sturm tightened the reins to quell the nervous ani mal let there be no mistakes or it will be your head he said he spurred lightly and galloped north toward castle brightblade sturm regretted not having time to scatter the cattle inside the old keep but there was no time for such diversions the moment the real merinsaard awoke and freed himself from his bonds the hunt for sturm bright blade would begin chapter the secret of brightblade castle maitat was as fleet as he was beautiful and in a very short time the dark hump of vingaard keep sank below the southern horizon with the stars to guide him sturm bore northwest a tributary of the vingaard river lay due north and the verkhas hills to the west in the fertile pocket of land between the two lay castle brightblade the white stallions hooves drummed a solo song on the plain several times sturm halted his headlong flight to lis ten for sounds of pursuit aside from the whirring of crick ets in the tall grass the plain was silent a few hours before dawn sturm slowed maitat as they closed upon a shadowy ruin it was an old hut and a land marker now demolished the stump of the marker still bore the lower half of its carved name plaque the lower petals of a rose showed and beneath that a sun and a naked sword bright blade sturm had come to the southern limits of his ancestral holdings he clucked his tongue and urged the horse forward the fields beyond the marker that he remembered as rich graz ing land and bountiful orchards were overgrown and wild the neat rows of apple and pear trees were little more than a thicket now vines had long since reclaimed the road sturm rode on tightlipped ducking now and then to clear the sagging tree branches the orchard was split by a creek he remembered and so it was still he steered maitat into the shallow stream the creek ran a mile or so to the very base of the walls of castle brightblade maitat trotted through the cool water the east was brightening to amber when the gray walls appeared over the treetops the profile of the battlements and towers brought a lump to his throat but it was not the same as when he left creepers scaled the walls in thick mats blocks of stone had toppled and the towers were naked to the sky their roofs burned off years ago come on sturm said to the horse tapping him gently with his heels maitat cantered through the creek kicking up founts with every step he climbed the bank on the west side and plowed through the hedges on the castles west face was the main gate sturm clattered up the grass spotted cobblestone road to the entrance shaded from the rising sun the walls looked black the narrow moat was little more than a muddy ditch now without the dam to divert the creek it would never keep water sturm slowed maitat once they hit the bridge belingens cruel remarks about knights jumping into the moat echoed in sturms mind the ditch was nothing but a dark swampy morass the gate was gone only the blackened hinges remained spiked to the stone walls with iron nails a foot long the courtyard was thick with blown leaves and charred wood sturm looked up at the donjon rising before him the win dows gaped blankly their sills displaying tongues of soot where fire had raged through he wanted to call out to yell father father ive come home but no one would hear no one but ghosts the bailey had been used recently to house animals sturm found the tracks of massed cattle and realized that merinsaards camp at vingaard keep was not the only site where the invaders were marshaling provisions a deep anger welled in him at the thought of the low purpose for which the noble edifice of castle brightblade had been used he rounded the corner of the donjon and entered the north courtyard there was the little postern gate that his mother and he had fled through that last time he had seen his father he saw again his father embrace his mother for the last time as snow fell around them lady ilys bright blade never recovered from the chill of that parting to the end of her life she was cold rigid and bitter then he saw the body sturm dismounted and led maitat by the reins he walked up to the body lying face down in the leaves and rolled it over it was a man and hed not been dead long a day perhaps or two hed been neatly run through from behind the corpse still clutched a cloth bag in his fist sturm pried open the fingers and found that the bag held petty valuables silver coins crude jewelry and some semi precious stones whoever had killed this man had not done so to rob him in fact by the dagger and picklock tucked in his belt the dead man appeared to be a thief himself sturm walked on he discovered the remains of a camp fire and some bedding all trampled and tangled under a blue horsehair blanket he found another body this one had died by sword as well the usual sort of camp items were scattered about copper pan clay pots waterskins more silver coins and a bolt of fine silk had the thieves had a fall ing out over their spoils if so why hadnt the winner taken everything with him an empty doorway yawned nearby to the kitchens sturm mused he used a broken tent pole for a stake and tied maitat sunlight streamed into the shattered donjon but many halls were still pitch black sturm went back to the spoiled robber camp and made a torch with a stick and some rags as he worked he heard a stirring in the doorway he whirled sword ready there was nothing there the dead men had changed sturms perception of the cas tle hed been expecting a mournful tour of his old home and a search for understanding to his fathers fate now a more sinister air clung to the stones no place was free of the probing fingers of evil not even the former castle of a solamnic knight the kitchens were picked clean plundered long ago even of their fire brick and andirons cobwebs clung to every beam and doorway he came to the great hall where his father had often dined with great lords such as gunthar uth wistan dorman hammerhand and drustan sparfeld of garnet the great oak table was gone the brass candle holders on the walls were ripped out the fireplace with its carved symbols of the order of the rose had been deliber ately defaced there was that noise again sturm was sure that it was footfalls who are you come out and show yourself he waved the torch toward the vaulted ceiling the stone arch es were cloaked in a tightly nestled layer of bats disgusted sturm crossed the hall to the steps one set led up to the pri vate rooms while another led down to the cellars sturm put a foot on the lowest of the rising steps hello sighed a voice sturm froze under the hood his hair prickled who is there he called this way the voice came from below sword in his right hand torch in his left sturm descended the steps it was cold down there the torch flickered in the breeze rising through the stairwell the corridor curved away on either side following the foundation of the very ancient cit adel that castle brightblade had been built on which way sturm called boldly this way whispered the voice it seemed oddly familiar as it sighed down the hall like the last gasp of a dying man sturm followed it to his left he had not gone fifty yards when he stumbled upon a third dead man this one was different he was no robber he was older his beard untrimmed and his face worn by wind and sun the dead man sat slumped against the wall a dagger buried in his ribs oddly his right arm was bent and resting atop his head a finger stiffly pointing down sturm studied the face it was familiar in a rush he recognized the man as bren one of his fathers old retainers if he were here could sturms father be far away what are you pointing at old fellow sturm asked the dead man urgently he opened the mans coat to see if bren carried any clues to the fate of sturms father when he did the dead mans right arm slid out of position and came to rest pointing straight up overhead sturm raised the torch there was nothing above him but an iron wall sconce which was crooked sturm looked more closely and saw a light mark scored on the wall block the bracket piv oted scratching this mark sturm grasped the lower end of the sconce and pushed it turned following the scratched path in the wall the floor trembled and a tremendous grinding sound filled the tunnel a section of floor rose in front of sturm revealing a dark cavity below in all his life in the castle hed never known of such a secret room go down go down rasped the phantom voice sturm felt for the first time a presence to go with the voice he turned sharply and saw the apparition behind him it was a dim red figure dressed in what looked like furs sturm stepped forward with the torch he couldnt make out the face but he caught a glimpse of a dark droop ing mustache the man hed seen in the thunderstorm come forward you he shouted and thrust the torch into the specters face the face was his own sturm dropped the brand great paladine he sputtered backing away his heel slipped off the top step into the secret vault what does this mean go down repeated the phantom sturm its lips did not move but the voice was distinct go why are you here sturm said he reached for the torch with trembling hands where did you come from far away sturms eyes widened the phantom repeatedly urged him to descend into the secret chamber i will sturm assured i will with that the red figure vanished sturm turned to the steps but could see nothing beyond the sphere of ruddy light cast by the torch he took a deep breath and went down it was cold in the secret vault and he was glad to be wear ing merinsaards thick tunic at the bottom of the steps some eight feet beneath the level of the corridor he found two more corpses they were unmarked but their faces told too well how they had met their fate the trap door had sealed them in and in the ensuing hours the men had suffo cated sturm turned from the dead robbers as he did his torch light gleamed on something metallic he walked into the velvet darkness his breath pluming out before him the glow of the torch fell over a suit of armor sturm swallowed hard trying to force down the lump in his throat with one shaking hand he reached out to brush the dust from the etched steel it was it was his sturm had found his fathers suit of armor breast and backplate greaves schildrons and helmet were all there the superla tive war armor etched with the rose motif the helmet had high horns on the forehead making sturms old headgear still dented from rapaldos axe seem like a cheap imitation the armor was hung on a wooden frame as sturm ran his hands over the cherished suit he felt the soft cold links of a chain mail shirt under the breastplate and hanging from the waist by a single thickness of scarlet ribbon was a slip of yellow parchment inscribed in angriff brightblades forceful hand were the words for my son sturm was filled with such joy at that moment he could scarcely breathe the mortal shell of a man could weaken and die but the virtues that made him a leader among men a knight of solamnia were embodied in the imperishable metal sturms life was half complete all that remained was to know of his fathers fate he threw off merinsaards clothes and dusty or not began to put on the armor it fit well almost perfectly the shoulders were a bit roomy but sturm would grow into them he finished tying the cops to his boots and lifted the breastplate off the crossbar beneath it hanging from a sin gle peg was the sword the hilt curved toward the point in a graceful are the steel as clean and shiny as when it had come from the forge the long handle was wrapped in rough wire to ensure a tight grip even when soaked with blood the almond shaped pommel was hard brass engraved with the symbol of the rose sturm could bear it no longer he felt the tears flow over his cheeks and made no move to wipe them away he had not cried like this since the night hed left his father behind twelve years ago the sword came lightly off its peg the balance was per fect and the handle fit sturms hand as though it had been made for him he drew merinsaards silverhandled weapon and tossed it clanging to the cold stone floor sturm slipped his fathers sword into the black scabbard and hur riedly fit the breastplate and backplate over his head he was still closing the buckles under his arms when he heard a strange humming merinsaards sword was glowing the hum emanated from it sturm shoved the stand over on top of the glowing blade and he watched openmouthed as the sword rose into the air flipping the heavy wooden crosstree over effort lessly merinsaards sword drifted toward the stairs and sturm hastily snatched up his fathers helmet and followed the silver sword slanted upward out of the vault the floating blade moved unerringly across the great hall to the despoiled kitchen and out the door there stood mai tat unmoving like a statue of alabaster the nervous stal lion had never been so quiet the sword came on point first the blade slowly circled the horse its point barely touching maitats neck the glow reached out to engulf the horse the charger began to writhe and shrink within its white aura he stepped forward ready to cut the suffering animal down but the fierce heat radiating from the sword stopped him the glow intensified to searing level there was a flash of blinding light and a great clap of thunder sturm was hurled back against the wall the breath driven from his body a deepthroated laugh filled the courtyard the hair on sturms neck prickled he coughed and rubbed his eyes where maitat had been there now was merinsaard fully armed and full of rage so brightblade this is thetreasure you traveled so far to find is it worth dying for he roared sturm fell back a pace his head throbbing from the shock of merinsaards appearance finding his voice he replied the relics of a noble past are always worth having but i dont expect to die just yet sturm brought the brightblade sword on guard merin saard cut wide circles in the air with his own blade but he didnt come forward to fence he raised the silver sword high and declaimed do you know what it was you so care lessly carried forth from my camp impudent fool this sword is the key to all the negative planes it is thresholder the pathway to power i allowed you to escape worm five seconds after you left me bound and gagged i was free and plotting how best to follow you was it not convenient that you should impersonate me and ride me in my equine form all the way here an unnatural wind sprang up blowing hot in sturms face its a pity you did not stay a horse he said boldly in that form at least you were a useful creature a ball of silver fire flew out from thresholders tip it spi raled up to the donjons roof and burst there shattering the tiles asunder sturm ducked inside the kitchen as broken rock rained down where hed been standing merinsaard laughed flee little man only now do you realize with whom you have trifled merinsaard smashed through the wall he whipped his silver blade to and fro leaving arcs of cracklinghot light behind sturm dodged into the great hall just ahead of a siz zling tongue of fire that scored molten ruts in the slate floor merinsaard was toying with him he could bring the whole castle down on sturm if he desired sturm wanted to stand and fight but only on ground of his own choosing there would be less debris to fling at him on the open battlements so sturm led the maniacal warlord to the second floor and down the narrow corridor where sturms bedroom used to be sturm cleared the end of the corridor just as merinsaard entered it the warriorwizard sent white fire blasting down the empty passage opening a hole through a wall two feet thick sturm ran on past the third and fourth floors to the roof come back young brightblade you cant hide forever merinsaard taunted him a miasma of anger and evil settled over the entire castle sturm came to a section of wall where the wooden boarding had been burned away he teetered along a charred beam thinking the heavier merinsaard could not follow then crouched behind the rubble from a fallen tower and tried to plan an attack when he came to the burned area merinsaard folded his arms across his chest and muttered a spell in an ancient gut tural tongue black clouds collected around the hoarding and merinsaard simply walked across on the vapor chuck ling fiercely as he came sturm pushed over a section of bro ken wall in a desperate attempt to impede the wizards approach thresholder swept back and forth shattering the tumbling blocks into gravel where will you go next chortled merinsaard you are running out of castle brightblade what a disappointment you would have been to your father he was a true warrior ten times the man youll ever be my men pursued him for months after they sacked the castle he survived them all even the trackers of leereach what was he to you sturm shouted why should you want his death he was a knight and a battle lord my mistress could not allow him to live if our plan for conquest was to go for ward a blast from the silver sword shaved off the top of the battered tower what an irony it is that you will die wearing his armor what a supreme moment for my dark queen hes right sturm thought ive run out of castle and im not the man my father was a curved wall of the tower closed in behind him sturm looked up there was no place to go no place but down tiny droplets of fire burst around sturms feet he hopped aside perilously close to the edge jump boy cheat my revenge why dont you it will be easier than the death i have in mind for you merinsaard said a scant five yards away sturm looked down it was a long long fall take the step jump for you it can be over quickly hissed the wizard there was no hope this was the end sturm would never again see his friends or solve the mystery of his father for him there was only a choice of deaths a single step and oblivion didnt every man want an easy death when his time came but youre not every man his mind screamed youre the son and grandson of solamnic knights his mind screamed this knowledge helped melt the icy fear that gripped his heart he squared his shoulders and faced merinsaard the brightblade sword pointed at the warlords heart i do not do your evil bidding sturm stated if you claim to be a warrior and a lord let your blade test mine and we will see who acquits himself with honor merinsaard smiled showing white teeth the blinding glow faded from thresholder and sturm assumed a fighting stance the wizard extended his blade at sturm and with no warning at all a blast of fire lashed out from the tip it struck sturm in the chest and slammed him into the tower wall as you see said merinsaard i am not an honorable man he raised thresholder for the final mortal strike and his eyes got very wide and white sturm struggled to bring the tip of his fathers sword waveringly into the air suddenly merinsaard made a gagging sound and stag gered to the battlement sturm was astonished to see an arrow buried in his back some distance away silhouetted against the morning sky was a figure with a bow sturm got to his feet merinsaard grasped the battlement with his mailed hands but the iron links found no purchase and the warriorwizard toppled through a crenelation to the courtyard below there was a scream a heavy ringing thud and silence sturm raced for the steps the mysterious archer was nowhere in sight he found merinsaard dead his sightless eyes staring into the mossy flagstones thresholder lay just beyond his lifeless fingers as sturm watched the sword flared and vanished with a loud crack where it had lain the stones were scorched sturm wavered and braced himself against the donjon wall as he tried to make sense of what had happened another arrow struck the ground at his feet the gray goose feather fletching on the long black arrow quivered from the impact sturm jerked around and saw the unknown archer atop the outer wall the bowman raised a hand in salute then ducked into an empty watchtower and was gone he stooped to examine the arrow tied to the shaft just behind the head was a slip of paper sturm freed it and read dear s i knew youd come here and here i find you in a losing fight with a wizard my new friends dont choose to play fair but i decided to even the odds in memory of our past friendship next time you might not be so lucky k ps you were a sucker to let him point the magic blade at you kitiara sturm called to the sky and stones kitiara where are you but he knew she was gone lost to him for ever chapter palanthas if took some time but a message displayed by sturm from palanthas to sancrist was answered stutts inventor of the practical well mostly practical flying ship sent sturm a reply that took up sixteen sheets of foolscap front and back it seems that he wingover sighter and the rest made it back to mt nevermind eventually using the hull of the cloudmaster as a conventional sailing ship the massive report the gnomes submitted to the high council of gnomish technology ran into thirty volumes the irony is stutts wrote to sturm in all the time we spent on lunitari we didnt manage to bring back a single sample of soil air rock or plant life all our copious sam ple collection was abandoned trying to lighten the ship for takeoff with only our notes the high council rendered a verdict of not proved about our expedition sighter was pretty mad but im not too disturbed as i write this the hull of the cloudmaster mark ii is taking shape on the slopes of mt nevermind it will have four sets of wings and two bags for ethereal air and carry sturm flipped through the letter with a smile all the rest of the pages were a catalog of the things the gnomes planned to take with them on their next voyage only the last lines were of interest if you and mistress kitiara would like to accompany us again please make your way to sancrist by ten days before the winter solstice thats when were taking off for lunitari cutwood wants to go to solinari but he was overruled we still have a lot to learn about the red moon plus there is some hope we might find evidence of bellcrank the letter was signed with several lines of stuttss gnomish name sturm set the pages aside safe voyage he said aloud the maid in the inn where he was staying in palanthas heard him and came to his table something you require she asked her name was zerla and she was pretty with curly blond hair and a warm smile she reminded sturm of tika were tika about ten years older no thank you he said been in palanthas long she asked a few weeks thinking of staying are youl actually im ready to leave now zerla frowned attractively not on my account i hope not at all i have business in the south said sturm a girl tervy came to mind but sturms most pressing task was to get back on his fathers trail that meant going to high clerist tower hed come to palanthas after his encounter with merinsaard mainly to rest and get his mind calm and focused again while there sturm heard gossip that some knights were gathering at high clerist for a conclave he was certain his fathers trail would lead there zerla was talking to him and sturm snapped out of his daydream the goodlooking ones are usually taken she was say ing zerla wiped the table under his cup of sweet cider are you married what no im not the maid brightened where are you from solamnia he said i thought so i noticed your helmet and mustache youre a knight arent you he admitted that he was my grand father tells me stories of the old days when the knights watched over the land and saw that justice was done i wish id lived back then id have liked to see the knights on their fine horses armor all polished doing good for people zerla blushed im sorry im talking too much i dont mind sturm said what you said cheers me i thought most folk had forgotten the order or hated it he finished his cider and put down two solacian silver pieces the change is for you he said thank you zerla swept the cup and coins off the table sturm walked out into the afternoon sunshine in the days hed been lingering in the city other reports had come in via the seaport tales of strange marauders in other regions were growing when sturm got to high clerist he would have plenty to tell the other knights but here in palanthas the threat seemed far away chil dren played in the streets wagons and carts moved goods about from the wharves to nearby shops and markets the citizens were well fed and well dressed yes the danger of war was far removed from the life of the average palanthan he could see from the high street that puffy white sails filled the bay were there gnomes down there he wondered did a gleaming white elf ship named high crest ride at anchor beyond the headland sturm could not tarry long enough to find out too long hed allowed himself to be diverted by other matters the time had come to shoulder the responsibility of his knightly name the burden of duty was as heavy as the armor sturm now wore his fathers armor and the brightblade sword that hung by his side sturm rested his right hand on the pommel and let his eyes linger on the polished plate of his armor he took a deep breath and walked down the street so it was south to high clerist nearly a year had passed from the time hed said goodbye to tanis flint and all his friends in solace and tervy and south again abanasinia and solace in due time his old friends would be gathering at the inn of the last home they would want to hear about what had happened to him and kitiara how could he tell them how could he explain to tanis and what of her brothers would they understand any better what sturm himself did not so many questions troubled sturm as he walked the sunny streets of palanthas a cloud passed over the sun and sturm looked up dark er clouds than that were coming he could shout it from the rooftops but the palanthans wouldnt heed him life was good why worry about war werent the mountains high was not the bay patrolled by palanthan galleys armed and ready palanthas was safe absolutely but mountains and warships were no impediment to evil the seed of that insidious force lay in every heart in every act of greed and hatred the land and the sea were merely highways over which ideas flowed as readily as the trade winds and now the sky was open too the gnomes had proved that the cloud moved on sturm shaded his eyes from the suns glare and listened for the sound of beating wings
