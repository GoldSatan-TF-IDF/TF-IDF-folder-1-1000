hours of the roman day for the names of certain historical figures in these pages i have used familiar literary forms rather than the more authentic latin while their contemporaries never referred to marcus antonius as marc antony or to gnaeus pompeius magnus as pompey the great these traditional versions carry such a magic that it seemed pedantic to resist them the ancient romans did not number their hours as we do in twelvehour segments before and after midday but rather beginning at daybreak so that when a roman spoke of the first hour of the day he meant quite literally the first hour of daylight and the first hour of the night was the first hour of darkness the following table roughly approximates the equivalent hours of the day as drawn from the historical sources and used in murder

and shook me gently i pulled away and felt cold air on the back of my neck as the blanket slid away i snatched it back and snuggled against it burrowing for warmth i reached for bethesda but found only a warm vacancy where she should have been really papa youd better wake up eco shook me again not quite so gently yes husband said bethesda get up what sleep is as deep as the sleep of a cold januarius night when the sky is a blanket of lowering clouds and the earth shivers below even with my son and wife yammering at me i slipped back into the arms of morpheus as easily as a boy slipping into a bottomless downy bed of goose feathers it seemed to me that two magpies were chattering absurdly in a tree nearby calling me papa and husband they swooped down fluttered their wings pecked me with their beaks i groaned and waved my arms to fend them off after a brief battle they retreated into the frosty clouds leaving me to dream in peace the frosty clouds burst open cold water splashed my face i sat upright sputtering and blinking with a satisfied nod bethesda placed an empty cup beside a flickering lamp on a little table against the wall eco stood at the foot of the bed gathering up the blanket he had just pulled off me i shivered in my sleeping gown and hugged myself blanket thief i mumbled grimly at that moment it seemed the foulest crime imaginable stealing an old mans rest eco remained impassive bethesda crossed her arms and arched an eyebrow by the dim lamplight the two of them still looked suspiciously like magpies i closed my eyes have pity i sighed thinking an appeal to mercy might gain me just one more blissful moment of sleep but before my head reached the pillow eco gripped my shoulder and pulled me upright again no papa its serious whats serious i made a desultory attempt to shake him off is the house on fire i was irretrievably awake now and grumpy until i realized who was absent from the conspiracy to wake me i looked around the room blinking and felt a sudden thrill of panic diana where is diana here papa she entered the room and stepped into the circle of light her long hair let down for the night hung loose over her shoulders shimmering like black water under starlight her eyes the almondshaped egyptian eyes inherited from her mother were slightly swollen with sleep whats the matter she said yawning what are you doing here eco why is everyone up and whats all the noise from the street noise i said she cocked her head i suppose you cant hear it very well here at the back of the house you can certainly hear it from my room they woke me up who people in the street running with torches yelling something she wrinkled her nose which she does when shes puzzled seeing the blank look on my face she turned to her mother who stepped towards her with embracing arms at seventeen diana is still enough of a child to appreciate such comforting meanwhile eco kept to one side wearing the glum expression of a messenger in a play who bears ill tidings i finally realized that something must be truly terribly wrong a short time later i was dressed and walking at a fast clip through the dark streets at ecos side together with his four bodyguards i turned my head anxiously as a group of sternlooking young men came running up from behind and passed us their torches cut through the air with a whoosh our shadows danced crazily up and down the street growing huge as the torches passed close by and then dwindling like wraiths into the darkness as the torchbearers left us behind i tripped against an uneven paving stone numas balls we should have brought torches ourselves id rather my bodyguards keep their hands free said eco yes well at least we have enough of those i said eyeing the four formidable young slaves who surrounded us one ahead one behind one to each side they had the look of trained gladiators stiffjawed flintyeyed alert to every movement in the street around us good bodyguards are expensive to purchase and expensive to feed my daughterinlaw menenia had complained each time eco added another to their household saying the money would be better spent on kitchen slaves or a better tutor for the twins protection comes first eco would tell her its the times we live in sadly i had to agree my thoughts settled on ecos wife and children whom he had left in his house over on the esquiline hill menenia and the twins i said walking fester to keep up with him my breath made clouds in the air but at least the pace kept me warm even as fast as we were walking another group of men came up from behind and passed us their torches sending our shadows into headlong flight theyre safe i had a new door put on the house last month it would take an army to break it down and i left my two biggest bodyguards to look after them just how many bodyguards do you own nowadays only six the two at home and the four with us only six i still had only belbo whom i had left behind to look after bethesda and diana unfortunately belbo was really too old to be an adequate bodyguard any longer the other household slaves could hardly be expected to put up much of a fight if something truly terrible were to happen i tried to push such thoughts from my mind another group of men came rushing up from behind us like us they carried no torches as they passed in the darkness i noticed ecos bodyguards grow tense and reach inside their cloaks strangers without torches in their hands could be carrying something more dangerous like daggers but the group passed without incident up ahead someone flung open the shutters of an upperstorey window and leaned out what in hades is going on tonight theyve killed him cried one of the men ahead of us murdered him in cold blood the cowardly bastards killed who clodius clodius is dead the shadowy figure at the window was silent for a moment then let out a long ringing laugh that echoed in the cold night air the group ahead of us came to an abrupt halt trouble said eco i nodded then realized the hushed remark was a signal to his bodyguards they tightened their ranks around us we pressed on at a faster pace so where gasped the man at the window barely able to speak for his laughter where is everybody headed in such a hot rush to a celebration the group in the street erupted in angry shouts some raised their fists others stooped over searching for rocks even on the palatine hill with its immaculate streets and elegant houses there are loose stones to be found the man at the window kept laughing then suddenly yelped my head oh my head you filthy bastards he slammed his shutters on a hail of rocks we hurried on and turned a corner do you think its true eco about clodius being dead well know soon enough isnt that his house straight ahead look at all the torches gathered in the street thats what brought me out tonight we could see the glow reflected off the clouds menenia called me up on the rooftop to see she thought the whole palatine hill must be on fire so you thought youd come see if your papa was singed eco smiled then his face turned grim on the way down in the subura i saw people everywhere in the streets gathered at corners listening to speakers huddled in doorways talking in low voices some ranting some weeping hundreds of men heading for the palatine like a river rushing uphill and all saying the same thing clodius is dead the house of publius clodius his new house for he had purchased the place and moved in only a few months before was one of the citys architectural marvels or monsters depending on ones point of view the houses of the rich on the palatine hill grow larger and more ostentatious every year like great preening animals devouring the little houses around them and displaying ever more sumptuous coats the coat of this particular beast was of manycoloured marble by the glow of the torches in the street one could see the glimmering sheen of the marble veneers and columns that adorned the outer terraces polished green lacedaemonian porphyry egyptian red marble mottled with white dots like the pelt of a fawn yellow numidian marble with red veins these terraces set into a hillside and planted with roses stripped bare by winter surrounded the gravelpaved forecourt the iron gate that normally barred entrance to the court stood open but the way was completely blocked by the mass of mourners who filled the court and spilled out into the street somewhere beyond that crowd at the far side of the forecourt was the entrance to the great house itself which sprawled across the hill like a selfcontained village its various wings surrounded by yet more terraces and connected by porticoes lined with yet more multicoloured marble columns the house loomed above us a miniature mountain of deep shadows and shimmering marble lit from within and without suspended dreamlike between the lowering clouds and the hazy reek put forth by the torches what now i said to eco we cant even get into the forecourt the crowds too thick the rumour must be true look at all these grown men weeping come best to get back home and look after our families no telling what will happen next eco nodded but didnt seem to hear he stood on tiptoe straining to see within the forecourt the doors to the house are shut no one seems to be going in or out everyones just milling about there was a sudden pulse of excitement in the crowd let her through let her through someone shouted the crush grew even greater as people stepped back to make way for some sort of conveyance coming through the street a phalanx of gladiators appeared first roughly shoving and elbowing their way forwards people did their best to get out of the way the gladiators were enormous like giants ecos bodyguards were mere boys by comparison they say there are islands beyond the northernmost reaches of gaul where men grow that big these had pale faces and scraggly red hair the crowd in front of us compressed eco and i were squeezed together with his bodyguards still in a ring around us someone stepped on my foot my arms were trapped at my sides i caught a glimpse of the approaching litter supported on the shoulders of bearers who dwarfed even the giant gladiators suspended above the crowd the red and white striped silk canopy shimmered in the flickering torchlight my heart skipped a beat i knew that litter i had been carried in it myself of course she would be here the litter drew closer its curtains were closed as of course they would be she would have no desire to see the mob or to be seen by them but for a brief moment as the canopy passed it seemed to me that the curtains parted a tiny bit i strained to see above the heads of the litter bearers but was confounded by the play of light and shadows that rippled across the red and white silk perhaps it was only a shadow i saw and not an opening at all ecos hand on my shoulder abruptly drew me back out of the path of the gladiators who advanced alongside the canopy he spoke into my ear do you think of course it must be her the red and white stripes who else i was hardly the only man in the crowd to recognize the litter and to know who must be inside these were clodiuss people after all the poor of the subura who rioted at his command the exslaves who looked to him to protect their voting rights the hungry mob that had grown fat from his legislation to hand out free grain they had always supported clodius as he had always supported them they had followed his career gossiped among themselves about his sexual escapades and family affairs plotted terrible fates for his enemies they adored clodius they might or might not have adored his scandalous older sister but they recognized her litter when they saw it suddenly i heard her name whispered by someone in the crowd others repeated it then joined in unison until the name became a soft chant that followed in the wake of her canopy clodia clodia clodia her litter passed through the narrow gateway into the forecourt her gladiators could have cleared the way by force but violence turned out to be unnecessary at the sound of her name the mourners in the court drew back in a kind of awe a pocket of emptiness formed before the litter and closed after it so that it proceeded swiftly and without incident to the far side of the court and up the short flight of steps to the entrance the tall bronze doors opened inward the canopy was turned so that its occupants could not be seen as they alighted and entered the house the doors shut behind them with a muffled clang the chanting died away an uneasy hush descended on the crowd clodius dead said eco quietly it hardly seems possible you havent lived as long as i have i said ruefully they all die the great and the small and most of them sooner than later of course i only mean i know what you mean when some men die its like a grain of sand thrown into a river theres not even a ripple with others its like a great boulder waves splash onto the bank and with a very few like a meteor falling out of the sky said eco i took a deep breath lets hope it wont be as awful as that but something told me it would be we waited for a while trapped by the inertia that falls upon a crowd when something momentous looms from those around us we picked up numerous conflicting rumours of what had happened there had been an incident on the appian way just outside romeno twelve miles away at bovillae no somewhere farther south clodius had been out riding alone no with a small bodyguard no in a litter with his wife and their usual retinue of slaves and attendants there had been an ambush no a single assassin no a traitor among clodiuss own men so it went with no sure truth to be found only a single unanimous point of agreement clodius was dead the lowering clouds gradually moved on to reveal the naked firmament moonless pitchblack spangled with stars that glittered like ice crystals the short swift walk from my house had warmed my blood the crush of bodies and burning torches had kept me warm but as the night grew colder so did i i curled my toes rubbed my hands together watched my breath mingle with the smoke in the air this is no good i finally said im freezing i didnt bring a heavy enough cloak eco seemed warm enough i noticed in a cloak no heavier than mine but a man of fiftyeight has thinner blood man a man twenty years younger what are we waiting for anyway we found out what the panic was about clodius is dead yes but how i had to smile he had learned his trade from me curiosity becomes a habit even when theres no money in it a finder cant help being curious especially when theres murder involved we wont find out from this crowd i said i suppose not come on then he hesitated youd think theyd send someone out to talk to the crowd surely someone will come out sooner or later he saw me shivering lets go then you dont have to leave i cant let you walk home alone papa not on a night like this send the bodyguards with me then im not fool enough to stay in this crowd alone we could split them up two for you and two for me no i dont want to take any chances ill walk you home then ill come back if i still want to we might have haggled over these logistics for a while longer but at that moment eco lifted his eyes to look at someone behind me his bodyguards tensed im looking for a man called gordianus said a rumbling voice above my head i turned to find my nose pressed against an extremely broad chest somewhere up above was a ruddy face topped by a fringe of red curls the fellows latin was atrocious im gordianus i said good come with me come with you where he cocked his head into the house of course at whose invitation i asked already knowing at the lady clodias command she had seen me from her litter after all ii even with the redhaired giant leading us i was dubious of the prospect of pressing through the crowded gateway and across the forecourt instead he started off in another direction we followed him down the street past the fringes of the crowd to the foot of a narrow stairway tucked into the hillside beyond the outermost ring of marble terraces the stairway was flanked by fig trees whose dense branches formed a canopy above are you sure this leads to the house said eco suspiciously just follow me said the giant gruffly pointing ahead to a distant lamp at the top of the stairs without a torch to guide us the way was dark and the steps lost in shadow we mounted them cautiously lagging behind the giant until we arrived at a narrow landing the lamp was hung above a wooden door beside the door stood another gladiator who ordered us to leave our escorts outside and to remove our weapons eco produced a dagger and handed it over to one of his bodyguards when i protested that i carried nothing the redhaired giant insisted on searching me finally satisfied he opened the door and led us inside we followed a long dim hallway descended a flight of steps and at length emerged into a narrow room we were in the foyer of the house just inside the tall bronze doors which were barred on the inside by a sturdy wooden beam through the doors i could hear the noise of the restless crowd from the courtyard beyond wait here the giant said as he stepped through some curtains the foyer was lit by a hanging lamp its flames reflected in the polished marble walls and floor i stepped closer to the shimmering red curtains fascinated by them do you know what these are eco these must be the famous attalic draperies theres genuine gold thread in them to see them by firelight youd think the fabric was woven of flames i should explain that the house of publius clodius and its furnishings had a brief but remarkable history the original owner had been marcus scaurus who began building the house six years before that was the same year that scaurus was elected aedile and was thus obliged at his own expense to entertain the masses with theatrical productions during the autumn festivals following the ageold tradition scaurus constructed a temporary theatre on the field of mars outside the city walls two years later pompey would build the first permanent theatre in rome roman children would grow up thinking nothing of such greek decadence in their midst but scauruss theatre was built to stand for only a season i have been to many cities and seen many remarkable buildings but never the like of scauruss theatre there were seats for people the enormous stage was three storeys high supported by marble columns between these columns and tucked in various niches throughout the building there were a total of bronze statues these outlandish numbers were talked about until everyone knew them by heart and they were not exaggerations in slack moments during the plays gawkers would count the columns and statues out loud while the poor actors emoted to no avail upstaged by the decor the bottom storey of the stage was decorated with marble the top storey with gilded wood and the middle storey with astonishing constructions of coloured glass not merely small windows but whole walls of glass an extravagance that had never been seen before and will surely never be duplicated again to decorate the stage there were enormous scenic backdrops painted by some of the finest artists in the world framed by lavish attalic draperies of red and orange cloth interwoven with gold thread like the legendary golden robes of king attalus of asia under the bright light of noon they seemed to be woven of sunlight itself when the festivals were over and the theatre was taken down scaurus sold off some of the decorations and made lavish gifts of others but much of the stuff he kept for himself to decorate his new house on the palatine marble veneers and columns were turned into terraces and porticos the walls of coloured glass were transformed into skylights enormous crates full of statues and fabulous draperies and paintings were stacked up in the forecourt of the house and gradually taken inside for his redesigned atrium scaurus decided to instal the largest columns from the theatre made of black lucullean marble each eight times as tall as a man the columns were so heavy and hauling them so difficult that a sewage contractor forced scaurus to post a bond against possible damages to the city drains when the columns were transported across town to the palatine the house of scaurus excited almost as much comment as his theatre people who had gawked at the theatre came to gawk at the house his more conservative and less affluent neighbours considered the place an affront to good taste a monstrosity of waste and excess a defamation of stern roman virtue those who complained should have remembered the old trojan axiom no matter how appalling a situation it can always get worse as when word got out that scaurus was moving and had sold the place to the rabblerouser clodius clodius the highborn patrician who disowned his pedigree to become a plebeian clodius the bane of the best people clodius the master of the mob clodius had paid almost fifteen million sesterces for the house and its furnishings if the rumour was true that clodius was dead then he had had little time to enjoy the place he would never see the marble terraces bloom with roses in the spring i poked my head through the attalic draperies into the atrium beyond where the ceiling abruptly shot up to the height of three storeys the lucullean marble columns i whispered to eco stepping through the curtains and beckoning for him to follow for here they were soaring up in jetblack splendour to the ceiling forty feet above in the centre of the atrium was a shallow pool decorated with shimmering mosaic tiles of blueblack and silver picturing the night sky and the constellations high above the pool a corresponding square was cut into the roof but instead of being open to the sky there appeared to be a vast pane of glass across the skylight through which the stars wavered as if they were underwater it was a dizzying conceit the skylight above appeared to be a pool reflecting the stars at our feet i took a slow walk around the perimeter of the atrium installed in niches in the walls were the wax masks of family ancestors publius clodius pulcher came from a very ancient very noble line one by one the faces of his predecessors stared impassively back at me most had been captured in maturity or old age but one could see they were in general a handsome lot pulcher the name of the family branch means beautiful after all eco tapped my shoulder our escort had returned he gestured with a toss of his chin and we followed him more deeply into the house as we walked down hallways i peered into the rooms on either side everywhere i saw reminders that we were in a house that had only recently been moved into and was still unsettled boxes and crates were stacked mazelike in some rooms while other rooms were empty in some places there was scaffolding and the smell of fresh plaster even the rooms which appeared finished seemed somehow tentative furniture was set at odd angles pictures were hung in odd spaces statues were placed too close together what had i expected to find inside the house women weeping slaves running about in confusion a sense of panic instead the house was quiet with hardly a person in sight the vastness of the place made the quiet seem all the more acute and uncanny like a deserted temple occasionally a slave crossed our path deferentially stepping out of our way and keeping his face averted when the body dies a philosopher once told me all the life within it contracts to a single point before expiring altogether so it seemed inside the house of clodius that all the life had gathered in one place for suddenly we rounded a corner and entered a room lit by many lamps and full of hushed voices nervouslooking men in togas paced fretfully about conversing in groups gesturing with their hands shaking their heads arguing in whispers slaves stood out of the way in corners quiet but alert awaiting instructions we came to a closed door at the far side of the room nearby a hulking brute of a man sat with his chin in his hands wearing a miserable expression there was a bloodstained bandage on his head and a tourniquet around one arm a handsome young man in an elegant tunic hovered over him berating him and barely pausing to let the brute answer in mumbles i still cant understand how you could have deserted him like that why were there so few of you with him in the first place what in hades were they thinking when they took him to that tavern instead of back to his villa our escort gently rapped on the door with the side of his foot someone had taught him good manners the young man and the wounded man looked up and peered suspiciously at eco and me the wounded man frowned who in hades the young man stared at us dully it must be that fellow my aunt clodia sent for the door opened a pair of feminine eyes peered out our escort cleared his throat the one called gordianus and his son eco the slave girl nodded and opened the door eco and i stepped inside our escort stayed behind as the girl shut the door the room had the feeling of a sanctuary thick rugs covered the floor and tapestries covered the walls muffling the quiet crackling of the single brazier that warmed the room and cast long shadows into the corners against one wall there was a long table like an altar with a few women clustered before it their backs turned to us the women were robed in black their hair let loose to fall over their shoulders they seemed not to notice our arrival the slave girl went to one of them and touched her gently on the elbow clodia turned and looked at us from across the room i had not seen her for almost four years since the trial of marcus caelius clodia had retained my services to assist the prosecution things had not gone as she planned and her miscalculations had ended badly for her since then she had led a much quieter more private existence or so one heard on the rare occasions when her name was mentioned but i had not forgotten her one never forgets a woman like clodia she walked slowly towards us the hem of her black gown trailing behind her her perfume reached us a moment before she did scenting the air with the essence of crocus and spikenard i had always seen her with her hair pulled back and held in place by pins now she wore it down for grieving giving a lustrous black frame to the striking angles of her cheekbones and the proud line of her nose she was past forty now but her skin was still like white rose petals her smooth cheeks and forehead seemed to glow by the flickering light of the brazier her eyes those famous glittering green eyes were red from weeping but her voice was steady gordianus i thought i glimpsed you in the crowd this is your son my elder son eco she nodded blinking back tears come sit with me she led us to a corner and gestured for us to sit on one couch while she sat on another she pressed one hand against her forehead and shut her eyes she seemed on the verge of sobbing but after a moment she breathed deeply and sat upright folding her hands in her lap the light from the brazier was interrupted by a shadow one of the others had crossed the room to join us she sat beside clodia and reached for her hands my daughter metella said clodia though i hardly needed to be told the young woman was unmistakably her mothers child perhaps she would even become as beautiful as her mother given time a beauty like clodias was not something a woman could be born with it consisted of more than what the eyes could see of a mystery behind the flesh which accrues only with the passage of time i seem to remember that you have a daughter the same age said clodia quietly diana i said seventeen clodia nodded metella suddenly began to weep her mother embraced her for a moment then released her and sent her to rejoin the others she loved her uncle very much clodia said what happened her voice was strained and colourless as if any display of emotion would make it impossible for her to speak we dont know for certain he was down south at his villa past bovillae something happened on the road they say it was milo or milos men a skirmish others were killed not just publius there was a catch in her voice she paused to compose herself someone passing by just happened to find his body in the road there wasnt even anyone standing guard over him strangers brought him back to the city his body arrived here just after sundown since then some of his bodyguards have come straggling in the ones who survived were still trying to make sense of what happened i saw a man in bandages being questioned in the other room a bodyguard the man has been with publius for years how could he have let this happen and the young man questioning him my nephew i imagine our brother appiuss oldest boy he came with me in the litter along with metella he loved publius like a second father she shook her head publiuss own little boy was with him down at bovillae we dont know whats become of the child we dont even know where he is this was suddenly too much for her she began to weep eco looked away it was a hard thing to watch her weeping subsided clodia i said quietly why did you send for me the question seemed to baffle her she wrinkled her brow and blinked back tears im not sure i saw you in the crowd and so she shrugged i dont know really but something will have to be done you know about that sort of thing dont you inquiries investigations how its done publius knew how to go about that kind of thing of course but now publius she drew a deep breath and slowly exhaled her tears had run dry i dont know why i called for you really to see an old familiar face we parted friends didnt we she touched my arm and managed a wan smile the effort produced only a small fraction of the charm of which i knew she was capable the feebleness of the attempt made it all the more poignant who knows what will happen now the world has turned upside down but something will have to be done to set things right publiuss children are too young to see to it it will fall to others in the family we may need you it may come to that you see she sighed wearily theres nothing to be done right now except to seek what comfort we can metella needs me she stood and looked bleakly towards the women across the room the interview seemed to be at an end i nodded to eco together we rose from the couch the slave girl came to show us out clodia walked away from us then turned back wait you should see him i want you to see what they did to him she led us across the room to the altarlike table where metella stood along with two other women and a child at our approach the oldest of the women turned and scowled at us her face was gaunt and haggard her hair was almost entirely grey unpinned it hung to her waist there were no tears in her eyes only anger and resentment who are these men friends of mine said clodia her voice taking on an edge what man isnt the woman gave clodia a withering look what are they doing here they should wait in the outer room with the rest i asked them here sempronia this is not your household said the woman bluntly metella went to her mothers side and took her hand the older woman glared at them the fourth woman whose face i had not yet seen kept her back turned she reached down to touch the head of the little girl pressed against her the child craned her neck and looked up at us with wide innocent eyes sempronia please said clodia in a strained whisper yes mother lets try to be peaceable even with dear clodia the fourth woman finally turned in her eyes i saw neither tears nor anger there was weariness in her voice but it was the weariness of exhaustion not resignation there was no emotion to be read in her voice or on her face only a kind of steady determination one might have expected to see a stronger reaction from the widow of the dead man perhaps she was simply numb with shock but her gaze was keen and unwavering as she appraised us fulvia was not a great beauty like clodia but her appearance was striking nonetheless she was younger by at least ten years i guessed her to be no more than thirty as her little daughter clung to her i saw where the childs curious luminous brown eyes had come from there was a sharpness in fulvias gaze that indicated a formidable intelligence she lacked her mothers grim harshness but one could see the seeds of it in the hard lines around her mouth especially when she turned her gaze to clodia i could see at a glance that there was no love lost between the two sistersinlaw clodia and her brother had long been famous or infamous for their mutual devotion there were many who thought they were more like man and wife than siblings where did that leave clodiuss real wife what had fulvia thought of the intimacy between her husband and his sister from the look that passed between them i gathered that the women had learned to tolerate one another but not much more than that clodius had been the link between them the mutual object of their affections as well as the cause of their mutual animosity perhaps clodius had also kept the peace between them now clodius was dead quite dead i thought for beyond fulvia i could see his corpse laid out on the long high table he was still dressed in winter riding clothes a heavy longsleeved tunic cinched with a belt at the waist woollen leggings red leather boots the filthy bloodsoaked tunic was torn open across his chest and hung in rags like the streamers of a tattered red flag come whispered clodia ignoring the other women and taking my arm i want you to see she led me to the table eco pressed close behind me the face was undamaged the eyes were closed and the bloodless ups and cheeks were marred only by a few smudges of dirt and blood and a slight grimace like that of a man suffering from a toothache or having an unpleasant dream he looked uncannily like his sister with the same finely moulded cheekbones and long proud nose it was a face to melt the hearts of women and make men prickle with envy a race to taunt his scowling patrician colleagues in the senate and win the adoration of the rabble clodius had been strikingly handsome almost too boyishlooking for a man nearly forty the only signs of his age were a few strands of grey at his temples even these were mostly lost in his thick mane of black hair below the neck his strong lean body was elegantly proportioned with square shoulders and a broad swimmers chest a gaping puncture wound pierced his right shoulder there were two smaller stab wounds in his chest and his limbs were marked with numerous lacerations scrapes and mottled bruises more bruises ringed his throat as if a thin cord had been tightened around his neck indeed had he shown no other wounds i would have said that he had been strangled beside me eco shuddered like me he had seen many dead bodies but victims of poison or a dagger in the back present a less gory spectacle than did the corpse before us this was not the body of a man who had died from quick and furtive murder this was a man who had died in battle clodia took one of the corpses hands in hers pressing it between her palms as if she could warm it she ran her fingers over his and wrinkled her brow his ring his gold signet ring did you remove it fulvia fulvia shook her head the ring was gone when they brought him the men who killed him must have taken it like a trophy again she showed no emotion there was a gentle rapping at the door a group of slave girls entered with cloths folded over their arms they carried combs jars of unguents and pitchers of heated water that sent trails of steam into the air hand me a comb said clodia reaching out to one of the girls fulvia frowned who sent for these things i did clodia moved to the end of the table and began to comb her brothers hair the teeth caught on a tangle of dried blood her face stiffened she pulled the comb through but her hands were shaking you sent for them then you can send them away said fulvia what do you mean his body doesnt need to be bathed of course it does the people outside want to see him and they will but not like this exactly like this you wanted your friends to see his wounds well so do i everyone in rome is going to see them but all this blood and his clothes hanging from him like rags well take off his clothes then let the people see him exactly as he is clodia continued to comb keeping her eyes on her work fulvia stepped towards her she seized clodias wrist snatched the comb and threw it on the floor the gesture was sudden and violent but her voice remained as impassive as her face mother is right this isnt your household clodia and he wasnt your husband eco tugged at my sleeve i nodded it was time to take our leave i bowed my head in deference to the corpse but the gesture went unnoticed clodia and fulvia stared at one another like tigresses with flattened ears the slave girls scattered nervously as we made our way to the door before i left the room i turned and took a last look at the women and was struck by the tableau of clodius dead upon the table surrounded by the five females who had been closest to him in life their ages spread over the range of a lifetime his little daughter his niece metella his wife fulvia his sister clodia his motherinlaw sempronia i thought of the trojan women mourning hector with the attendant slave girls for a chorus the brightly lit outer room seemed like another world with its fretfully pacing men in togas and hushed masculine voices the atmosphere was just as tense but of a different nature not of mourning but of crisis and confusion like a military camp under siege or a desperate gathering of conspirators the room was more crowded than before important newcomers had arrived and with them their retinues of freedmen and slaves i recognized several wellknown senators and magistrates of the populist stripe some stood in pairs quietly conversing others were gathered in a circle listening to a wildeyed man with unkempt hair who kept striking his palm with his fist i say we mount an assault on milos house tonight he was saying why wait its just a stones throw away well drag him into the street set the place on fire and tear him limb from limb i whispered into ecos ear sextus cloelius eco nodded and whispered back clodiuss righthand man organizes mobs stages riots breaks arms slits noses not afraid to get his hands dirty some of the politicians nodded at cloeliuss suggestion others scoffed what makes you think that milo would dare to come back to the city after what hes done said one hes probably halfway to massilia by now not milo said cloelius hes boasted for years that hed kill publius clodius one day mark my words hell be down in the forum tomorrow to brag about it and when he shows his face well slaughter him on the spot theres no point in a slaughter said the handsome elegantly dressed young man i had noticed on the way in clodiuss nephew appius well press for a trial instead a trial cried cloelius exasperated there was a collective groan yes a trial insisted appius its the only way to expose the bastard and his friends along with him do you think milo alone was behind this he hasnt the wits to stage an ambush i smell ciceros bloody maw uncle publiuss enemies didnt kill him on a whim it was cold calculated murder i dont want just revenge a knife in the back could accomplish that i want to see these men discredited humiliated jeered out of rome i want the whole city to repudiate them and their families with them that means a trial i hardly think its a matter of choosing whether to stage or not stage a slaughter said a calm shrewdlooking young man at the edge of the crowd gaius sallust eco whispered in my ear one of the radical tribunes elected last year heads turned having gained the groups undivided attention sallust shrugged well what makes you think we can control the mob one way or the other clodius could but clodius is dead theres no telling what will happen tomorrow or tonight for that matter a slaughter perhaps a bloodbath well be lucky if theres enough organization left in rome to stage a trial at this there was another round of groaning and scoffing but no one challenged outright what sallust had said instead they turned uneasily away and resumed their argument without him a trial appius insisted a riot first said sextus cloelius the mob wont settle for anything less and if milo dares to show himself well chop off his head and carry it through the forum on a stick then the mood of the city will surely swing against us argued appius no uncle publius understood the way to make use of the mob as a dagger not as a bludgeon youre wrought up sextus you need some sleep dont tell me how publius used the mob said cloelius half the time i was the one who plotted his strategies for him appiuss eyes flashed they reminded me of clodias eyes glittering and green like emeralds dont try to rise above your station sextus cloelius save your vulgar rhetoric for the mob the men in this room are a little too sophisticated for your style of blustering cloelius opened his mouth to answer then turned and stalked off there was a tense silence broken by sallust i think were all a little wrought up he said im going home to get some sleep a large coterie of retainers shuffled out of the room with him leaving more space for those who remained to carry on with their pacing and gesticulating we should do likewise i said nudging eco i need my sleep besides its as sallust says theres no telling what may happen in the streets tonight we should be home with our families behind barred doors the gladiator who had escorted us earlier had been keeping an eye on us as we moved towards the door he joined up with us and insisted on showing us out he turned back only when he had delivered us into the protection of ecos bodyguards on the landing outside the secluded side entrance we descended the steps to the street the crowd gathered outside the forecourt of clodiuss house had grown even larger men stood in groups arguing like their leaders inside the house over what should be done only in louder voices and cruder language other men stood alone and openly sobbed as if their own brother or father had been murdered i meant to walk straight on but the crowd was like a force an undertow at my feet that held me back eco was content to stay and observe and so we lingered fascinated by the torchlight the floating bits of conversations the shifting mass of humanity the mood of uncertainty and dread suddenly the great bronze doors to clodiuss house swung open with a double clang a hush of anticipation rippled through the crowd armed men appeared first they descended the steps in a cordon preceding and flanking the men in togas who carried the body of clodius upon a long flat bier a groan rose from the crowd at the first glimpse of the body followed by a great rush forwards the bier was set down on the steps tilted upward so that clodius could be seen we were caught in the crush the crowd in the forecourt compressed and those in the street were pulled in behind them as if sucked into a vortex eco gripped my hand as we were carried through the gates and into the forecourt like flotsam on a flood his bodyguards struggled to stay close shoving and pressing against us i was jabbed in the ribs by the point of a knife concealed inside the tunic of the bodyguard beside me and considered the mad irony if i should be accidentally gutted by the weapon of a man intending to protect me we came to a stop the crowd was packed into the forecourt like grains of sand in a bottle through the reek of the torches i had a clear view of clodius propped up on his bier surrounded in death as he had always been in life by armed guards to either side of the bier stood the men who had carried it among them i recognized appius and sextus cloelius clodius had been stripped of his bloody garments and retained only a loincloth around his hips the puncture at his shoulder and the wounds in his chest had been cleaned but only to show them clearly there was still plenty of gore and blood smeared across his pale waxy flesh his hair i noticed had been lovingly combed and untangled it was pushed back from his face as he had worn it in life but a stray tendril had fallen forwards over one eye to look at his face alone one might have thought that he was merely asleep and frowning because the hair was tickling him and that he might at any moment reach up to push it away to see him naked under the stars on such a cold night made me shiver around us men moaned cursed wept stamped their feet shook their fists buried their faces in their hands another tremor of apprehension rippled through the crowd as fulvia appeared on the steps her arms were crossed over her chest her head bowed her long dark hair hung straight down merging with the long black line of her gown hands reached towards her from the crowd but she seemed oblivious of these gestures of comfort she stood for a long moment beside her husbands body staring at it then she lifted her face to the sky and let out a cry of anguish that turned my blood cold it was like the cry of a wild beast rending the cold night air if any still slept on the palatine surely it woke them fulvia tore at her hair lifted her arms to heaven and threw herself across her husbands body her nephew and sextus cloelius made a fumbling attempt to restrain her then stepped back in awe as she shrieked and beat her fists against the bier she framed the corpses face with trembling hands and pressed her face to her husbands covering his cold lips with a kiss around us the mob raged like churning water i thought of what the tribune sallust had said no one controls such a mob it takes on a will of its own it can maim or kill a man without meaning to and for no purpose at all crushing the life out of him or trampling him underfoot i grabbed eco and by some feat of will we managed to push our way back through the gate the crowd that overflowed the courtyard now filled the street as far as the eye could see all up and down the block houses were lit up as brightly as day with anxiouslooking guards posted on the roofs i pressed on forcing a way through the crowd while eco and his bodyguards struggled to keep up at last we passed beyond the edges of the crowd i never slowed my gait until we rounded a corner and found ourselves on an empty darkened street i stopped to catch my breath and eco did the same his hands were trembling i realized that i was shaking too hearing only my own breath and the pulse in my temples i didnt notice the approaching footsteps but the bodyguards did they stiffened and drew themselves around us men were coming up the darkened street heading in the direction of clodiuss house as they passedtheir leader signalled for them to stop he peered at us in the dim starlight his face was in shadow but i could see that he had curly hair and a prominent nose and a strong physique beneath his cloak after a moment he stepped away from his bodyguards and approached us do you come from clodiuss house yes i said is it true what they say what do they say that clodius is dead its true the man sighed it was a quiet gentle sigh very different from the raging laments we had just left behind poor publius its the end of him then for good or ill all over he cocked his head dont i know you do you i think so yes im sure of it can you see in the dark citizen well enough and i never forget a voice he hummed to himself then grunted youre metos father arent you and this is metos brother eco yes i tried to get a better look at him i could make out his rugged features the strong brow the flattened boxers nose but i still didnt recognize him you and i met last year he said briefly when you came to visit meto in ravenna i serve under caesar too he paused for a moment when i gave no sign of remembering he shrugged well then whats happening around the bend that glow in the sky not a house on fire no just a great many torches theres a big crowd gathered at the house yes theyve come to see the body his wife fulvia fulvia he spoke the name with an odd intensity as if it had a secret meaning for him she grieves you might be able to hear her from here he sighed again a deep rich sigh i suppose i should see for myself farewell then gordianus and you eco he rejoined his companions and moved swiftly on farewell i said still unable to remember his name i turned to eco as he said papa we met him last year at caesars winter headquarters up in ravenna a bit modest the way he says i serve under caesar too one of the generals top men according to meto we were barely introduced id forgotten about it myself im surprised he remembers us but then the mans a politician of course hes been back in rome for several months running for office ive seen him in the forum canvassing for votes you must have seen him too have i whats his name marc antony iii over breakfast bethesda and diana demanded to know everything i tried to soften my description of clodiuss corpse in deference to their appetites but they insisted on all the gruesome details the wrangling of the politicians was of less interest to them but they listened attentively to my impressions of the famous house and its furnishings and they were especially curious about clodia can it really be four years since the trial of marcus caelius bethesda blew gently on a spoonful of hot farina almost and to think we havent had a glimpse of clodia in all that time not surprising really we hardly move in the same exalted circles but i dont think anyones seen much of her the trial took something out of her she seemed a changed woman to me really it sounds like she made quite a show of inviting you into the very heart of her brothers grand house as if she were doing you a great favour making you feel privileged and special she wants something really bethesda the woman was distraught was she i told you she could hardly keep from weeping to weep is one thing to be distraught is another i dont follow you no bethesda sat back from the table be careful of the farina diana youll burn your tongue diana nodded absently and gulped down a heaping spoonful what do you mean bethesda about clodia well i have no doubt that she was very upset about her brothers death we all know how close they were or at least the way people talked about them and such a bloody death from the way you describe his body awful she stirred her farina little puffs of steam rose from the bowl but diana cleared her throat i think that what mother is trying to say is well its obvious isnt it bethesda looked at diana and they nodded in unison her litter her bodyguard and using the main entrance yes diana pursed her lips sagely what in hades are the two of you talking about well bethesda tried another spoonful of farina and finally deemed it cool enough from your description it seems that theres the main entrance to the house and also the secluded little side door that you took yes and they both end up in the same place yes in the main foyer well i cant speak for clodia but if i were distraught i should have no stomach for facing a huge crowd id want to avoid that if i possibly could and clodia could have done so quite easily simply by entering through that side door she could have avoided the crowd completely am i right her litter could have deposited her and metella and her nephew appius at the foot of the steps and they could have gone up to the landing and into the house without anyone even knowing theyd arrived i suppose so diana picked up the thread from her mother instead she went through the thick of the crowd in that huge litter the one with the red and white stripes that everyone knows is hers with a veritable army of big redheaded gladiators bethesda nodded where everyone would be sure to notice her arrival and talk about it long afterwards said diana what is your point i said looking back and forth between them well papa only that grief was not the only thing on clodias mind exactly said bethesda making an entrance that was the point oh really i shook my head if youd been there if youd felt the mood of the place the despair the anguish all the better to heighten the drama said bethesda i dont doubt clodias grief but you see she must have considered the circumstances ahead of time she realized that she wouldnt be allowed to appear publicly alongside her brothers body when it was shown to the crowd that privilege was reserved for fulvia so clodia made an impression in the only way she could by making a grand entrance said diana i see youre saying she wanted to upstage her sisterinlaw not at all bethesda frowned at my obtuseness she only wanted what was hers to claim the portion of public grief that she feels belongs to her diana explained i see i said not at all certain that i did well speaking of doing things for show of course i was quite struck by the inconsistency of fulvias behaviour inconsistency said bethesda what do you mean papa i told you how stiff she was in the inner room how she showed virtually no emotion even when she put clodia in her place about cleaning the body and then her hysterical shrieking in front of all those people when they showed clodius to the mob but wheres the inconsistency papa diana looked at me curiously as did her mother i almost thought they were making fun of me it seems to me that a woman should grieve in private and show restraint in public not the other way around i said bethesda and diana looked at each other and wrinkled their brows what would be the point of that said bethesda its not a matter of having a point husband bethesda was shaking her head of course fulvia didnt want to show her grief to you a stranger in the intimacy of her home and especially not in front of clodia she comported herself with dignity to make her mother proud to show her little daughter how to be strong to confound her weeping sisterinlaw and for the sake of her husband as well since you romans believe that the lemur of a dead man may linger for a while in the vicinity of its vacant corpse so for you she put on her most dignified manner but the crowd outside that was a different matter fulvia wanted to stir them up as much as she could just as her husband had stirred them up so many times before she could hardly do that by standing next to his bloody corpse and behaving like a statue could she then you think her display of public grief was calculated and disingenuous calculated most certainly but disingenuous not at all she simply chose the most suitable time and place to release the grief that was inside her all along i shook my head im not sure youre making sense id rather try to figure out what sort of schemes the politicians in the anteroom were up to bethesda and diana shrugged in unison to show that the subject bored them politicians are usually too obvious to be very interesting said bethesda of course it may be that ive misjudged clodia and fulvia i wasnt there to see with my own eyes i can only go by what youve told me am i such an unreliable observer i raised an eyebrow men do call me the finder you know the thing is said bethesda oblivious to my point that one never quite knows what some people are really up to especially with a woman as complicated as clodia or fulvia how does one ever know what she really thinks really feels what she really wants bethesda exchanged a thoughtful look with diana simultaneously they lifted spoonfuls of porridge to their lips then abruptly lowered them as belbo came into the room for many years the strawhaired giant of a fellow had been my private bodyguard and had saved my life on more than one occasion he was still as strong as an ox but as lumbering as one too as loyal as a hound but no longer fit for the chase i still entrusted my life to him on a daily basis let him shave my neck but i couldnt rely on him to protect me from daggers in the forum what does one do with a loyal bodyguard who has outlasted his usefulness belbo could read only a little and do only the most rudimentary sums he had no special skills at carpentry or gardening aside from performing an occasional feat of prodigious strength toting a heavy sack of grain or lifting a massive wardrobe singlehanded he served me well enough as a doorkeeper a job which chiefly required him to sit in a warm patch of sunlight in the atrium for most of the day lethargy suited his bovine nature and enhanced that equable temperament which strangers often mistook for stupidity belbos wits might be slow but they were not dim it was his way to smile at a joke after everyone else finished laughing he seldom grew angry even when provoked he even more rarely showed fear as he stepped into the dining room however his oxlike eyes were wide with alarm belbo whats wrong out in the street master in front of the house i think youd better come see as soon as i stepped into the garden at the centre of the house i heard the noise carried on the open air an indistinct mingling of cries and stamping feet it sounded like a riot i hurried through the garden and the atrium to the foyer at the front of the house belbo pulled open the little sliding panel in the door and stepped aside to let me press my eye to the peephole i saw a blur of movement from right to left a mob rushing by all dressed in black i heard the roar of the crowd but couldnt make sense of it who are they belbo whats going on i stared through the peephole suddenly a figure broke away from the mob and ran directly up to the door he put his mouth to the peephole and began screaming well burn it down burn it down he banged his fists against the door i jerked back my heart pounding through the peephole i saw the man step back his face frozen in a maniacal grin even with the door between us i shivered then just as suddenly as he had rushed up the man turned and rushed away disappearing into the mob what in hades is going on i wouldnt advise going outside to find out said belbo earnestly i thought for a moment well go up on the roof to have a look fetch the ladder belbo and bring it to the garden a few moments later i found myself settled precariously on the slanting tiles along the front roof of my house from here i had a view not only of the street below but of the forum beyond with its temples and public spaces clustered close together in the valley between the palatine and capitoline hills just below me the mob continued to surge through the street some of them ran straight on others broke away and took the shortcut called the ramp that leads down to the forum and empties into a narrow space between the house of the vestals and the temple of castor and pollux some of the rioters carried sticks and clubs a few brandished daggers in open defiance of the law that forbids such weapons within the city and though it was well after daybreak a few carried torches the flames whipped and snapped through the cold air the mob eventually thinned but was soon followed by an even larger slower group of mourners if it was a funeral procession it was certainly a strange one where were the mummers doing parodies of the dead man to lighten the mood where were the wax effigies of the dead mans ancestors taken from their places of honour in his foyer to witness his passage to join them on the other side where were the hired mourners weeping and clawing at their tangled hair indeed where was there a woman to be seen but there was music mournful horns wailing flutes and shivering tambourines making a noise that set my teeth on edge and there was a body the corpse of clodius carried upon a wooden bier festooned with black cloth he was still naked except for a loincloth and still filthy and smeared with dried blood some of the mourners broke away to take the ramp down to the forum but the main procession with the corpse of clodius kept to the street in front of my house which runs along the crest of the palatine they were making a slow deliberate circuit of the hill i realized passing by the houses of the rich and powerful in a sombre procession letting his friends and foes alike take a final look at the man who had caused so much disruption to the orderly life of the republic a few houses farther on their course would take them directly past the front door of the man who had been clodiuss most implacable enemy in the senate and the courts clodius had made himself the champion of the lowly of foot soldiers and freedmen always against him there had been cicero the loyal spokesman for those who proudly called themselves the best people the funeral procession seemed orderly but in the mob that preceded it i had seen men with daggers and torches i held my breath wondering what might happen when they reached ciceros house when i looked towards ciceros house i saw that i was not alone in my apprehension intervening houses and trees blocked my view of the street but of the house itself i could clearly see some shuttered windows in the upper storey and a portion of the roof two figures were perched there as belbo and i were perched on my root peering over the edge at the street below by the glare of the slanting morning light i instandy discerned the thicknecked grimjawed silhouette of cicero crouching close behind him reaching out to make sure that his master did not lean too far was the slighter silhouette of ciceros lifelong secretary tiro they were still for a long moment as if frozen by the cold morning air then cicero reached back for tiros shoulder they put their heads together and anxiously conferred from the way they drew back and craned their necks trying to see but not be seen i gathered that the bizarre funeral cortege was passing directly below them the dirge of the horns and flutes became shriller the shivering of the distant tambourines more manic intent on the spectacle below cicero and tiro took no notice of my scrutiny the procession apparently came to a halt before ciceros house cicero bobbed his head forwards and back like a nervous quail i could imagine his dilemma he was afraid to take his eyes away from the mob and yet the merest glimpse of him might incite them to violence horns blared flutes trilled tambourines rattled at last the cortege moved on and the dirge faded away cicero and tiro sat back sighing with relief then cicero winced and gripped his stomach as the heel to achilles so the belly to cicero his breakfast had turned against him he rose still crouching and moved crablike up the roof with tiro following behind tiro turned his head and saw us watching he touched his masters sleeve and spoke cicero paused and turned his face towards us i raised my hand in neighbourly greeting tiro waved back cicero stayed motionless for a moment then clutched his stomach and hurried on disappearing over the edge of the roof meanwhile below us in the street more men in black kept running by in parties of two and three stragglers rushing to catch up most of them took the ramp i tried to see where they were all headed but my view of the forum was mostly of beaten copper roofs gleaming in the sunlight every now and again i could catch a glimpse of tiny figures moving in the spaces between they all seemed to be gathering before the senate house at the far end of the forum where the sheer rock face of the capitoline hill forms a natural wall from my position i had a clear view of the front of the senate house broad marble steps led up to the massive bronze doors which were closed i could see only a tiny portion of the open space in front of the senate house but this included a clear view of the rostra the raised platform from which speakers address the populace already the space between the rostra and the senate house was filled with a crush of blackclad mourners the funeral dirge which for a while had faded out of hearing now returned rising from the forum echoing up from the valley the harsh music sounded more confused and discordant than ever suddenly it was overwhelmed by a great shout from the crowd the body of clodius had arrived a little later i saw the bier as it was carried onto the rostra and propped up for the crowd to see just as it had been displayed on the steps of clodiuss house the night before what a tiny thing it looked and yet even at such a distance there was still something shocking about that glimpse of naked flesh amid so many blackclad mourners and so much cold chiselled stone a speaker mounted the rostra i could hear only faint echoes of his voice as he paced back and forth across the rostra waving his arms pointing to the corpse of clodius and raising his fists the crowd broke into a thunderous roar from that point on the noise of the mob rose and fell but never quite subsided whats going on i turned my head startled diana go back down the ladder at once why is it dangerous up here very your mother would have a fit oh i hardly think so she held the ladder for me but i think shes afraid to come up herself as well she might be and how about you papa i should think an old fellow like you would be more likely to lose his balance than i would be how did i ever come to have such an impertinent child im not impertinent just curious its like the siege of troy isnt it what like jupiter up on mount ida watching the battlefield down below theyre all so tiny it makes one feel godlike does it jupiter could send down thunderbolts or messengers with wings and he could hear what was being said having a view hardly makes me feel godlike quite the opposite it makes me feel powerless watching from a distance like this you could go down and join them put myself at the mercy of that mob theres no telling what they might do next papa look like a stormchurned flood the crowd seemed suddenly to overflow the broad square in front of the rostra surging in wave after wave onto the steps and terraces of the surrounding temples and public buildings papa look the senate house the broad steps were inundated by the mob which rose like a black flood tide to lash against the tall bronze doors bolted from within they stood against the tide but soon i began to hear a low thudding repetitive boom it was hard to see exactly what was happening but the mob seemed to be assaulting the doors of the senate house with some sort of makeshift battering ram impossible i said incredible what are they thinking of what do they want all at once the doors gave way a moment later a cheer of triumph rose from the crowd i looked back to the rostra the speaker was still ranting striding back and forth and exhorting the mob with wild gestures but the body of clodius had disappeared i frowned puzzled then caught sight of the naked body on its blackdraped bier proceeding with odd jerky movements towards the steps of the senate house it seemed that the mob was passing the bier from hand to hand above their heads i suddenly had a vision of the mob as a colony of insects and the corpse of clodius as their queen i shivered and felt an intimation of vertigo with one hand i reached for diana putting my arm around her shoulder and with the other i held more firmly to the tiles of the roof the bier reached the foot of the senate house steps stalled for a moment then tilted upward and began to ascend the mass of the crowd able to see the body again produced another loud roar of mingled triumph and despair the bier reached the top of the steps and was propped upright a man stepped up beside it waving a burning torch he seemed to be giving a speech though it was hard to imagine that the roaring crowd could hear him any better than i could even at such a distance i was almost certain that the speaker was sextus cloelius clodiuss wildeyed lieutenant the man who had spoken of riots and revenge against milo the previous night after a while still waving his torch he turned and entered the senate house the bier was carried in after him what can they possibly be thinking i said burn it down said belbo wasnt that what the fellow said the one who pounded on the door i shook my head he was raving besides he must have meant burning down milos house or maybe ciceros he couldnt possibly have meant sometimes uttering the impossible can suddenly make it seem quite possible after all i stared at the roof of the senate house as if by concentrating i could see through it to perceive what sextus cloelius was up to surely not and then i saw the first wisps of smoke streaming wraithlike from the shuttered windows set high along the walls of the senate house papa yes diana i see they must be cremating the body inside the building the idiots if they arent careful they hardly look to me like the sort to be careful said belbo tilting his head earnestly a little later the first flickering tongues of flame appeared at one of the windows one after another the shutters caught fire heavy black smoke began to pour from the windows then from the open doorway sextus cloelius ran out of the building waving his torch triumphantly over his head the crowd fell silent for a moment probably as awed as i was by the enormity of what had happened then they released a roar that must have been heard all the way to bovillae it was heard in ciceros house at least from the corner of my eye i saw a movement on his roof he had returned along with tiro the two of them stood upright no longer crouching and watched the spectacle in the forum below tiro clutched his face he was weeping how many happy hours had he spent in that building copying down his masters speeches in the shorthand he invented ordering his army of clerks about paying witness to the great career he had done so much to foster slaves can be very sentimental cicero did not weep he crossed his arms set his jaw in a hard line and stared grimly at the orgy of destruction below there said diana she was pointing at cicero there thats what jupiter must have looked like gazing down at troy knowing cicero far better than my daughter did and certain that there was nothing remotely godlike about him i was about to correct her when belbo interrupted youre right he said the very image their shared certainty forced me to take another look diana was right i had to concede it as cicero looked at that moment watching the destruction of the senate house by clodiuss mob so great jupiter might have looked when he brooded on mount ida and watched the mad clash of mortals below iv whipped by the cold wind the blazes shot higher and higher until the whole senate house was engulfed by flames the mob danced on the marble steps hooting and laughing while they dodged cascades of cinders and ash the fire began to spread first to the complex of senatorial offices to the south of the senate house the threat of the mob had already emptied most of the buildings but after the flames started a few panicstricken clerks came rushing out carrying armloads of documents some tripped and fell others zigzagged madly dodging the taunting mob dropping their burdens wax tablets scattered like tumbling dice scrolls unfurled and streamed like pennants in the breeze then the wind changed the flames spread west of the senate house to the porcian basilica one of the great buildings of the forum it was a hundred and thirty years old the first basilica ever built its distinguishing features the long nave terminating in an apse with colonnaded aisles on either side are now duplicated in buildings all over the empire many of the wealthiest bankers in the world kept their headquarters in the porcian basilica it took hardly an hour for the fire to reduce its venerable majesty to a smouldering pile of rubble it was the bankers i learnedlater desperate to salvage what remained of their records who finally organized a large contingent of freedmen and slaves to battle the flames acting out of pure selfishness they may have saved a large part of rome from going up in smoke the firefighters formed long snaking lines across the forum and through the cattle market all the way to the banks of the tiber where they filled buckets with water and passed them up to pour on the flames then passed the empty buckets back again from time to time a few rowdies broke away from the mourners frenzied revelry to harass the firefighters pelting them with stones and spitting on them scuffles broke out a cordon of bodyguards also sent by the bankers arrived to protect the bucketpassers it was a mad day rome seemed racked with fever delirious with clodius consigned to the purifying flames and the senate house along with him his mourners carried on their unconventional funeral celebration could they have planned such madness in advance or did they make it up as they went along inspired by the dancing flames and the billowing smoke invigorated by the charred tang in the air at midafternoon they held a funeral feast before the smouldering senate house they set up tables covered the tables with black cloths and spread out a banquet while the firefighters continued their frantic efforts the clodians drank and ate in honour of their dead leader the poor and hungry of the city came out to join them at first meekly and then seeing that they were welcome in jubilation vast quantities of food arrived great urns full of bloodblack sausages pots of black beans loaves of black bread all suitably black for a feast to honour the dead washed down with bloodred wine meanwhile the confused frightened curious citizens of rome those who lacked the safe vantage of a palatine rooftop to watch what was going on skirted the edges of the forum cautiously peeking around comers and peering over walls gawking variously in outrage delight disbelief and consternation i spent much of the day on my root watching so did cicero he would disappear for a while then reappear with various visitors many of them senators as i could tell from the purple border on their togas they would take in the view shake their heads in disgust or gasp in horror then disappear again talking and gesticulating there seemed to be some sort of allday meeting going on in ciceros house eco came by to see me for a while i told him he was mad to venture out on such a day he had stayed clear of the forum and though he had heard the rumour that the senate house was destroyed he had thought it was only that a rumour i took him up on theroof so he could see the spectacle for himself he headed back to menenia and the twins soon after even bethesda overcame her distrust of the ladder and ventured up on the roof for a while to see what all the fuss was about i teased her that the sight of so much rioting must have made her homesick for alexandria seeing that the alexandrians were so famous for rioting she didnt laugh at the joke neither did i the feasting and the firefighting down in the forum continued until well after nightfall towards evening belbo brought me a bowl of hot soup and climbed back down a little later diana joined me with her own steaming bowl as we sat alone on the roof the sky darkened to deeper and deeper shades of blue verging into black in every season twilight is the most beautiful hour in rome the stars began to show in the firmament glittering like bits of frost there was even a kind of prettiness about the nickering lights down in the forum now that darkness hid the ugliness of charred wood and blackened stone the fires had largely died down but the deepening gloom revealed smouldering patches of flame in the ruins of the porcian basilica and the senatorial office buildings diana finished her soup she put down the bowl and pulled a blanket over her shoulders how did clodius die papa from his wounds i should think surely you dont want me to describe them again no i mean how did it happen i dont know really im not sure that anyone does except whoever killed him of course there seemed to be quite a bit of confusion about it at his house last night clodia said there was a skirmish of some sort down on the appian way near a place called bovillae where clodius had a villa clodius and some of his men had an altercation with milo and some of his men clodius got the worst of it but why did they fight clodius and milo have been enemies for a long time diana why why are two men usually enemies because they want the same thing a woman in some cases or a boy or a fathers love or an inheritance or a piece of land in this case clodius and milo both wanted power and they couldnt both have it apparently not sometimes when two ambitious men are enemies one of them has to die if the others to go on living at least thats how it usually works out sooner or later its what we romans call politics i smiled without mirth you hate politics dont you papa i like to say i do but i thought im like the man who says he hates the theatre but never misses a play he claims its his friends who drag him along even so he can quote every line of terence so you secretly love politics no but its in the air i breathe and i dont care to stop breathing put it another way politics is the roman disease and im no more immune than anyone else she frowned what do you mean certain diseases are peculiar to certain tribes and nations your brother meto says that up in gaul theres a tribe in which every person is born deaf in one ear youve heard your mother say that theres a village on the nile where everyone breaks out in hives at the approach of a cat and i read once that spaniards suffer a form of tooth rot that can only be cured by drinking their own urine papa diana wrinkled her nose not all diseases are grossly physical the athenians are addicted to art without it they become irritable and constipated alexandrians live for commerce theyd sell a virgins sigh if they could find a way to bottle it i hear the parthians suffer from hippomania whole clans go to war with each other to lay claim to a fine breeding stud well politics is the roman disease everyone in the city catches it sooner or later even women nowadays no one ever recovers its an insidious sickness with perverse symptoms different people suffer in different ways and some dont suffer at all it cripples one man kills another and makes yet another man grow fat and strong so is it a good thing or a bad thing just a roman thing diana and whether its good or bad for rome i cant say its made us the rulers of the world but i begin to wonder if it wont be the end of us i stared down at the forum no longer like jupiter watching the plain of ida more now like pluto surveying the fiery pits of hades diana leaned back her jetblack hair made a pillow for her head as she studied the sky above her dark eyes reflected glimmers of cold starlight i like it when you talk to me like this papa do you this is how you used to talk to meto sometimes before he left for the army i suppose she turned on her side propped her head on her hand and looked at me earnestly is something bad going to happen papa i imagine the people around clodius think something bad has already happened to us i mean are we in danger papa not if i can help it i ran my hand over the side of her face and stroked her hair but things are getting worse arent they thats what you and eco always say to each other when you talk politics and now its worse than ever clodius dead the senate house burned down is something awful about to happen something awful is always about to happen to someone somewhere the only escape is to make a friend of fortune if shell have you and run the other way whenever you see a politician coming im serious papa are things about to i dont know about to fall apart for us for everybody how could i answer her out of the past i suddenly remembered a scene from the forum when i was a young man after sulla won the civil war rows and rows of heads mounted on pikes the enemies of the dictator paying gaping witness to his triumph afterwards people swore that such a thing would never happen again that was thirty years ago i cant see the future diana but you know the past enough to understand about clodius and milo explain it to me if i could understand whats happening perhaps it wouldnt worry me so much very well diana clodius and milo where to begin well we shall have to start with caesar and pompey you know who they are of course gaius julius caesar is the man meto serves up in gaul the greatest general since alexander the great i smiled so meto says pompey might not agree pompey cleared the seas of the pirates and conquered the east i nodded and surnamed himself magnus the great just like alexander as i said a moment ago sometime when two men want the same thing you mean caesar and pompey both want to be alexander the great yes exactly since you put it like that and there cant be two at once the world is not big enough but dont caesar and pompey both serve the senate and the people of rome nominally yes they receive their commands and permission to raise their armies from the senate and between them theyve conquered the world in the name of the senate but sometimes servants outgrow their master caesar and pompey have both grown too big for the senate so far the salvation of the republic has been that the two generals have held one another in check neither can grow too powerful for fear of riling the other and there have been other factors figured into the balance pompey married caesars daughter didnt he yes julia apparently it was a genuine love match that marriage link smoothed over the two mens differences family connections mean everything especially to patricians like caesar and another factor the two rivals used to be three there was marcus crassus the man who owned meto when he was a little boy he was the one who put down spartacus and the slave rebellion yes but despite that victory crassus was never much of a general but he did manage to make himself the richest man in the world crassus caesar and pompey formed what they called the triumvirate sharing power between the three of them that seemed to work for a while a table with three legј is steady but a table with just two legs sooner or later has to fall last spring crassus was killed in parthia at the eastern end of the world trying to prove his military prowess once and for all by conquering some of the same lands that alexander conquered but the parthian cavalry defeated him they killed his son along with forty thousand roman soldiers they chopped off crassuss head and used it for a stage prop to amuse their king exit crassus leaving the triumvirate with only two feet but at least those two feet were still bound together by the marriage link between pompey and caesar until julia died in childbirth now nothing holds the two of them together and theres nothing to keep them from coming to blows sooner or later rome holds its breath like a hedgehog watching two eagles circle overhead ready to battle it out to see which of them gets to eat the hedgehog i think you must be the first man ever to compare rome to a hedgehog papa diana studied the stars is there a hedgehog constellation i dont think so so youve told me all this about caesar and pompey the great but what about clodius and milo caesar and pompey are eagles up in the sky soaring over mountains and seas down here on solid ground its clodius and milo whove been fighting over rome itself the city not the empire they fought with gangs instead of armies instead of mountain ranges and seas they squabbled over the seven hills and the markets on the riverfront instead of battles they staged riots in the forum instead of campaigning against barbarians they campaigned against each other for office bullying and bribing voters pandering to their constituents postponing elections pulling every possible trick to get the better of each other milo represents those who call themselves the best people old families old money the most conservative elements in the senate the kind of people pompey likes to associate with so its not surprising that from time to time milo has more or less acted as pompeys henchman here in rome clodius iswasa radical despite his patrician blood he appealed to the mob when he was in the military he staged an uprising of common soldiers against their commander who happened to be his own brotherinlaw the year the plebeians elected him tribune he promised to set up a free grain dole and he did by annexing cyprus to finance the scheme clodius was always out to better the lot of common foot soldiers and farmers and the city poor and in return they were always there to vote when he needed them sometimes with ballots more often with fists the rabble loved him and the best people hated him from time to time clodius found himself on the same side as caesar another patrician with populist leanings and so they assisted each other mostly behind the scenes people came to think of them as allies caesar and clodius against pompey and milo the two great men moving all over the world each allied with a lesser man with a gang at his disposal here in rome to fight for control of the capital like the heroes of the iliad said diana the gods allied with mortals one god looking out for hector another god on the side of achilles and hector and achilles each haying an army all these references to troy i take it youve been reading homer i need to practise my greek mother helps me your mother cant read yes but she speaks greek she helps me with pronunciation i see well a little literary allusion goes a long way but if i can compare rome to a hedgehog i suppose we can also compare our local gang leaders to hector and achilles its apt in a way the gods withdrew their favour from hector in the end didnt they so fell the house of priam and troy along with it the gods can be fickle like any ally its all politics in the end allegiances shift like sand underfoot loyalty slips through your fingers and a man dies yes then more men die usually and buildings burn we watched the forum in silence for a while caesar and pompey clodius and milo said diana still how did it come to this papa the senate house burned to the ground i sighed the young think there must always be a simple answer you know how the elections are held diana or at least how theyre supposed to be held citizens gather on the field of mars to cast their ballots for the various magistrates who run the government there are different elections on different days for the various magistrates most of the elections are held in the summer good weather for gathering out of doors the voters elect two consuls who have the highest power after the consuls come the praetors and then the aediles and the quaestors and so on all with different powers and duties the old year ends at the beginning of januarius the elected magistrates take office they serve for one year and then step down or move on to govern foreign provinces so its been for hundreds and hundreds of years going all the way back to the fall of the kings and the founding of the republic thats how its supposed to work anyway but today rome is a city without magistrates were halfway through the month of januarius and still there are no magistrates to run the state what about the tribunes said diana i hummed stalling while i thought of the answer the roman constitution is so damnably complicated technically tribunes are not magistrates the tribunate was established long ago when only patricians could be magistrates and the plebeians demanded to have their own representatives nowadays the magistracies are open to both classes but tribunes must still be plebeians there are ten of them each year chosen by a special assembly of plebeians only they still tend to represent the interests of the weak against the strong the poor against the rich clodius himself served a term as tribune that was the year he managed to get cicero sent into exile and established the grain dole but clodius and his sister are patricians ah but clodius fixed that he had himself adopted by a plebeian practically young enough to be his son just so that he could run for the tribunate even his enemies had to admire his ingenuity its a natural office for a rabblerouser i dare say some of our more ambitious tribunes are down in the forum right now haranguing that mob anyway the selection of tribunes was carried out as usual last year with no disruptions but not so with the regular magistrates what happened last year milo chose to run for consul clodius ran for praetor if each had won theyd have cancelled each other out milo would have vetoed clodiuss radical schemes and clodius would have undermined milos efforts on behalf of the best people each would have been a thorn in the side of the other said diana exacdy so each was determined to keep the other from winning yet each was a formidable candidate likely to win his office so every time an election was scheduled something occurred to postpone it an augur would read the signs in the sky and say the omens were bad election cancelled a new day would be chosen but on the eve of the election someone in the senate would come up with an obscure point of calendar law to show that no voting could be held on that day after all much debate a new date is finally chosen the day arrives riots break out on the field of mars and on and on in previous years elections there have been gross irregularities voters bribed or intimidated lawsuits used to keep men from running for office or from serving out their terms all sorts of manoeuvres to tilt and skew the process but theres never been a year like this last one pure chaos a republic that cant even manage to hold elections is a very sick republic as if to punctuate that sentiment a smouldering pocket of flame down in the porcian basilica suddenly flared up the fire must have eaten through to a cache of lamp oil and ignited it the concussion reached the palatine a moment later like the muffled boom of a drumbeat by the glare of the towering flames i saw the tiny figures of startled firefighters scattering a cheer went up from the feasting clodians the snakelike line of bucketcarriers altered course to douse the new flareup which spat back at them with steam and tongues of flame in the gathering darkness the struggle between the fire and those who fought it began to take on fantastical shapes so its no surprise i went on if milo should have killed clodius the only thing less surprising would have been if clodius had killed milo diana nodded thoughtfully a little while later bethesda called up from the garden it was nearly time for dinner diana went down to help her mother she seemed satisfied with the answers i had given her though i was quite aware that i had not answered her most important questions are we in danger papa is something awful about to happen the fiery explosion down in the forum seemed to have ignited a fresh burst of excitement among the clodians they finished their feast speakers mounted the rostra again chants echoed up from the mob a strange ceremony began men marched in single file up to the smouldering ruins of the senate house then descended the blackened steps holding fiery torches aloft after a while i realized what was happening they were lighting their torches from the same purifying fire that had consumed clodiuss remains out of piety and devotion they would take it home with them to add to their own hearth fires or so i thought until i saw that the mob had another use in mind for the sacred fire from the steps of the senate house the torchbearers headed towards the palatine it was easy to follow their progress they moved like creeping rivers of flame between the temples and across the paved squares they returned by the ways they had come some heading up the ramp others disappearing from my sight around the edge of the hill heading for the paths that would take them up the western flank of the palatine the torchlight in that direction made such a glow that over on ciceros roof i could see the figures of cicero and tiro in silhouette their backs turned towards me as they put their heads together those who ascended the ramp turned west away from my house and ran in the direction of ciceros house i held my breath i saw ciceros silhouette stiffen but the torchbearers ran on following the street making a circumference of the crest of the hill they would meet up with the rest of the mob at some point on the farther side who had a house in that vicinity milo with the same cleansing fire that had turned the bloody remains of clodius to ash the mob intended to burn down milos house and milo with it if he had dared to return to the city diana called to me from below papa mother says its time to eat yes diana in a moment milos house was far away measuring by a stones throw not far at all measuring by the speed of flames riding a cold breeze to jump from roof to roof if the mob set fire to milos house the blaze could easily spread all over the palatine the safest course might be to take the family to ecos house over on the esquiline but what would happen then if my house did catch fire who would fight the flames and what reason was there to think that we could cross the subura and reach ecos house in safety on such a night with such a mob on the loose papa are you coming down do you see something a few stragglers came running up the ramp their torches crackled in the air like flapping pennants as they took the sharp turn towards ciceros house and beyond im coming i said i took a last look in the direction of milos house i seemed to hear sounds of conflict clattering shouting but the echoes were confused and distant papa i turned and stepped onto the top rung of the ladder it was a sombre meal i tasted nothing afterwards when diana and bethesda had retired for the night i stole up to the roof again i looked in the direction of milos house but saw no sign of flames still when i was ready to come down i called for belbo to take my place we took turns through the night one fitfully dozing beneath a mound of blankets on a couch in the garden one up on the roof watching the skyline for any telltale orange glow but when it finally came the glow was in the opposite direction the sun came up and my house still stood i went up to the roof to have a final look in the cold hazy morning air the forum was like a smeared painting i could hardly make out any details at all but when i took a deep breath i caught the scent of burned wood and baked stone the smell of what had once been the senate house which had become the crematorium of the rabbles fallen champion v driven off with arrows said eco stretching his arms over his head and yawning he had slept as poorly as i had the haze had lifted the sun was shining in the garden we sat on folding chairs across from the statue of minerva soaking up the tenuous midday warmth thats the word in the street anyway he continued the clodians didnt anticipate so much resistance they expected to find milos house more or less deserted i suppose they figured they could break in kill a few slaves loot the place then burn it to the ground instead they were met by a troop of archers posted on the roof expert marksmen apparently the battle didnt last long a few casualties and the clodians turned and ran i should think theyd have had enough by that point anyway burning the senate house stuffing themselves sick listening to all those speeches youd think theyd have been ready to call it a day youd think so but then so the rumour goes after they were repulsed from milos house the mob left the palatine ran through the subura and outside the city walls to the necropolis the city of the dead at night i should think theyd have been as frightened of lemures as of arrows they stayed clear of the sepulchres and burial pits they headed for the sacred grove of libitina goddess of the dead eco nodded they broke into her temple in the middle of the night but why surely the duty of registering clodius among the dead fells to his family not to the mob and they cant have been looking to rent requisites for the funeral theyd already done the job of cremating clodius without paying much heed to religious niceties it had nothing to do with that papa for some reason its in the temple of libitina that the fasces are kept when there are no consuls you know those bundles of sticks with an axe projecting carried by the consuls at ceremonies and processions their badges of office exactly with no consuls in office the fasces have to be stored somewhere and apparently the official place is the temple of libitina so the mob breaks into the temple seizes the fasces and then runs back into the city to seek out the men running for consul against milo publius hypsaeus and quintus scipio yes both supported by clodius of course the mob goes straight to scipios house and shouts for him to come out and claim the fasces forgo the election entirely become consul by appointment of the mob that must have been the idea but scipio wouldnt show his face probably scared out of his wits like everybody else in rome last night then the same thing at the house of hypsaeus shouts of acclamation but the candidate kept his door shut then somebody in the mob got the idea to offer the fasces to pompey pompey but hes not even eligible hes still a proconsul in charge of running spain he commands an army legally he cant even enter the city walls thats why hes living in his garden villa out on the pincian hill the mob couldnt be bothered by such technicalities they ran out the fontinalis gate and up the flaminian way to pompeys villa they waved their torches and lifted up the fasces some shouted for pompey to become consul others shouted for him to become dictator i shook my head what in hades are they thinking of probably most of them werent even born the last time rome had a dictator there are plenty of people in the street who think its time we had one again to put an end to all this chaos theyre mad a dictatorship could only make things worse anyway i cant believe the leaders of the clodian mob came up with such an idea clodius and pompey detested each other and pompeys never been a friend of populist causes hes popular with the masses even so the mighty general conqueror of the east the great one pompey magnus i shook my head it still doesnt sound right the same people who provoked the mob to burn down the senate house are hardly likely to want a reactionary like pompey to be their dictator maybe it wasnt the same mob at all or maybe the mob was taken over at some point by infiltrators from pompeys camp eco raised an eyebrow so you think the incident might have been staged by pompey himself do you think he wants to be dictator then more likely he wanted a chance to publicly turn down the call there are plenty of senators especially friends of caesar who think pbmpey might be plotting to take over the state how better to reassure them than to turn down a mob of citizens offering him the fasces he didnt exactly turn them down like scipio and hypsaeus he didnt show his face i moved my chair a bit to keep up with the sun where the shade fell the air had a bite what word of milo then some think he sneaked back into the city last night and is holed up in his house they say thats why the archers were in place to fight off the clodians last night because theyre part of milos personal bodyguard but it seems just as likely that he left them to guard the place in his absence especially if he had planned to murder clodius he knew the mob would react with violence so he left his house fortified others say hes gone into voluntary exile off to massilia or somewhere thats possible i said its hard to see how he could possibly be elected consul now if and when the state finally does manage to hold elections and if milo cant be elected consul hes finished hes spent a fortune putting on shows and games trying to impress the voters he doesnt have the resources of caesar or pompey or even of clodius he wagered everything on his run for consul and now hes surely lost all chance of winning exile might seem the only honourable solution to him another voice joined us from the direction of the statue ofminerva but then why did milo kill clodius if it meant ruining his own future i looked towards the statue the virgin goddess towered above us painted in such lifelike colours that she seemed almost to breathe in one hand she clutched an upright spear in the other a shield an owl perched on her shoulder a snake coiled at her feet under the midday sun her eyes were shaded by the visor of her crested helmet for just an instant it seemed that minerva herself had spoken then diana stepped from beneath the shade of the portico and leaned against the pedestal she put her hand on the sculpted snake a good question diana i said why would milo murder clodius if he knew it would unleash such a fury why kill his enemy if that meant killing his own chances of being elected perhaps he miscalculated the reaction said eco or perhaps he killed clodius by accident or in selfdefence do you mind if i join you said diana not waiting for an answer she pulled up a little folding chair and sat she shivered in her cloak its cold out here let the sunshine sink in for a bit i said and then theres a third rumour eco said some say that milo is plotting revolution and the murder of clodius was just the first stroke they say hes stockpiled weapons all over the city there must have been an arsenal of arrows at his house to fend off the mob last night and now hes crisscrossing the countryside gathering troops to march on rome setting himself up as another catilina i raised an eyebrow only this time the revolutionaries would have men like cicero on their side instead of against them cicero is the last man to support anything remotely like a revolution even if it was led by his good friend milo but who knows nowadays i suppose anything is possible oh and some other news papa this must have happened yesterday while the mob was rioting down in the forum a patrician committee of the senate met somewhere here on the palatine they finally appointed an interrex diana looked puzzled see if i can explain it accurately eco i said in cases where there are no consuls say if both should die on a battlefield or if a whole year should go by with no elections added eco i nodded in such a case where there are no magistrates at the head of the state the senate appoints a temporary magistrate called an interrex to run the government and hold new elections each interrex serves for only five days and then a new one is appointed that way they dont get too settled in their office so on and so forth until one of them manages to get new consuls elected the senate should have appointed an interrex at me beginning of the year since there were no new consuls when the old consuls stepped down but friends of hypsaeus and scipio managed to stall the appointment thinking milo had the upper hand and wanting to hold off the elections a while longer no interrex no elections well perhaps now therell finally be elections and an end to this crazy talk of solving the crisis with a dictator not for another five days at least said eco you missed one technical point papa the first interrex cant hold the election that can only be done by a subsequent interrex not by the first interrex i said during his fiveday term he simply oversees a sort of coolingoff period diana nodded it should take at least that long for the senate house to cool off the first interrex had no authority to hold elections as eco had astutely pointed out but the supporters of scipio and hypsaeus sensing that the candidacy of milo was done for decided the time for elections had arrived even as eco and i talked they surrounded the house of marcus lepidus the newly appointed interrex on the palatine lepiduss wife a lady of irreproachable character named cornelia was busy setting up ceremonial looms in the foyer following an ancient custom pertaining to the wives of interrexes no one knows the origin of this custom perhaps it has something to do with the interrexs role in weaving the threads of the republics future when lepidus appeared at his door the leaders of the crowd demanded that he hold elections at once he explained to them the impossibility of his doing so they repeated their demands lepidus a very oldfashioned patrician told them exactly what they could do with such a radical notion in terms to make their ears burn then he slammed the door on them the crowd did not erupt in a riot but they did tighten their cordon around the house preventing anyone from leaving or entering they built fires in the street to keep themselves warm to keep themselves amused they passed wineskins back and forth and shouted their electioneering chants many of which were obscene poems about fausta milos notoriously unfaithful wife when the wine made the convoluted lyrics too complicated to recite they resorted to a simpler chant vote now vote now the interrex ostensibly the head of the roman state at least for the next few days was a prisoner in his own house of course every man is a prisoner in his own house when the streets are unsafe and atrocities take place even in broad daylight what is a man to do lock himself away like a cowering deaf mute or step into the fray looking for a means to put an end to the violence around him i had actually seen worse times in rome the civil war that led to sullas dictatorship for a start but i had been a young man then i moved through those crises following the instinct of the young which craves adventure ahead of survival looking back now im shocked at how little regard i seemed to have had for the risks i took i wasnt especially brave or foolish merely young now i was no longer young i was far more aware and more respectful of death and injury having seen and experienced so much of both in the intervening years with every passing year the fabric of existence seemed more fragile to me life seemed more precious i was less amenable to taking chances with my own life or with the lives of others yet i found myself in times that called for taking chances the idea of shutting myself away and disclaiming all responsibility offered no satisfaction to me like many a man in rome that winter the tumult in the streets sparked a tumult in my own heart the republic was very sick perhaps sick unto death its wrenching spasms presented a spectacle i could hardly bear to look at but i found it even harder to look away some years before i had tried to remove myself completely from the arena of politics sick of deceit and false promises of the pompous vanity of politicians and the gaping credulity of their followers of the vindictive arrogance of victors and the squalid backbiting of the vanquished i declared i would have no more of it i moved to a farm up in etruria determined to turn my back on rome that attempt did me no good instead i became more deeply embroiled in political intrigue than i could ever have imagined i was like a fretting navigator who goes to great lengths to avoid a whirlpool only to find that hes plotted a course straight into the vortex the episode of catilina and his riddle had made me recognize the inexorable nature of fate rome is my fate and the fate of rome was once again in the hands of her politicians so in retrospect i justify to myself my reaction when later that day after eco had gone home i received a visitor he was an old old acquaintance such an old acquaintance in fact that belbo secretly peering out the peephole in the front door didnt recognize the man i had told belbo not to let in anyone he didnt know by sight so he dutifully fetched me from my study to have a look for myself i saw a man past middle age of medium build with an open handsome face and a touch of grey at his temples he had the wellmoulded lips the straight nose and the curly hair of a greek he carried himself with an almost haughty selfimportance like a philosopher or a scholar the boyish young slave i had first met thirty years ago had grown into a distinguishedlooking man it had been a long time since i had seen him so close at hand usually when i saw him at all it was at a distance as i had seen him on the previous night putting his head together with cicero up on the roof of ciceros house he was very nearly the last person i had expected to call on me i shut the peephole and waved to belbo to unbar the door tiro i exclaimed gordianus he bowed his head and smiled faindy behind him stood a troop of bodyguards i counted at least ten men which seemed a bit excessive ifhe had merely walked the short distance from ciceros house on the other hand anyone leaving ciceros house was likely to be a target of the clodian mob with a wave of his hand he ordered them to stay outside belbo shut the door behind him i showed him to my study and gestured for him to take a chair near the flaming brazier instead he walked slowly around the room examining the scrolls in their pigeonholes and the decorative painting of a garden on one wall youve prospered gordianus in some ways i remember your old house over on the esquiline that big rambling place with the garden all gone to seed it belongs to my son eco now his wife has restored the garden to immaculate condition time passes so quickly who would have thought that youd ever have a son old enough to run his own household hes made me a grandfather so one hears does one a smile quivered at the comer of his lips you are still spoken of from time to time in ciceros house gordianus but not too fondly i imagine oh you might be surprised i certainly would be if cicero has anything good to say about me these days i should have thought that the trial of marcus caelius was the last straw between us tiro shrugged cicero bears you no ill will hes not a man to hold grudges ha tiro inclined his head thoughtfully cicero can make himself a formidable enemy to be sure against those who make themselves his enemies by their spitefulness and deceit or by the danger they pose to the republic but that has never been the case with you gordianus cicero understands that youre a complicated man not always easy for him to understand but at heart an honourable and honest man honourable honest he repeated stressing the words like cicero riimself if the two of you have sometimes come into conflict its because youve seen things in different lights honourable men cant be expected always to agree i sighed tiro was obviously as devoted to cicero as ever it would be useless to point out to him the flaws in his masters character the mans totally unscrupulous behaviour as an advocate his pompous selfimportance his utter disregard for the truth unless it happened to serve his purpose the long string of victims he had destroyed in the cause of upholding the privileges and the power of the best people are you sure you wont sit tiro belbo can take your cloak it looks rather heavy even for this weather ill sit yes i tire rather easily these days and yes i suppose i can do without the cloak the room seems warm enough i have to be careful of catching a chill i hardly heard what he said because as he shrugged off his heavy cloak i saw what he was wearing underneath not a slaves tunic but a toga tiro was dressed as a citizen i looked at his hand and saw sure enough that he wore the iron ring of a citizen just as i did but tiro when did this happen what he saw the direction of my gaze and smiled he worked his fingers as if he was still not used to the ring oh this yes a change in status hardly more than a formality in many respects i do the same work serve the same man its easier for me to own property now of course tiro no longer a slave youre free yes he seemed almost embarrassed well it took cicero long enough you and i talked of such a possibility the very first time we met do you remember not really his cheeks coloured a bit and i realized how pale they had been before what did you just say about taking a chill and tiring easily tiro is something wrong he shook his head of course not not any more i looked at him sceptically i was ill he admitted but that was last year very ill to be frank my health has been somewhat erratic for the last few years he smiled i suppose thats one of the reasons cicero made me a freedman last year it looked then as if it might be a case of now or never but im much better now i could have wished for a fester recovery but at least im not walking with the cane any more the physicians say theres no reason i shouldnt regain my full strength and be as healthy as i ever was i looked at him with fresh eyes what i had read as a haughty expression was merely due to the gauntness of his cheeks i reckoned in my head and realized that he must be fifty he suddenly looked his age there was more grey among the tight curls than i had thought and there was a bald spot at the top of his head a kind of boyish enthusiasm still sparkled in his eyes but the firelight also caught the haunted glimmer of a man who had known severe illness yet he also seemed a man who was comfortable with himself and his place in the world his frank and easy manner exuded an air of sophistication and selfcontentment and why not the boyish slave who had come to my door those many years ago as the messenger of an obscure master was now a free citizen and the invaluable righthand man of the most famous orator alive tiro had met great men and travelled the world at ciceros side he had helped to run the government when cicero was consul he was famous in his own right having invented a form of abbreviated writing whereby a copyist could take down a speech verbatim as quickly as it was spoken every clerk in the senate house was now required to learn tironian shorthand why did you come to me today tiro on behalf of cicero of course he might have come himself cicero is keeping indoors he said stressing the last word only slightly so am i what could he possibly want with me hell tell you that himself he cant possibly think ill agree to help him but you dont know what he wants it doesnt matter i paid back the favour i owed him for helping me acquire my etruscan estate years ago with interest since then let me be candid with you tirosince then with every passing year cicero has fallen lower and lower in my esteem not that i imagine my estimation means anything to cicero but i have my standards humble as they may be i dont intend to come running simply because cicero thinks he can make some use of me one more time tiros face was impassive which disappointed me i suppose i expected him to wince or sigh or shake his head he only replied in a dispassionate voice youre mistaken of course in your opinion of cicero you misjudge him many men do that always confuses me but then i work with him every day i understand every nuance of his thought others arent so privileged he looked at me steadily well shall we be going i almost laughed tiro were you not listening to me his expression became more severe i saw you yesterday gordianus watching the fires down in the forum from your rooftop what did you think of all that you were appalled of course but not everyone was appalled those behind the destruction were delighted say what you like about cicero but when it comes to certain fundamental matters you and he are on the same side did you know they tried to burn milos house last night i heard about it such a fire could have spread all over the palatine this room were sitting in could have been a pile of smoking rubble this morning you realize that dont you i looked at him for a long moment and sighed youre really not a slave any more are you tiro you talk like a free man you bully with words just like a roman his face tightened he was trying not to smile i am a roman now in every sense of the word as much a roman as you gordianus as much a roman as cicero he laughed perhaps not quite what does he want from me theres a fire gordianus no not the fire down in the forum a greater fire that threatens to consume everything worth fighting for cicero wants you to help pass buckets of water so to speak he leaned towards me with an earnest look there are men who start fires there are men who put them out i think we know which kind you are does it really matter whether you happen to like or dislike the citizen standing next to you in the bucketpassing line the point is to put out the fire come let cicero talk to you i sat for a moment watching the flames in the brazier i waved to belbo who stood quietly in the corner of the room bring tiro his cloak i said the flames danced and wavered and bring a cloak for me too tell bethesda im going out for a while tiro smiled the walk was brief the air was bracing the bodyguards were perhaps unnecessary we didnt pass a single person in the street all the houses along the way were shut up tight i had never been inside ciceros newly rebuilt house some years before when clodius managed to get cicero exiled from rome the clodian mob had celebrated their triumph by burning down ciceros house i had watched the flames from my balcony when the senate recalled cicero from exile sixteen months later he set about rebuilding clodius dogged him at every step blocking his progress with legal manoeuvres the property had been confiscated by the state and consecrated for religious use he claimed cicero countered that the confiscation was illegal and that his rights as a roman citizen had been grossly violated it had been one of their livelier uglier exchanges cicero had won the case the house had been rebuilt well i thought as we stepped across the threshold clodius would never threaten this home again tiro led me through the foyer to the atrium beyond the room was chilly high clouds had gathered blocking the suns warmth wait here a moment tiro said and exited to my left after only a brief pause i heard voices from the hallway to my right the first voice was muffled and indistinct but i recognized the second voice at once it was cicero well he was saying what if we tell people that it was clodius who staged the ambush instead of the other way around i also knew the third voice it was ciceros handsome fiery protege marcus caelius jupiters balls whod believe that given the circumstances better to say perhaps that the three men stepped into the atrium caelius saw me and fell silent at the same moment tiro returned from the opposite direction he saw the situation and looked chagrined cicero gave him a brief sharp look rebuking him for leaving a visitor unattended had i heard something i was not intended to hear gordianus agreed to pay you a visit tiro said quickly i went to the study to announce him but but i wasnt there said cicero his rich orators tones filled the atrium an unctuous smile lit up his fleshy face i tend to think better on my feet the more expansive the thoughts the bigger the circuit the study couldnt contain me weve walked a mile since you left tiro round and round the house well gordianus he stepped forwards im honoured to welcome you to my home once again you know marcus caelius of course i did indeed caelius crossed his arms and gave me a sardonic look he was a creature of quicksilver and always had been he had begun as ciceros pupil then he allied himself or appeared to do so with ciceros archenemy catilina that was how i first met him eventually he drifted into the camp of clodius and into the arms some said the clutches of clodia his felling out with those two had landed him in dire straits a trial for murder for which i helped gather evidence for the prosecution he had been rescued by cicero who came to the defence of his errant pupil with a stirring oration now to all appearances caelius was once again the faithful protege he seemed to bear me no ill will for having helped the opposing side at his trial his ambition was of the freewheeling sort that has little use for grudges he was famous for his sharp tongue but equally famous for his charm and extraordinary handsomeness he was now serving a term as a tribune which meant he was one of the few currently operating officers of the state but im not sure that youve met my other friend said cicero he gestured to the third man who hung back peering at me distrustfully the fellow was short and stocky with the kind of muscular barrelshaped body that looks even stouter in a toga his fingers were short and blunt as was his nose his face was round with a small mouth and deepset eyes under shaggy eyebrows the shadow of his beard was so heavy that it gave his jaw a dark greasy look no wonder he had been the natural enemy of the lithe longlimbed effortlessly elegant clodius physically two men could hardly have been more opposite milo was back in town after all vi of course i recognize titus annius milo i said but youre right cicero weve never been introduced well then its about time milo this is gordianus called the finder a man of great ingenuity we became acquainted many years ago when i took on my first murder case youve read my defence of sextus roscius of course everyone has but not many people know the part that gordianus played thirty years ago our paths have crossed from time to time since then i said dryly and our relationship has always been the great orator searched for a word interesting i suggested exactly come lets move to the study its chilly in the atrium we retired to a small wellheated room towards the back of the house the walk down the hallway and through the central garden gave me a chance to peruse the surroundings the furnishings draperies paintings and mosaics were all of the finest i had seen nothing more impressive even in clodiuss house the scale of ciceros place was more modest to be sure but in some ways that made it more pleasing cicero had always had impeccable taste he had always had enough money to indulge his tastes as well but he now seemed to have prospered well beyond merely keeping up appearances it takes real wealth to have a fountain decorated with golddusted mosaics or to hang a painting signed by iaia of cyzicus on the study wall or to display on a table to itself covered by a thick piece of perfectly transparent glass which must itself have carried a handsome price a scrap of an original scroll of a dialogue with corrections in platos own hand roman law forbids advocates from collecting fees for their services every case is probono yet successful advocates manage to become rich nonetheless instead of mere bags of silver they are rewarded with generous gifts of property or exclusive opportunities to invest cicero was one of the best advocates in rome and he had always known how to cultivate the best people his house was full of beautiful rare expensive things i could only imagine the treasures that had been destroyed or looted when the clodian mob burned his old house at ciceros direction a slave pulled a circle of chairs closer to the flaming brazier before we had settled ourselves another slave brought silver cups and a ewer of heated wine instead of hovering nearby tiro joined us he was a citizen now ciceros confederate not his slave still i noticed he held a wax tablet and a stylus on his lap for taking notes cicero sipped daintily from his cup tiro did likewise the wine was well watered cicero was not a man for strong indulgences the same could hardly be said of marcus caelius or at least of the caelius i had known before cicero reformed him he saw me watching him and made a show of following his mentors example pursing his lips and barely touching them to the rim the expression gave him such a simpering look that i decided he was deliberately mocking cicero milo made no pretence at delicacy he drained his cup in a single swallow and held it out to the slave for more gordianus was that surprise i read on your face when you recognized milo cicero cocked his head you werent expecting to find him here were you frankly i thought he must be halfway to massilia by now ha turn tail and run like a rabbit you truly dont know my friend milo if you could think him such a coward im not sure its a question of cowardice more of expedience anyway the rumour of his flight to massilia is widespread milo scowled but said nothing you see i told you said caelius finally speaking gordianus and his son hear everything between them their four ears catch every whisper in rome cicero nodded yes go on gordianus what else are people saying some say milo slipped back into the city last night and barricaded himself in his house and that he was there when the mob came to burn it so they think hes not a coward just a madman no milo spent the night here under my roof safe and sound what else do they say that he plans to incite a revolution he started by assassinating clodius and now hes gathering an army to march on rome his confederates inside the walls have stockpiled weapons and incendiary materials all over the city well you can see for yourself how absurd that rumour is milo is here in my house not out rabblerousing and does my house stink of sulphur and pitch of course not a revolution indeed theres not a man in rome more dedicated to the preservation of the republic than titus annius milo not even myself when i think of the abuse hes suffered and the terrible risks hes taken the weight of such sacrifices seemed to bear heavily on milo who finished his second cup of wine and looked at me glumly i looked around the room at the many scrolls in their pigeonhole cases at iaias painting of a scene from the odyssey at the priceless scrap of plato under glass you take an awful risk yourself cicero if the mob had known that milo was here yes i know what youre thinking this house has already been torched once but that was because clodius managed to drive me out of the city first it would never have happened if i had been here to stop it and it will never happen again so long as im present to defend to my last breath what belongs to me it may come to that for you as well gordianus before this crisis passes you have a fine house yourself now you have a family to protect think of those things and then think of that howling mob we saw yesterday running wild like a pack of dogs down in the forum do you know how sextus cloelius built the fire in the senate house he smashed the consuls chairs and the sacred tribunal and used the wood to build a funeral pyre for the monster he ripped up scrolls for kindling unspeakable desecration like their dead leader these useless freedmen and beggars have no respect at all for the majesty of the state and no respect for simple decency theyre a menace to any man who stands in their way cicero sat back and took a deep breath the important thing is the clodians were foolish enough to burn down the senate house they had the advantage up to that point people were clucking their tongues about poor pitiful clodius that was a masterstroke parading his corpse in public like that stripped naked with all the wounds showing as an advocate i have to admire their panache if i could drag a stinking corpse into court and shove it under the jurymens noses believe me i wouldnt think twice shock and sympathy are twothirds of the battle but they overplayed their advantage caelius swirled his wine cup they took the heat off milo and lit a fire under their own feet cicero raised his cup to caelius precisely oh caelius the turn of phrase is exquisite a metaphor thats also literally true they took the heat off milo and lit a fire under their own feet bravo even milo smiled begrudgingly and raised his cup he too was an orator after all with an appreciation for rhetoric you say that milo spent the night here i said cicero nodded yes while the clodians paraded clodiuss naked corpse all over the palatine milo waited outside the city not afraid to come back mind you but cautious sensible testing the wind like a general checking the lay of the land before he proceeds when i saw that the clodian fools were setting fires i sent a messenger to inform him if he wished to come back to the city he should do so stealthily i said and stay away from his own house i offered him my hospitality but the decision to return was his i rendered no advice either way milo saw the path before him and took it titus annius milo i have never known a braver man than you cicero gazed at the subject of his words with an intensity that would have made a more modest man blush but milos only reaction was to stiffen his jaw and raise his head higher his features did not appear to me remotely heroic as we are accustomed to seeing heroes portrayed in marble or bronze but he did know how to strike a defiant pose i could never have abandoned rome in her hour of need he said with a rhetorical quaver in his voice i came back to save her excellent said caelius tiro copy that down will you we must remember to use that i thought he was being rude or facetious but milo took no offence instead he leaned towards caelius with a quizzical expression or do you think it should be i never abandoned rome not even for a day no no it was perfect the way you said it the first time tiro did you get it tiro scribbled and nodded i realized that the discussion was taking place at more than one level and for more than one purpose youre in the middle of writing a speech arent you i said not yet said gicero were still working out the basic ideas you can be of enormous help to us gordianus im not sure i want to be i think you do he said giving me a look that must have been familiar to caelius and to all the others who had been his proteges and pupils the look said do not disappoint me look at us here locked away in my study unable to take a step out of doors without a troop of gladiators to protect us were blind and deaf we have a fierce brave heart milo here an eloquent tongue caelius a hand to write tiro and i dare say a cool head myself but we have no eyes no ears its a delicate business gauging the mood of the people in the street one must look one must listen miscalculations at moments of crisis like this can be he did not utter the word disastrous to speak of disaster would invite an ill omen besides everyone in the room understood precisely what he meant from bitter experience cicero knew only too well what the outcome could be when the mob turned against a man i only want your opinion on a few things gordianus the race for consul for instance it looks as though the elections may finally be held how would you gauge themood of the people towards milos candidacy i stared at him dumbfounded well are his chances better now than before or worse its a simple enough question yes but i can hardly believe that you expect a serious answer milo nervously tapped his empty cup against the arm of his chair he means to say that its hopeless is that what you mean gordianus cicero peered at me earnestly i cleared my throat clodius is dead someone killed him with great violence i saw the body myself saw it where snapped milo while i hesitated pondering whether to tell them about my visit to clodiuss house cicero spared me the decision by interrupting gordianus saw the body from his rooftop just as i saw it from mine i told you milo how they paraded the corpse all over the palatine yes i saw it from my rooftop i said it was not after all a he and if any roman didnt see it hes certainly heard about it and what exactly are people saying about the matter said cicero what do you mean how do they think clodius died who do they think was responsible if cicero wished to feign obtuseness i would oblige him the word on everyones lips is that milo killed him or milos men where on the appian way somewhere near bovillae cicero nodded moughtfully how i paused judging by the wounds i would say that daggers were used i thought of the puncture wound at the shoulder perhaps a spear as well and he may have been strangled you must have had a clearer view of the body than i did said cicero perhaps my eyes are trained for such details but youve heard no actual details of the fatal incident and how it came about no caelius nodded vigorously and neither have most people ill wager how could they have heard details who could possibly supply them milo worked his stubbly jaw back and forth and drummed his fingers against his cup still rumours spring up like weeds in a crack if a story has a hole in it people will fill it up with anything that fits have you heard rumours gordianus said cicero about a battle an ambush an accident ive heard all sorts of rumours an ambush a battle a single assassin a traitor among clodiuss men i think thats hopeful said caelius sitting back and raising an eyebrow he held out his wine cup and a slave hurried to fill it people havent yet made up their minds theres still a chance for us to tell them our side of the story but well have to do it quickly gossip sets like mortar in peoples heads once its hardened you have to chisel it out best to pour your own gossip into their ears first and of course theres the fire said cicero surely thats cracked open some hard heads people who were hostile to milo before will surely listen to reason now only the most lunatic radicals could take the side of that mob of pyromaniacs against milo he sighed exasperated i dont understand why the death of clodius should stir such a controversy anyway except among the small core of his most rabid followers any sensible man can see that rome is better off without the scoundrel its so obvious if we go before the people and say yes milo killed clodius arent we simply saying that milo is a hero were essentially proclaiming him the saviour of the republic cicero looked to me for a reaction i answered carefully i cant speak for most people but i think there are plenty of romans who are simply tired of all the chaos and disorder exactly said cicero and it was clodius who was behind all that disorder fomenting unrest among the rabble shaking up the natural order of things get rid of clodius and youre halfway to getting rid of chaos tiro take that down get rid of clodius you may be going too far said caelius shaking his head it begins to sound like gloating even people who are glad to see the last of clodius may have serious concerns about the circumstances of his death you cant make milo out to be a champion of law and order if at the same time you proudly assert that he broke the law by killing a man ah but it takes on a different light if you show that milo was the victim of an ambush and merely defending himself said cicero waving a finger was it an ambush i said looking from face to face was milo the intended victim tiro busy scribbling on his tablet didnt look up the others looked at me curiously cicero brightened well what do you think gordianus is it credible that clodius might have set an ambush for milo down on the appian way i shrugged their hatred for one another was well known caelius looked at me sceptically i felt like a witness under crossexamination but then isnt it just as likely that it was milo who set a trap for clodius what would you say to that idea gordianus but surely it cant have been both ways it must have been one or the other must it said cicero what if there was no ambush at all what if the two parties happened to meet on the appian way entirely by accident does that strike you as credible perhaps but people pass on the road all the time without someone ending up dead caelius laughed he has a point cicero pressed his fingertips together but accidents happen a man cant always control his slaves especially gladiators whove been trained to protect him and to react at the first hint of danger tiro make a note milo needs to free certain of his slaves who might otherwise be compelled to give testimony under torture slaves can be tortured but not freedmen if worse comes to worst if it comes to a trial you mean i said milo grunted cicero tapped his fingertips against each other its my conviction that milo will yet be elected consul he deserves no less for his service to the state still we must be prepared for less happy possibilities a trial for murder you mean what would milo have to fear from the testimony of his slaves cicero considered the question gordianus makes a good point if milo waits and frees the slaves at the wrong time it could look bad the earlier the better i think you can always say they were manumitted out of gratitude as a reward caelius suggested they saved his life after all did they i said well thats what well say said caelius looking at me as if i were a simpleton i shook my head in disgust youre only talking about appearances arent you and nothing more about this or that hypothetical version of what might or might not have happened and whether people will believe it you might as well be writing a comedy for the stage better a comedy than a tragedy quipped caelius cicero looked at me thoughtfully we are advocates gordianus this is what we do i shook my head cicero saw that i was not satisfied how shall i put this he said your nature is different from mine truth has a different meaning to you you seem to think it matters in and of itself but the truth you crave is an illusion chasing after truth is a fit pastime for greek philosophers who have nothing better to do but we are romans gordianus we have a world to run he studied me for a long moment and saw that i still resisted gordianus the next few days and months are absolutely critical to the survival of everything decent and honourable that remains in this city you saw what they did yesterday the madness the destruction the wanton desecration can you picture yourself in that mob surely not can you imagine what rome would be like if people of that ilk were allowed to rule a nightmare surely you can see where your own interests lie i studied each of their faces in turn gicero radiant with purpose tiro busy with his stylus caelius looking sombre but ready to grin and milo thrusting out his jaw like a stubborn boy spoiling for a fight but what really happened on the appian way i said i received only blank stares in reply before cicero smoothly moved on to some other subject and then quickly graciously firmly made it clear that my visit was at an end i left ciceros house without a satisfactory answer to my question and indeed with no clear idea of why he had summoned me cicero himself didnt appear to know exactly what he wanted from me but seemed merely to be feeling me out i had a vague sense of opposing forces marshalling their powers and wondered exactly where i stood in the scheme of things vii the siege at the house of the interrex marcus lepidus continued the next day and the next and the next with the partisans of scipio and hypsaeus continuing to demand immediate consular elections temples and business interests in the forum closed their doors every day great crowds came to gawk at the charred ruins of the senate house some wept some cheered fights and shouting matches were common some of the visitors laid flowers on the steps as if it were a sepulchre in honour of the man who had been cremated there others scattered the flowers and trampled on them affairs of state came to a standstill life continued however bethesda sent her slave girls down to the markets to buy the things she needed for dinner it took them longer than usual as they had to search harder but they returned with full baskets belbo went to fetch a pair of shoes that i had sent out to be repaired and reported that work went on more or less as usual in the street of the shoemakers people went about the daytoday business of gaining a livelihood and feeding themselves but with a sense of dreadful suspense rome had the distracted air of a man on a dark unfamiliar path doggedly pushing on fretfully looking over his shoulder waiting for something terrible to happen eco came to visit each day theyre all three mad if they think that the fellow still has a chance of being elected consul he said when i told him about my peculiar interview with cicero caelius and milo but cicero is right about one thing the clodians went too far when they burned the senate house they lost the sympathy of the people in the middle murders an outrage but fire scares the wits out of people fire is a symbol of purification i suggested maybe at a funeral or in a poem but when you start burning down buildings fire stands for discriminate destruction purifying the state may sound like a lofty idea in a speech but not when people start getting burned when reformers turn violent they scare people so that anyone with anything to lose prefers things to stay as they are thats one result then maybe milo does stand a chance to be elected consul never hes tainted by clodiuss death about which we still dont have any concrete details i said worriedly rubbing my chin so you think the voters will make hypsaeus and scipio consuls but arent they tainted as well they hadthe support of clodius and now people are frightened of the clodians yes but hypsaeus and scipio are seen as being their own men they werent associated with the burning of the senate house but theyre rabblerousers nonetheless look at the blockade their supporters have thrown around lepiduss house surely theyre no more acceptable to the people in the middle than clodius was eco looked at me thoughtfully if milos out and if hypsaeus and scipio are also out dont say it but he did people will turn to pompey pompey was much on the minds of many people in those days including his old ally milo on the fifth and final day of lepiduss term as interrex a trio of radical tribunes held a contio down in the forum eco and i attended a contio is a public openair meeting though it may have a feeling of informality it is a function of the state and is governed by specific rules only certain people may speak at a contio they must address a specific topic and so on most importantly only certain officials may hold a contio the consuls may do so for example so may the tribunes rome had no consuls for the time being but there were ten tribunes as usual some of them were keeping very busy the funeral of clodius or rather the gathering in the forum to hear clodius eulogized and to burn his corpse had been a contio or at least had started out that way it had been called by the tribunes pompeius and plancus i had seen both of these men at clodiuss house on the night of his murder in the anteroom where the politicians had gathered to assess the disaster the next day these two led the procession around the palatine and down to the forum it was their speeches which inflamed the mob pompeius and plancus were the same tribunes who had blocked the appointment of an interrex at the beginning of the new year and had thus pushed back the scheduling of elections at a time when milo felt confident of victory their contio on the final day of lepiduss term as interrex was attended by a great crowd when eco came to my house that morning and announced his intention to attend i declined at first to accompany him it would be insanity to go out in public at such a time i argued even with bodyguards but the pull of the forum was too strong for four days except for my visit to cicero i had kept almost entirely to my house i was growing restless in times of crisis or jubilation there is something in a romans blood that pulls him inexorably to join with great throngs of his fellow citizens to listen to other citizens make speeches beneath the open sky where men and gods alike can see and hear eco insisted that we push our way to the front of the crowd we wore our togas as befitted the occasion ecos bodyguards were dressed in tunics and cloaks thus one can often tell at a glance in a mixed crowd who is a citizen and who is a slave attending a citizen up on the platform plancus and pompeius were joined by their fellow tribune sallust it was sallust whom i heard in the house of clodius arguing that no one but clodius could control the mob he had warned of a bloodbath but apparently he had reconciled himself to the rabblerousing efforts of his fellow tribunes and had decided to join them these three addressed the crowd not with formal speeches but alternating back and forth as if having a conversation or a debate among themselves and soliciting the reactions of their fellow citizens the exact circumstances of the incident on the appian way were not discussed i was beginning to find this paucity of details maddening but no one else in the crowd seemed to mind or even to notice that milo and his men had murdered clodius in cold blood was simply taken for granted the issue was what to do about it the main thing the speakers all agreed was to hold consular elections at once once hypsaeus and scipio were in office milo could be dealt with accordingly but what about the rumours that milos raising an army shouted someone in the crowd if his goal is insurrection said sallust then its all the more important that we elect consuls at once in order to raise a force against him for the defence of the city but what about milos allies here inside the city shouted someone else they say he has secret stockpiles of all sorts of weapons they could cut our throats while we sleep they could set our houses on fire ha you clodian arsonists shouldnt talk about fire said another man there were harsh words a scuffle broke out though it was some distance away ecos bodyguards grew tense and tightened their circle around us the speakers on the platform ignored the interruption the fact is said sallust milo is back in rome this news sent a murmur through the crowd a man behind me close enough for me to smell the garlic on his breath cupped his hands around his mouth the shameless pig came back to rome the very day after he murdered clodius he shouted milo must have been in his house that night when we went to pay a call with our torches i should know i took an arrow in my shoulder the man pulled his toga open at the throat to show off his bandages brave citizen cried sallust he raised his arm in salute which prompted a round of cheering mixed with a few jeers but whatever milos whereabouts for the last few days we know that he was in town as of yesterday because yesterday milo emerged from hiding to go and pay a visit to pompey magnus at his villa on the pincian hill this news set off another murmur in the crowd in the race for consul pompey had given his blessing to hypsaeus who had served him as a military officer in the east but pompey and milo had once been allies and pompey and clodius had often been enemies could it be that the great one had been induced to countenance milos crime and to throw his support behind the murderer pompeys involvement could shift the balance conclusively either for milo or against him sallust smiled reading the crowds anxiety and uncertainty drawing out the suspense with his silence you will be happy to learn he finally said that pompey magnus to his great credit refused even to see the villain the suspense broke with a round of cheers and more than that he sent the scoundrel a roundabout message politely asking him to refrain from calling again so as to spare pompey the embarrassment of refusing to see him again milos perfidy is so profound that even the great one fears it might taint him if he should brush against it the tribune plancus stepped forwards he spoke as if engaging sallust in conversation but his words rang out as only those of a trained orator can i should imagine that milo was greatly offended by pompeys rebuff i should imagine he was agreed sallust we know that milo is a man who offends easily and we have seen how deadly his grudges can be plancus mimed an expression of dismay we were so close to the platform that i could see just how broadly he played his part what are you implying sallust do you imagine that pompey himself might be in danger sallust gave a worldweary shrug exaggerated just enough so that the gesture could be read from the back of the crowd weve seen that the monster will stop at nothing to take over the state clodius has already fallen victim to his bloodlust if pompey now stands in his way there were cries from the crowd no never impossible milo wouldnt dare wouldnt he the tribune pompeius who had been holding back stepped forwards as a member of pompeys clan he claimed the crowds full attention i shall tell you what i think he said it was milo who provided a body to be cremated in the senate house and its milo wholl provide another body to be buried on the capitoline hill his meaning was clear for who but pompey could be worthy of a sepulchre on the hill of romes most sacred temples the crowd raised their fists and began to shout drowning out the speakers on the platform who seemed only too pleased to fall silent and yield to the roar of the mob was milo plotting to kill pompey the tribunes had not offered even a shred of evidence but the mere suggestion drove the crowd to a frenzy the forum was like a great pool of sound individual cries were like pebbles that rippled through the crowd and echoed back from its edges all coalesced into a deafening indistinct roar until somewhere in the crowd someone began to chant the chant was joined by more and more voices until it rose above the roar vote now vote now it was the same cry that had echoed for days around the house of the interrex marcus lepidus the crowd began to move how this movement began i never quite understood i saw no signal from the tribunes on the stage i heard no shout from the crowd urging everyone to head for the house of lepidus perhaps if i had been on my rooftop watching instead of in the thick of things i could have seen and understood the dynamics of the mob or perhaps not one might as easily comprehend the uncanny unison of a swarm of bees in flight however it happened the crowd became a mob and the mob began to move as a single body towards the palatine eco and i moved along with it for a while unable to separate ourselves like flotsam on a current i was jostled and poked and pushed forwards against my will i gritted my teeth and grunted but the same experience that i found so unpleasant seemed to invigorate many of those around me who grinned and made giddy whoops of excitement as if they had drunk too much wine little by little we worked our way sideways through the press of the crowd until we reached the edge and were able to drop back even eco seemed intoxicated by the excitement whats wrong papa he said smiling and catching his breath dont you want to join the march on the interrexs house dont be funny eco theres no telling what will happen im going home so should you i spent that afternoon on my rooftop anxiously looking for signs of fire or smoke i saw none but heard the clattering echoes of some kind of battle taking place in the direction of lepiduss house a sharp wind began to gust from the north followed by dark clouds as the first cold raindrops pelted my face bethesda appeared in the garden come down from there she demanded her hands on her hips i obeyed but halfway down the ladder i turned to stone as did everything around me a bolt of lightning opened the sky jupiter blinked as the augurs say the blinding flash of bonewhite light was followed by a crack of thunder so loud that the earth itself seemed to flinch rain swept across the garden i hurried down the ladder shivering and told belbo to light the brazier in my study i hardly had a chance to warm my hands over the flames before belbo was back announcing a visitor the same as before he said ciceros man tiro belbo nodded well show him in what about his bodyguards they can stay outside in the rain a moment later tiro stepped into the room pushing the hood back from his face his heavy woollen cloak was wet he covered his mouth and coughed cicero shouldnt send you out in the rain tiro he should consider your health its only a short walk besides he thinks youre fond of me and that i might not come if he sent someone else to fetch me tiro smiled will you come shouldnt you and i have a brief polite conversation about the weather first thunder and lightning said tiro rolling his eyes skyward omens and portents if you believe in that sort of thing doesnt everybody dont be disingenuous tiro it doesnt suit you just because your master your former master i mean pretends to go along with such superstitious ideas for the sake of politics you really despise cicero dont you i sighed no more or less than i despise all the rest of his kind i suppose his kind politicians no i think you despise him more than the rest because once upon a time you thought he was different somehow and then he disappointed you perhaps whereas you expect only the worst from the rest of them so theyve never let you down i shrugged but isnt it really only your own false expectations that have let you down gordianus do you think a man can cross a muddy street without getting his feet dirty cicero cant walk on air no one can cicero doesnt just cross the muddy street tiro he stoops down and flings handfuls of mud at anybody in his way he sticks out his foot and trips people and claps when they fall on their faces then he washes his hands at the nearest fountain and blithely pretends they were never dirty tiro gave me a grudging smile cicero can be a bit selfrighteous smug is more like it yes well i try to tone down those parts in his speeches but its a funny thing people may say that modesty is a virtue but they respect a man who sings his own praises they think if hes vain he must have a reason and when such a bright fellow starts slinging mud they pay attention they figure he must have a good reason for doing that too you dont have to convince me that cicero knows how to manipulate an audience gordianus these are merely questions of style not content certain things about cicero rub you the wrong way dont you think i sometimes tire of his manner spending so many hours of the day in his company he can drive me mad and yet ive never met a more admirable or honourable man in all my life fundamentally you and cicero are on the same side tiro you neednt try to convince me to come along with you ive only been waiting for a break in our conversation to send belbo after my cloak but look here he is already anticipating my needs belbo put the cloak over my shoulders i pulled it around me the weather has turned colder still lets hope this rain keeps up said tiro it makes it harder to start fires keeps the flames from spreading there weve talked about the weather shall we be going i found cicero in his study deep in conversation with marcus caelius cicero looked up and saw me scanning the room milo isnt here he said hes returned to his own house a show of selfconfidence after all what does milo have to fear in his own home when the people of rome love him so do they how can they not after the favour hes done them ridding the world of that appalling scoundrel he trapped the tyrant in iron bands and slew him with his own bare hands i said finishing the quotation from ennius well did he did he what did milo slay clodius with his own bare hands i remembered the marks i had seen on clodiuss throat something had been twisted around his neck before he died either to restrain him or to choke him or to drag him cicero shrugged i wasnt there to see but the image appeals to me like his namesake the fabled wrestler of croton milo is a strong fellow i suppose he could strangle a man to death what do you think caelius caelius looked thoughtful strangulation it might make people forget the blood take their minds off those gaping wounds the idea of clodius being strangled i like it its cleaner less gory thinking about knives sets peoples teeth on edge strangulation is more manly more heroic it suggests killing an animal barehanded it equates clodius with a wild beast best to skirt such graphic details really but if we must discuss the actual where and how of the murder i didnt come here to listen to two orators toss ideas in the air i said caelius smiled but how else can we see which ideas float and which ones fall like stones you can do that after i leave tiro made a face of disapproval at my rudeness why did you agree to come gordianus said cicero i thought perhaps tiro had converted you with his eloquence converted me but i thought you said we were already in the same camp cicero we are you just dont realize it yet he laced his fingers behind his head and smiled dont be so smug cicero you asked me to come here i am why did i come i walked to the brazier and spread my hands over the flames because its a cold night in rome and dark outside like everyone else im craving warmth and light especially light my reasons for coming are entirely selfish i want more illumination on the path ahead any glimmer to show the way knowledge is a fire it burns high in this house but right now it seems to be putting out a great deal more smoke than light cicero shrugged goodnaturedly well then perhaps you might cast some light for me gordianus perhaps i believe you went down to the contio in the forum today yes how did you know that he waved his hand dismissively one sees things hears things how one has eyes and ears spies you mean he shrugged let us say that very little happens here on the palatine that escapes my notice but there are places where my eyes and ears cant go not safely anyway not without being noticed such as a contio held by three radical tribunes to stir up the mob three pompeius plancus sallust sallust as well i thought he might have come to his senses by now cicero thoughtfully tapped his chin not a good sign said caelius sallust is the cautious one if hes decided to start stirring up riots with the others they didnt incite a riot i said it ended with a march on lepiduss house a march said cicero it may have begun that way but by the time they arrived it was an allout assault he stood and began to pace he suddenly looked weary you didnt witness the attack yourself gordianus of course not i went home and bolted my doors then ill tell you what happened the rabble marched up the palatine and joined their fellows at the barricade then altogether they rushed the house of lepidus and broke down the door they used jiving stones theyd pulled up from the street they broke the lock and smashed the bolt into splinters make note of that gordianus the next time you bolt your door at night and lie down to sleep thinking youre safe no mans house is secure if theres a mob determined to get inside they ransacked the place overturned the busts of lepiduss ancestors smashed furniture tore apart the ceremonial looms in the hall so much for the patrician ladies spinning an orderly pattern for the future of rome the poor women ran screaming in fright the mob probably intended to seize lepidus and force him to conduct some sort of mock election right there on the spot not much doubt which candidates that rabble would have chosen is there hypsaeus and scipio clodiuss old allies as if such proceedings could carry any authority at all the gods help rome when the day comes that men are chosen to head the state at the whim of a raging mob fortunately milo was ready cicero tapped his skull always thinking ever vigilant milo expected that something like this might occur on the last day of lepiduss interregnum so he arranged to have his own men assembled in a side street out of sight when the attack on the house began they rallied and mounted a counterattack from the rear there was quite a battle and no little amount of bloodshed but needless to say the clodian rabble quickly scattered and fled their type is useless in a mantoman fight milos men found lepidus locked away in an upstairs room with his wife and daughters all ready to slash their wrists can you imagine an interrex of rome was on the verge of killing himself rather than be torn apart by a mob of slaves and freedmen and the women of his house were preparing to die rather than be raped by such men i tell you even in the darkest days of the civil war there was never such a shame on the republic and once again it was milo who came to the rescue but what chance is there that his foresight and vigilance will be recognized let alone rewarded as they should be if ever a man deserved to be consul cicero seemed to speak from the heart sincerely outraged by the attack on lepidus sincerely in awe of his friends patriotic zeal but of course i reminded myself it was a part of his profession to be able to speak without apparent artifice to strike the heartfelt tone to stir emotions in his listeners against their will i cleared my throat is it true what they say about milo and pompey cicero frowned and looked puzzled at the sudden change of subject caelius raised a curious eyebrow has pompey also become a menace to the state i said is that why milos plotting to do away with him as clodius was done away with for the good of rome does he intend to strangle the general with his own bare hands no wonder pompey wont allow him into his villa ciceros frown deepened is that what was said at the contio today i nodded thats what really stirred up the mob they said that milo paid a call on pompey and pompey refused to see him it was implied that pompey fears for his life and with good reason what cicero was aghast or pretended to be i quote the tribune pompeius it was milo who provided a body to be cremated in the senate house and its milo wholl provide another body to be buried on the capitoline hill absurd there certainly seemed to be nothing theatrical or premeditated in the way cicero spat out the word those rabblerousers will say anything and the idiots will believe it the audience for the contio gordianus did it seem to you that it was made up of handpicked supporters packed with clodian sympathizers not particularly there were dissenting voices in the crowd it was a mixed group a great many people of all sorts were interested to hear what the tribunes had to say i was there myself and yet the crowd was swayed by such nonsense more than swayed cicero from what youve told me of the attack on lepiduss house its completely false then what theyre saying about milo and pompey of course yes well perhaps not completely false said marcus caelius raising an eyebrow at me and then casting an imperturbable catlike gaze at his agitated mentor well cicero gordianus has been candid with us he deserves our candour in return the fact is that milo did attempt to pay a call on pompey and pompey rebuffed him it was a miscalculation on milos part if you ask me he felt obliged to seek the great ones blessing he should have known better but our milo is a simple man simple in the virtuous sense as our ancestors supposedly were having done pompey so many favours in the past milo assumed that the great one would feel obliged to return those favours now that milo is in dire straits think again so the radical tribunes knew about the rebuff i nodded how did sallust put it pompey sent the scoundrel a roundabout message asking him to refrain from calling again so as to spare pompey the embarrassment of refusing to see him again youve always had an excellent memory for words said cicero quietly indeed said caelius you could make tiros shorthand obsolete he turned to cicero but how did sallust and the rest find out about pompeys message it was sent in secret and to this house not directly to milo perhaps pompey wasnt as discreet as he wanted us to think said cicero easy enough to whisper the news from ear to ear until the tribunes knew about it pompey is like everyone else at the moment hes testing the waters caelius turned back to me and what did sallust and the other tribunes say about the subsequent exchange of messages between milo and pompey i shook my head they only mentioned the visit and pompeys rebuff well then perhaps pompey is being discreet after all said caelius you see gordianus milo was quite shaken when pompey refused his visit when he received pompeys message declining any further visits milo sent pompey a message in return begging him to reconsider and offering caelius said cicero but we might as well tell gordianus everything insisted caelius well then milo offered to quit the race for consul if pompey wanted him to a word from you pompey magnus and for the good of rome i will abandon my ambitions to serve her of course he was really fishing for some backhanded encouragement no no dear fellow politics prevents me from receiving your visit but of course you must run but thats not what he got what did pompey say the great one is apparently too far above the fray to be bothered with milos petty ambitions he sent back a curt reply it is not for me to say who can or cannot stand for office i would never dream of imposing my opinion on the roman people who are quite capable of making their own judgment without my advice cold cold as chilly as the rain thats coming down cicero shook his head they werent small favours the sacrifices milo made for pompey over the years but now that milos in trouble and clodius is no longer a threat pompey cant cut his ties to milo fast enough pompey may yet come around if he can be made to see that its in his interest said caelius we cant count on that said cicero milo will have to make his move without pompeys support caelius nodded i agree word will spread tonight about the rescue of lepidus that will count in milos favour milo stands for order and tradition against the lawless mob and we shouldnt underestimate the resentment that decent people feel against the clodians for burning the senate house i think we can count on a favourable crowd tomorrow tomorrow i said caelius smiled another contio this time called by me be sure to come gordianus we shall fight fire with fire you dont mean that literally i hope caelius laughed viii eco called on me early the next morning brimming with news papa have you heard what happened at lepiduss house yesterday after the contio yes quite a battle apparently blood all over lepiduss house they say his ancestral busts ruined beyond repair the yarn for the ceremonial looms all a tangled mess but now hell always be known as the interrex who held firm against the mob he got his five days of fame we were damned lucky the violence didnt start down in the forum while we were still in that crowd what if milos little army had shown up there instead of waiting in ambush at lepiduss house im an old man eco i cant outrun a mob no one forced you to go to the contio papa i grunted dont you trust my new bodyguards i grunted again i suppose the senatorial committee will choose a new interrex today thats the word no one knows where theyre meetingprobably outside the city theyve kept the location secret afraid of another blockade or a battle the new interrex will have the authority to call elections but with things so unsettled it seems unlikely that well actually see new consuls in the next five days oh and speaking of unsettled theres to be another contio today this one called by the notsoradical tribune marcus caelius yes and they say that milo himself may speak eco looked at me archly papa youre remarkably well informed for a man who never sets foot in the forum unless i drag you there something tells me youve been in touch with cicero again tell me everything i gave him the details of my visit to ciceros house on the previous day eco drew his own conclusions pompeys behaving like a bastard isnt he oh i dont know what a backstabber milo was his ally for years and now ah but little things like murder can sour even the sincerest relationships if milo killed clodius just how far do pompeys obligations of friendship extend eco looked at me quizzically why do you say if what do you mean you said if milo killed clodius oh i suppose i did well i dont see why you defend pompey this little thing this murder seems only to have strengthened ciceros support ofmilo yes one cant fault ciceros loyalty i suppose its because theyre so much alike cicero and milo i thought of cicero frail in youth dyspeptic in middle age shrewd calculating a model of taste and refinement and then of milo who seemed quite the opposite with his robust bullish physique his bluff manner and a rough edge to his character that no amount of money or education had ever managed to smooth away alike in what ways eco well theyre the two brightest of the new men arent they the two shiniest new stars in the firmament or they would be if milo could ever get himself elected consul eco had a point cicero had been the first of his family to attain a magistracy he had been born with money and means to be sure but none of his ancestors had ever held high office with his election as a quaestor at the age of thirty he had become as the parlance goes a new man in the halls of power this in itself was a great achievement but ciceros ascent had not ended with the lower magistracies he had worked his way all the way up to consul this was truly remarkable as a rule the consulship is attained only by candidates already of consular family men whose ancestors held the consulship before them thus do the high nobility by various traps and schemes perpetuate their status and exclude newcomers but against all odds cicero had attained the consulship and he was the first new man of his generation to do so milo was also a new man if he became consul he would be only the second new man in living memory after cicero to do so i see what you mean eco i suppose they see themselves as the only two members of a very exclusive club theyve risen above their birth so that they can now look down on people like you and me from a comfortable height but theyre still outsiders and interlopers to the old aristocratic families who were born to privilege and great expectations like their mutual enemy clodius or pompey i noted or caesar so its all the better that theyre so different on the outside said eco they get to play each others alter ego cicero and milo alter egoswell cicero certainly seems determined to stand by milo no matter what hes done whether the mob likes it or not and whether pompey likes it or not for that matter but to what end said eco for my decision to attend caeliuss contio that day i have no one to blame but myself the event attracted a considerable crowd even larger than the crowd that had attended the radical tribunes contio the previous day the news of the battle at lepiduss house had made people even more restless and anxious as i have said in times of duress romans gather by instinct in large groups to listen to speeches with ecos bodyguards helping to clear the way we managed to find a good spot in front of the speakers platform despite the crush i peered at the sea of faces around us trying to judge the temper of the crowd i noticed a number of stuffy conservative types men of means attended by large retinues of bodyguards and retainers dressed in immaculate togas spun from superior wool eco pointed to such a specimen nearby businessman he said banker i countered merely for the sake of argument promilo anticlodius more likely and probably more outraged by the burning of the porcian basilica than the loss of the senate house eco nodded probably impressed that milos men saved marcus lepidus probably hopes therell be someone to do the same for him if the mob ever attacks his house but is milo the man for him maybe thats what hes here to decide more numerous than the wealthy traders and bankers in the crowd were citizens of more modest appearance who might have been small shopkeepers or craftsmen or free labourers eco nodded in the direction of such a man nearby a glumlooking fellow attended by a single slave and dressed in a toga with a worn hem that one looks to have less to lose than our banker friend and less to start with a fire in his apartment block could wipe him out completely well if the worst happened he neednt go hungry theres always the grain dole that clodius established i shook my head people like him want the state to give them order more than they want a grain dole he craves stability no less than our banker friend do you think thats why hes here looking for law and order why not lets find out eco took my arm and together we slid through the crowd to the consternation of ecos bodyguards who were hard pressed to follow citizen said eco dont i know you the man looked at eco appraisingly i dont think so yes im almost certain we frequent the same tavern you know that little place the three dolphins thats it yes im sure weve spoken before maybe the mans glum expression lightened a bit oh you remember we once had quite a laugh you know at that funny fellow who works there gaius you mean yes hes an odd one the man chuckled and of course eco gestured with his hands to suggest an ample bosom the man flashed a crooked smile and nodded ah the old mans daughter the one he claims is still a virgin ha eco discreetly tapped his foot against mine as if to say the fish is hooked gaining the confidence of a total stranger is one of the tricks that eco learned from me and he likes to show off to his teacher i saw him glance quickly at the mans hands appraising the chapped fingertips and the red stain under the fingernails do you still work as a cloth dyer what else washing and dyeing washing and dyeing over in the street of the fullers every day for more than twenty years now is that right eco lowered his voice to a confidential tone say how much did they give you what this morning you know what i mean how much did milos men give you the fuller looked at eco and then glanced warily at me its all right said eco the fellows with me hes a harmless mute i discreetly kicked ecos ankle this was a private joke it was eco who had once been a mute not me now he had effectively prevented me from saying a word so how much did they give you said eco again same as everyone else i imagine said the fuller yes but how much well i never like to say exactly but enough the man tapped at a purse tucked away in his toga and produced a muffled clink and a promise for quite a bit more if ill vote for him when the time comes and you a hundred sesterces said eco what a hundred they gave me only half that much ah but the hundred was for both of us eco hooked his thumb at me the man nodded mollified by ecos explanation then he frowned but if your friend is a mute and cant even shout his support it hardly seems fair to pay him as much as ah but as you can see the two of us each have two slaves men with strong lungs and you appear to have only one even with my friend being mute that gives us five voices to your two yes well i suppose so citizen what do you make of all this with an expansive gesture eco indicated the whole forum and by extension the crisis plaguing rome the fuller shrugged same as usual only worse except that now theyve gone from character assassination to assassination outright wed be lucky if theyd all kill each other off starting from the top down wipe themselves out but you know how it is when the big fellows start railing they fall on top of us little fellows and crush us eco nodded sagely then youre not a particularly enthusiastic supporter of milo fah the man curled his hp in disdain oh hes certainly better than some others or else i wouldnt be here you couldnt pay me enough to attend a contio held by the clodians that fellow clodius was worse than a beast in rut screwing his own sister and they say when he was a boy he sold himself to rich old men you know the song to get ahead he gave them head then took his sister to his bed and but what about the grain dole the man was suddenly incensed just another scheme to make himself more powerful yes clodius set up the grain dole and then who was put in charge of keeping the lists of eligible citizens sextus cloelius thats right clodiuss number one henchman the one who torched the senate house as corrupt as they come dont talk to me about the grain dole its all a racket a racket said eco of course you must know how it works enlighten me all right sextus cloelius talks a man into freeing half his household slaves the slaves become freedmen but where are they going to go they still work for their old master they still live in his house but as freedmen they can go onto the grain dole so their master doesnt have to feed them anymore the state does for his cut sextus cloelius enlists these new freedmen into the clodian gang to stalk the streets at night and show up at contios to terrorize the opposition and they get to vote as well the grain dole clodius passed off the whole nasty business as a big favour hed done for the common man in rome people like me providing us with a way to feed ourselves in bad times but it was just a way to supply riimself with new voters and gang members and to feed them at state expense i tell you i was born a citizen and it makes me furious to see clodiuss gang of exslaves getting the same privileges as me what a conniver that clodius was right up to the last they say he was working out more new schemes to give even more power to freedmen if hed had his way hed have torn down the state and put his gangs in charge of everything then wed have had king clodius chopping off heads right and left and a bunch of exslaves bullying the rest of us were all better off with him dead thats for sure milo did a good thing i dont mind turning up to shout a few words of encouragement for him and if it puts a little jingle in your purse said eco why not yes why not well ill talk to you later citizen perhaps well meet again at the three ducks the three dolphins said the fuller exactly eco smiled and withdrew taking my arm well papa was i right about the fellow on the contrary eco i was right just as i speculated our friend the fuller came here today to support law and order indeed not papa the man was bribed to be here probably like threequarters or more of the rest of this crowd i knew id seen some of milos lieutenants passing out money when i walked through the forum earlier this morning on my way to your house i suppose we should be insulted that we werent offered anything the bribe dispensers all know us by now eco i suppose thats it this little gathering is costing milo a tidy sum yes but i was still right about what about why our friend the fuller is here hes looking for the rule of law and order and a bribe said eco and a bribe i conceded caelius and milo soon arrived surrounded by a large retinue as they made their way through the crowd people craned their necks to get a look at milo and when they saw him many began to cheer their excitement seemed genuine and why not for better or worse milo was the man of the hour and this was his first appearance in public since the incident on the appian way all eyes were on him all ears were eager to hear him speak with or without bribery milo had many supporters he had been campaigning for the consulship for a long time and in an effort to expand his support beyond the best people he had spent a fortune on extravagant games and shows rome loves a politician who knows how to stage a spectacle some magistrates are required to put on shows at various annual festivals at their own expense as part of their official duties for the year other men put on shows as private citizens in the guise of funeral games whatever the pretext every politician ascending the rungs of the magistracies is obligated to outdo his rivals in producing the most memorable races and comedies and gladiatorial combats the practice is so accepted that no one ever seems to notice that providing expensive public entertainments is just as much a kind of electoral bribery as putting coins directly into the purses of voters nowadays people seem to have lost the will to object even to that marcus caelius ascended the platform and called the contio to order caelius had been trained in oratory from boyhood by both cicero and the late marcus crassus he was their most brilliant pupil he had mastered the formal challenges of constructing a speech as well as the technical skills of modulating his voice and casting it to great distances but more notably over the years he had crafted a wickedly sarcastic style which set the tone for his whole generation when older orators striving for new effects attempted to emulate this style the result was often blatant and shrill but it was never so when practised by caelius himself this was his genius that he was able to cast over a large crowd the same charm that he emanated in closer quarters but without the ironical undercutting that one often felt in his immediate presence he was able to utter the most vicious innuendoes and obscene double entendres at a public gathering without seeming vindictive or vulgar instead he seemed only effortlessly clever and witty and quite sincere this gave him tremendous power as an orator caelius was not really in his element playing the rabblerousing tribune at a contio he was more suited to courts of law especially as a prosecutor where he could pour his acid over a squirming victim before an appreciative audience of cultured jurors educated men like himself who appreciated swift convoluted wordplay still caelius commenced his contio displaying the selfassurance he was known for of the sort that cannot be faked good citizens of rome you see beside me on the platform today a man you all know titus annius milo his name has been on all your lips of late you have gone to bed at night thinking about him asking yourselves just what sort of man is this milo youve awakened in the morning wondering where on earth he might be and every hour of every day you have considered the same pressing question which you must be considering even now when will this madness be over well we are here to get some answers not tomorrow not somewhere eke but here and now first wonder no more where milo is hes standing right in front of you his head held high proudly showing himself in the heart of the city he has served so long and so faithfully you may have heard a wild rumour that milo had left rome for good and was never coming back yes i see some of you nodding you know the rumour ridiculous think of that which you love best in all the world would you ever let yourself be parted from it or abandon it for any reason no not if you had to die first not even he lowered his voice if you had to kill that is how much milo loves rome he will never forsake her which brings us back to the first question what sort of fellow is milo what is his character thats something each of you may decide for yourself when you have had a chance to hear him out yes milo himself shall speak to you today the rules allow him to speak since milo is himself the subject of this contio and i demand that he speak since i am the tribune who called this contio demand him to speak i say because milo did not come here willingly oh no i had to drag him here today against his will do you think he wanted to leave his safe house to go walking in a city where madmen run riot crying out for his death milo is exceedingly brave but hes not a fool no he came only because i insisted that he come only because i as your tribune demanded it which brings us to the third question which weighs like a stone on all of us which fills our heads like the stench from the smoking ruins of the senate house over yonder when will this madness be over not until something is done about the death of clodius im afraid not until the whole ugly incident is put to rest as the shade of clodius himself was supposedly put to rest when his friends set fire to him like a faggot in the senate house how did clodius die and why and who killed him the friends of clodius claim that he was viciously attacked and killed without cause they point the finger of blame at milo they call him a murderer they insinuate that he intends to kill again and that next time his victim will be a man far more revered far greater than clodius ever was then let us put titus annius milo on trial yes right here right now let us put him on trial for murder not a trial such as the magistrates hold with jurors chosen from the senate and the higher orders it is you the people citizens of rome who have suffered most from the chaos of the last few days and so i bring this matter directly to you the people and earnestly solicit your judgment you see i have not come to praise milo i have come to try him and if you should determine that he is a vicious murderer that he plots more murders then let him leave our midst yes let him be banished let us send him into exile and make that vicious rumour real let us drive milo from the heart of the city he loves into the wilderness at this there were scattered cries of indignation from the crowd as if the idea of milo in exile outraged them i noticed that our friend the fuller was among the first to raise his voice in protest he was soon joined by a swelling chorus of dissent someone had done a thorough job of seeding the crowd but i noticed that the man i had called a banker was yelling in protest too and gesturing for those in his retinue to raise their voices surely a man of his means had not been bought with a mere fifty sesterces caelius raised his hands for silence and put on an expression of dismay citizens please restrain yourselves you love milo as milo loves rome i understand that still he must be called to account he must be judged and we must be sober in our verdict no more cheering or jeering i beg you this is not a candidates rally this is a contio held in time of dire emergency a solemn inquiry into a matter that has crippled our city with riot and fire what we do here today will be talked about all over the seven hills and beyond the city walls those who cannot be here today great and small alike will take notice of your judgment remember that eco spoke in my ear another reference to pompey caelius stepped to one side of the platform milo come forwards proud and with head held high that was how caelius had described milo certainly he did not have the scurrying gait or furtive look of a man haunted by guilt he swept forwards without hesitation and with a grand almost swaggering air of confidence his toga was better fitted than the one he had worn at ciceros house draped and folded to give the best impression of his short stocky physique his usually beardshadowed jaw looked so pale that i wondered if he had applied some sort of cosmetic at a real trial he would have been expected to put on his shabbiest toga shamble about like an old man wear his hair unkempt and let his beard grow stubbly jurors expect an accused man to exploit their sympathies clearly milo was having none of that to show himself at a trial even a mock trial looking more like a proud candidate than an anxious defendant was an act of pure defiance this partisan crowd loved it despite caeliuss admonitions a loud and seemingly spontaneous cheer echoed through the forum milos lips twitched into a smirk and he lifted his chin several degrees higher caelius put on a stern face and raised his arms for silence citizens must i remind you what we are here for let us proceed let titus annius milo make an accounting of his actions caelius stepped back to allow milo full run of the platform milo was of the armswinging school of oratory which requires an expansive stage in many ways the opposite of caelius his forte was not the small jest that only later in the speech blossoms into hilarity or the elegant understatement that veils a pointed dagger milo represented what cicero had once jokingly ridiculed as the hammer and yoke school of oratory pound home every point with a heavy hammer then yoke up the metaphors and flog them all the way to market but not every speaker can be a cicero or caelius every orator has to find the style that suits him and dogged earnestness bordering on stolid defiance suited milo that morning striding back and forth across the platform waving his arms he seemed utterly blunt and candid though i knew that his every word and gesture must have been carefully scripted and rehearsed again and again in ciceros study fellow citizens of this beloved city my friend marcus caelius is right the madness that threatens us all will never be dispelled until the true circumstances of the death of publius clodius are made known i dont know what youve heard about his death can only imagine the ugly rumours that have been flying and the vicious aspersions that have been cast against me and against my loyal servants who bravely risked their lives to save my own im not the sort to give pretty speeches i will be brief and to the point i can only tell you what i know nine days ago i left rome and set out on a short journey down the appian way some of you may know that i hold a local office back in my home town lanuvium last year my fellow lanuvines elected me their dictator a quaint way of saying chief magistrate the office is not demanding but occasionally i do have to go home to fulfil my obligations this was such an occasion i was called upon to nominate a priest to the local cult of juno to preside over her festival next month junos patronage of lanuvium goes back to ancient times before the lanuvines were conquered by rome her festival is the biggest day of the year in lanuvium traditionally the roman consuls attend so i intend to return to lanuvium next month in that capacity because there will be elections and i will be elected consul there was an outburst of cheering milo waited for it to subside that morning i attended the regular meeting of the senate which broke up around the fourth hour of the day then i went home to change into travelling clothes my wife was going with me i would have preferred to start right away the trip to lanuvium is about eighteen miles an easy days journey if you get an early enough start but with all her lastminute preparations isnt that always the way with a wife we didnt leave rome until well after midday for her comfort we rode in an open carriage bundled up in heavy cloaks i should like to have travelled lighter but my wife insisted on bringing her serving maids and boys along so we had quite a long retinue as you all know the appian way heads south straight as an arrows flight and flat as a table its not until you reach the vicinity of mount alba that the road takes a few turns and you begin to ascend a bit there are some grand homes in that area pompey has a villa in the woods not too far off the road so did publius clodius i wish i had remembered that and been more cautious clodius must have known of my plan to go to lanuvium that dayit was no secret perhaps he also knew that i would be accompanied by my wife and her servants encumbered with a most unwarlike retinue im told that clodius had said outright and in public only a few days previously that he intended to kill me within a matter of days we cant take the consulship from milo but we can take his life thats what he said and this was the day he intended to make good on that threat at that lonely spot on the appian way i found out later that clodius had left rome suddenly quietly the previous day to be ready for me to he in wait he must have had scouts posted along the way running ahead to let him know that i was coming he chose a spot where the higher ground gave him the advantage there i was in a carriage with all those women and servant boys and there was clodius with his troop of trained killers on horseback hidden in the trees off the road waiting and watching the ambush occurred at about the eleventh hour of the day the sun was already beginning to dip below the higher trees and then the attackconfusion screaming blood if id been a bird flying overhead i might be able to tell you exactly what happened but to me sitting in that carriage with my wife it all began in the blink of an eye all at once there were men with swords standing in the road blocking our way my driver shouted at them they rushed at him pulled him from the carriage and stabbed him to death right before my eyes i threw off my cloak i found my sword and leaped from the vehicle by hercules the screams of my wife still echo in my ears the men whod killed my driver came after me but the fellows were cowards at heart a few swings of my sword and they fled like rabbits when milo mimed the action with broad strokes through the air it wasnt hard to imagine men fleeing from him then i realized that more men were attacking the retinue behind me amid the confusion i saw clodius himself astride a hone he turned and saw my beloved fausta he heard her screaming he didnt see me the carriage blocked his view but he must have seen my rumpled cloak and thought that i was still in the carriage with fausta slumped over dead because he cried out to his companions weve got him milos dead at last hes dead let me tell you citizens its a strange thing hearing a man proclaim your death in a gleeful voice my bodyguards farther back in the retinue tried to fight their way to the carriage to help me until they heard clodius gloating that i was dead can you blame them for what happened next they fought to defend themselves yes but they also fought because they were furious because they thought that their master had been murdered and their mistress was in terrible danger in the midst of the skirmish they came upon clodius himself and when the skirmish was over clodius was dead i didnt order his death it happened without my knowledge and outside my presence are my slaves to blame no they did exactly what every man here would have wanted his own slaves to do in the same situation am i not right there was a roar of agreement from the crowd i noticed that the banker was especially enthusiastic milo seemed to draw strength from the crowd he continued to shout above the roar veins bulged on neck and his face turned red if clodius had succeeded with his ambush its i who would be dead today he poked his chest repeatedly with his forefinger hard enough to bruise himself it would be clodius that everyone would be pointing at theyd all be accusing clodius of murder and saying clodius was a threat to milo restrained himself it wouldnt do to say the great ones name out loud but clodius failed clodius lost he paid the price for his wickedness he was the cause of his own death and i wont take responsibility for it this brought even louder cheers milo stood on tiptoe clenching his fists at his sides and shouting to be heard he had remarkably powerful lungs i regret nothing i apologize for nothing and i refuse to mouth empty words of comfort to his widow or his children and certainly not to that vile sister of his his death was the greatest gift the gods could give to rome if id strangled him with my own hands i wouldnt be ashamed to say so if id killed him in cold blood caught him by surprise and stabbed him in the back still i would be proud of the act caelius hurriedly stepped forwards his face rigid i leaned towards eco i think milo has gone beyond his script caelius raised his left hand for silence with his right hand he reached for milos shoulder when milo tried to shrug him off caelius tightened his grip until i saw milo wince and shoot him an angry glance the crowd ignored the signal for silence they began to chant as if they were at an election rally several different chants started up at once the result was deafening the fuller joined in with those reciting an old piece of doggerel about clodius and his sister clodius played the little girl while he was still a boy then clodia made the little man into her private toy this chant was repeated over and over punctuated by whoops of laughter and shouted louder and louder to compete with another chant taken up by the banker and his retinue grain dole grain dole its all just shit from clodiuss hole big pole little pole they all disappear up clodiuss hole up on the platform milo burst into laughter his face turned an apoplectic shade of red he laughed so hard he began to weep he seemed to me like a man who has been holding a torturous pose that strains every tendon to agony for hour after hour and suddenly cannot hold the pose any longer he shook so convulsively that he seemed hardly able to stand up caelius gave up on quieting the crowd he wore a bemused vaguely anxious expression as if to say this was not exactly what i intended but i suppose it will do i turned to eco curious to see my unflappable sons reaction but he had reverted to muteness as confounded as i was to ridicule the dead is to mock the gods there was something frightening in the sudden raging hilarity of the mob a vertiginous sensation of teetering at the edge of a dark precipice the raucous chanting continued but was suddenly joined by a noise more like screaming than laughter an invisible palpable tremor passed through the crowd a quiver of anxiety heads turned in confusion trying to discern the source the ripple of apprehension was quickly followed by a wave of panic how had milo described the ambush on the appian way confusion screaming blood if id been a bird flying overhead i might be able to tell you exactly what happened but it all began in the blink of an eye so it was in the forum that day when the clodians descended with flashing swords like a vengeful army on the contio of caelius and milo i have never been a military man but i am not a stranger to battle in the year that cicero was consul i was with my son meto when he fought for catilina at the battle of pistoria i carried a sword i saw romans slaughter romans i have seen battle i know what a battle looks like sounds like smells like what happened in the forum that day was nothing like a battle it was a massacre during the massacre itself there was no time to think about anything but escape it was only afterwards that i was able to ponder exactly what happened some said that the clodians attack was spontaneous spurred by reports of what milo and caelius were saying at the contio infuriated at the allegation that clodius had staged an ambush his grieving followers decided to show the crowd at the contio just what an ambush was like others argued that the attack was premeditated just as clodiuss ambush on the appian way had been premeditated and that the clodians had only been waiting for milos appearance and the first public gathering of his supporters to launch their assault premeditated or not the attack was well staged the clodians arrived heavily armed they made no attempt to hide their weapons they carried short swords daggers and clubs some carried bags of stones some carried torches they seemed to appear from all sides at once the panicked crowd contracted into itself so that at first there was as great a danger of being crushed or trampled underfoot by friends as there was of being cut open or clubbed to death by foes of course despite the law which forbids carrying weapons inside the city walls many at the contio were secretly armed or had armed bodyguards and many of them especially those who were part of milos regular gang had as much experience of street fighting as the clodians so the engagement was not entirely onesided but the clodians had the strategic advantage of surprise and the tactical advantage of having the crowd surrounded they may also have had a considerable advantage in numbers that was what the bruised and battered adherents of milo claimed afterwards but at the time i doubt that anyone bothered to count heads milos adherents would also claim afterwards that the attackingforce was made up largely of slaves clodiuss lieutenants they claimed now commanded whole armies of slaves and former slaves who owed them allegiance thanks to clodiuss radical innovations like the grain dole that was the true crime of what happened that day milos people said that slaves and exslaves had disrupted a peaceable public assembly of citizens conducting state business what had the republic come to when such lowborn rabble ruled the streets but as i say all these considerations came as afterthoughts at the time panic reigned eco and i sensed the danger at the same moment even though there was nothing yet to see he reached for my arm i reached for his his bodyguards turned outward in a ring and reached for the daggers hidden in their tunics eco pressed his mouth to my ear whatever happens papa stay close to me more easily said than done i thought as bodies pressed together and were wrenched this way and that like links of armour being tested by a smith to be caught in such a crowd must be something like the sensation of drowning in rough waters a sea of bodies is a solid writhing thing that presses back against you struggling like you to stay alive the noise became deafening oaths curses screams grunts sudden highpitched wails and guttural choking sounds the fuller and his slave were suddenly next to me he was yelling to no one in particular i knew this would happen i knew it suddenly there was a break in the crowd nearby like a rip through a piece of cloth the clodians broke through wildeyed men with upright daggers in their fists rushed towards me their hps were drawn back their teeth clenched they growled like dogs ecos bodyguards seemed to have vanished along with eco the panicked crowd was at my back like a solid wall i could no more melt into it than i could melt into stone that one cried one of the attackers pointing with his knife get the bastard he rushed towards me i braced myself fighting the impulse to turn away i have always promised myself that i would not end up as one of those corpses discovered with wounds in the back i stared at the mans face trying to look into his eyes but his wild gaze was fixed on something beyond me he veered past me his knife whistling a shrill note a fingerswidth from my ear his friends followed shoving me out of the way from the comer of my eye i saw flashing daggers rise into the air one after another like longnecked birds craning skyward i pressed myself into the fleeing crowd trying to merge again into its anonymity trying not to watch an even stronger impulse compelled me to look back the daggers rose and fell rose and fell they were met by other daggers streamers of blood shot upward like screams congealing in the frosty air in the midst of the turmoil i saw the man i had taken for a banker he was the one the clodians had rushed to attack his cordon of bodyguards had been breached and decimated the slaves who fell defending him were crumpled in a mass around him their bloodstained bodies trapping his legs so that he could not flee the clodians circled him like vultures their knives like pecking beaks they stabbed him again and again as he twisted and writhed his mouth gaping in a soundless scream greedy hands reached to snatch the silver necklace from his throat and pull a bag of coins from inside his toga his assailants circled him once more and then moved on like a whirlwind by some miracle the banker remained upright his eyes and mouth were wide open in astonishment his toga covered with blood suddenly one of his assailants rushed back and quickly skdlfuly like a dutiful slave caring for his masters accoutrements took the mans hand and slipped the gold signet ring from his finger the thief might have left it at that but having come back to finish his business he seemed determined to strike a final blow he slipped behind the stupefied banker and raised his dagger high gripping it with both hands i cringed and braced myself as if the blow were aimed at me but i never saw it fell a strong hand gripped my shoulder and spun me around i faced a hulking young man with glinting eyes and a grimly set jaw at the bottom edge of my sight i saw flashing steel and knew he held a dagger i have faced the prospect of imminent death on several occasions ioi in my nearsixty years it always seems to provoke the same chain of thoughts in my head you fool i always thinkbecause it seems that such situations could always somehow have been avoided or at least postponedyou fool this is the end of you at last the gods have lost interest in the little story of your life you no longer amuse them you shall now be snuffed out like a guttering lamp it is always the same the names of my loved ones echo in my head i hear the sweet sound of my fathers voice which i have not heard for many many years and sometimes in such moments and this was such a moment i see the face of my mother who died when i was very young and whose face i can otherwise never quite recall i remembered it vividly in that instant and knew that my father had been right when he had told me as he had often done that she was beautiful very beautiful but of course a part of me knew that i was not yet destined to die and understood at once when the hulking young man in a gruff desperate voice said thank jupiter i found you the master is furious come on the fellow was one of ecos young bodyguards of course in my confusion i had not recognized him eco had retreated behind a nearby temple where a leanto shed attached to the plain rear wall offered a degree of concealment we could still be seen from two directions since the shed was open at either end but the spot was at least more defensible than standing in the open papa thank the gods davus found you never mind the gods thank davus i smiled at the sturdy young fellow who grinned back at me what now eco peered out glumly there was nothing and no one to be seen except blank walls which cast back the echoes of the rioting mob i suppose we could stay here not a bad spot to make a stand though theres no knowing what we might come up against should we make a run for it maybe to your house or mine mines closer i said but wed have to cross the forum somehow and i imagine theres more chance of the riot spreading up that way towards milos house i felt a chill as i thought of my wife and daughter alone at the house with only a barred door and belbo to protect them to my house then papa no i have to get back to bethesda and diana he nodded the sound of the not seemed to grow louder though it might have been only a trick of the acoustics suddenly two figures appeared from around the corner of the temple we ducked into the shadows from their plain tunics the two appeared to be slaves they rounded the corner so fast they bumped into each other and almost fell the taller one saw the shed and pointed there we could hide there the shorter stockier one saw the shed and rushed towards it pushing his companion out of the way they were almost like comic slaves out of plautus except that in a play they would be fleeing a just beating from their master not a bloody riot jupiters balls said the taller one hurrying to catch up you neednt push me down milo and you neednt shout my name out loud you idiot come on before someone sees us milo was inside the shed before he realized it was occupied the first thing he saw were four daggers pointing towards him as ecos bodyguards advanced caelius coming up from behind bumped into him and knocked him forwards milos eyebrows shot up and he bared his teeth in a grimace as he tripped forwards and very nearly impaled himself on the nearest dagger caelius glimpsing steel skittered back and peered wideeyed into the shed draw back said eco calling off the bodyguards these two wont hurt us milo scanned the faces confronting him and stopped at mine gordianus is that you ciceros man gordianus yes ciceros man no and youre milo though who would know it to look at you wheres your toga are you joking the mob is going after anybody in a toga theyre all a bunch of cutthroat slaves and thieves killing and robbing every citizen they come to i threw off my toga the first chance i got thank jupiter i was wearing this tunic underneath you took off your ring of citizenship as well i said looking at his bare finger yes well i see that marcus caelius followed your inspiration i shook my head two of the most powerful men in rome were deliberately posing as slaves and behaving like slaves as well i suddenly had to laugh stop that said milo sony its the tension of the moment but i started laughing again and was soon joined not only by eco but by ecos slaves even caelius always ready to see the absurdity in any situation barked out a laugh but wheres your retinue your bodyguards i said slaughtered scattered who knows said milo i dont suppose that could be them i said all laughter dying from my voice a group of daggerwielding men had just appeared from around the corner oh jupiters balls caelius groaned he and milo shoved their way through the shed and fled out the other side i followed with eco and his bodyguards bringing up the rear behind us i heard a clash of steel and turned to see one of the pursuers stagger and fall clutching his chest where davus had wounded him at the sight of one of their own gushing blood the brigands lost heart and fell back caelius and milo had disappeared we found ourselves at the edge of the riot amid the scattered bodies of the wounded and dead the paving stones were slick with blood smoke belched from the entrance to the temple of castor and pollux next door atop the house of the vestal virgins the virgo maxima and her priestesses had gathered on the roof and were watching the scene below with expressions of horror and outrage come this way i said pointing to the paved walkway between the two buildings it took us to the base of the palatine hill and onto the ramp others were ahead of us fleeing up the long sloping path like refugees from a sacked city i thought i glimpsed caelius and milo far ahead travelling at a breakneck pace and knocking people out of their way right and left i was completely out of breath before i reached the top of the ramp eco saw my distress and signalled to his bodyguards to help me along they seized my arms and practically carried me the last few steps we hurried across the street towards my house suddenly ahead of us from out of one of my neighbours houses a group of armed men burst into the street their leader clutched a handful of jewellery strands of pearls and silver links dangled from his grubby fingers in his other hand he held a dagger dripping blood the door behind him had been knocked from its hinges you there he shouted at us though he was some distance away i smelled wine and garlic on his breath garlic for strength an old gladiators trick wine to fortify his courage he had a red face and iceblue eyes have you seen him seen who i gestured to the bodyguards to give the party a wide berth but to keep moving forwards milo of course were going from house to house searching for him when we find him we shall crucify him for killing clodius searching for milo are you said eco he was looking at the fistful of stolen jewellery the sarcasm in his voice made me cringe the thief held up his hand and shook it what these who ever said that justice should be free eh we deserve our payment dont we as much as these rich folk deserve their pretty things he made such an ugly face that i thought he was about to come after us with his dagger instead he threw the handful of jewellery at our feet the silver clinked against the paving stones and the strand of pearls burst pink and white baubles bounced everywhere like bits of hail the men behind him yelled and cursed who cares he shouted therell be plenty more where that came from he turned and led his raiding party down the street away from us towards the next house my heart began to pound in my chest if they were headed in the opposite direction that meant they had already been to my house my head felt light i blinked at oily spots before my eyes confronted with the possibility of my own death a part of me always reacted with sceptical resignation facing the possibility of something terrible happening to bethesda and diana i felt an overwhelming dread eco understood he clutched my hand and squeezed it as we approached the house i looked for signs of fire or smoke and saw none then i saw the double doors of the entrance they were standing wide open the lock had been broken so had the bar which lay across the threshold broken in two pieces i stepped into the foyer which seemed very dark after the daylight outside rushing forwards i tripped over something large and solid eco and davus helped me up papa said eco i hurried on bethesda diana no one answered i ran from room to room only vaguely aware that eco and his men followed after me couches and chairs had been knocked over cabinets lay on their sides with their doors open in my bedroom the sleeping couch had been senselessly ripped open and the sniffing pulled out in handfuls a pool of something dark and slick shimmered on the floor in front of bethesdas dressing table blood i shuddered close to tears then realized that it was only unguent from a broken jar which had fallen to the floor there was no one in the kitchens no one in the sleeping quarters where were the slaves i hurried on to dianas room the door of her wardrobe stood open and her clothes were scattered all over the floor the little silver box where she kept her few pieces of jewellery was gone i called her name there was no answer i came to my study the scroll cases were empty they had plucked every scroll from its pigeonhole probably looking for hidden valuables having found none they had at least left my scrolls and writing instruments intact of what use were such things to thieves everything lay in piles on the floor scattered but undamaged the scrolls still tightly rolled and tied with ribbons then i caught a whiff of something foul i wrinkled my nose and followed the smell to the corner of the room someone had defecated on the floor and then used a torn piece of parchment to wipe himself i carefully picked up the scrap by a corner to see what it was and read a few lines father what wretchedness is on us now i mourn for you still more than for the dead poor antigone poor euripides i stepped from my study into the garden at the centre of the house the bronze statue of minerva which i had inherited from my dear friend lucius claudius along with the house which had been his pride and joy and mine which had elicited the envy of cicero himself had been pulled from its pedestal did they think to find some secret treasure chamber beneath it or did they act out of sheer wanton destructiveness the bronze should have survived the fell but there must have been some hidden flaw in its casting the virgin goddess of wisdom lay broken in two pieces papa what eco have you found them no papa not bethesda or diana but in the foyer you should come and see for yourself see what before he could answer a voice from the sky called both our names i looked up and saw diana peering over the edge of the roof my throat constricted and i almost sobbed with relief diana oh diana but what how did you get up there the ladder of course then we pulled it up after us and then we kept out of sight and stayed quiet the thieves never even knew we were here your mother as well yes she wasnt afraid to climb the ladder at all and the slaves too it was my idea and a brilliant idea it was tears welled in my eyes until diana became a blur and look papa i even thought to save my jewellery box she held it proudly before her yes very good go get your mother now i said impatient to see with my own eyes that bethesda was safe tell belbo to come too eco spoke softly in my ear papa come to the foyer what come he took my arm and led me there when i first rushed into the house i had tripped over something large and heavy the thing i had tripped over was a body ecos men had rolled him onto his back and pulled him into the light belbos face normally so bovine and amenable was frozen in a grimace of fierce determination in his right hand he clenched a dagger with blood on it the front of his pale tunic was spotted with great blossoms of red he had died just inside the broken door defending the breach striving to keep them out his dagger testified that he had inflicted at least one wound but he had taken many more the tears which i had been holding back which i had begrudgingly released in my relief at seeing diana now came in a blinding flood the simple cheerful man who had been my loyal companion for twentyfive years and the protector of my loved ones who had saved my life more than once who had always seemed lit from within by a steady flame which nothing could extinguish lay lifeless at my feet belbo was dead part two road the looting and burning went on for days rome was utterly without order fires broke out or were deliberately started all over the city a haze of smoke settled into the valleys between the seven hills teams of slaves and hired freedmen their clothes and faces smeared with soot rushed from crisis to crisis i heard women screaming in the night hoarse cries for help the clash of steel against steel there were wild rumours of every sort of outrage rapes murders kidnappings children trapped in houses and burned alive men hung upside down by their feet at street corners beaten to death with clubs and left hanging like trophies the day after belbo was killed eco and i braved the streets to deliver his body to the necropolis outside the city walls two of my household slaves pulled the cart bearing his corpse ecos bodyguards flanked our procession though we passed several gangs of looters no one disturbed us they were too busy plundering the living to bother with the dead at the grove of libitina we entered belbo into the registry of the dead the cremators were very busy that day belbo was burned along with several others on a flaming pyre and then his ashes were taken to a common grave it seemed too small an end to such a robust life eco and i debated whether my family should go to his house or his family should come to my house so as to join our defences in the end we decided to leave his household slaves at the house on the esquiline so as to guard the place but to move menenia and the twins into my house which once the door was repaired and strengthened was arguably more defensible the palatine was dangerous but there had been numerous fires and reports of atrocities on the esquiline as well and down in the subura there was no semblance of order at all besides my house had already been ransacked there was no reason for the same looters to come back a second time as is wont to happen in such circumstances the air of crisis actually lent a comforting solidarity to the household bethesda menenia and diana all worked together seeing to the repair of the damaged furniture making lists of the things that needed to be replaced finding ways to keep the household fed when most of the markets were shut down and the rest were open for only a few unpredictable hours each day the twins titus and titania sensing the gravity of the situation were eager to help and behaved with a maturity beyond their seven years i felt safer in the company of davus and the other bodyguards and it was good to have eco beside me but the ransacked house itself was a constant reminder of our vulnerability whenever i passed through the garden i saw the minerva lying broken on the ground whenever i passed through the foyer i remembered belbo as we had found him i felt his absence acutely sometimes i called his name aloud before stopping myself he had been at my side every day for so long that i had come to take him for granted like the air and like the air once he was gone i realized just how much i had needed him one interrex gave way to the next and the next and there were still no elections or even the prospect of elections how could there be in such a state of chaos day by day and hour by hour the sentiment seemed to be growing that rome needed a dictator occasionally the name of caesar was mentioned more often and more vehemently it was pompey who was invoked as if the great ones name were some magical incantation that could put all wrongs to right each day i thought that i might hear from cicero again but there were no more summons from tiro no hushed meetings with milo and caelius i almost wished that cicero would call for me so that i could get some idea of what he and his circle were up to in the midst of the disorder it was another who came calling for me instead it was a cold bright februarius morning eco had gone to check on affairs at his house so i was alone in my study despite the chill i had opened the shutters to let in some sunlight and fresh air perhaps the many fires all over the city had at last been quenched i could smell only a faint tang of smoke davus came into my study to say that a litter accompanied by a train of slaves was camped outside my front door and that one of the slaves had a message for me litter yes quite a grand vehicle it has red and white stripes i said with a stab of intuition why yes he raised his eyebrows and i was reminded with a pang of sadness of belbo young davus looked nothing like him being dark and considerably more handsome than belbo had ever been but he was of the same size and bovine demeanour he wrinkled his brow it looks familiar could it be the same litter we saw arrive at the house of clodius on the night of his death i think it must be i see and theres a slave with a message you say show him in the man was typical of clodias male servants young and impeccably groomed with a striking profile and a muscular neck i would have known who sent him even if davus had not told me about the litter for there was a hint of her perfume about his clothes i had never forgotten that scent with its blend of spikenard and costly crocus oil he must have been a very favoured slave to smell so strongly of his mistress his status was confirmed by his haughty manner he sniffed and peered about my study as if he were thinking of buying the house not just delivering a message well i finally said what does clodia want from me young man he gave me a dubious look as if to say i cant imagine then smiled she requests the pleasure of your company in her litter in her litter what does she expect me to go traipsing through the streets in a litter at a time like this with all thats going on if its your safety youre concerned about dont worry where else could you possibly be safer certainly not here he seemed to suggest looking over my shoulder and through the open shutters at the broken minerva in the garden and he was probably right it was the clodians who were rioting they all knew clodias litter they would scarcely attack their idols sister besides that her retinue probably included some of the biggest and fiercest gladiators in the city indeed where else could i possibly be safer than skimming across the palatine in clodias litterunless of course we ran into a gang of milos men out looking for trouble on the other hand considering the circumstances anarchy in the streets rival gangs waging virtual civil war a looming dictatorship an uncertain future it was probably not a good idea to consort with clodia at the moment eco would surely have advised me against it but eco was not there and i was tired of hiding in my house playing passive spectator to a city spinning out of control so long as cicero had taken me into his confidence however suspicious the circumstances i had felt that i had access to special knowledge the privilege of knowing more than other men reassured me it gave me a sense of control and power whether real or not now i felt cut ofј adrift more anxious than if i were deliberately courting a danger that i at least comprehended a meeting with clodia promised a glimmer of privileged information i couldnt resist the chance to be close to clodia again had nothing to do with it itold myself the opportunity to recline next to her in her litter cocooned in the aura of her perfume close enough to feel the heat of her body davus tell your mistress that ive been called away on a small errand i dont expect to be away long but if i am ill send a messenger youre going out master yes i should go with you youll hardly be needed said clodias slave giving davus a disparaging look i suppose davus looked puny to him compared to clodias redhaired giants i suspect the fellows right davus id rather you stayed here to look after the house i followed the slave through the foyer and out of the house under the cold sun the red and white canopy of the litter was dazzling the air was almost still with only a hint of a breeze but the fabric was so delicate that the stripes wavered and brushed against one another like trembling serpents the redhaired gladiators surrounding the litter drew themselves to attention one of the bearers rushed to put down a block of wood before the entrance to the litter to serve as a step before i could do it myself the curtains were parted from within the slave girl who opened them moved aside and nodded towards the place where i was to sit next to her mistress but all i saw were clodias eyes her famous eyes catullus in one of his love poems had said they guttered like emeralds cicero in die speech which had nearly destroyed her had said that clodias eyes flashed like sparks from a whetted blade her eyes could seduce or scandalize her eyes could also weep they glittered now with tears i wondered if she had ever stopped crying since her brother died she turned her face away in any other circumstances i might have thought the movement was calculated to show off the striking profile of her forehead and the line of her nose her lustrous dark hair hung down unpinned for grieving her gown was black as were the cushions around her the corner seemed to swallow her up in darkness except for her face and throat which were a luminous creamy white i slipped into the litter beside her she reached for my hand still averting her eyes thank you for coming gordianus i was afraid you might not why for fear of the streets no for fear of your alexandrian wife her lips compressed into the barest smile where are we going to clodiuss house the smile grew rigid or to fulvias house i suppose i should say what for you must remember when i invited you into the house on the night he died i had a premonition that we might need you sooner or later i was right its fulvia who needs you really i seem to recall that your sisterinlaw was less than pleased with my presence in the mourning room things change fulvia is a pragmatist you happen to be the man that she needs right now for what shell explain that to you herself but this is what i ask from you anything that you discover about my brothers deathtell me please she turned her eyes on me then and squeezed my hand i know you believe in the truth gordianus i know how much it matters to you it matters to me as well if only i could know for certain how clodius died who killed him and why then perhaps i could finally stop weeping she managed another faint smile and let go of my hand weve arrived already the ride had been so smooth that i had scarcely known we were moving at all ill wait here until youre ready to leave and then take you home again the slave girl pulled back the curtains for me the block of wood awaited my step the great forecourt of clodiuss house was empty except for several men guarding the terraces and the gate oneof clodias gladiators accompanied me up the steps the massive doors opened inward as if a gust of divine wind preceded me a slave accompanied me through the halls and galleries and up a flight of stairs to a room i hadnt seen before it was at a corner of the house with open windows that commanded a view of palatine rooftops and the great temples on the capitoline hill beyond the walls were stained with a bright green wash and decorated with blue and white borders in a geometrical greek design it was a bright cheerful room airy and light i saw sempronia first she sat in a chair close by the windows wrapped in a red blanket to ward off the chill her long grey hair was still worn down for mourning but it was gathered by a pin at the nape of her neck and hung straight behind her touching the floor the look she gave me was almost as cold as the air from outside fulvia stepped in front of the windows the light streaming in was so bright that i saw her only as a tall narrow silhouette as she stepped closer the veil of shadow over her features slowly dissolved she was as i remembered her plainer than clodia but striking in her own fashion younger and with something very shrewd about her eyes she sat in the chair beside her mother as there were no other chairs in the room i remained standing fulvia looked at me appraisingly clodia says youre clever i suppose she ought to know i shrugged not sure whether to respond to the compliment or the insinuation i understand that youve paid some calls on cicero recently she fixed her eyes on me not in the last few days but since my husbands murder yes on a couple of occasions how did you know lets just say that i inherited my husbands eyes and ears and his calculated manner as well i thought she was all in black to be sure but i saw no other signs of mourning had her hysterical outburst before the crowd in the forecourt that night been purely for show or was it a genuine release of the anguish that she otherwise held in check she certainly seemed controlled at the moment clodia was more like the grieving widow i thought and fulvia more like the impassive heir wasting no tears as she took on her husbands mantle youre trying to figure me out she said dont bother and i wont try to figure you out your business with cicero is your own affair i wont ask you to do anything that compromises whatever relationship you have with him or with milo for that matter i raised my hand to object but she went on everyone knows that milo was responsible for my husbands death thats not what i want you to find out for me what then for the first time there was a glimmer of discomfort on her race a slight wrinkling of the forehead a trembling of the lips theres a certain man a friend of my husband an old friend of mine as well actually hes approached me offering his services when the time comes to prosecute milo i could use his help his support but yes im not sure that i can trust him can you tell me his name marc antony she raised an eyebrow you know him no but the look on your face i know his name yes one of caesars men oh yes now i remember our paths crossed that very night as i was leaving your house he was on his way here he happens to know one of my sons we exchanged a few words only a few let me think he asked me if the rumour was true about publius clodius i told him it was sempronia rustled her blanket would her daughter ever acquire such a hardened face and how did antony react said fulvia it was dark i could hardly see his face but his voice was rather wistful as i recall he said something like ah its all over then the end of publius for good or ill then he went on his way fulvia gazed out the window at the distant capitoline it was sempronia who answered he ended up here but fulvia was in no condition to see him or anyone antony spent some time talking with the other men in the anteroom and then left so we know that antony was here in rome that night yes said fulvia keeping her eyes on something far away but where was he earlier that day are you saying that you believe he had something to do with your husbands death fulvia didnt answer sempronia clutched at the red blanket the fellow tried to murder clodius with his bare hands only a year ago fulvia returned from wherever her thoughts had taken her my mother exaggerates do i whats this about i said you never heard the story said fulvia i should have thought it would have made the rounds such a juicy bit of gossip perhaps for once the people concerned managed to keep their mouths shut there was no cause for scandal just a dispute between two old friends nothing more it would have been considerably more if antony had succeeded said sempronia but he didnt insisted fulvia perhaps you should explain i said fulvia nodded it happened out on the field of mars last year on one of the election days that ended up being cancelled all the candidates were present haranguing their supporters im told there was the usual milling about some scuffling men with moneybags offering lastminute bribes a few minor skirmishes you know what its like i mean being a man you must have been to elections and seen for yourself perhaps you were there that day no actually the last time i voted in a consular election was ten years ago when catilina ran sempronia was suddenly interested you voted for catilina no actually i voted for a fellow with no head called nemo the two women regarded me curiously its a very long story never mind no i wasnt there on the day youre talking about but i can picture the scene what happened antony and my husband had words said fulvia as i understand it the exchange began in a friendly manner but it didnt end that way publius was always a bit vague as to who said what to whom but we know how it turned out said sempronia with equal parts of disdain and amusement in her voice with antony drawing his sword and chasing publius from one end of the field of mars to the other where were your husbands bodyguards i asked those particular bodyguards said fulvia i dont know where they were that day but i know where they are now off working in me mines there was a glint in her eyes that made her look for that instant almost as hard as her mother anyway publius got away unscathed except for his dignity said sempronia ducking into a cabinet under a stairway in some ratinfested warehouse on the river like a cowering slave fleeing from his masters whip in some secondrate comedy thats enough mother fulvia turned her flinty gaze to sempronia the test of wills between the two of them was almost palpable like the grating sound of steel against a whetting stone sempronia visibly relented sinking back beneath her red blanket fulvia protector of her dead husbands dignity sat upright what sort of man had clodius been to contend with the two of them on a daily basis and with his sister thrown in for good measure no wonder he had thought himself worthy to run the city if he had learned to keep control of his own household what was the nature of this quarrel between your husband and antony i told you i never really knew what started the incident but surely you have some idea fulvia became distant again gazing out of the window was this oscillation between harsh clarity and withdrawal calculated to keep me off balance or was it simply her nature or a kind of malady induced by the shock of her husbands murder you neednt be concerned with such specifics gordianus all i want is to find out whether marc antony played any part whatsoever in what happened to publius on the appian way first i think i would need to determine to my own satisfaction exactly what did happen on the appian way does that mean youll accept the task no ill have to think about it first when can you give me your answer i rubbed my chin tomorrow fulvia nodded in the meantime i said i want you to tell me exactly what happened that day so far as you know i want to know what clodius was doing away from rome who might have known of his movements who brought his body back to rome and how the skirmish began fulvia drew a deep breath in the first place this talk of an ambush is complete nonsense unless it was milo who ambushed clodius it was certainly milos men who began the fight without any provocation whatsoever my husband was completely blameless and the atrocities milos men committed at our country villa afterwards terrorizing the servants an hour later our interview came to an end i still had not made up my mind about helping fulvia though a remuneration in silver had been mentioned that was sorely tempting especially considering the damage that had been done to my house and the fact that i needed more bodyguards it seemed that the more prosperous i grew the more costly it became to live literally to stay alive simple necessity made fulvias offer attractive it would also give me an excuse to go poking about into the incident that had set rome aflame and ended in the death of a man very close to me on the other hand as always there was the degree of danger to be considered bethesda would say i was mad so would eco probably before he insisted on sharing the danger with me my head was full of these thoughts as i rode home beside clodia in her litter but not so full that i failed to notice her perfume and the warmth of her leg where it pressed against mine did you accept my sisterinlaws commission she asked not yet we arrived at my house as i moved to step out of the litter clodia gripped my arm if you do accept gordianus i hope that youll share with me whatever you may discover it matters to me very much to know all i can about my brothers death it was the sixth hour of the day and i was hungry for the midday meal i headed towards the kitchen but davus approached me in the hall and told me that eco was waiting for me i gathered from the look on davuss face that someone had severely scolded him for letting me go out without him i found eco in my study and also bethesda husband where have you been didnt davus tell you i was called away on business bethesdas nostrils twitched she cocked her head selfconsciously i raised my sleeve to my nose and breathed a faint scent of spikenard and crocus oil clodia declared bethesda oh i knew already davus told me about seeing her litter what did she want papa eco looked almost as disapproving as bethesda actually i began and then was interrupted by the reappearance of davus at the door another visitor master yes he says his name is tiro it was like the old etruscan adage i thought no rain for a month and then a downpour he says that youre invited to come and share a midday meal with marcus tullius cicero and eco is invited too of course said tiro suddenly looking over davuss shoulder what had become of the retiring perfectly behaved slave who would never have thought of taking the liberty of wandering unaccompanied through a citizens house tiro had become a brash freedman it seemed and proof of the general consensus that manners in the republic had all gone to hades i am hungry eco conceded patting his belly and im starving i said bethesda crossed her arms and said nothing imperious she might be but she was not sempronia or fulvia after all thank jupiter for that ix armed men stood guard at the door of ciceros house and patrolled the roof more men were stationed inside the foyer i felt as if i were entering a generals camp the shutters had been closed in the dining room to keep out the cold pallid winter light seeped in from the garden warmed by the glow of hanging lamps cicero was already settled on a dining couch with marcus caelius beside him tiro gestured for eco and me to take places on the couch opposite which was long enough for all three of us to share caelius was looking smug about something as usual which irritated me as usual marcus caelius youve come up in the world since i last saw you he lazily raised an eyebrow i mean you appear to be a free citizen now when our paths last crossed in the forum in that shed behind the temple took you and titus annius milo for runaway slaves cicero and tiro frowned eco glanced at me uncertainly caeliuss face became a blank mask for a moment then he burst out laughing oh gordianus i wish id thought of that one myself caelius has come up in the world he wagged his finger if one of my rival tribunes uses it against me i shall know youve taken to writing speeches for the enemy gordianus would never consider doing that surely said cicero fixing his eyes on me shall we plunge straight into the meal i can hear your stomachs growling from here only simple fare im afraid the cook tells me its impossible to find provisions in the markets but its best for a man to keep his diet simple anyway cicero had suffered from chronic dyspepsia for as long as i had known him the food was superb nonetheless a fish soup with dumplings was followed by bits of roasted chicken wrapped in pickled grape leaves with an aromatic cumin sauce cicero had learned to appreciate the finer pleasures which befitted a man of his stature he ate cautiously nonetheless scrutinizing each spoonful and slice before putting it into his mouth as if he could tell by looking which morsel might set off his indigestion speaking of coming up or going down in the world gordianus it strikes me that accepting a ride in the litter of a certain lady these days would cause many people to think that the passenger had lowered himself considerably how could that be a litter goes to and fro cicero not up and down caelius laughed it all depends whos in the litter with her cicero looked at caelius shrewdly not a prudent comment my friend considering your own history with the lady in question or the role you played in her comeuppance said caelius almost choking on a bite of chicken to get the word out ahead of cicero i gathered it was a sort of game between them punning at the expense of their enemies particularly the clodii i assume youre referring to a visitor i had earner today i said the lady who swept you away said caelius how is it that you know who my visitors are cicero id hate to think that my house is being watched cicero put down his spoon now really gordianus we live on the same street i have slaves and visitors coming and going all day they all know the ladys litter everyone does she could hardly park the thing in front of your house without people noticing he picked up the spoon again and toyed with it but the curious thing is that you should have gone off with her i dont know where you see i dont have anyone watching you or else theyd have followed but youd like to know only if you care to tell me as a matter of fact it wasnt the lady in question who well she does have a name doesnt she so why not use it yes i left in clodias litter but it wasnt clodia who wanted me pity said caelius is it i wouldnt know the edge in my voice surprised me clodia was only acting as gobetween she took me to her sisterinlaws house if you must know i see cicero didnt seemed surprised had he sent a spy to follow the litter after all would it betray a confidence to tell us what fulvia wanted with you she wanted my help in a certain personal matter nothing unusual oh i seriously doubt that really i suppose you think she wanted my help in something to do with her husbands death but we all know the story behind that already dont we milo himself laid out the facts at caeliuss condo for all rome to hear clodius staged a vicious ambush the dde turned against him one of milos slaves put an end to him ask caelius he was there he heard the story just as eco and i did though milo was cut off before he could quite finish caelius returned my glance unblinking and unamused no fulvia hardly said a word about milo if thats what youre thinking nor did she have much to say about milos friend marc antony cicero looked genuinely nonplused antony milos friend i doubt that the two of them even know each other i looked at caelius who seemed as lost as cicero no telltale smirk no twitch of secret amusement then i must be mistaken perhaps i mixed up the names that happens more and more as i get older youre only a little younger than i am cicero dont you find its a problem keeping names straight a man learns so many of them over a long lifetime where do all the names go its like words on a tablet you can only fit in so many and then you have to write smaller and smaller until the letters become illegible and the scribbles all run together some people have a gift for names i suppose or even a slave especially trained for the task cicero nodded tiro has always had a knack for keeping names straight hes saved me from making many a gaffe all those smalltown voters from the hinterland who take offence if you cant remember their family tree all the way back to king numa it was a politicians joke we all laughed but caelius practically brayed but this business about marc antony said cicero i shrugged as i said he was hardly mentioned at all you say hes not a friend of milo is he friend of yours then cicero he looked at me thoughtfully were not enemies if thats what you mean it was my turn to look puzzled theres no ill will between marc antony and myself he said at least not on my part come cicero said caelius rolling his eyes its obvious that gordianus is looking for information about antony why i cant imagine but theres no reason to be coy gordianus is your guest sharing your food i suggest we tell him whatever he wants to know and then perhaps at another time hell return the favour and tell us something he knows cicero looked dubious for a moment then opened his hands in a gesture of acquiescence what do you already know about marc antony almost nothing i know that hes one of caesars lieutenants and i understand hes back from gaul to run for office a quaestorship said caelius and likely to win a spot if and when theres a vote his politics hes allied with caesar of course said cicero other than that his only programme so far as i can discern is selfadvancement hes an original then unique among roman politicians i said neither cicero nor caelius responded to this joke tiro predictably frowned taking offence on behalf of his former master eco kept a straight face but shook his head almost imperceptibly wondering at his fathers impertinence i understand hes very popular with his troops i said so my son meto tells me and why not antony has the common touch ciceros tone was not complimentary hes of noble birth but they say he drinks and carouses with the lowest soldiers from the barracks hes always been like that he used to hang out with his mothers household slaves and freedmen when he was growing up always the little boy who liked to get dirty always attracted to loud vulgar pleasures well he got a bad start tell me one would have to go back to his grandfather at least of course i thought the career of any roman of high birth could never be described beginning merely with his own birth the old fellow was quite a power back when i was growing up one of my tutors in rhetoric as a matter of fact and one of the best magnificent speeches words that rumbled like thunder but he would never publish them he said that only a fool would do that because it just gave your enemies a way to point out your inconsistencies cicero who had made a career of publishing and disseminating his speeches laughed ruefully caelius smiled wasnt there some scandal involving antonys grandfather and a vestal virgin caelius must you always have a scandal yes and if theres not one ill invent it well you happen to be right there was a trial for despoiling a vestal somewhere in the distant past but he was acquitted of that and went on to a truly distinguished career ended up serving as consul then censor and was finally elected to the college of augurs for life but his rise really began with his military service he was one of the first to mount a campaign against the pirates in cilicia did so well he was awarded a triumphal procession in rome the senate allowed him to decorate the rostra with the beaks of the ships he had captured and even voted to erect a statue of him a statue said eco i dont recall ever seeing it thats because it was pulled down shortly after he was executed during the civil war i remember seeing his head on a spike in the forum it gave me nightmares for months afterwards quite a shock seeing an old tutor in that condition even the canniest politician was liable to make a fatal misstep back in those days rather like these days murmured caelius eco i noticed put down a piece of chicken he had been about to eat anyway cicero continued antonys grandfather had an extraordinary career even if it did end so ingloriously antony never knew him of course the old man was killed a few years before antony was born now antonys father was another matter altogether goodlooking well liked generous to his friends but a terrible bungler like his father before him he was sent to quell the pirates raised a massive war chest gathered a formidable navy then squandered it all in losing skirmishes from spain to crete when he negotiated a humiliating peace with the pirates that was the last straw the senate rejected the treaty in outrage antonys father died in crete some say of shame antony was only aboutwhat caelius eleven or twelve years old caelius nodded and we all know one outcome of his fathers failure the senate looked around for someone else to put an end to the pirate problem pompey got the commission andcame down on the pirates like a tidal wave his own tide has been rising ever since but youre taking us astray said cicero gordianus doesnt want to hear about pompey he wants to know about marc antony well hes no pompey but caesar seems to think hes competent as you see if marc antony has any military acumen then it must have come from his grandfather but theres also a strong element of his father in him antonys charming affable boisterous and entirely too reckless of course some of that may be due to the unfortunate influence of his stepfather his stepfather i said cicero looked rueful well its hardly antonys fault that his mother made that disastrous second marriage and tied her fortunes to such a loser i suppose julia thought she was marrying up since lentulus had been a consul was a patrician like herself lentulus you mean antonys stepfather was yes legs lentulus said cicero with loathing in his voice so called for pulling up his toga to bare his legs like a schoolboy in for a strapping when his fellow senators put him on trial for embezzling public money a man so flagrantly corrupt that he was finally expelled from the senate and so persistent that he managed to worm his way back in again superstitious as well some charlatan fortuneteller convinced him that he was destined to become dictator because of a few lines of doggerel in the sibylline books thats how lentulus got involved with catilina and his traitorous clique we all know how that ended indeed we did it had happened in the year that cicero was consul the socalled conspiracy of catilina had been ruthlessly put down under ciceros authority lentulus and a number of others had been executed without a formal trial the best people had lauded cicero for his decisiveness in saving the republic many among the populists had condemned him as a murderous tyrant a backlash had followed culminating in the vengeful legislation masterminded by clodius to send cicero into exile the senate had eventually rescinded the exile cicero was a powerful player on the stage in rome again and clodius was dead its ten years since catilina i said quietly yes and for ten years marc antony has carried a grudge against me said cicero hes never come to terms with the hard fact that his stepfather had to die antony was only twenty at the time passionate young men cant always be reached by reason they can carry resentments for a long time cicero sighed whether from emotion or dyspepsia i couldnt tell ive heard that he even claims that i refused to hand over the body to his mother after lentulus was strangled and julia had to come begging to my wife to intercede nonsense an obscene lie i saw to it that the bodies of all the conspirators were given proper burial cicero winced and pressed his hand to his belly he surveyed what remained of the meal before him as if to identify the guilty dish which had set off his indigestion antonys grandfather his father his stepfather they had all risen to glory and had all ended in ruin the world is like a spinning disc driving men and women to the edge and then hurling them this way and that into the void beyond its whirling rim most are never seen again but some manage to grab hold of the edge and claw their way back to the centre not once but again and again cicero was one of those so was caelius youve explained his lineage i said what about antony himself he fell in with a bad crowd clodius and his gang of aristocratic young incorrigibles said cicero the usual formula for dissipation high living radical politics mad schemes for the future and no money to finance any of it antonys father left an estate so encumbered with debts that antony refused his inheritance technically he started his career as a bankrupt it was young gaius curio who covered his debts he and antony were like peas in a pod companions in debauchery inseparable so close that their relationship gave rise to all sorts of nasty rumours well when curios father got the bill for antonys debts he went through the roof came seeking my advice i told him to grit his teeth hand over the silver and forbid his son ever to see antony again the next time antony came calling on curio the watchmen turned him away so what did antony do scaled a wall and let himself down through a hole in the roof directly into curios bedroom like a determined suitor cicero and caelius shared a laugh interrupted by another wince from cicero as he gingerly clutched his belly anyway antony solved his money problems when he married a woman named fadia the daughter of a rich freedman a freedman the scandal of marrying that far below ones station would have ruined an aristocrat when i was young but i suppose the incorrigibles in antonys circle applauded him for flouting convention and landing a big dowry at least the marriage seems to have taken antonys mind off curio im told that antony fathered several children before fadia died meanwhile he spent some time in greece studying oratory put in some military service in judaea and syria helped put down a revolt against king ptolemy in egypt and eventually hitched himself to caesar and headed for gaul oh and a couple of years ago he found time to get married again this time to his cousin antonia and now marc antony has become one of julius caesars most trusted lieutenants i suppose hes good at his job if caesar deems him worthy of grooming for office and sends him back to rome to stand for quaestor while the slaves brought water and wine to refill the cups and cleared away the dishes i mulled over all that cicero had told me sempronia said that antony had chased after clodius with a sword on the field of mars trying to kill him but according to cicero antony had been a member of clodiuss intimate circle so antony and clodius were good friends i ventured they were said caelius whose age and quicksilver alliances made him more privy to the intimate affairs of the radical generation than cicero until their little misunderstanding over fulvia misunderstanding apparently antony misunderstood that fulvia was clodiuss wife and thought she was free for the taking caelius flicked his tongue to catch a drop of wine at the corner of his mouth you mean oh the affair probably meant nothing to antony between his boyhood lover curio his two wives and all the whores of his youth what was a little fling with fulvia but clodius was furious when he found out he and fulvia were still newlyweds more or less and clodius always tended to fly off the handle at the least provocation didnt he this was oh about six years ago after that there was a chill between antony and clodius and then a whole sea between them when antony went off to greece and judaea and then several mountain ranges when antony headed up to gaul he and clodius never saw eye to eye again they were never close enough except on the field of mars i suggested caelius threw back his head and laughed oh that how could i forget cicero you must remember my telling you about it last year during one of the cancelled elections antony and clodius ran into each other quite by accident i imagine they had words antony pulls out his sword brave slayer of a thousand gauls and clodius lets out a shriek and takes off like a scared rabbit i suppose that made antony the dog what could he do but give chase of course if hed caught clodius it might have been more the case of the dog and the ferret with the mutt getting his nose bitten and howling all the way back to gaul what started the fight the old business about fulvia but you say that was six years ago caelius shrugged who knows clodius and antony are both famous for long memories and short tempers how did we ever get started on the subject of marc antony anyway said cicero fulvia must have been feeling nostalgic when gordianus visited her this morning said caelius did she discuss all her former lovers with you no i said and neither did clodia the grin froze on caeliuss face cicero gave him an unsympathetic glance i pulled myself upright on the couch an excellent meal marcus cicero perfect for the middle of the day not too light not too heavy i might say the same for the conversation now i think that my son and i must be on our way why did you bring up marc antony asked eco on the short walk back to my house antony was the reason fulvia wanted to see me hes offered to help prosecute milo shes not sure whether to trust him she has a suspicion that he was involved somehow in clodiuss death or it may be her mother who suspects antony and fulvia wants to prove him innocent did she tell you that she and antony used to be lovers no and just because cicero and caelius say so that doesnt mean its true but she did tell you about the chase across the field of mars last year yes eco nodded after a moment he laughed that was amazing the way you handled them who cicero and caelius was it im sure they thought it was they who were handling me i probably told them more than i should have and now for a few scraps of information about antony theyll act as if i owe them the world but the way you talk to them sometimes practically insulting them to their faces yes well its a strange thing but people like cicero and caelius like to be insulted do they thats been my experience i needle them they needle me back they know they have nothing to fear from me nothing i might say can really hurt them they enjoy my needling the way one sometimes enjoys having a mosquito bite the itch gives them something to scratch not like a bee sting not like the bloody sores ive seen cicero inflict on his enemies with a barbed word or two davus let us in from the look on his race i knew that something was up before davus could speak a voice rumbled behind him the master of the house home at last he was a big man probably a gladiator or a soldier despite the richly embroidered fabric of his grey tunic and dark green cape his nose had been broken maybe more than once and each of his hands was the size of a babys head his own head was as bald as a babys and almost as ugly he had the look of a man who could walk through a dangerous place without being bothered a visitor said davus unnecessarily so i see and who sent you citizen i said noting the iron ring on his finger he was probably someones freedman the great one he said bluntly his voice was like gravel in a sluice you mean thats all i ever call him its how he likes to be addressed im sure and what does the great one the honour of your presence at your earliest convenience now unless you can make it earlier davus yes master tell your mistress that i have yet another errand this one will take me outside the city walls i imagine do you want me to go with you i looked to the man id decided to call baby face who smiled and said i brought a whole troop of bodyguards with me where are they i told them to wait across the street down the ramp a ways i figured there was no need to bother your neighbours with a lot of traffic youre more discreet than some of my callers today thank you eco will you come with me of course papa eco had never met the great one either i noticed that my stomach was suddenly churning i couldnt blame ciceros cook so i set out for the third time that day thinking again of the old etruscan proverb but this was not a downpour this was a deluge xii the law forbids any man with an army under his command to enter the city walls technically pompey was such a commander though his army was off in spain he had seen fit to delegate its operation to lieutenants while he stayed close to rome to keep watch on the electoral crisis he resided at his villa on the pincian hill not far outside the walls as pompey was unable to come to rome rome went to pompey as the mob had done when they ran to his villa to offer him the consular axes or as milo had done when unsuccessfully seeking an audience or as eco and i found ourselves doing that afternoon baby face and his troop of gladiators closed ranks around us like an armoured tortoise for the walk down the ramp across the forum and through the fontinalis gate we crossed the traditional boundary of the city as we stepped through the gate but the flaminian way was just as crowded with buildings outside the wall as within gradually the buildings became smaller and fewer until we came to an open area the disused public voting stalls were off to our left up ahead to the right was a high guarded gate that opened at our approach the paved path led up through terraced gardens sometimes sloping sometimes in steps switching right and left as it ascended the grounds on either side were mantled with winter greys and browns the dreariness of the naked trees and bushes relieved here and there by statues in marble or bronze a regal swan that might have been jupiter courting leda graced a small circular pool we passed a low wall where a slave boy sat pulling a thorn from his foot painted in such lifelike colours i might have mistaken him for flesh and blood except that he was naked under the cold sun i saw no gods or goddesses in the garden until we came upon the requisite priapus guardian and motivator of growing things occupying a stone alcove set into a high hedge grinning lasciviously and displaying an erection almost as large as the rest of him the crown of his marble phallus had been rubbed shinysmooth by passing hands we came at last to the villa where more gladiators stood guard before a pair of tall wooden doors with bronze fittings baby face told us to wait while he went inside eco tugged at my sleeve when i turned there wasno need to ask what he wanted to show me the view was spectacular tangled branches and treetops hid the path we had just ascended as well as the flaminian way and the voting stalls immediately below us but above and beyond the treetops the whole field of mars lay open before us the ancient marching grounds and equestrian training courses had all but vanished in the course of my lifetime filled up by cheap tenements and jumbled warehouses dominating everything else was the great complex built by pompey in his consulship two years back a sprawling mass of meeting halls galleries fountains gardens and the citys first permanent theatre farther on like a great arm curving around the field of mars was the tiber its course marked by a low thick blanket of river mist that allowed only glimpses of the gardens and villas on its other bank clodias garden villa where the stylish young men of rome used to swim nude for her amusement was somewhere on that distant bank the whole scene was like a painting done in muted winter hues of rustred and greygreen bone white and iron blue eco tugged at my elbow again and nodded towards the south the mass of the villa blocked the view of most of the city proper except for a narrow glimpse of the temples on the capitoline hill and a jumbled cityscape beyond far away perhaps on the aventine hill a plume of smoke rose like a vast marble pillar into the still air whatever chaos reigned at the base of that pillar it was too far away for us to see or hear did a man begin to feel remote and uncaring looking down on rome from such a high place or did he become even more acutely aware of buildings burning out of control and chaos in the streets surveying rome from such a godlike vantage point the doors behind us opened with a clank baby face emerged smiling grimly the great one will see you now i must have been rather nervous as baby face ushered us through the foyer into the atrium and up a curving flight of stairs because afterwards when bethesda asked me i couldnt remember a thing about the furnishings and fixtures though i could vividly recall that my mouth was as dry as vellum and my heart seemed to have swollen to twice its normal size we were led to a room of many windows at the southwest corner of the house curtains and shutters had been pulled back to allow an expansive view of the city the column of smoke off to the south which we had glimpsed from the doorstep was at the centre of this view and was joined by two more pillars of smoke closer and off to the left probably made by fires on the esquiline hill or down in the subura pompey stood at the windows his back to us he was only a silhouette at first a crown of unkempt curls above powerful shoulders and a robust wellpadded torso as my eyes adapted to the light i saw that he wore a long voluminous woollen robe of emerald green his hands were joined together behind his back his fingers tapping nervously against each other he heard us enter and slowly turned around baby face moved inconspicuously into a corner i glimpsed the shadow of another guard on the balcony outside the windows pompey was the same age as cicero which meant that he was a few years younger than me i could have wished for as few wrinkles though not for as many chins it occurred to me that pompey might be the sort of man who turns to food in a crisis commanding armies on the march kept him busy and fit holed up in his pincian villa he had taken on the weight of the world but there were no puns in my mind at that moment this was not fulvia or clodia mysterious and grimly determined but made vulnerable by their sex nor was it cicero or caelius a known quantity with whom i could exchange careless banter this was pompey when he was young poets had swooned for his beauty with his luxuriant windtossed locks of hair his smooth brow and chiselled nose people had called the boy general another alexander even before his military prowess proved them right young pompeys typical expression had been a placid dreamy half smile as if the contemplation of his own future greatness kept him perpetually cheerful but also a bit aloof if his face had a flaw it was a tendency to roundness and a fullness in his lips and cheeks that appeared either ripely sensual or pleasantly plump depending on the angle and the light as he grew older his face seemed to flatten a bit and to grow even rounder the chiselled nose became fleshy the wild locks were shorn in deference to maturity the smile became less sensual more complacent as his prestige and power grew it was as if pompey had less need of physical beauty and so put aside the comely garment of his youth all this i had seen from a distance as pompey built his career orating in the courts of law campaigning for office on the held of mars cutting a great swathe through the forum attended by his vast retinue of military and political lieutenants each of those lieutenants in turn attended by his own coterie of followers seeking favours at second hand from the great one but what cannot be seen from a distance are a mans eyes as i now saw pompeys eyes staring into mine with a disconcerting intensity for some reason i recalled a famous quote from his youth when he was sent to drive the dictator sullas enemies out of sicily the people of the liberated city of messana had complained that pompey had no jurisdiction over them because of ancient agreements between themselves and rome pompey had replied stop quoting laws to us we carry swords gordianus the finder he said and your adopted son eco he smiled to himself and nodded as if pleased that he could remember such insignificant details without a slave to remind him we havent met before have we no great one i didnt think so the silence that followed was uncomfortable for me but apparently not for pompey who paced slowly before us his hands still clasped behind his back youve had a busy day he finally said pardon great one clodia comes by to carry you off in her litter you pay a call on fulvia i suppose sempronia was there as well no sooner are you home than ciceros freedman comes calling and you and your son are off to confer with cicero and caelius milo wasnt there today was he i started to answer then realized that pompey was looking not at me but at baby face who shook his head and answered no great one milo hasnt left his house all day pompey nodded and returned his gaze to me but youve met with milo before under ciceros roof it was not a question but it seemed to require a response an admission rather than an answer yes its been quite a while since i saw titus annius milo how is he looking these days looking great one hes always been so proud of his powerful physique naming himself after milo the legendary wrestler of croton and all that is he holding up he appears fit enough and his state of mind im not privy to that great one no but youre a reader of signs are you not surely you read something from his face his voice milo is anxious angry uncertain but you hardly need me to tell you that no i do not his smile seemed without irony merely a gesture of appreciation for not wasting his time what did clodia want with you this morning when i hesitated pompey frowned dont tell me its none of my business it is everything that happens in rome nowadays is my business what did clodia want with you to take me to fulvia only that and what did fulvia want great one surely words spoken in confidence by a grieving widow finder you make me impatient i considered how to answer a certain man has approached her shes uncertain whether to trust him surely suitors havent started knocking on her door already not a suitor exactly i said though in feet antony had once been fulvias lover if caelius was to be believed pompey looked profoundly uninterested well i wont press you for details fulvias personal affairs are of no immediate importance to me did you agree to help her i havent yet decided perhaps i could help who knows i might possess whatever information youre seeking it seemed unlikely marc antony was caesars man not pompeys are you offering to help me great one perhaps im a reasonable man if i can give something of value to you then i imagine youll be more willing to give me what i want and what is it that you want from me great one ill come to that in a moment do you have any questions for me i thought carefully and saw no danger in asking what can you tell me about marc antony caesars lieutenant i know that his father made a mess of clearing out the pirates before the senate finally gave me the job and that his stepfather got himself executed for treason at ciceros behest and i recall that young antony went off soldiering in my old stamping grounds out east for a few years before he signed up with caesar what else is there to know perhaps nothing by hercules hes not the one courting fulvia is he i dont see how hes already married to his cousin antonia and thats not the sort of marriage its easy to step out of but if he is a suitor fulvia would do well to avoid him thats my advice clodius may have been an extortionist and a rabblerouser but at least he knew how to bring home the silver look at that house they ended up in young antonys another matter like caesar and the rest of that circle always more and more in debt always selling themselves for the next loan to see them through theyll come to a bad end the lot of them i only hope they dont bankrupt the republic along with them he fell silent and raised an eyebrow in mild surprise at himself i realized for saying more than he meant to and what did cicero make of your visit to fulvia said pompey pressing on i cleared my throat he was curious like yourself great one he wasnt somehow behind your visit to fulvia was he no i thought perhaps hed set you up to be his spy that would be so very like cicero covert networks unsigned letters messages sent in some secret code invented by tiro paid informers one lurker keeping watch on the next like a spider casting webs in all directions hed have turned out differently if hed had any talent as a military man more action fewer words are you ciceros spy finder he disconcerted me again with his gaze no great one perhaps you are and you simply dont know it the suggestion surprised me then made me uneasy i think i know all of ciceros tricks by now pompey raised an eyebrow really even i wouldnt make that claim what do you make of caeliuss behaviour why is he standing up for milo whats in it for him caelius has cast his lot with cicero cicero has cast his lot with milo so by extension caelius is milos man im not sure that caelius is anybodys man you speak the truth there finder and what do you make of milo himself as i said before great one yes i know anxious angry uncertain but what do you make of him i met him for the first time only recently since the death of clodius really no previous connection none but you do have some old connection with clodius no i did a bit of work for clodiuss sister a few years ago he nodded when she helped prosecute caelius for murder i spoke in caeliuss defence you may recall yes im afraid i missed your speech it wasnt a very good one just as well a good speech would have been wasted no one would have remembered it not after the speech cicero made that day for caelius or against clodia should i say so finder were you ever in clodiuss camp i was not and i am not and youre not in milos camp either no he appraised me for a long moment then turned to eco what about you like father like son eco cleared his throat i helped my father when he worked for clodia but i never met her brother i went with my father to ciceros house today but i have yet to meet milo face to face and your loyalties im my fathers man pompey smiled a loyal son makes the best partisan of all eh finder but what about your other son the one whos off in gaul has he not pulled the rest of the gordiani into caesars orbit along with him my son meto is a loyal soldier but my family has no special allegiance to caesar pompey regarded me curiously how is it that you manage to navigate such an independent course finder without being smashed on the rocks it seems to me great one that if i let another man navigate for me i would have been smashed on the rocks long before now do you always steer your own course finder but how do you have some special knowledge of the stars or do you sail blindly into the future as blindly as every other man i suppose perhaps its the stars that are steering us ah yes i know that feeling you believe you have a destiny then a very small one perhaps better than none at all i suppose the great one shook his head as if the idea of having no destiny or only a small one was too difficult for him to imagine destiny is a strange thing look at clodius ending as a bloody corpse on the great road his ancestor built its almost too appropriate like a greek tragedy look at milo i suppose the appropriate end for him would be to get caught in a trap of some sort and eaten alive by his enemies i dont follow you great one you know like the legendary milo of croton is there a story attached to his death famous athletes have never been my particular interest no but you cant really understand our milo unless you know about his namesake what a man calls himself tells you what he thinks of himself and sometimes where hes headed surely i neednt point that out to a man who calls himself finder i understand great one pompey didnt even blink i shall tell you about milo of croton then he said come its warmer on the balcony we can sit in the sun ill have some heated wine brought alban or falernian i prefer alban myself a drier aftertaste so we sat on the southwest balcony of pompeys pincian villa sipping tenyearold wine and looking out over the city the fire on the aventine hill had apparently been extinguished the great column of smoke had been cut off at the base and seemed to float above the rooftops like something from a nightmare a new pillar of smoke thicker and jet black had appeared in the vicinity of the colline gate far away to our left pompey swirled the wine in his cup when our milo was young he was quite an athlete or so he says after the third cup of wine he starts bragging about his athletic glory days the way a soldier brags about old battles he won many competitions especially as a wrestler i dont know what sort of competition a boy has growing up in a village like lanuvium but milo was always the strongest the fastest the most determined powerful as an ox stubborn as an ox too thats our milo hes still as vain as a greek about his physique you know not exactly the greek ideal too short and stocky but hes certainly kept himself fit ive seen him naked at the baths belly like a brick wall shoulders like catapult stones he could crack a nut between those buttocks pompey let out a coarse laugh that was quietly echoed by the guard at the end of the balcony who could hardly help overhearing i realized that eco and i had been admitted to a certain intimacy with the great one he was sharing with us the sort of manly talk a commander shares at ease with his subordinates so when titus annius was casting about for a name to give himself he settled on milo do you remember the old schoolboy exercise about milo of croton when i showed a blank expression eco whose spotty education had nonetheless been more formal than mine ventured to answer compose a recitation on the following theme and show how it might instruct us through life milo of croton having accustomed himself to carrying a calf every day for exercise kept on carrying it until it was grown to a bull pompey and eco shared a nostalgic laugh the moral of the theme as a boy grows into a man so grow his burdens said pompey and if youre a fellow like milo of croton you wont shrug them off but just keep smiling through clenched teeth as you lug them forwards grunting and groaning im sure that our milo had to write on the same theme the lesson seems to have stuck with him he took a sip of wine frowned and called for the steward is this really the best alban we have its gone off it wont do bring the falernian now where was i oh yes feats of strength milo of croton could hold a ripe pomegranate in his fist they say so firmly that no one could wrest his fingers apart and yet so carefully that the pomegranate wouldnt bleed he could stand on a discus covered with grease and maintain such perfect balance that no one could push him off he could tie a cord around his head hold his breath and make the veins on his forehead bulge out until the cord broke now thats something i should like to see but milo of croton wasnt always graceful once at the games at olympia when he was on his way to accept the laurel leaf crown for wrestling he slipped and fell flat on his back as he was scrambling to get up some of the wags in the crowd started saying he shouldnt be crowned having displayed such clumsiness milo said that wasnt the third fall i fell only once lets see one of you throw me two more times that shut them up in a hurry he won twelve crowns altogether six at olympia and six at delphi when croton went to war with the sybarites for a helmet milo wore all his laurel leaf crowns at once enough to cushion a blow and dressed like his hero hercules in a lions skin carrying a dub he led the people of croton to victory and when in gratitude they decided to erect a statue of him milo himself carried his own statue through the square and placed it on the pedestal when pythagoras the philosopher was living in croton he and milo became great friends opposites attract the thinker and the strongman lucky for pythagoras since milo saved his life there was an earthquake and in the dining hall at the philosophers school a pillar gave way milo held up the collapsing ceiling while pythagoras and his students cleared out then slipped out from under it and managed to save himself as well do you begin to see finder how these legendary feats might bear some allegorical relation to the way in which our milo conducts himself and sees his destiny the legendary hero whose clenched fist cannot be opened against his will who will not be shoved aside no matter how slippery his footing who carries a great burden but does not complain who can hold his breath until the veins in his forehead pop out who is best friends with a famous wise man who is willing to throw himself into the lurch to save his friends who goes into battle wearing the mantle or in this case the name of his boyhood hero who would gladly put his own statue upon a pedestal who cannot be thrown down by anyone but who might all on his own and in full sight of the watching world fall flat on his back i considered this as i sipped freshly poured falernian from my cup a late afternoon breeze had begun to stir the sky high above rome slanting the pillars of smoke and tattering their upper reaches but what of the death of milo of croton great one how does the adage go to possess great strength counts for nothing unless a man knows how to use it that was the undoing of milo of croton he set out on a journey one day on foot and lost his way in a deep forest far from the road he came to a cleared place where some woodsmen had been working but the day was late and the woodsmen were gone he saw a huge log there was a long crack along the whole length of the log with several iron wedges driven into the gap apparently the woodsmen had intended to split the log in two but the job was too big for them and they left it for another day milo thought i shall split the log myself think how surprised theyll be to find that one man has done the job for them using only his bare hands how clever theyll think me how grateful theyll be another famous feat of strength for milo of croton so he pushed his fingers into the narrow breach until his palms were flat against the two sides he pushed them apart with all his might the iron wedges loosened and fell out and instantly the crack snapped shut milos hands were trapped his arms were bent the log was too heavy for him to shift he couldnt move darkness fell there was a howling in the woods wild beasts crept out of the forest into the clearing they could smell his fear sense his helplessness they only nipped at him at first but when they saw that he couldnt defend himself they clambered onto him fangs flashing they tore him apart they devoured him alive the next morning the horrified woodsmen found what was left of milo of croton pompey sipped his wine need i belabour certain obvious parallels to the peril in which our milo finds himself no great one you seem to know a great deal about both milos my either used to tell me stories about milo of croton when i was a boy as for titus annius milo he and i have been allies now and then but not any longer clodius and i were allies once too he said deflecting the question just as caesar and i were once allies and still are for all i know i dont understand great one some things only the fates seem tofathom no matter what about you finder who are your allies whom do you serve you seem to be a man who moves through every camp but belongs to none it would seem that way great one that makes you a rather unusual fellow finder a valuable man to know im not sure how great one i want you to do a bit of work for me i felt several things at once excitement wariness a sinking sensation perhaps great one if i can i want you to take a trip down the appian way to the place where clodius was killed take along your son if you like have a look at the site talk to the local people see what you can find out if youre as good as your name perhaps youll discover a few things that others have overlooked why me great one surely there are other men you could send theres no one who could move as freely as you seem to move between fulvias house and ciceros as i said youre an unusual fellow the fates seem to have landed me in a curious spot youre not the only one we must all submit to the fates he drained his wine slowly never taking his eyes off me finder let me explain something to you as a general i have been very nearly infallible ive moved from triumph to triumph without a misstep with hardly even a moments hesitation i have the instinct for it you see a peculiar genius all my own i could do it with my eyes shut but politics politics is another matter i approach the forum the same way i approach a battlefield i marshal my forces i lay out a plan but things never seem to go exactly as i want ill think im headed straight for the prize and suddenly i find that i dont know where in hades i am or how i got there i lose all sense of direction julia always said i had bad advisors probably right on a battlefield your troops are here the enemy is there and a man either gives you the right information or else hell be dead the next day but in this hazy murk a dagger can be aimed at your heart and you never know it and socalled advisors have a habit of telling you what they think you want to hear never mind the facts i wouldnt care to tell you how many times ive charged down a path using a map that led me straight into a brick wall that mustnt happen now not now no false advice no fawning lies no blind spots i must know the lay of the land the disposition of the enemy the precise movements of all the forces around me first of all and above all else i want to know exactly what happened on the appian way do you understand i think so great one can i trust you finder i looked at him for a long moment wondering if i could trust pompey no need to answer he finally said my generals instinct senses no deceit in you so will you do what i ask fulvia had already asked me to investigate the circumstances of her husbands death now pompey was doing the same i felt ecos eyes on me i took a deep breath ill go down the appian way ill find out whatever i can about clodiuss death pompey nodded good im sure we can agree on terms ive never asked a man to march for me without proper payment as for lodging you can stay at my villa while youre down there its not far from clodiuss place probably just a stones throw from the spot where he was killed he took a sip of falernian and gazed down at the city i shall be leaving rome myself in a day or two when i come back i shall put an end to all this nonsense nonsense great one by a wave of his hand he indicated the pillars of smoke this infernal disorder but how great one pompey looked at me shrewdly i suppose theres no harm in telling you tomorrow the senate will convene in the portico at my theatre out on the field of mars outside the city walls yes that way i can attend legally attend the proceedings let no man say that pompey thinks himself above the law a lot of business has piled up as you can imagine a number of proposals shall be put forth one of them is to rebuild the senate house no controversy there i shall suggest that milos brotherinlaw faustus sulla be given the contract let no man say that pompey is unfair to the relatives of milo besides such a commission seems only proper since it was sulla faustuss father who remodelled the old senate house thus the senate shall pay homage to the memory of the dictator sulla and his achievements many romans flinch at that word dictator they forget how important it is to have some mechanism whereby supreme power can be placed in the hands of a single man when circumstances demand it he took another sip of wine and stared at the pillars of smoke as if he could disperse them by sheer will power and there will be another more important proposal that the senate declare a state of emergency and issue the ultimate decree do you know what that means finder yes i said remembering the last time such a decree had been issued when cicero was consul and had demanded extraordinary powers to deal with catilina and his circle the ultimate decree instructs the consuls to do whatever may be necessary to save the state martial law said pompey bluntly but there are no consuls yes thats a problem how can troops be levied from the countryside if there are no consuls to levy them well its only a technicality really someone other than a consul will have to do the job of course fortunately as a man who has twice been elected consul and as the current commander of the roman troops in spain i have both the necessary expertise to raise a militia here in italy and the skill to deploy it in the most efficient manner to bring order to the city the senate will agree to this im certain they will its all a matter of counting the votes ahead of time oh some of caesars supporters will make a fuss as may some of the more hidebound conservatives like cato a terrible precedent they shall say but what other solution have they to offer they wont protest too vehemently i shall find ways to mollify them the important thing is that order be restored if we must resort to certain innovations to achieve that end if the law must be slightly bent then so be it he at last turned his gaze from the pillars of smoke which for the moment at least had refused to disperse well then shall we discuss your fee finder xiii a man commences a journey on the appian way with the smell of fish in his nostrils and the sound of dripping water in his ears the smell comes from the fish markets just outside the capena gate at the southern end of the city fishermen from the tiber and as far away as ostia string up their catches on lines presenting row upon row of fish hung up by their gaping jaws with here and there a basket full of molluscs octopi or squid on a normal day at a normal hour the place resounds with the jabber of kitchen slaves housewives and marketers we set out in the grey hour before dawn before the markets would normally be open but even so the place was unnaturally quiet and deserted according to bethesda there had been no market outside the capena gate for days like startled minnows the fishermen had all been scared away still there was a strong odour of fish about the place as if the sea had penetrated the very stones beneath our feet the sound of dripping water comes from a leak in the appian aqueduct it was built by the same appius claudius caecus who built the appian way two hundred and sixty yean ago when the aqueduct reaches the city it merges with the wall and for a considerable distance flows inside it a river within a wall a marvel of design and engineering spoiled by only one defect at the capena gate the aqueduct leaks in warm months the great arching blocks of stone overhead are covered with dripping moss like the ceiling of a grotto in the dead of winter the moss dies back and sometimes the water freezes into a dully gleaming sheet of ice on this morning it was not that cold the water seeped slowly but freely as we stepped through the gate one drop in particular an especially large especially frigid drop struck the back of my neck and wriggled down my spine i gave a jerk and must have made a curious noise for eco gripped my arm and davus looked at me with alarm i knew what davus must be thinking its an ill omen to begin the first step of a journey with a shudder and a curse from the master eco less superstitious probably feared that i was having a seizure then a drop glanced off the tip of ecos nose making him blink in confusion when davus tilted his head back and opened his mouth to laugh another drop struck him square between the eyes there now weve all been anointed by the capena gate a very good omen i declared for the benefit of davus eco raised a dubious eyebrow where is this stable that pompey mentioned ive never noticed it before i looked around towards the left just beyond the market stood the dense grove of trees that surrounded the shrine of egeria with its limestone springs it could hardly be in that direction i looked towards the right that must be the place over there it looks like a stable doesnt it usually all the hanging fish would hide it from view i see an open door and a light inside someone must be up already a narrow path flanked by cypress trees led to the long low building in the shadow of the city wall i took a step inside the open door and was met by an odour of horse dung and hay that was a welcome relief to the stink offish then by a pitchfork aimed at my throat who are you what do you want the man held a lamp in his other hand the glow lit up his gaunt wary face we come from your master i said i thought youd be expecting us maybe what are you called finder all right then the man lowered his pitchfork i have to be careful theres been a lot of trouble lately desperate men damned good horses and me in between me the one wholl pay if theres any stolen understand and ill tell you the master keeps some fine ones here fine horses takes a military man to really appreciate what a horse is worth keeps them here for convenience for when he wants to take a ride to his villa down south come along and see careful follow the lamp he said you could have your pick how many are you three here i happen to have three blacks not a spot of white on them those are the ones id take if i were you i saw the three he meant and reached towards the nearest the beast had a long powerful neck and bright eyes why are these the fastest he shrugged maybe maybe not but theyd for sure be the hardest to see if you do any riding after dark something to think about these days making yourself hard to see if youre out in the open at night the three horses looked fit and strong enough and were very black indeed even in the glow of the mans lamp they tended to vanish into the shadowy stalls i took his advice davus had some trouble mounting his horse it turned out he had never ridden a horse before eco looked thoroughly disgusted not angry at davus but at himself for not thinking of such an elementary detail before we set out what use was a bodyguard on horseback if he couldnt control his mount davus was now my personal bodyguard i should have been the one to ask if he could ride but i was so used to belbo that i took it for granted youve never even been on a horse i asked no master you know nothing about riding nothing master davus peered uncertainly at the ground on either side like a man atop a rickety table then today you shall learn how to ride i said and tomorrow you will hardly be able to stand upright i thought what good would a bodyguard be with saddle sores and wooden limbs the hone snorted davus gave a start and gripped the reins rightly the stableman was greatly amused dont worry i tell you these hones are the best trained to do all the thinking battle hones keep their wits no matter what smarter than your average slave thats for sure the great one even lets women ride them davus took this as a challenge he wrinkled his brow forced the queasy look from his face and sat upright we ambled away from the stables letting the mounts get a feel for us eco was fretful but not about davus do you think it was a good idea bringing strangers into the house theyre pompeys men dont you think we can trust them i suppose so it was the only way well perhaps not the only way in feet for the time that eco and i would be away pompey had offered to allow bethesda menenia and diana and whatever attendants they needed to take up residence in his old family house inside the city wall in the carinae district on the western slope of the esquiline it made sense they would certainly have been safe there and the place was situated midway between ecos house and mine but i didnt want to slip quite so far quite so quickly into pompeys camp putting my family completely in his care would mean putting them completely in his power and in a way that outsiders would surely notice on the other hand it was out of the question for me to leave rome even for a few days without doing something to safeguard the family households especially if eco went with me which he insisted on doing the solution was to borrow a troop of bodyguards from pompey as part of my fee sufficient to protect both the house on the esquiline and the house on the palatine in our absence pompey was agreeable his men had arrived at my house early that morning before eco and i departed i didnt like the looks of some of those fellows brooded eco i think thats the point theyre frightening but can we trust them pompey says so i doubt that theres a man on earth better at keeping discipline in his own ranks than pompey bethesda wasnt pleased bethesda wasnt pleased about any of this her household is in chaos her husband is traipsing off into danger again and another mans gladiators are tracking mud into her house but i suspect she was secretly glad to have the protection those men who ransacked the house and killed belbo that shook her more than shell admit and mark my words by the time we get back shell have every one of pompeys brutes trained to take off his shoes before he steps on the carpets and to ask permission before he goes to the privy eco laughed perhaps pompey will take her on as a drill sergeant we rode on a bit menenia was reasonable enough about the whole thing he noted the wistfulness in his voice made me suspect they had come to more than a mental understanding during the night menenia is the soul of reason i said and diana dont say it i saw the way she was looking at some of those fellows id rather not think about it davus shifted uneasily and cleared his throat but eco pressed on shes seventeen papa she should get married soon perhaps but how a decent marriage means negotiations between the families planning announcements to friends all the things we went through when you married menenia can you imagine managing all that with things as they are now the riots will pass papa things will get back to normal soon enough will they life goes on papa things are bound to get better are they this time im not so sure there was not a person to be seen along the road at least not any living person lining the way as always along the major thoroughfares outside any city were a succession of tombs and sepulchres large and small burial within city walls is illegal so the neighbourhoods of the dead begin just outside the walls crooked cenotaphs with inscriptions worn smooth by time stood alongside newly sculpted family portraits in marble and limestone among the grandest tombs were those of the scipios the family whose glory had dominated rome in the age before my fathers birth they conquered carthage and began the work of empire now they were dust equally grand were the tombs of the claudii the appian way was their road or so they considered it since it had been built by their ancestor the dead claudii in their ornate stone tombs were clustered thickly along the way like jostling spectators at a parade the claudii continued to make their mark on rome publius clodius affecting the plebeian variant of the name had been the latest to hold sway as pompey had noted his murder on the road of his ancestors had been a twist of fate of the sort so beloved by melodramatic playwrights and sentimental rhetoricians the irony might some day provide a theme for schoolboy compositions appius claudius caecus built the appian way two hundred and sixty years later his descendant publius clodius was murdered there compare and contrast the achievements of these two men beyond the tombs were great drifts and piles of rubbish and debris bits of broken pottery and wornout shoes shards of glass and bits of metal and plaster a city as vast as rome produces a great deal of trash and it all has to go somewhere better to cart it outside the walk and dump it in the city of the dead than to let it pile up among the living at the farthest edge of the city where the tombs and trash heaps grew fewer and farther between and the countryside began in earnest we passed the monument of basilius ive never known who basilius was or why his tomb built like a miniature greek temple atop a little hill should be as grand as those of the claudii or scipios the inscriptions are so old they can no longer be read but the monuments prominence and location make it a landmark of sorts the monument of basilius marks the farthest reach of the citys vices or the farthest incursion of the countrysides menace depending on your point of view bad types of all sorts congregate there the vicinity is notorious for robberies and rapes thus the commonplace warning to a friend setting out on the appian way be careful passing the monument of basilius that morning those had been bethesdas next to last words to me at the moment the only vagrants to be seen were a few wretched figures huddled under coarse blankets against the monuments base surrounded by empty wine vessels they were probably as harmless and miserable as they looked on the other hand bandits are notorious for feigning such disguises i spurred my mount to a trot eager to put the place behind us but as we hurried on all my inner senses told me i was getting closer to danger not farther away when i had insisted that pompey supply guards for my family in my absence he had offered to send more guards along with eco and me i had refused his men were likely to be recognized what was the point of sending me to find out what pompeys men could not if people could tell at a glance that i came from pompey besides i had reasoned three healthy armed men on horseback offering offence to no one should have little to worry about bethesdas very last words to me that morning with what glimmered suspiciously like a tear in her eye had been you are a fool i hoped she was wrong past the monument of basilius the appian way stretches like a long straight ribbon towards mount alba on the horizon the land on either side is as flat as a table dotted here and there with distant trees and houses a man can see for miles there was no one but us travelling on the road that morning no slaves at work in the fellow fields except for a few plumes of smoke from hearth fires in scattered houses there were no signs of life at all this is one of the safest stretches on the whole appian way since the topography affords no places for ambush the fresh air the smell of earth the vast emptiness the sun rising over the long ridge of hills to the west all these things made me feel exhilarated glad to be leaving the city and its madness behind me for a while but one of us did not look happy at all is something wrong davus you seem to be getting the hang of riding master no the horse is fine even as he spoke he tightened his grip on the reins as if the beast might overhear and rear up just to spite him is it something else then nothing master only he scanned the empty fields on either side with such a disconcerted look that i followed his gaze thinking there must be some menace lurking in the clumps of frigid earth and brown grass for jupiters sake what do you see davus nothing master dont keep saying that you must see something no master thats exactly it im seeing nothing nothing at all and it seems to go on forever are you going blind no i can see everything except that theres nothing to see i suddenly understood i couldnt help but laugh at the absurdity of it eco frowned and drew his mount closer what going on papa davus has never been outside the city in his life i said isnt that right davus yes master how old are you davus nineteen master davus is nineteen years old eco and he has never been on a horse and he has never stepped foot outside rome eco cursed and rolled his eyes and rode on ahead hes angry at me master no he isnt davus he misses his wife and hes worried about her then youre angry at me no davus forget that i laughed dont give it another thought youll need all your thinking to stay upright on that horse and to keep track of all the nothing thats going by we rode on for a while the stillness broken only by the clop of hooves against the road tufts of steam rose from the horses nostrils i took a deep breath hungry to feel the bite of cold air in my lungs the empty azure bowl of the morning sky was like crystal the brown winter earth was like a slumbering giant across whom we made our tiny progress i was unspeakably glad to be away from rome he was a very good slave wasnt he said davus with a frown so heavy it pulled his chin to his chest who the bodyguard you had before me the one who was killed i sighed his name was belbo yes he was a good slave a good man i suppose he was stronger than me smarter than me too i looked at davuss hulking arms and shoulders and saw the unhappy befuddlement on his face probably not i said but ill wager he knew how to ride a horse ill bet he wasnt afraid of an empty field dont worry about it i said as gently as i could none of this was his fault after all xiv the sun is up eco the air is cold and clear there is not another person on the road not another person in sight ah can you hear that i dont hear a thing papa exactly not even a bird or a cricket silence i believe my faculties are beginning to return i may actually be able to think again eco laughed did you ever lose the ability its not a joke cant you feel it with every step the horses take us farther from the city the clearer my head becomes its as if ive been in fog and now its lifting the haze we left behind in the city was smoke papa the haze thats visible yes but theres another haze thats settled over rome panic confusion deception no one can think straight people are behaving like madmen rushing wildly about hiding in holes running from their shadows its like a bad dream that wont end but now i feel like im waking up dont you feel it too he looked about took a deep breath and laughed yes good perhaps together we can begin to make sense of things where shall we start papa on this very spot but lets go back in time twentyone days why because it was exactly twentyone days ago that clodius set out on the appian way i figured it out last night and milo milo set out the next day the day of their fatal encounter but well come to that lets begin with clodius and reconstruct the events as they happened so far as we know from both milo and fulvia i had not yet shared with eco all the details of my interview with fulvia the previous day to begin fulvia told me that clodius left their house on the palatine at about the third hour not as early as we did we set out even before sunrise before the first hour but the third hour would have been an early start for a man like clodius why because he was as dissolute as cicero claims no because whenever a man as powerful as clodius leaves town even on a short trip there are always a great many loose ends and lastminute details to be dealt with i gathered from fulvia that such was the case with clodius that morning hastily scribbled notes messengers dispatched and so forth finally clodius set out on his way before hed even left the palatine hill he paused to look in on a friend who had fallen deathly ill cyrus the architect the names familiar will we be questioning him im afraid not cyrus died later that very day not long after clodius left him he was an architect to the rich and famous much sought after he seemed to have been above politics cicero hired him to rebuild his house on the palatine after it was burned down by the mob clodius hired him when he bought that monstrosity of a house from scaurus to design all the changes i gather that cyrus had been spending a great deal of time at clodiuss house in recent months overseeing workers dining with the family so cyrus worked for both cicero and clodius i gather that he had an artists temperament the type thats too talented to take sides not only did both clodius and cicero use his services they both gave him legal advice it seems that cyrus consulted both of them separately when he fell ill and drew up his will and named both of them among his heirs after clodiuss farewell visit that morning cicero went to see cyrus and was with him when he died an architect with a sense of symmetry noted eco you say he was above politics but i wonder all the time he was spending at clodiuss house dining with the family able to wander about at will what a splendid eavesdropper hed have made for cicero i thought of that even if he wasnt a deliberate spy even in normal conversations cyrus could have inadvertently given cicero a great deal of information about clodiuss household and dealings and cicero would know just how to extract the information he wanted but this is merely supposition weve no cause to think that cyrus was in any sense a spy cyrus merely constitutes a curious link between cicero and clodius just another example of what a small town rome really is cyruss name comes up again later which is why i mention him now but his part in the story is probably insignificant understood eco looked at me shrewdly all the same im suspicious of this cyrus fellow i shall be keeping a close watch on him dead or alive thats the spirit ugh papa its not like you to pun none intended to continue clodius paid a last visit to the ailing cyrus and then set out on the appian way the reason for his trip was some business in the town of aricia about fifteen miles from rome its an easy days journey on horseback the traditional first nights stop on a trip south a place with inns and taverns for travellers clodius had business there he was slated to address the town senate the next morning fulvia didnt seem to know what the occasion was or why clodiuss presence was required perhaps it was time for an annual pig festival in aricia or a celebration of some local deity politicians are always taking trips to outlying towns to court the voters clodius happened to be a major property owner in the vicinity he and fulvia owned a villa just this side of aricia something to note fulvia didnt go with him thats a little odd from all ive heard fulvia was very much the politicians dutiful wife and wives generally go along on this sort of trip while the politician makes friendly jabber with the local magistrates the politicians wife radiates matronly virtue and shares recipes with the magistrates wives or something like that but fulvia stayed at home did you ask her why she told me she was concerned about cyruss condition was she that close to cyrus youve seen her house imagine having your architect die on you in the middle of redoing that monstrosity i see what you mean but does it really matter that fulvia didnt go with clodius maybe maybe not consider this if a man was plotting to ambush his enemy as milo contends that clodius was hed leave his wife at home dont you think but heres something curious clodius did take his young son along with him the boy is only a child eight years old that seems to negate the idea that clodius left fulvia behind because he was plotting violence youd think he would have left his son safely at home too did fulvia say why he took the boy with him she says clodius wanted to introduce his son to the city leaders in aricia now that sounds like a typical roman politician never too soon to start cultivating the heir and of course absent his wife what better way to show himself off as a good family man than to bring along his little boy clodiuss enemies meaning cicero and milo have spent yean painting him as an incestuous whoremongering former male prostitute who lives to seduce other mens wives and sons which may or may not have touched on the truth that sort of talk doesnt necessarily ruin a mans reputation in jaded sophisticated rome but its poison out in the countryside where people still take oldfashioned virtues seriously so when clodius shows up to speak to the citizens of aricia he wants to present himself as an upstanding husband and father how better to do that than to deliver his speech with eightyearold publius junior by his side eco frowned but the boy wasnt there when clodius and milo had their skirmish on the appian way the next day was he no but we shall come to that one more thing to consider while we still have clodius setting out for aricia a large contio was held in the forum that morning called by the same radical tribunes whove been instigating riots since clodius died normally clodius would have made a point of attending such a contio to make sure things went according to plan instead he headed off for aricia eco shrugged a man cant be in two places at once no so he has to make a choice some would say that its hard to imagine clodius missing a rabblerousing contio just to curry favour with the town fathers at a rest stop on the appian way unless he had an ulterior motive such as an ambush on his mortal enemy so his enemies might suggest simply another point to keep in mind what sort of entourage did clodius take with him three friends and a number of slaves fulvia says twentyfive or thirty most of them on foot and all of them armed so many a large bodyguard granted but hardly unreasonable how else could a man like clodius travel safely in the countryside as it was the bodyguard wasnt adequate to save him in the end but there will be those wholl suggest that such a formidable group must have been intended for attack rather than defence another detail to be noted so at last we have clodius on his way yes he deals with lastminute business at home gives fulvia a kiss stops in to see the dying architect he and his thirty or so men stride through the capena gate perhaps a cold drop of water falls on his neck just as it did on mine and gives him a start its midmorning the market is jammed with shoppers and stinks of fish slaves and humble citizens recognize him hail him those who despise him only scowl and bite their tongues theyd be outnumbered in a crowd like that he and his friends get horses from somewhere pompeys cant be the only stable in the area and theyre off on the appian way with their entourage walking behind them clodius probably pauses to pay homage at the tombs of his illustrious ancestors his son is with him and what patrician father would pass up the opportunity to impress his birthright on a boy they pass the notorious monument of basilius and clodius doesnt give it a thought the place is dangerous only at night and theres a troop of armed men marching behind him the road is wide so clodius and his three friends ride abreast with his son at his right hand listening to the grownups converse the little fellow must be quite impressed with his father all those men at papas beck and call the huge crowds that gather when papa speaks such a grand house to grow up in to think it will all be in ruins the next day now clodius and his company have come to the same long dull stretch of road where we find ourselves clodius has his friends along to keep the conversation lively and of course his son to whom he can point out the various shrines and tombs that continue to dot the way now and again when that fails he can brag about the road itself as every claudian has done since it was built it is a remarkably fine road isnt it the blocks so perfectly cut and fitted the surface so level and smooth the way so remarkably wide ox carts going in opposite directions can pass without even pausing youd think the gods themselves had made such a road but no it was appius claudius caecus manytimes greatgrandfather of our own publius clodius one more thing for that little boy to be proud of aricia lies ahead at the end of the journey about four hours away a horseman in a hurry could make it sooner but since the bodyguards are walking clodius and his friends on horseback are obliged to keep a slow but steady pace on the way to aricia what will they pass a lot of nothing said davus asserting his presence after a long silence he seemed in control of his horse and in better spirits ready to laugh at himself a lot of empty farmland to be more precise interspersed with woods here and there and some marshes in the low spots all very flat and not particularly scenic to the left distant mountains on the horizon to the right a gentle gradual slope towards the sea and up ahead growing steadily larger as they draw nearer mount alba what do you think of it davus he peered at the low peaked mass on the horizon it must be enormous i smiled not really only a small mountain as mountains go but a major landmark in these flatlands there are several small towns among the ridges and foothills aricia is one of them but the first one well come to just as the ground begins to rise is bovillae youve taken this road plenty of times on your way down to neapolis eco how far is bovillae from rome a little past the eleventh milestone and whats there at bovillae ive been through the place papa im not sure ive ever stopped think he stared through narrowed eyes at the foothills ahead as if by squinting he could make out the details at such a distance i seem to remember an inn along the road and a stable yes the stable has probably been there in one form or another for well over two hundred years since the first stretch of the appian way from rome to bovillae was paved appius claudius caecus built the road as a military route for the legions to use thats why its so wide and so straight bovillae was the first poststation for military messengers a place to change horses and where theres a stable of course theres an inn what does the inn at bovillae look like a stone building two storeys yes theres probably a communal sleeping room upstairs a tavern downstairs and a cookhouse at the back a stable and an inn what else eco shrugged a few houses here and there away from the road oh and an altar to jupiter built under a circle of old oak trees with a little creek nearby a very pretty spot oak trees yes once the road starts ascending to higher ground at bovillae the trees get thicker the top of the mountain is a veritable forest i dont suppose youve ever seen a forest davus ive seen what they call groves growing around temples in the city not quite the same thing well so much for bovillae not much to it is there not a very special place to breathe your last breath but thats where clodius died the next day the skirmish started farther up the road but apparently milos men chased clodius to the inn where he made his last stand according to fulvia it was a senator named sextus tedius who came along later and found the body lying in the road he had his slaves put the corpse into his litter and sent it on to rome you and i saw the condition it was in when it reached fulvia stabbed and strangled and after bovillae eco whats next on the road the land begins to rise as you said wooded slopes with rich peoples estates pylons set on either side of private roads leading up to big houses that you can barely glimpse as you go by he cocked his head and squinted something new closer to the roada temple of some sort not a temple but a residence the house of the vestal virgins youre right its new built only in the last few years before that the vestals lived somewhere higher up the mountain theres a temple of vesta somewhere up there not a place we men are likely to set foot in press on imaginary rider whats next along the road on the opposite side of the road something else religious having to do with women a shrine not a temple a shrine to fauna the good goddess excellent a place for faunas female worshippers to leave offerings and make prayers and another place where we wouldnt be particularly welcome but according to fulvia it was on the stretch of road directly in front of the shrine of the good goddess that the skirmish between clodius and milo began well want to take a careful look at the lay of the land and see whether it looks like a suitable place for an ambush but lets return to clodius on the day before his death on his way from rome to aricia hell have passed all these places perhaps without stopping wanting to press on now that hes so close to his destination what comes next eco hmm i seem to remember some impressive pylons on the left and a road heading up to a villa on the ridge above yes if my assumption is correct thats where well be spending the night pompeys villa from the directions baby face gave me i think that must be the place eco whistled the view must be extraordinary yes pompey seems to like living in places where hes able to look down on the world around him but dont stop yet whats next along the road more private estates one of them must belong to clodius yes his is that enormous thing that seems to perch on the side of the hill the place where they cut down all those trees and did all that excavating yes apparently a great deal of the interior space is underground like a vault defensible as a fortress fulvia told me from what she said i gathered that clodius was especially proud of the place even happier with it than that palace of a house on the palatine well get the chance to take a closer look at it thats where clodiuss journey ended for the day just a mile or so this side of aricia there must have been a few hours of sunlight left clodius probably inspected the grounds talked to the foreman saw to whatever it is that estate owners see to when they arrive at one of their estates his cook prepared a dinner that night to which some of the local elite were invited it all sounds very respectable very boring after all that riding little publius junior probably fell asleep on his dining couch the next morning clodius delivered his address to the town senate of aricia followed by a brief reception then back to his estate by shortly after midday or early afternoon fulvia says that he intended to spend at least another night there did he have more business in the area i dont know lets be sentimental and assume that he wanted to spend some fatherly time with his son strolling through the wooded grounds around his villa but then a messenger arrived a messenger the one that fulvia dispatched that morning to give her husband the sad news about cyrus the architect she asked clodius to return to rome at once was it really necessary for clodius to hurry home fulvia seemed to think so cyrus was close enough to have named clodius among his heirs and fulvia was depending on the man to finish their palatine house she felt overwhelmed by his death she wanted her husband to come home and clodius dropped everything to come running at her call you dont find that credible eco i dont know papa youve had more contact with the woman than i have yes well ill venture to say that when fulvia tells a man to do something the chances are good that the man will do what fulvia says even clodius even clodius which is to say that i find what fulvia told me credible if not necessarily convincing that clodius intended to spend another night at his country villa but instead found himself unexpectedly back on the appian way headed towards rome because of that message from fulvia if that was the case then there was no premeditated ambush was there when milo and his entourage passed by clodius should have been off strolling in the woods with his son instead clodius was on the appian way but only by chance but where was his son if the boy wasnt with him when the skirmish occurred fulvia says that clodius had promised the boy a stay in the country and left him at the villa with his tutor does it strike you as credible that he would leave the boy behind papa perhaps you might think fulvia would have wanted her son brought back to her but the rich see these things differently i suppose if i owned a huge villa in the country with a full staff of slaves to run the place i might feel comfortable leaving my eightyearold son in their keeping or perhaps the boy is an insufferable brat and a terrible traveller perhaps hed been a complete pest all the previous day and clodius couldnt abide another long trip with the monster and wanted to be rid of him eco laughed thats better forget the sentimentality of course to some it might look suspicious that clodius just happened to set out from his villa with an armed company just as milo was approaching on the appian way and just happened to leave his young son behind out of harms way another detail to be noted so we finally come to milo what was he doing on the appian way you heard his speech in the forum the other day he was expected for a religious ceremony in lanuvium which is the next town you come to after aricia a couple of miles farther south from what ive been able to tell the bare facts of the account milo gave at caeliuss contio are true he attended a meeting of the senate in rome that morning and later he set out at the head of a large retinue riding with his wife in a carriage milo claims they got a late start and didnt pass bovillae until about the eleventh hour the last hour of daylight if thats true it would seem to contradict fulvias story about clodius heading home because the eleventh hour of a winter day is too late for anyone with a scrap of sense to set out on a journey of several hours with a troop of men on foot it would have been long after dark before clodius got to rome and travelling by night is a dangerous business if only because of the chance that a man or beast will trip in the dark and break a leg so did the incident really occur that late fulvia says that clodiuss body carried in a litter arrived at her house on the palatine at the first hour of the night only an hour or two after milo claims the skirmish began which is impossible so theres a discrepancy about when the incident occurred fulvia says it happened earlier in the afternoon milo says it happened not long before sunset is that important papa it means that one of them has to be mistaken or deliberately lying i shall try to contain my surprise yes but why lie about the time eco and if fulvia or milo has lied about that then what else might one or the other be lying about do you think were likely to find out simply by going to these places and asking some questions we can try i said mount alba loomed straight ahead of us steadily growing larger clouds had gathered at its summit casting a shadow over the higher slopes so that the mountain seemed to erupt from the surrounding sunlit plains like a brooding mass of doubt davus frowned viewing the prospect with misgivings he was not the only one xv though we arrived at bovillae before the fourth hour the midday meal was already being prepared smoke rose from the cookhouse behind the inn carrying smells of baking bread and roasting meat im starving said eco davuss stomach growled in sympathy good i said we wont have to invent any pretences for why were stopping at the tavern it was a twostorey building made of muchweathered stone the land all around was cleared and trammelled by the passage of many feet over many years it was to this place according to fulvia that clodius had fled when milos men overwhelmed him he had taken refuge in the tavern milos men had stormed the place fulvia knew no details of the battle only that eventually a passing senator on his way to rome had come upon clodiuss body lying in the road outside the tavern and had sent it on to rome in his litter davus walked the horses to a hitching post beneath a nearby stand of trees there was a trough with water for the horses and a bench for davus to sit on while he watched them before we went inside eco and i took a quick look at all four sides of the building to see how defensible it looked there were large shuttered windows in the upper storey inaccessible as there was no way to climb up to them the shuttered windows in the rear and side walls of the lower storey were small and set high up a man might have been able to wriggle through one but only if given a boost and if there was no one inside to stop him the back door made of solid wood opened onto a covered walkway to the cookhouse the front door which at the moment stood open was also made of solid wood the doorway was so narrow that eco and i had to turn sideways and step inside one at a time the windows on either side of the front door were slightly larger and situated a little lower than the other windows on the ground floor but a man would still have had a difficult time scrambling in or out of them all in all the inn appeared to be a reasonably defensible building still i saw the signs of a recent losing battle so did eco did you notice the difference in the shutters papa yes the ones on the upstairs windows are all made of old grey wood while the shutters on every one of the downstairs windows are conspicuously new as are both the front and back doors theres a lot of new plaster around the doorway as well you and i know all too well how doors can be broken and need replacing where do you suppose everyone is papa who would you expect to be here there were no other travellers on the road this morning were probably early for the regular midday clientele as my eyes adjusted to the dim light i saw a plain rustic room with a few tables and benches a steeply angled stairway to the upper floor began at the far left corner underneath the stairway a counter blocked off the back portion of the room in the wall behind the counter there was a little archway with a cloth curtain tied back to show a shadowy storage room that led through to the rear door after a moment the door rattled and opened to show the silhouette of a large woman outlined by bright sunlight she closed the door behind her and waddled up to the bar wiping her hands on the front of her coarse gown she smelled of baking bread and roasting meat i thought i saw someone come in she peered at us with a squint that i took to be almost hostile until i realized she was waiting for her eyes to adjust to the dimness she was a stronglooking woman with meaty arms and a round open face surrounded by a tangle of greying red hair thats your fellow with the horses over by the trough yes i said three altogether are you yes travellers hungry travellers added eco leaning against the bar she showed the hint of a smile we can take care of that as long as you have something that jingles eco produced his coin purse she nodded ive got a couple of rabbits roasting itll be a little while before theyre done but i can bring you some bread and cheese in the meantime she reached under the bar and produced two cups then went back to the storage room and returned with a pitcher of wine and a pitcher of water could you take some food out to the fellow under the trees too i said i can hear his stomach growling from here certainly ill send one of my boys to take care of him theyre out in the cookhouse watching the fire with my husband she added as if making of point of letting us know that she was not a woman alone travellers you say headed north or south south youve come from rome then she poured out generous portions of wine then added splashes of water we left early this morning whats it like up in the city an awful mess were glad to be away from it well its been an awful mess around here too let me tell you ever since that accursed day she sighed and shook her head ah yes we must be close to where it happened the skirmish up the road she snorted call it a skirmish if you like but id call it an allout battle to judge from the damage that was done and the dead bodies lying all about and it may have started up the road but right heres where it ended she slapped the top of the counter what do you mean arent we talking about the same thing milo and clodius and all the blood that was spilled i nodded no one in rome talks about anything else these days but everything is so confused and jumbled every new version contradicts the last one something happened on the appian way and clodius ended up dead thats about the only thing all the stories agree on where when and how nobody knows for sure she rolled her eyes so much suffering and destruction youd think people would at least bother to find out what really happened if only to be glad it didnt happen to them but you said you were hungry ill get you some bread hot from the oven eco opened his mouth to call her back but i squeezed his arm and shook my head the woman is eager enough to tell us what she knows i said in a low voice let her do it at her own pace she returned with a steaming loaf of bread in a basket and a piece of cheese the size of a brick then went back to the storeroom and returned with a heaped bowl of black and green olives she put her elbows on the bar leaned towards us and resumed her tale without any prompting it was my brotherinlaw who owned this tavern my little sisters husband a hardworking fellow from a long line of hard workers inherited the place from his rather the familys owned this inn for generations he wept with joy the day my sister gave him a son to leave it to she sighed who could have known how soon hed be passing the place along the boys still a baby and now that his papa is dead theres not another grown man on either side of the family to run the place so weve taken it over my husband and i with our boys helping us while my poor widowed sister stays with her baby ah poor marcus that was her husbands name theres always some danger when you run a place like this on the road always the risk of being raided by bandits or runaway slaves whod slash your throat without a thought but marcus was a big stout fellow not afraid of anything and this inn was his whole life always had been since he was a child i think he didnt realize the danger that day when clodiuss men came running in all bloody and out of breath he didnt turn them away he just asked them what he could do to help clodius staggered inside wounded and bleeding and told him to bolt the doors then they laid clodius right here flat on his back she slapped the counter hard enough to cause ripples in our cups by the dim light i studied the mottled stained surface of the old wood a lot of wine must have been spilled on that counter over the years i told myself but there were stains which might have been something else marcus should have sent them all right back out into the road thats what my husband says but what does he know he wasnt here but my poor sister was she told me all about it shed left her baby with me that day oh how she loved working in this tavern as much as marcus did nothing could keep her away when clodius and his men showed up she was upstairs shaking out blankets and sweeping the floors if only her little boy had been sick if only something anything had kept her at home that day the shock of what happened to marcus was bad enough but for her to have been here to have seen and heard its broken something inside her ah well thats why we have to do everything we can to keep the place going until little marcus is big enough to take his fathers place i nodded so the skirmish the battle began up the road but clodius ended up here had he ever been in the tavern before did he know your brotherinlaw marcus oh certainly publius clodius stopped in here plenty of times on his way to that villa of his up on the mountain i met him myself a few times over the years so charming you could tell right away that he was highborn there was no hiding that just a certain way he had of carrying himself and always such fine clothes and fine horses and how his hair and fingernails were always so nicely groomed you dont often see a man who keeps his fingernails so well cared for but he was never aloof he always remembered marcuss name always asked him how little marcus was coming along he had a young son himself so ive heard of course not everybody liked publius clodius he stirred up some hard feelings around here back when he started building his villa hard feelings well there were some who said that the way he got hold of the surrounding land wasnt completely honest and others who complained that some of the trees he cut down were part of the sacred grove of jupiter and the vestals had to move out of their old house but clodius gave them money to build their new house which is only a little farther from the temple of vesta than their old one so i could never see what all their complaining was about she shook her head but ill speak no ill of the dead especially when the poor mans lemur left his body within the sound of my voice so your brotherinlaw was friendly with clodius despite any hard feelings that some of your neighbours might have had oh yes i suppose thats why clodius ran to this place when he found himself in trouble if only he hadnt brought the trouble with him but i dont blame the dead i blame the other the other she picked up a rag from behind the bar and began twisting it clenching her fists until the knuckles turned white the one whose men were after clodius that day hes the bastard to blame for what happened here titus annius milo you mean she made a noise in her throat as if she might spit if you want to call him that milo he chose that name for himself didnt he what a vain fellow thinking he takes after some great olympic hero well no one is overawed by your socalled milo in these parts hes just another fellow from the far side of the mountain who went off to rome to make his fortune he comes from lanuvium did you know that yes i think id heard that titus annius milo you call him he wasnt born with that name either he wasnt even born with the name titus the fellow was born plain gaius papius like his father before him and let me assure you that the papii of lanuvium never did a single thing of importance that anyone can remember by birth hes as common as dirt but when his father died his grandfather adopted him that was his mothers father titus annius the one with the noble ancestors so milo took the old mans names and added a name of his own and gaius papius turned into titus annius milo now everyones heard of him he inherited his grandfathers money too when the old man died but they say hes squandered it all on those fancy funeral games he put on to impress the voters in rome the things a man will do to get himself elected to high office well no man among my relatives would ever vote for the fellow always pretending and putting on airs as fake as all three of his names no we never had any use for milo she paused for breath and began to wipe the counter with her rag as if she could rub away the bloodstains oh milo would stop in here from time to time on his way home to lanuvium buy a round of wine for everybody say a few pretty words make sure everyone noticed him the local boy whod become such a powerful fellow in rome friend of cicero ally of pompey sure to become consul one of these days but if you ask me milo hasnt got a speck of clodiuss charm clodius would come into this room and it would be as if someone had lit candles all around everything suddenly had a glow to it milo would come in blustering and grinning and it was like someone blowing bad breath in your face his charm was all for show you could practically see him gritting his teeth at having to mix with the common folk hed left behind as for that wife of his whats her name fausta i believe said eco ah yes fausta cornelia well theres a case of a man marrying upward if ever there was one now how did the old dictator sullas daughter ever end up hitched to gaius papius from lanuvium all a game of money and politics i suppose marriage between people like that always comes down to a cold calculation doesnt it they say it hasnt stopped her from having all the lovers she wants they say faustas more of a slut now than she was with her first husband for all that let me tell you she never pretended to have the common touch when she and milo would come parading up the appian way and hed stop in here to buy drinks for everyone the great fausta cornelia would stay most firmly ensconced in that fancy carriage of hers rigid as a statue staring straight ahead as if it might give her a gas pain just to look at a person like myself well i could understand her staying out of the tavern a lady like that clodiuss wife fulvia was the same she and her women would always keep to themselves when clodius stopped in but youd see her on the grass under the trees playing with her little boy or nursing the little gid behaving like a normal person not like fausta cornelia too good to even exchange a glance with the likes of myself but there was one time one time the woman suddenly shook and choked with laughter nature gets the better of everybody in the end eh she managed to say regaining herself i remember the time oh she must have needed to relieve herself very badly because she actually sent a slave to ask me where the toilets were so i sent a girl to show her the way to the little building over by the stream past the stables and the girl came back saying that fausta cornelia hadnt found the toilets to her liking and that shed refused to use them you can bet that milo left the tavern and set out pretty soon after that i suppose she held it in all the way to lanuvium but how even the appian way has a few bumps in it we all talked about it afterwards wondering whether shed had an accident in the carriage and how milo would react oh can you imagine the look on the mans face she burst out laughing again until tears flowed down her cheeks finally she recovered and stood wiping away the tears with the backs of her hands ah the rabbit itll be done by now surely and with that she disappeared again through the back door eco raised an eyebrow it seems that clodius and milo were both rather well known in these parts yes the ambitious local boy and the aristocratic outsider with money and charm two types bound to excite strong reactions in people admiration respect envy hatred yes i said and both of them politicians not shy about putting themselves forwards we know how skilful clodius was at laying on the common touch he made an art of it milo who really did have common roots seems to have been rather clumsy at it so our hostess says papa but shes obviously biased and whats this about clodius cutting down sacred trees displacing the local vestal virgins kicking open the back door out hostess returned bearing a steaming platter a tall hulking figure came in after her carrying a steaming bowl the fellow was so large that i felt a little apprehensive until i realized who it was davus what are you doing youre supposed to be watching the horses a fine thing if we were to finish our meal and find them gone i dont care to walk the twelve miles back to rome dont worry said the woman i sent one of my boys to take his place your horses will be safe you have my word for it isnt it all right for your slave to come inside the clouds are starting to creep down from the mountaintop and a fellow can catch a chill sitting out in the open air let him warm up a bit she cast a look at davus such as women alas have all too rarely cast at me just because a fellow happens to be nineteen has wavy black hair oxlike shoulders and a profile like a greek statue shes brought him inside so that she can look at him said eco from the corner of his mouth obviously i agreed this is the woman who preferred clodius to milo remember the woman put plates andutensils before the three of us and filled our cups the steaming platter turned out to be the roasted rabbit rabbit is not my favourite flesh too greasy and bony but it was well cooked and i was too hungry to quibble the steaming bowl was full of glazed turnips i complimented our hostess on the sauce oh its simple enough a bit of cumin a little garlic some honey and vinegar and olive oil a pinch of rue a root vegetable calls for a spicy sauce my mother always said its really quite excellent i said and meant it but it was time to bring her back to the death of clodius did you do much of the cooking here at the tavern before that unfortunate day oh every now and again especially after my sister had her boy but you werent here that day no as i said there was only my sister working upstairs and marcus had clodius come through bovillae the previous day so my sister told me but he didnt stop in she saw his entourage come marching through but they passed so quickly that she only caught a glimpse of clodius riding at the head with his little boy beside him and a couple of friends and on the day of the incident milo must have passed through here not long before the battle oh yes my sister remembers that vividly remembers everything that happened that day like a bad dream you cant forget milo did stop for a while to water his horses but none of his men came into the tavern still she says you couldnt miss his entourage it went on and on like one of those triumphal processions in the city thats how he usually travelled at least when she was with him fausta cornelia you mean yes youd think she couldnt leave the house without ten slaves to make up her face in the morning and ten slaves to tuck her into bed at night and i suppose gaius papius milo if you must simply liked showing off all those slaves and bodyguards to his friends and family back in lanuvium look at me i just cant seem to leave the house without having a hundred minions trailing behind me a hundred were there that many people in his entourage that day she shrugged oh i dont know the number as i say i didnt see it myself my sister did but she says that while milo was watering his hones at the stable with his people milling about they filled up the road like a crowd in the forum in rome and when they finally got going again the procession just seemed to go on and on marcus made a joke of it she said if only milo had watered his slaves as well as his horses they could have sold every drop of wine in stock and paid for a new roof so milos party was bigger than the group that clodius passed through with on the previous day are you a simpleton or are you just not listening yes definitely much much bigger but clodiuss party was made up entirely of armed men so ive heard whereas you make it sound as though milo travelled with hairdressers and cosmeticians faustas slaves were in the party yes but milo always travelled with plenty of gladiators some of them pretty famous ever heard of eudamus and birria of course they were in milos party he owned the two of them isnt that just like him to buy a pair of famous gladiators just so he could show them off even ive heard of eudamus and birria and i have about as much interest in seeing men kill each other in an arena as i do in watching a beetle roll a piece of dung across the road though some of those gladiators arent hard to look at she cast a glance at davus who busied himself with tearing a bit of rabbit flesh off the bone eudamus and birria on the other hand now those two are about as pretty as a donkeys hincl end and about as hard to miss they always brought up the rear of milos entourage huge like walking trees you never see one without the other my husband says they used to fight as a team in the arena yes two against two sometimes two against four said davus pulling a rabbit bone from his mouth eco and i both looked at him in surprise go on davus i said he cleared his throat its just that when i was a boy my old master used to take us all to watch the fights he explained he owned a few gladiators himself thought about training me for the arena but finally decided i was too small and he could make a better deal selling me as a bodyguard he always said that no man ever lost money betting on eudamus and birria it didnt matter what sort of weapon they used or in what combination trident and net short sword axe with shields or without they could paralyse a man with fear just by staring at him the two scariest men who ever lived thats what my old master used to call them i speared a turnip with my fork and dabbed it in the sauce and these gladiators were with milo when he passed through that day the woman nodded of that im certain because they were the first of the men who came running after clodius my sister saw them from an upstairs window is that where she stayed during the attack upstairs this is how she tells it she heard the noise when clodius and his men rushed in and she started to come down she just caught a glimpse of them then marcus yelled at her to go back upstairs how many men did she see not very many five or six she said and clodius lying on this counter gripping his shoulder and gnashing his teeth giving orders to the rest giving orders yes telling them to close the shutters and so forth then he was wounded but still conscious very much so determined my sister said his men were looking to him for directions but the looks on those mens faces what sort of look like men with death on their heels bracing themselves to turn and look it in the fece thats just how she put it panicstricken gasping for breath when they heard her on the stairs they all gave a start and looked up at her like startled rabbits all except clodius she said he smiled at her smiled then marcus yelled for her to go back and she ran up the stairs then what she ran to a window to see what they were running from just a little up the road a man had fallen two men stood over him hacking at him with swords blood flying all over the place the fallen man must have been with clodius the other two were eudamus and birria she recognized them right away like demons from hades she said like monsters from an old story farther up the road she could see more fallen men and what looked like a whole army of gladiators heading for the tavern imagine how she felt eudamus and birria finished hacking at the fallen man and came lumbering towards the tavern the others came rushing up behind them oh it makes me sick to think of it my baby sister she shook her head and patted her hand against her breast eco pushed his plate away looking slightly queasy davus stared intently at the woman and used his teeth to tear a shred of rabbit flesh off a bone and then what i said marcus had barred the doors and the shutters downstairs the attackers got closer and closer and then they were at the door bang bang bang beating at the door at the shutters with their fists with the pommels of their swords the racket was terrifying she covered her ears and still she could hear it it went on and onmen crying out the crack of splintered wood and broken hinges screams and yells clanging steel the woman rolled her eyes up sometimes i cant sleep at night imagining what she must have gone through trapped up there alone and helpless she finally gathered up all the blankets crouched in a corner and piled the blankets on top of her she says she cant even remember doing it but she must have because finally she realized that all the noise was over and there she was sweating under all those blankets but shivering as if she were naked how much time had passed who knows a few moments an hour she couldnt say finally she got up the courage to peek through the blankets she was still all alone upstairs and there was only silence from down below she went to a window and looked out she saw bodies scattered here and there along the road and the strangest thing right in front of the tavern a litter with a group of people standing around it a litter yes not a carriage or a wagon but a litter the kind thats carried by a team of slaves with curtains for privacy the litter had been put down the bearers were standing by an old man in a senators toga and a woman were standing over one of the fallen men in the road with their heads together talking did your sister recognize the senator no but she knew the litter weve seen it for years heading up to rome and coming back again it belongs to an old senator who owns one of the villas on the mountain sextus tedius ive never seen his face hes not the sort to come into a place like this and the man they were leaning over clodius your sister was able to recognize him even at a distance i suppose so thats what she said that it was clodius how did he get from the tavern into the road who knows probably eudamus and birria dragged him out there like dogs with a rabbit i thought of the marks around clodiuss throat perhaps he had been uterally dragged by the neck the woman looked at our plates why you two havent finished your meat on a chilly day like this a man needs plenty of hot food in his belly to keep up his strength this one knows how to eat she cast a toothy grin at davus who finished sucking the last bit of marrow from a bone and cast a lingering glance at the uneaten meat on our plates wasnt it good excellent i assured her roasted to perfection im afraid we stuffed ourselves with too much of your fine bread and cheese beforehand i slid my plate and ecos towards davus you say your sister saw bodies scattered along the road and senator tedius and his wife not his wife senator tedius is a widower the woman would have been his daughter i imagine his only child shes never married and is very devoted to him i see then she saw senator tedius and his daughter with their litter out front discussing what to do with clodius where were milos men vanished theyd won the battle hadnt they what reason did they have to stay my poor sister finally found the courage to creep down the stairs i know what she saw because i saw it myself later eveiything overturned and broken the door off its hinges all the shutters smashed it was as if the furies themselves had been unleashed in this room and worst of all right at the foot of the stairs poor marcus pierced all over with wounds and not a breath left in his body at the foot of the stairs dont you see defending her she must have lost her senses for a while because the next thing she remembers is arriving at my house up the hill she could barely talk for weeping oh how she wept and the people outside the tavern i said quietly senator tedius and his retinue she shrugged they were all gone by the time my husband and i got here so was clodius or whatever was left of him later we heard that tedius had sent the body on to rome in his litter and hundreds of people gathered at clodiuss house in rome that night and lit bonfires his poor widow but fulvias grief couldnt have been any greater than my sisters there were no gatherings here no bonfires just a great mess to be cleaned up the next day my husband saw that all the bodies were gathered up and laid out in rows over by the stable a man from clodiuss villa came with a wagon and claimed them but they didnt clean the blood from the appian way you can still see great patches of it between here and the shrine of the good goddess and nobodys offered to pay a single sesterce towards the repairs we had to make to this place i told my husband that he should take milo to court for damages but he says we should wait and see how things go up in rome before we get ourselves into more trouble how do you like that honest men suffer in silence while a man like milo can still put himself forward for consul its an outrage i nodded sympathetically so you and your husband arrived after everyone else had scattered yes all we saw were dead bodies at what time of day did all this happen the battle well considering when we arrived and from all my sister said i think it must have been about the middle of the afternoon id say milo arrived in bovillae at the ninth hour watered his horses rounded up his entourage and moved on and then his gladiators chased clodius here at the tenth hour not later not closer to sunset she shook her head why do you ask i shrugged one hears so many different versions of the story up in rome there was a noise from the open doorway behind us i stiffened but the woman smiled at the men who entered roasted rabbit today if i can trust my nose said one of them and turnips with our hostesss special sauce said one of his companions sniffing the air they settled themselves on some benches in a comer what do we owe you i asked the woman as i counted coins from ecos purse i leaned towards her over the bar your sister how is she now she shook her head a broken woman as i told you i dont know if shell ever get over it is there any chance that she could receive a visitor a visitor the woman frowned i lowered my voice even further forgive me i havent been entirely forthcoming with you im afraid but now that ive heard you speak i know i can trust you i didnt just happen to pass by today no the woman looked at me suspiciously but with growing interest no im here on behalf of fulvia clodiuss widow she raised her eyebrows yes please keep your voice down i wasnt sure i could trust you before but now that ive heard your feelings about clodius and about milo and his wife roasted rabbit roasted rabbit the newcomers began to chant and beat their fists against the tables laughing goodnaturedly just wait your turn shouted our hostess with a gjare that they took for a joke they laughed and began another chant that quickly disintegrated into laughter turnips turnips tur she leaned closer and spoke just above a whisper i see so youre here to help wreck milos schemes i pursed my hps i cant say thats my purpose for being here exactly but i can say that fulvia has asked me to find out what i can about her husbands death ah she nodded knowingly so you can see why i would like to speak to your sister if i could of course she nodded sagely then frowned but its not possible i realize her fragile condition but its not only that shes not here no shes gone off with her son to stay with our aunt down in rhegium everyone thought it would be best for her to get as far from this place as possible for a while i nodded one couldnt get much farther away than rhegium at the very tip of the italian peninsula roasted rabbit and turnips and sauce roasted rabbit and turnips and sauce the woman shrugged i really must see to the others now but good luck anything that helps to bring milo down a peg or two oh but one more question roasted rabbit and turnips and sauce yes marc antony does that name mean anything to you she thought for a moment then shook her head are you sure never heard of him he must not be from around here roasted rabbit and turnips and sauce our hostess groaned id better feed this lot quickly before we have another riot in this place she rolled her eyes and cast a final grin at davus then hurried away xvi where to now said eco as we stepped out of the inn i could use a nap after that meal davus yawned and stretched in agreement nonsense the day is early and we have a lot more to do davus fetch the horses we set out on the appian way and soon passed the stable and the outbuilding where the toilets had failed to meet with fausta cornelias approval eco laughed do you think that milos wife can be half as disagreeable as our hostess seemed to think ive never had the pleasure of meeting the lady myself but shes certainly been the subject of more than her share of gossip not that i ever seek out such tales bethesda tells them to diana you know and i can hardly help overhearing of course papa i understand its the same with menenia always subjecting me to distasteful gossip but it would be rude to plug my ears wouldnt it so tell me what youve heard and ill tell you what ive heard i laughed davus immune to the irony looked at us as if we were crazy mostly to do with her sexual habits i said when her previous husband gaius memmius was off governing some province she chose to stay in rome and carried on so scandalously that when memmius got home he divorced her then she married milo children not yet theyve been married only a couple of years but from what one hears shes been too busy with her lovers to do much procreating with her husband poor milo save your sympathy i suspect its as our hostess said the two of them married each other for politics and profit whatever else she may be fausta is the dictator sullas daughter and that means a great deal especially to the socalled best people with whom milo has been trying to ingratiate himself most of his life what could it have been like to have been sullas child i doubt whether you or i can even begin to imagine eco she and her twin brother faustus were born late in the dictators life and he was apparently quite pleased with himself imagine cursing a child with a name meaning lucky omen if faustas a spoiled brat blame her doting monster of a father marrying her was a step up for milo i can see that but what was in the marriage for fausta she may not have had many choices memmius had divorced her and left her with a tarnished reputation milo looked to be a rising star didnt he hed just inherited a lot of money from his grandfather never mind that he proceeded to squander it all on the old mans funeral games apparently she didnt marry milo for his lovemaking since she seems to look elsewhere for that eco nodded i suppose youve heard the story about milo catching the radical tribune sallust in bed with her the day after their wedding he had his slaves beat sallust black and blue and confiscated his moneybag for a fine yes which makes me wonder how much of sallusts alliance with the clodians these days is from political sincerity and how much is from a desire to get revenge on milo then of course theres the tale of how milo caught his old friend sextus villius in bed with fausta milo flew into a rage and dragged villius screaming from the room but in feet fausta had been entertaining two lovers and the other one had managed to hide in a wardrobe while milo was thrashing villius out in the hall the second lover sneaked back into bed with fausta and gave her the ride of her life the lady seems to have a penchant for getting caught observed eco or maybe she has a taste for cruelty and likes to see her lovers thrashed davus looked at us and made a face i suspect he had never heard two men speculate about other peoples behaviour in such a prurient fashion eco shook his head ill say it again poor milo he married fausta for prestige and all hes gotten is embarrassment even her twin brother makes jokes about her yes i know the story while her first husband was gone from rome she was stringing along two lovers at once one a fuller who owned a woolwashing operation and the other a fellow called macula on account of a birthmark on his cheek that looked like a stain so faustus observed i dont see why my sister doesnt get rid of that stain after all she has the personal services of a fuller even davus laughed i pointed at a circle of oak trees a little off the road your memory was perfect eco theres the altar of jupiter that you mentioned perhaps we should stop and do something pious to make up for all this gossipmongering eco the complete sceptic likes to taunt me for what little religious sensibility i possess it wouldnt hurt to leave a few coins and say a prayer my son weve had a safe journey and good fortune so far as we dismounted under the shade of the oaks a man in a scrappy white robe appeared from behind the stone altar his jaw was covered with stubble and he smelled of wine he introduced himself as felix and explained that he was the priest of the place and offered to recite an invocation to jupiter on our behalf for a small fee eco rolled his eyes but i gestured for him to open his purse the prayer was a simple formula mumbled so quickly that i scarcely heard it instead i looked into the shadowy recesses of the trees around us and listened to the nearby babbling of the stream and the rustling of the branches so close to the normally busy altogether civilized expanse of the appian way this ancient spot possessed a powerful sense of the ineffable and unseen there is good reason why the altars and temples of the gods are erected in some places and not in others the places chose the altars so to speak and not the other way around this was such a place and no matter what sort of priest maintained it its specialness was as palpable yet elusive as the mist of a breath in cold air when the prayer was done we turned to leave but the priest reached for my arm youre passing through felix said he had the narrow face of a ferret and his teeth were yellow on our way from here to there you know what happened just up on the road dont you quite a few things over the years i should imagine no i mean the business with milo and clodius oh that are we close close cant you hear the lemures of the dead shaking the leaves around us the battle ended just down the road at the old inn yes we just ate there the proprietress told us something about it felix looked disappointed then brightened ah but she couldnt have shown you where the battle started no is it interesting to see interesting when you go back to rome you can tell all your drinking friends that you saw the very spot where the bloodshed began what makes you think were from rome he raised an eyebrow as if to say that our origins were all too obvious to a country dweller like himself so do you want to see the place or not are you offering to be our guide why not ive been the priest at this altar for twenty years and i know everything there is to know about these parts of course i would require a small gratuity for the upkeep of the altar i narrowed my eyes and looked at eco what do you think eco stroked his chin i suppose it might be interesting were not in too much of a hurry oh it will only take a moment said felix i cant leave the altar for long i pretended to consider then finally nodded very well come along with us davus eco and i kept our horses to a slow walk so that the priest on foot could keep up past bovillae the road began a steady ascent the wooded hillside rose on our left and sloped downward on our right despite the increasingly jumbled landscape the road that appius claudius had built continued steady on its course as smooth and broad as ever so you saw the inn already said our guide did you nodce the new doors and shutters you shouldve seen the place right after the battle like a crone with her eyes and teeth plucked out and all those bodies lying about did you see the battle yourself i heard the fighting when it started up the hill and knew that something was up then i saw them come running past you can see a bit of the road from the altar that fellow clodius stumbling and tripping practically carried along by his men five or six of them and then a little later those two monsters lumbering after themeudamus and birria you recognized them who wouldnt i never miss a gladiator show when i get the chance to see one for religious purposes you understand the games started as funeral rites you know theyre still a sacred institution i didnt care to argue the point with a priest were eudamus and birria the only ones who came after clodius and his men felix snorted now wouldnt that make a legend the two gladiators who laid siege to the inn at bovillae and conquered it all by themselves no they werent the only ones a whole army came down behind them an army perhaps i exaggerate how many men then ten twenty maybe more than that then clodius was greatly outnumbered you could say that and the siege at the inn did you see that as well well not exactly not while it was happening i stayed at the altar of course to protect it of course but everyone knows how it turned out marcus the innkeeper slaughtered and that scoundrel clodius and his men lying dead in the road scoundrel the priest looked up at me sidelong and clicked his teeth i mean no offence citizen you were a partisan of the fellow no our hostess at the inn had a different opinion of clodius thats all say what you please about him then ill go ahead and call him a scoundrel if you dont object you preferred milo felix raised an eyebrow im a priest of great jupiter i keep my thoughts on higher things than the squabbling of petty politicians up in rome but when a man commits sacrilege as blatantly as clodius did the gods are bound to strike him down sooner or later sacrilege you mean the time he disguised himself as a woman to sneak into the rites of the good goddess in rome with the objective of making love to caesars wife even as the rites were being performed this had been one of clodiuss most infamous escapades that was indeed a terrible sacrilege said the priest clodius should have been stoned for that but he managed to bribe the jury a failure of earthly justice said eco nodding in agreement but with a mischievous twinkle in his eye and a lapse of heavenly justice too when i was a boy everyone told me that any man who dared to violate the rites of the good goddess would be struck deaf dumb and blind but clodius was the same after he sneaked into the rites as he was before i wonder why the good goddess spared him did his gown and makeup fool her or was she as charmed by clodius as caesars wife was the priest refused to be needed of course she spared him so that he could meet a more horrible fate these ten years later here at bovillae do you think its only a coincidence that the battle began right in front of the good goddesss shrine on the appian way fauna had a hand in his fate you can be sure the priest nodded gravely daring eco to refute his logic but that wasnt the mans only sacrilege or even the wont up in rome i dont suppose youve heard much about what clodius did to the grove of jupiter here on mount alba or the way he treated the local vestal virgins our hostess at the inn mentioned something about it i said but the storys new to me felix shook his head youd think such crimes would be brought to light when a man runs for public office but i suppose people were ready to elect clodius praetor without giving a thought to his religious offences in these parts ill tell you then it all had to do with that gigantic villa of his up on the hill it was a simple enough place to start with but that wouldnt do he had to keep expanding it turning it into his private fortress his property came right up against some of the most sacred parts of the mountain the grove of jupiter the temple of vesta the house of the vestal virgins when he needed more land clodius somehow got the property lines redrawn he claimed a large part of the sacred grove which he then proceeded to chop down for lumber and he had the vestals evicted from their house which he then dismantled stone by stone to add a wing to his own villa using the old mosaics and statuary for decorations look theres the new house of the vestals over there on the left you can just glimpse it through the trees at least he left the temple of vesta alone but thats small recompense for what he did to the grove to my mind theres no more impious act than doing harm to a sacred tree and clodius ordered them cut down by tens and twenties but how did he manage to lay claim to these sacred properties how should i know im only a simple priest assigned to a single altar who knows what sort of threats and bribes he made men like that will stop at nothing to get what they want he looked at eco do you doubt me now young man when i say that the gods were at work when clodius was struck down the gods are at work in all things i said to mollify him even in our chance meeting and this conversation so you saw the flight to the inn but not the battle itself but i could hear it from the altar cracking and crashing and screaming how long did this go on hard to say not too long then a lot of yelling and things fell quiet for a while then the old senator and his daughter came down the hill in their litter you mean after eudamus and birria and milos men had gone back up the hill i said no the senator went by and it wasnt until quite a bit later that milos men started back up the hill with the prisoners prisoners i frowned five or six of them id say how could you tell they were prisoners because their hands were bound they were all huddled together looking scared out of their wits with milos men surrounding them and eudamus and birria prodding them on with an occasional jab to their behinds but who were these prisoners clodiuss men felix shrugged who else but i thought that the five or six men defending clodius at the inn were all killed yes i suppose they were maybe these were some of his men rounded up from the woods were these prisoners wounded were they bloody he looked puzzled now that you ask me no i dont think they were i shook my head according to fulvia at least half of clodiuss men had scattered and fled into the woods early in the battle these were the few survivors who had eventually come back to her with fragmentary reports of the disaster and all the rest had died either along the road or protecting clodius at the inn according to her no one in clodiuss entourage was missing or unaccounted for who then were these prisoners the priest spoke of and if senator tedius had come along in his litter before milos men departed not after how was it that when the innkeepers wife ventured to look out of the window after the battle she saw only senator tedius and his daughter standing over clodius with their retinue and no sign of milos men the precise sequence of events was suddenly muddled in my mind what exactly had the innkeepers wife seen with her own eyes her sisterinlaw was only a secondhand witness and might have inadvertently changed some detail or left something out if only the woman was not so far away in rhegium well this is the spot announced the priest a little out of breath from the uphill climb theres the shrine of the good goddess up ahead on the right he pointed to a miniature temple with a round roof just off the road ringed by oak trees this is where the battle started clodius and his men were coming down the hill and milo and his men were heading up was that how it had happened two parties simply happened to pass on the road and somehow came to blows or had there in fact been an ambush no matter how ill conceived on the part of clodius and his smaller force the spot was perfect for it the trees were dense enough on either side to provide hiding places and the slope of the land would have favoured an attacker corning from above but who excepting the parties involved had actually witnessed the event felicia cried the priest to a tall lithe figure in a white gown who had stepped out of the woods surrounding the shrine of the good goddess as she approached us she raised her hand in greeting and smiled and i saw that she was older than i had first thought there was a luminous quality about her pale face and a gracefulness in her step that at a distance projected the illusion of youth clearly she had once been a stunningly beautiful woman she was still very pleasing to look at the priest stepped towards her and put his hands on his hips kindly wait your turn felicia i am escorting these men for the moment of course of course she mocked him by making a pretence of being intimidated fluttering her eyelashes and wringing her hands i know the rules you get first chance at the travellers from the north i get first chance at the ones from the south besides felicia no one here can go into your shrine all men so i see she appraised each of us in turn smiling at eco letting her eyes linger on davus looking at me last oh all right felicia theyre yours i have to get back to the altar anyway the priest looked up at me and unabashedly stuck out his empty palm ah yes i said the gratuityfor the upkeep of jupiters altar i nodded to eco who produced a sum from his purse that was as usual a little too stingy i frowned and he tipped out another coin i nodded took the money and dropped it into the priests open palm where it vanished from sight with almost magical speed the priest without another word did the same xvii so felicia i said finding it impossible not to return the womans beaming smile you must be the attendant at the shrine of the good goddess i see to the needs of the female travellers who wish to stop and worship here yes for a gratuity only an impious mortal expects to get something from the gods in return for nothing i nodded you and your brother seem to have made quite a business of showing the local sights to visitors people want to know what happened here on the appian way indeed they do but how did you know that the two of us are brother and sister did felix tell you i had referred to the priest as her brother in a religious sense not suspecting they were actually kin it was a family business then attending to the shrines and profiting from the tourists on this stretch of the appian way there seemed to be a bit of sibling rivalry as well i suppose my brother also told you that i used to be a temple prostitute in the service of isis in my younger days felicia said not waiting for an answer she raised her chin adding even more height to her tall narrow figure yes its true i was a temple prostitute but today i serve only fauna the good goddess she seemed quite proud of both facts fascinating i said and did you happen to be on duty here that day the day of the battle oh yes and did you see what happened oh yes it seemed to me that she kept her eyes unnaturally wide open as people do when fighting off sleep or trying to frighten small children she pointed towards bovillae milos party came up the hill from bovillae such a lot of them i raised an eyebrow all hairdressers and cosmeticians from what ive heard not at all well yes there did seem to be a number of bath and bedchamber slaves you should have heard the way they squealed when the fighting began but there were plenty of armed men as well in front behind all up and down the sides like a little army marching off to battle where was milo near the front of the procession in a carriage with his wife did they stop here at the shrine no fausta cornelia never stopped here really i would assume that sullas daughter a woman of such high standing must play a leading role in the cult of the good goddess in rome perhaps but i find that most of the women who stopat this shrine are from smaller towns and more humble circumstances many of the women from the city seem to consider themselves a bit above stopping at such a humble place to pay their respects to the goddess they had rather attend to her in more lavish surroundings i suppose that hardly seems pious of them i make no judgment her smile never wavered her eyes never narrowed but you wanted to know about the skirmish well it began right there directly in front of the shrine i was sitting on the steps warming myself in a bit of sunshine i saw the whole thing what hour was this about the ninth hour so far every witness had confirmed fulvias account and refuted milo who placed the skirmish two hours later youre certain yes theres a sundial in the glade behind the shrine id looked at it not long before how did me skirmish begin milo and his company were coming up the hill clodius and his men were coming down the hill clodius was out on the open road then he didnt suddenly appear out of the woods no he didnt lay an ambush not at all was he on horseback yes so were a couple of his companions the rest were on foot were there any womenor children with him no all grown men how many about twenty or twentyfive armed they looked like a group of trained fighters if thats what you mean you seem to be more curious about such details than most of the travellers ive talked to do i i studied the empty stretch of road so when the two parties met did they simply begin fighting no it wasnt like that did they exchange insults no not at fust quite the opposite in fact as soon as the two parties caught sight of each other everyone fell silent they all stiffened a bit i could see the reaction as it moved through the two groups like twin ripples from the meeting point necks stiff jaws clenched eyes set straight ahead posturing the way men do around each other there was a bit of confusion as they passed the road is wide but both parties had to draw in and stretch out a bit to make room clodiuss men became more spread out than milos there was some jostling even so and some grumbling there was a tension in the air that set my teeth on edge how can i explain it like raking your fingernails across a slate tile i remember gasping suddenly and realizing that id been holding my breath watching and waiting for something dreadful to happen while the two groups were still passing each other clodius and his friends on horseback drew away from the road just in front of where i was sitting letting their men go ahead of them milo and his wife proceeded up the hill in their carriage getting farther and farther away finally the last of milos party and the last of clodiuss party passed one another right in front of me clodius tugged at his reins and fell in behind his men i drew a breath of relief i whispered a prayer to the good goddess thankful that nothing had happened after all but clodius couldnt leave well enough alone some demon must have poked at him he looked back and shouted something over his shoulder at the two gladiators at the rear of milos train two gladiators yes acting as a rearguard i suppose theyre famous or so my brother says eudamus and birria yes those two and what did clodius say to them she blinked if i were still a temple prostitute and not an attendant of the good goddess i would quote his exact words a modest approximation then it was something like why so glumlooking birria hasnt eudamus been letting you clean his sword often enough i see then what happened the one called birria spun around lightning quick like snapping your fingers and threw his spear at clodius it happened so fast that id never have seen it if i hadnt been looking straight at him clodius was still looking back laughing at his own joke the spear struck him very hard where she reached up to her shoulder here i think i barely saw it strike the spear flew faster than i could follow it and struck so hard it knocked clodius clear off his horse then there was a moment of total confusion men shouting taming about bumping into each other i got up from the steps and ran into the shrine but i kept watching as best i could from the shadows it all happened very quickly id never seen a battle before i suppose all battles must look like that a bunch of men running around swinging their weapons at each other shouting at the top of their lungs it all looked rather ridiculous to tell you the truth and yet at the same time rather awesome the only thing i could think of was when i was very young and i used to watch strangers copulating in the shadows of the temple of isis it was hard not to laugh but at the same time there was something frightening about it fascinating revolting and absurd all at once what happened to clodius someone pulled the spear from his shoulder and he managed to get to his feet some of milos men made a charge where was milo she thought for a moment nowhere to be seen at least not yet then from what you say the battle began spontaneously and without milos knowledge while he was away at the head of the entourage the parties met by chance and passed each other in silence without incident until clodius hurled a parting insult and birria hurled a spear back at him on an impulse felicia nodded agreement with the same imperturbable smile and the same glassy look in her eyes was that all there was to the incident still papa a citizen is responsible for his slaves behaviour eco reminded me milo might not have countenanced birrias crime but he was to some degree legally culpable and a man is also responsible for any raise tales he puts forwards i said thinking of the very different but no less vivid account of the same incident that milo had delivered at caeliuss contio so far everything felicia had told me agreed with fulvias version of the incident gleaned from the survivors among clodiuss party except that fulvia had omitted clodiuss parting insult without that detail birrias attack appeared entirely unprovoked perhaps even premeditated but the detail of the insult seemed genuine enough and it was hard to imagine that felicia was mistaken or lying it was understandable that fulvia might have omitted a fact that impugned her husbands memory her sources might have withheld it from her or perhaps might not have heard the insult themselves but milos elaborate tale of a coldblooded ambush appeared to be a complete fabrication how did the battle proceed badly for clodius and his men said felicia they were greatly outnumbered of course a few of them were killed right away a number of them ran off into the woods with milos men chasing after them one of clodiuss friends on horseback shouted that he would go for help and headed up the hill trying to gallop through milos ranks headed back to clodiuss villa i suppose did he make it through i dont know i didnt see and clodiuss other friend on horseback i think he must have been knocked off his horse because the next time i looked all of clodiuss men those who were still with him and standing were on foot the horses were gone which explains why clodius made his retreat on foot and why he headed down to bovillae for safety said eco milos men blocked the way back to his villa it was either retreat to the inn or make a stand in the road and clodius was already badly wounded i said your brother says he was stumbling and had to be helped yet he reached the inn well ahead of his pursuers how did he get such a head start i wonder milos men didnt chase after him right away said felicia they seemed uncertain whether or not to follow they looked like hounds running back and forth unable to pick up a scent until milo arrived and then milo was furious he stamped his feet shook his fists stood right in birrias face and screamed at him like some fool taunting a wild bear i cringed to see it but then milo calmed down and held a sort of council conferring with some of his men in a circle they seemed to come to a decision and milo dispatched birria and eudamus and a large party of men in the direction of bovillae the rest closed ranks around milo he drew his sword and kept peering into the woods i grew frightened myself some of clodiuss men had fled into the woods with milos men after them i worried that they might emerge in the glade behind the shrine or try to take refuge in the shrine itself so i stayed quiet and hid among the shadows no one noticed me when did senator tedius pass by i said that was the next thing that happened a fancy litter came down the hill with a little retinue i knew who it was because senator tediuss daughter often stops here at the shrine unlike fausta cornelia tedia is a very oldfashioned woman very pious very virtuous not proud or vain in the way that so many younger women of high birth are these days but she didnt come into the shrine that day when milos men stopped the litter she stayed inside tedius got out and talked to milo for a while from the way he gestured i assumed that milo was trying to persuade him to turn back but the senator is a stubborn man he insisted on proceeding got back into the litter and set off again down the hill towards bovillae more time passed i dont know how long milo paced and fretted fausta cornelia finally got out of the carriage and began to dog his steps they had some sort of argument but kept their voices low finally eudamus and birria came back bringing the prisoners with them prisoners i shook my head your brother mentioned them but who could they have been some of clodiuss men i shook my head i dont think so why not because i thought fulvia told me specifically that none of her husbands men had been missing felicia looked at me shrewdly or as shrewdly as anyone could with those glassy eyes and that unwavering smile you seem to know a lot already about what happened that day and you seem to have already told this story a number of times before she shrugged the appian way is a busy road even in these troubled times and people are naturally curious do you tell what you saw to anyone who happens to pass by so long as they donate something to the shrine ive never been one to withhold favours either in my old profession or my new one i looked at her and shook my head i found little to admire in her but i saw nothing to despise either when i considered the danger into which she had unwittingly even stupidly placed herself merely for the sake of taking in a few coins from strangers my blood ran cold felicia have you any idea of the risk youve taken im amazed that youre still alive you and your brother both her smile wavered her eyes flickered as if just beginning to focus what do you mean do you have no idea of the magnitude of what you saw that day you act as if it were merely a curiosity an amusing story to tell to travellers for profit but at this very moment up in rome a very powerful very ruthless man is struggling for his survival milo is telling everyone that he was ambushed by clodius that day she shrugged well i dont care what the man says i know what i saw and the things i told you if produced in a court of law could send milo into exile discredit his followers and cause enormous embarrassment to some of the most powerful men in rome men who havespies everywhere and assassins and whole stables full of fellows like eudamus and birria milos agents may have been here already snooping about if they managed to pass by you and your brother it can only be because the gods made them look the other way or have you already spoken to them as freely as youve spoken to me they may already know who you are and what youve been telling in that case only their incompetence can explain that fact that youre still alive to tell the tale to me or is it your lemur im speaking to her lips tightened her eyes narrowed after a moment she rallied and managed a semblance of her previous bland serenity but could not quite control the quaver in her voice i serve the good goddess do you think that will protect you that it will mean anything to such men any more than your brothers priesthood will mean something to them then you believe that you are in great danger or soon will be her smile at last faded and her eyes for the first time seemed to truly see me who are you a man who was glad to hear the truth and wishes you no harm she stared at me for a long moment what would you suggest that i do at the very least stop telling what you know to every traveller who passes by and tell your brother to do the same keep your mouths shut better than that id suggest that both of you take a lesson from the birds what fly south for the rest of the winter like the innkeepers widow i thought perhaps it wasnt grief that had sent her to rhegium but common sense fly south or else go to rome with your brother and seek the widow fulvias protection shell expect something in return especially if theres a trial and you could be placing your fortunes with a losing side but whatever you do leave this place but who would attend to the shrine how would i make a living i suspect you still have sufficient attributes to support yourself one way or another her smile flickered ill think about it in the meantime ill take your advice and say no more just as boldly as her brother she held out her empty palm when eco looked into his purse with a parsimonious frown i took the bag from him and pulled out one of the larger coins the sight of it in her hand prompted the return of her former glassyeyed state youre generous stranger with your advice and with your money use it for lodgings when you leave perhaps but youve paid for more than ive given i think shall i tell you something else something i havent told to every curious traveller passing by she saw my reaction and laughed i love that expression on a mans face so eager and attentive well then do you remember passing the house of the vestals on your way here from bovillae yes your brother pointed it out but you didnt stop to speak to any of the vestals no since you seem so anxious to know everything that happened that day it might profit you to speak to the virgo maxima ask her about the visitor who came to her after the battle ask about the offering that was made and refused cant you tell me the virgins of the goddess vesta do not tread on my authority and i do not tread on theirs ask the virgo maxima if you can manage to penetrate her haughtiness whatever you do dont let her know that i sent you whether she confides in you or not is her affair there now ive given you full value for your coin she began to walk back to the shrine felicia she turned back yes one last question i meant to ask your brother and forgot a name marc antony does it mean anything to you she shook her head turned away and resumed walking and felicia yes may the good goddess protect you from harm xviii following felicias advice we turned around and made our way back to the house of the vestals from the appian way a narrow winding lane led up to the forecourt and main entrance both the lane and the building were clearly of recent construction broken earth and tree stumps lined the lanes and the sharp edges and stained walls of the house were not yet softened by the wear of time it was a humble dwelling compared to the great house of the vestals in rome but hardly a hovel many a dweller on the palatine would have been proud to claim it or so it appeared from the outside it is not true as many people think that all men are forbidden at all times to enter any part of a sanctified building where vestals dwell i myself had once penetrated into the very sleeping cubicles of the house of the vestals in rome when i was called upon to investigate the scandal that led to the trials of catilina and crassus for desecrating the purity of certain of the vestals the penalty for such a crime is death for the man and for the vestal something far worse she is buried alive that incident was now twenty years in the past and the circumstances had been highly unusual but it occurred to me as i recalled it that clodius had been involved in that affair as well it had been one of his earliest escapades the general consensus finally held that clodius had tried to falsely incriminate the accused parties for his own obscure motives and the reaction against him had been so hostile that for a while he had dropped from sight early on clodius had set a pattern of attacking powerful men and revered institutions and had occasionally paid a price for his impudence i had no expectation of being allowed into the sleeping chambers of the house of the vestals on mount alba but if the rules of the dwelling followed those of the one in rome during daylight hours the foyer and perhaps one or two public rooms would be open to male visitors vestals are not entirely shut off from the world of men after all and must have practical means of meeting and dealing with the tradesmen who serve their needs and the state priests who oversee their activities still the wizened slave woman who answered the door peered at eco and me as if she had never seen a man before or so i thought until i realized that her squinting was due to her poor eyesight her hearing also seemed to be impaired i found myself repeating my request to see the virgo maxima in a louder and louder voice until at last a stout woman wearing the simple white woollen gown of a vestal appeared behind the slave and gently told her to move aside the vestal wore the traditional headdress of her order an oblong purplebordered scarf wound around her closecropped hair and secured with a metal clasp at her forehead her plain round face was untouched by cosmetics but her skin had the smooth creaminess of women who have spent their lives indoors and have never had to labour i judged her to be well into her sixties which meant that she had long ago completed her original thirtyyear term of service to the goddess and had voluntarily elected to stay on as a virgin for life youll have to excuse the slave she said shes a little deaf so i noticed except that she didnt seem to have any trouble understanding you even though her back was turned to you she only has difficulty hearing a lower range of tones mens voices she can understand most of the women here with no trouble her deafness is not a disability under this roof now you say you wish to see the virgo maxima what is your business its a matter of some delicacy i would rather speak of it only to the virgo maxima she gave me a brittle smile at odds with the softness of her face youll have to do better than that im afraid to begin with who are you and where do you come from my name is gordianus this is my son eco theres also a slave with us looking after our horses in the court we come from rome what business brought you here once again id rather speak of that only to you must understand gordianus of rome that there recently has been a great deal of violence and disruption in these parts men have been killed in broad daylight only a few steps from our door the local innkeeper was horribly murdered his young wife made a widow and the troubles of this house started well before the recent violence driven from our home forced to look on helplessly while sacred groves were desecrated i wont go into those marten except to say that at the best of times the women of this house are accustomed to being suspicious of men from the outside world if only for the sake of preserving their purity given our recent experiences we have even greater reason to be cautious and i must say just to look at you gordianus of rome i cant imagine what possible business you could have with the virgo maxima it is unusual to encounter a woman used to dealing with men strictly on her own terms the vestal clearly had no intention of admitting me to the virgo maximas presence without good cause and just as clearly she was not the sort to let slip any confidences behind her superiors back how then to gain her trust it was felicia who had pointed me here but she had also forbidden me to invoke her name there was another name i could invoke and though i was wary of revealing my commission from pompey even within these walls it began to seem the only way then the vestal spoke my name again under her breath gordianus she wrinkled her fleshy brow and gazed pensively into space gordianus of rome the name is unusual there are not a great many of us i suppose not and even fewer who would be about your age she eyed me carefully was it you who came to licinias assistance those many years ago if you mean am i the gordianus who assisted the virgo maxima in rome to get to the truth of a certain impropriety the answer is yes a certain impropriety i would call the discovery of a dead man in the sleeping chamber of a young vestal something more than that i didnt wish to mention the details myself good you are discreet and modest perhaps not a typical man at all how is it that you know of that incident the trials of catilina and crassus and the vestals were public knowledge of course but the dead body was kept secret not from me i know everything including the fact that it was clodius who arranged the murder in a vain attempt to implicate catilina that odious scoundrel was making trouble for us even then and getting away with it were you there at the time serving the goddess in rome no i have always served here at vestas temple on mount alba and yet you know the most intimate secrets of the mother house in rome the mother house she flared her nostrils the headquarters of your order i mean headquarters if you are implying that the house of the vestals in rome is somehow the superior of this house you are sorely mistaken even if you are gordianus the socalled finder the order of the vestal virgins was founded here on mount alba in the most ancient of days silvia the mother of romulus was a member of the local sisterhood and helped preserve the eternal flame in vestas temple the order in rome was not established until much later in the days of king numa and the eternal flame in the temple of vesta in rome was lit from the original flame here on mount alba oh yes rome takes preeminence nowadays great men leave their wills in the keeping of the roman vestals and the roman vestals have the honour of protecting the sacred relics that aeneas brought from troy but we of mount alba are the original sisterhood mother house indeed i meant no offence virgo maxima she looked at me shrewdly why do you call me that because you are the virgo maxima here are you not she tilted her head back and though she was too short to look down her nose at me she did her best of course lam she smiled faintly which is why i know certain secrets of the virgo maxima in rome and why i honour the name of gordianus the finder who once helped in secret to save the honour of the sisterhood not to mention the life of an innocent young vestal so you wished to speak with me in private come and bring your son we can talk in the room outside my chamber the door slave will act as chaperone if i pitch my voice low enough she wont hear a word that either of us says what struck me most about what little i saw of the interior ofthe house of the vestals that day was how shoddy the construction appeared to be from a distance the facade of brick and wood appeared to be at least sound if not distinguished but all the craftsmanship that had gone into the building had been put on the outside for show the foyer the hallway down which the virgo maxima led me and the anteroom where she allowed me an audience were all marked by a carelessness on the part of the carpenters that was painfully obvious corners met at the wrong angles with crude patchwork to make up the difference the floors were uneven and gobs of plaster seemed to have been laid on with all the skill of a bored child the virgo maxima followed my gaze and read my thoughts its nothing at all like our old house what a grand place that was so full of memories it wasnt the original house where silvia served of course not nearly that old but a very old house nonetheless full of history generations of vestals had lived and died there the place had a sacred character such as only accrues with time ah but how could the ancient sisters who chose the location of that house have known that one day long after they were dead along would come a fellow like clodius who couldnt be satisfied until hed got his greedy hands on the land and the house itself ive heard a bit about this from some of the local people i said everyone on mount alba knows what clodius did driving us from our home cutting down forests that had been sacred to jupiter since the beginning of time the shameful thing is that so many of the local people enthusiastically supported him not just rich and powerful men from rome who have country homes along the road but even some of the local farmers who serve in the municipal senates the religious objections meant nothing to them it was all a matter of politics and greed clodius handed out money and promises to the right people and in the end there was nothing we could do about it even our sisters in rome from the mother house as you call it were unable to help us or unwilling who knows what sort of influence clodiuss wife and motherinlaw exercise over the vestals in the city ah but im talking more than i should it fills me with such anger and shame to have a visitor see the situation in which we find ourselves clodius built this house for you as a replacement for the property he seized yes and after all his smooth words of reassurance i almost came to trust him we had no choice in the matter so why not look to the future with hope and try to be optimistic the old house is hardly livable in any more its felling down around your ears he told me full of character and charm to be sure but just an old dingy house if you look at it in the sunlight stains on the floors nicks in the walls creaky old stain think how much more comfortable youll be in a new house with everything dean and bright and all at my expense to make up for the inconvenience he didnt mention that the place would be built by slaves more used to shovelling dung than trowelling mortar and designed by an architect who wouldnt know a plinth from a portico this place is a disaster and our old house she sighed our old house for all its shabby quaintness was built of solid stone and had a roof that never leaked once in all the years since i became a vestal stained or not some of the floors had the most beautiful black and white mosaic tiles pictures and patterns that would take your breath awaynow i suppose theyre decorating the lavatories in that sprawling villa of his up on the hill i still cant imagine how he ever got the legal right to seize the property it all went back to documents from the time the appian way was built appius claudius caecus managed to obtain a great deal of property for himself and his family all along the road clodiuss villa or the core of it had been in his family for generations going back to the time the road was built because the old house of the vestals was within a certain distance of that property he was able to declare a special necessity when he decided to expand his villa and to make a claim on our house as well as parts of the grove of jupiter clodius was quite expert at producing documents out of thin air in the end he got his way legally and without violence and there was nothing we could do about it but there were hard feelings she gave me a withering look gordianus do not insult me with polite understatement and i will endeavour to treat you with the same courtesy but ive gone on about matters which are no doubt of more interest to myself than to you forgive me if i dont offer you food or wine it would not be proper for me to entertain two male visitors in such a fashion we shall also remain standing of course except for our chaperone she nodded to the old slave who sat on a backless chair in the comer you said you had some business with me gordianus yes thank you virgo maxima for favouring me let us deal with the matter quickly the briefer your stay under this roof the better im sure you understand ill be as forthright as i can i understand that a visitor came to this house shortly after clodius was killed down in bovillae she looked at me intently but did not answer i understand that this visitor made some sort of offering who told you this i have been asked not to say you keep a secret yet you think that i should reveal to you the business of this house virgo maxima i would never ask you to betray a confidence if what i ask is improper forgive me she regarded me for a long moment because you once helped the vestals in rome i shall tell you what you want to know yes a woman came here that day at what time very late in the afternoon shadows were gathering who was she i cant tell you that not because i wish to keep a secret from you but because i dont know the day was cold she wore a robe with a hood and kept her face hidden and as i say the daylight was failing but you heard her voice she spoke in a low husky voice hardly above a whisper as if she were concealing her voice as well as her face that thought occurred to me at the time what did she want she came bearing news she said there had been a battle between clodiuss men and milos men out on the road and that it had ended down in bovillae she told me that milo was unwounded but that clodius was dead so she merely came to give you this news no she gave me an offering a rather generous offering and requested that we make a prayer to vesta on her behalf a prayer yes a prayer of thanksgiving giving thanks that milo was safe that was not how she put it the virgo maxima lowered her eyes she asked for a prayer of thanksgiving that clodius was dead isnt that unusual giving thanks to the goddess for a mans death unusual but not entirely unheard of there are some deaths at which the gods themselves rejoice you accepted her offering yes you made the prayer of thanksgiving the goddess received it as warmly as any other prayer i tried to remember exactly what felicia had said to me ask her about the offering that was made and refused you say that she made a generous offering and that you accepted it of course i accepted it if the sisterhood here on mount alba were wealthy enough to wave aside offerings we should have paid to build a new house ourselves when clodius evicted us but wasnt there something she offered which you refused the virgo maxima eyed me warily if you already know so much why do you ask to find out what i dont know she considered for a long moment before she answered yes she offered something which i didnt take she offered it as proof that clodius was dead and also as payment for the prayer it was clodiuss gold signet ring taken from his dead finger the proof i accepted but the ring was hardly appropriate for payment i told her that coins would please the goddess more where is the ring now the woman still has it for all i know and now gordianus i think it is time only two more questions please virgo maxima very well the first milos wife fausta cornelia would you know her by sight or by the sound of her voice she smiled at so obvious a question perhaps perhaps not ive met many senators and magistrates wives at one time or another if you asked me to pick her out of a crowd i couldnt but i suspect she would look familiar would i recognize her if a hood hid her face and she spoke in a whisper almost certainly not and your last question for me gordianus can you tell me anything interesting about marc antony she laughed one question so transparent the other so peculiar have we moved on to a different subject entirely gordianus i have a reason for asking she shook her head marc antony the son of antonius who failed against the pirates yes off fighting gauls isnt he really i know nothing about the young man neither does anyone else apparently virgo maxima i thank you for your indulgence she regarded me kindly people should remember the past and past favours they should and would more often i imagine if they could spend less time fretting about the future xix a mystery woman said eco when we were back on our horses the virgo maxima no papa the woman who came to her with clodiuss ring not too mysterious from the look of things you think it was fausta cornelia who else rather vulgar of milo to send his wife off to the nearest religious establishment to brag about what hed done unless it was faustas idea which i suppose is more likely women of her social standing have a certain sense of how to mark the auspiciousness of an occasion she probably wanted to offer sincere thanks to vesta for looking after her household and incidentally to indulge in a little blasphemous gloating but why conceal her identity she never seems to bother about hiding anything else you mean her affairs i said it before the woman has a penchant for getting caught not the secretive sort by nature perhaps she hid her identity thinking to conceal her husbands role in the incident is that credible the next day the whole world would be talking about milos part ah but this was only shortly after the battle eco everything must have still seemed very much up in the air something awesome had occurred overwhelming yet also exhilarating clodius dead at last cause for jubilationbut also for fear how will the world react will there be some terrible retribution can the crime still be concealed discretion is advised but for something so extraordinary there must be an act of pious thanksgiving so while her husband regroups fausta slips away to the nearby house of the vestals she gloats over clodiuss death but in disguise where is the mystery i suppose youre right papa i only wonder where clodiuss ring ended up the decent thing would be to return it to his widow by an anonymous courier somehow i imagine it on a shelf with milos old wrestling trophies where he can take it down to fondle and gloat over whenever hes had a bit too much wine possession of the ring would make for a damning piece of evidence as would the virgo maximas tale if she could say that it was fausta who came to her but the ring is missing and all the virgo maxima can tell us with certainty is that an unknown woman came to the house of the vestals a mystery woman as you say i think fausta cornelia may be cleverer than her husband didnt we know that already she keeps fooling him over and over or making a fool of him anyway and here we are back at the shrine of the good goddess i dont see felicia about do you perhaps she took my advice and headed south already more likely shes gone home for the day the suns getting low papa what next id hoped to make it to clodiuss villa today but we probably dont have time i think weve accomplished quite a lot for one day papa we found out more than i expected to yes i think its time to find pompeys villa and come to rest the way to pompeys place was easy to find a pair of stone pylons chiselled with the letter m for magnus marked the turnoff a long winding road led up to the ridgetop it was not paved but was excellently graded and maintained and shaded by a canopy of towering oaks here and there statues of woodland beasts adorned the route or could be glimpsed in open meadows i had the feeling not so much of entering the woods as of passing through a park the villa itself was a long twostorey building that sprawled along the ridge the red tiles of its roof making it visible from a great distance amid the stony greygreen and umber winter landscape around it as we entered the forecourt a slave appeared almost at once to help us dismount and to take our horses another slave must have run to alert the foreman for even before davuss mount had disappeared into the stable the door of the main entrance opened and a tall sturdylooking man with greying hair and a look of authority stepped out to greet us when i produced the letter of commission which pompey had given me the man hardly glanced at it yes weve been expecting you he said how can that be the master sent a messenger a couple of days ago saying we should look for you but i met your master only last night the man gave me a wry look the master has a way of knowing what a man will do before the man himself knows your master was very confident of my cooperation i suppose he was said the foreman with a look that implied and why not these are your companions my son and my bodyguard no one else this is your entire party he peered at the road behind us i prefer to travel discreetly theres safety in numbers not always i said dunking of clodius ah well i prepared the villa for a larger party sighed the foreman evidently disappointed that his masters foresight had fallen down at details he clapped his hands well then your stay shall be all the more comfortable feel free to sleep in a different room every night and eat several meals a day the idea seems to please this one he raised an eyebrow at davus who returned a crooked smile as he reached back to rub his saddleweary rump in the city pompey was known for his lack of ostentation as a man who cared little for the gaudy ornaments of wealth but there was nothing spartan about his villa on mount alba perhaps like many politicians he maintained a stern sober guise in the city but allowed himself to put on a more festive and pleasureloving face in the seclusion of the countryside or perhaps the luxurious amenities to be found at every turn were put there solely for visitors such as myself many a rich man keeps his country villas not as private retreats but for the entertainment and lodging of others the bathing rooms in our wing were lit by skylights above and by a row of tiny windows at eye level through which i caught glimpses of the twilit sea on the far horizon we had risen high enough on the mountain to see the coast the walls and floors were decorated with ornately patterned tiles whose subtle greyblues and moss greens duplicated the colours of the distant darkening sea the three pools were kept at perfect temperatures for taking the cold warm and hot plunges i went through all three several times feeling my saddlesore body grow more and more relaxed as the natural light began to fade lamps were brought the reflection of their orange flames danced upon the water a wizened toothless old slave with remarkably strong hands gave us massages i insisted that davus be given a thorough massage as well considering that he was likely to be even staffer than myself the next day even the towels we were given were inordinately thick and luxurious no day could have had a sweeter ending our dinner was served in a heated room near the baths where the same furnaces which heated the water also sent warmed air through vents in the floor the quality and variety of the meal was remarkable especially a course of little pies filled with wild game and onions our sleeping chambers were located above the baths yet another clever way of making the most of the heat generated by the furnaces and the steam the furniture was mostly of eastern design and manufacture the goldpainted chairs with tasselled red pillows were a bit elaborate for my simple tastes as were the madly patterned hangings which covered the doorways pompey had spent many years in the east and had apparently developed an appreciation for the florid styles and delicate craftsmanship to be found in those lands he had conquered or pacified where such booty was his for the taking the bed was a beautiful thing carved from some dark exotic wood strewn with plump silk pillows and soft woollen blankets and covered with a gauzy canopy bethesda would have deemed it too fine to sleep on diana would have adored it though i had planned to stay up for a while to sort out with eco all that we had seen and learned that day and intended only to test the bed to see how soft or hard it was i must have fallen asleep only moments after putting my head on a pillow and closing my eyes when i next opened them the room was bright with the cold light of morning i rose sinking my toes into the plush wool rug stretched myself smiled at the surprising lack of soreness in my buttocks and legs drank from a ewer of cold spring water relieved myself into the pot by the bed pulled on my cloak and my shoes and finally stepped towards the light it streamed through shutters drawn over a wide doorway on the southern side of the room i pulled them back stepped onto the spacious balcony and stood astonished at the view of all the luxuries at pompeys villa surely this was the most unusual and offered the most enduring delight towards the west i was able to look down on the wooded hillside above the appian way catching glimpses of the wide ribbon of road below beyond the road were the foothills where shreds of mist still clung to treetops and beyond the foothills a wide expanse of open plains and farmland extended to the distant bluegreen sea above all was the deep blue bowl of the cloudless sky if the day remained clear the sunset from this vantage point would be extraordinary i turned and walked to the opposite side of the balcony with the morning light on my face and looked down onto a woodencircled lake hidden from the lower world its placid surface as smooth as polished silver reflected the forested cone of mount alba the sun had just risen from behind the mountain and for the moment seemed to be balanced on its highest peak what a view said eco joining me on the balcony when i gave a start he laughed relax papa if we arent safe in this house we arent safe anywhere what a view he repeated turning his head from side to side to take it in pompey seems to have a penchant for houses with a view just as fausta cornelia has a penchant for getting caught i took up the theme just as clodius had a penchant for making trouble and for acquiring real estate often both at the same time and as milo has a penchant for social climbing i went on and cicero for winning impossible cases every man acts out of his own nature and moves on a singular path towards his destiny whats your penchant papa trying to figure out the others not always a rewarding pursuit or a pleasant one eco sighed things could hardly get more pleasant than this yes men like pompey do know how to live i could get used to it best not to eco well be out of here as quickly as possible arent you missing menenia and little titus and titania he looked wistful menenia never served me a meal like the cook made last night or gave me a massage like that shrivelled old bath attendant men like pompey own all the best slaves speaking of which papa i had to rouse davus from his bed before i came here hes practically paralysed the more muscles a man has the more there are to ache did a wise old etruscan say that i doubt there was ever a wise old etruscan who didnt know how to ride a horse but davus is young and supple well see that he gets another good dose of riding today to work out the stiffness papa youve never been one to torture a slave consider it the revenge of the old on the young but its time to start moving first we eat shall we see what the cook has come up with this morning to help you stop missing menenia our bellies were warmed by freshly baked bread sprinkled with sesame seeds a porridge of oats and honey and a warmed compote of spiced apples davus joined us though the simple act of walking and sitting seemed to cause him considerable agony manifested by grunts and grimaces this did nothing to impair his appetite he consumed as much as eco and i combined i intended to take our horses and head out again on the appian way but when the foreman discovered our destination he suggested that we walk instead it seemed there was an ancient footpath that ran along the ridge that would take us directly to clodiuss villa its considerably shorter he explained and of course more discreet than being on the open road besides its much warmer today thanks to all this sunshine and the walk is quite beautiful it will take you through the grove the grove the sacred grove dedicated to jupiter or whats left of it yes i think i should like to see that come eco well davus it looks as if youre to be spared the agony of mounting a horse again at least for the moment his smile of gratitude turned into a wince as he rose to his feet as pompeys foreman had promised the walk offered splendid views especially on a day when the sky was cloudless and the visibility unlimited the mountain peak brooded above us and the plain shimmered below both equally remote the hidden lake showed nothing of itself only a perfect reflection of the sky the sea was too distant to be heard even as a whisper the taciturn woods as we passed into their shadow blocked off all sight of the rest of the world except for fleeting sunlit glimpses i found myself bemused by the shadedappled boulders strewn along the path by the rustle of last autumns leaves beneath our feet by the canopy of gnarled branches above i have always delighted in the beauty of the countryside even though my one attempt at living there on my farm in etruria had failed so utterly that chapter of my life like so many of those who participated in it belonged now to the dead past as the path continued to descend we came to a cleared place and the foundation ofa house the outline of the various rooms could be seen amid the scattered debris of stone and old wood there was little of any decorative value remaining except for a few fragments of mosaic floors that had been damaged in removal and left where they were there was also a marble statue of a female form its head missing that lay broken in pieces on the ground i was reminded with a shiver of the fallen bronze minerva in my own house this goddess i suspected had been knocked over by careless workmen rather than angry looters though the man to whom workers and looters alike had owed their allegiance was almost certainly the same living and dead clodius had left destruction in his wake i took time to wander through the ruins for a while tracing the demarcations of halls and cubicles where my presence would never have been allowed when the house stood trying to imagine the sounds smells and shadows of the place the virgo maxima had mourned for its rustic charm gone now forever i felt her presence in that place her brittle humour and forthright bitterness far more than i felt the presence of the goddess who no doubt had abandoned the desecrated place as surely as the missing head of her broken statue farther up the hill through the trees i could see the white columns and round roof of the circular temple of vestaher original temple as the virgo maxima had sternly reminded me even in daylight and at such a distance the flame that burned eternally within could be seen by the lurid glow it cast on the smooth inner curves of the surrounding columns the temple was unharmed and the land around it untouched even clodius had not been impious enough to disturb the sacred flame we returned to the path and moved on the character of the woods began to change in some subde way even my irreligious son sensed it and mentioned it before i did it may be as eco suggested that the trees outside a sacred grove having been felled and allowed to grow back many times over many generations establish a character somehow different from the trees within the sacred precinct which have never been brought down by any mortal and have never been scarred by any flame except fire sent from heaven by jupiter himself such sacred woods are different in many small ways the distance between the trees and the quality of the light that enters between them their relative ages the kind and amount of foliage at their feet however it may be after a time it was clear to us all even to citybound davus that we had entered a place that was special to the god all the more shocking then was the sudden devastation we encountered in the very heart of those woods we rounded a bend in the path ducked beneath a low branch and found ourselves in a clearing where only stumps remained it was not a small clearing but a whole hillside that had been denuded as if some rapacious devourer of trees had gorged itself at this place this must be what the priest felix was talking about i said they cut them down by tens and twenties he said but it looks even worse than that to me eco shook his head what sort of woodsmen would inflict such a scar on a sacred grove what sort of workers would carelessly knock over a statue of vesta and leave the broken pieces where they lay clodius was known to recruit many of his free labourers from among the hungry rabble in rome not a very skilled bunch i imagine but loyal and not very pious from the way they desecrated these holy places ah but these places werent holy once clodius was through with them im sure he attended to all the legal formalities to see that the house of the vestals and this section of the grove were duly desanctified before he plundered them surely a place either is holy or it isnt papa i had to smile at my sons sudden passion for things sacred eco you know better than that a place is sacred or not depending on the judgment of the proper authorities some of those authorities no doubt are very sensitive to the mysterious signs of the gods and as pious as men come others are not quite so pious and more likely to see auspices in the glitter of a coin than in a flash of lightning it is the roman way eco or at least it has been in my lifetime and one of the reasons i suppose that so many men of your generation tend to have so little religious sentiment we kept walking steadily as we spoke for i felt no desire to stop and contemplate the devastation we came at last to the end of the clearing the path took us into a dense stand of trees where for a brief moment the sacred nature of the grove seemed to reassert itself amid the hushed shadows but we had reached the farthest edge of the woods and after only a few more steps we found ourselves again in bright sunlight the band of woods we had just passed through had merely been left as a screen to hide the devastated hillside we had arrived at clodiuss alban villa the destination of the lumber from all those felled trees like his house in the city clodiuss villa still had an unfinished lookthe decorative stonework in some places was only partly done scaffolding clung to sections of the facade and the landscaping was interrupted here and there by piles of crushed stone and stacks of brick and lumber but the villa was built on such a massive scale that even in its roughhewn state it was impressive the grove of jupiter awed a man in one way a building such as this was awesome in its own right the hillside on which it was situated was so steep that i would have thought it unsuitable for building clodius had given the architect cyrus a difficult site on which to do his work and cyrus had responded with a building of daring innovation no doubt the structure was fixed intothe earth by some sort of stilts but any such supports were concealed behind solid walls viewed from the side the villa appeared to perch precariously on the hillside on the downhill side a long covered gallery ran the entire length of the topmost floor its seaward views must have rivalled those of pompeys villa it was surely no coincidence that there were no windows or other means of ingress on the lower floors which made the building practically impregnable to anyone approaching from below the long gallery would not only afford spectacular views but could be used to defend against attackers like the parapet of a fortress the entrance to the villa was located on the opposite side of the topmost floor which was the only part of the building visible from the eastern uphill side of the building a great mass of earth had been removed from the hillside to make a level courtyard in front of the entrance materials for constructing a wall were stacked around the courtyards perimeter but the wall had not yet been erected clodius and his architect must have realized the vulnerable nature of the villas entrance and had intended to do something about it neither of them would finish the job now we came to the entrance a double door made of solid oak ornately carved and darkened by age i wondered if it had come from the house of the vestals i rapped on it politely with my foot when there was no answer i rapped again i wonder what sort of reception we should expect said eco casting a wary eye at the nearby stable and the silent courtyard there was not a person or animal in sight where is everyone fulvia told me shes shut the villa for the time being you mean theres no one here a place as big as this can hardly have been abandoned entirely there must be some staff in residence no i took her to mean that shes cancelled construction closed the kitchen and shut off the visitors quarters im sure well find someone here i had no sooner spoken than the door to the stable opened and a boy stepped out carrying a heavy basket with both arms he saw us let out a scream and ran back into the stable dropping his burden behind him the basket tipped over spilling its contents i tried to make out whether it was millet or oats then a giant wasp buzzed by my head that was what it seemed like at least for a brief paralysing instant a sudden malicious whirring in front of my face so close it tickled my nose with the wind of its passing and left a sharp rushing sound in my ears then there was a thud of collision and the music of vibrating wood and the sight of a shuddering spear in front of my face impaled in the door xx which surprised me more the spear from an unknown quarter that barely missed my nose or the blinding speed with which davus reacted however stiffmuscled and slowwitted he might appear davus had the reflexes of a chasing hound he was across the courtyard and scrambling over a pile of bricks before i had time to blink even eco as quick and nimble as i was in my prime was left looking after him like a dazed runner left at the starting block davus reached the top of the brick pile and leaped openarmed into space an instant later there was a sound of two bodies colliding and a sharp exhalation that turned into a yelp of pain then davus called out master come quick i cant hold him eco raced across the courtyard i followed behind he went one way around the brick pile i went the other i heard another collision a grunt a spray of flying gravel i came upon davus on the far side of the pile just getting to his feet together we ran to find eco who stood clutching his middle the breath knocked out of him lying flat on his back in front of eco his eyelids flickering was a boy who could hardly have been more than ten years old i didnt touch him saideco catching his breath he ran straight into me almost knocked me down he fell back and must have hit his head the boy was dazed but not seriously hurt he gradually came to his senses and gave a start when he saw the three of us peering down at him his first reaction was an attempt to scramble to his feet rendered impossible by the fact that davus stood with a foot on each sleeve of the boys tunic pinning him down you neednt struggle young man said eco it doesnt look like youre going anywhere the boy stuck out his jaw and narrowed his eyes but his mask of defiance was all too easy to see through his chin quivered and his eyes shifted constantly from face to face we have no desire to hurt you i said in a gender tone than eco had used whats your name the boy squinted up at me from his point of view on the ground we must have looked like giants especially davus the squint was clearly for show another way of masking his fear his eyesight had to be perfect to have thrown a spear with such accuracy my name is mopsus he finally said his voice shook and your friend the boy in the stable the one who screamed when he saw us thats why you threw the spear wasnt it because he screamed and you thought he was in danger the boys squint relaxed a bit my little brother androcles ah your brother no wonder you were worried for him i looked towards the stable the door which was barely ajar gave a little jerk androcles must be quite worried for you right now but he neednt be as i said we have no desire to harm either of you then what are you here for his gruff voice rose to a squeak davus laughed the boy turned red with anger he thrashed helplessly on the ground which made davus laugh again tell this big elephant to get offme anger finally drove out fear and lent a surprising authority to his voice certainly as soon as youve answered a few questions why does no one come to the door where is everyone the boy shifted and wriggled straining against his confinement there was no way for him to escape from his longsleeved tunic as long as davus stood on the sleeves nor could he kick high enough to strike davus you really are stuck im afraid i said we could string him up papa perhaps start a fire under him roast him like a pig eco dont joke hell take you seriously something tells me this young fellow has seen awful things done to helpless men thats why hes so afraid of us am i right mopsus the boy said nothing but the look in his eyes answered for him my name is gordianus this is my son eco and that elephant as you call him is my bodyguard davus we come to this house in peace just the three of us we did nothing to your brother he saw us from the stable door screamed and ran back in mopsus wriggled in a paroxysm of disgust stupid androcles he always was a little screamer afraid of his shadow i am not squeaked a voice from the breach of the stable door androcles you fool get out of there run to the mill wake them up tell them mopsus bit his tongue davus and eco looked to me i put a finger to my lips i walked in a circle around the brick pile retracing my earlier steps to the courtyard then approached the stable door from a direction that couldnt be seen from the breach i yanked the door open thrust out my arm and put my hand gently but firmly on the shoulder of a little boy who looked up at me with eyes like moons dont be afraid androcles youre not a screamer like your brother says are you the child looked at me solemnly and shook his head i thought not here take my hand good now let us go and talk some sense into your silly older brother mopsus writhed in disgust androcles you idiot now theyve captured you too androcles looked up at me solemnly then at eco and davus in turn i think they may be all right mopsus not bad like the others the others probably sent them you stupid ass to ambush us and finish us off mopsuss voice squeaked out of control again making davus laugh the big elephant is funny androcles gazed up at davus with a look of awe you wont think its very funny when they flay us alive like they did to halicor said mopsus androcles shuddered at the idea but when i squeezed his hand he seemed reassured halicor was the tutor of young publius clodius wasnt he i said how would you know that unless they sent you mopsus practically spat the words having his little brother for an audience gave him the courage to keep up a pretence of toughness by they you mean the men who killed halicor who else milos men maybe milo himself sent you no the sternness in my voice silenced him look at me mopsus and you androcles i swear to you by the shade of my own father that milo did not send me here and i have not come on his behalf who did send you then said mopsus warily the day before i left rome i had a long talk with your mistress fulvia asked me to do some work for her it was true after all if not the entire truth i saw no need to complicate matters by mentioning the great one mopsus softened a bit the mistress sent you fulvia asked me to investigate a certain aspect of your late masters death im called the finder i have experience in such matters maybe he can find the men who killed halicor suggested androcles looking at his brother with wide eyes dont be ridiculous screamer we know who killed him we saw them do it with our own eyes did you indeed your mistress didnt tell me that only chat halicor had been killed along with the foreman and two other slaves she mentioned no witnesses thats because no one knows that we saw said mopsus until now litde androcles put his hands on his hips and looked accusingly at his older brother as if to ask which of them was the stupid screamer now i shall want to hear all about it i said but first i want to know what you meant when you told androcles to run to the mill and wake the others what others mopsus looked up at me biting his up and debating whether to cooperate i could almost see his thoughts at work his littde brother seemed to be in no harm and no real threats had been made against them his captors had disavowed any allegiance to milo and instead had invoked the name of his mistress in rome a lady probably as remote and exotic to such a boy as a goddess from olympus perhaps most importantly he was beginning to get very tired of being pinned to the ground let me up and ill tell you he said you wont run away because if you do davus will run after you i can hardly stop him hes like a dog without a leash and when he catches you hell never stop kughing androcles covered his mouth and giggled at the thought mopsus turned red i wont run just get the elephant off me davus step back davus did so but remained poised to chase after the boy his long muscular legs ready to spring he looked like one of those magnificent giant cats one sees at exotic animal shows in the arena except for his grin for such beasts never smile where had the crippling stiffness of the morning gone to ah to be that young again invulnerable like achilles mopsus got to his feet and dusted himself off he made a sour face at davus who showed the good sense to suppress his laughter what were you saying the others you mentioned down at the mill asleep probably like they usually are at this time of the morning after theyve been drinking the night before which they have been ever since they broke into the little house where the master stored his wine mopsus his little brother frowned at him and shook his head what do i care its only the truth its their job to guard the house our job to take care of the stable they should get into trouble then theres no one in the house at all i said no its all locked up after what happened the mistress called all the servants back to rome except for the men to guard the building and us to look after the animals added his brother tell her were doing our job i shall do that i promised but dont tell on the others said androcles suddenly very earnest not if it means theyll be punished he suddenly began to cry oh shut up said mopsus hes remembering what milos men did to halicor and the foreman thats not how the mistress would punish drunken guards stupid shed have them whipped a bit she wouldnt cut their limbs off how do you know the child sniffed because im not stupid like you androcles doesnt seem stupid to me said eco putting his hands on his hips hes not the one who threw a spear at three perfectly peaceable strangers how like him to take the underdogs side i thought was this how he kept peace between the twins at home but it occurred to me that the boys squabbling was also a way of skirting the ugly subject of halicor and his fate even as they kept bringing it up what exactly had they witnessed you were here on the day of the battle then you remember it well of course we were here tending the stable as always said mopsus it turned into a busy day what with the master and his men getting packed and ready to go what time of day was that when your master set out for rome in the afternoon what hour the boy shrugged closer to the ninth hour or later around the eleventh hour androcles tugged at my hand the ninth hour youre sure of that theres a sundial behind the stable after the master set out i went to look at it because i was hungry and i wondered how long until dinner and when your master set out did it seem that he had planned to leave at that time not at all said mopsus before his brother could answer ahead of him he was going to stay another day or two he left because the messenger came and what was the messengers news about the old architect cyrus he was dead and the mistress wanted the master back in rome you seem to know a lot about your masters business for a stableboy said eco who seemed determined to needle him ive got eyes and ears besides who do you think is the first person a messenger on horseback sees when he arrives at the villa me because im the one who takes his horse eco looked sceptical and this messenger felt compelled to share his news with you even before hed delivered it to clodius he said better get the horses ready for your master and his friends and i said why and he said because the mistress wants him back in rome and i said yes i think we understand said eco so your master received the message i said decided to head back to rome and rounded up his retinue but wasnt his son with him the boy publius clodius i suppose he must be about your age androcles of course publius was here said androcles with his tutor halicor halicor kept him busy most of the time but sometimes publius would slip away and come to find mopsus and me we told him we had work to do but he said as long as he was with us it was all right to go off with him so wed go to play in the woods or over at the ruins of the witches house witches i think he means the vestals eco that day after the messenger came did publius set out with his either no he stayed behind with halicor mopsus and i were glad because that meant hed be wanting to play with us and we wouldnt have to work so much and the foreman and halicor might get angry but so what because publius was always getting into trouble and then getting out of it again taking after his father said eco under his breath and as soon as the master and his men rode off publius came and found us in the stable we had a lot of work to do said mopsus cleaning up after they were gone quite a few of the men had slept in the stable and men make more of a mess than beasts but publius came and wanted to play mopsus told him we had work to do but publius said he was hiding from halicor and we had to help him hide so mopsus and i went to a corner and had a talk and we decided to show him the secret passage can you imagine even publius didnt know about it the masters own son a secret passage said eco i think these boys are telling us stories papa no its true insisted androcles yes its true said mopsus crossing his arms and sounding very adult were probably the only two people alive who know about it except publius now that both the master and cyrus are gone because they were the only ones who were supposed to know except of course for the slaves who did the actual building but who knows where they are now not even halicor or the foreman knew about it ill bet that even the mistress doesnt know his brother scoffed but i thought young mopsus might be right fulvia had said nothing of a secret passage to me nor had she mentioned these two boys she had only said that her son somehow managed to elude milos men when they came to the villa and terrorized the slaves possibly her son had been unformcorning with details and she had not wanted to press him or perhaps young publius was as good at keeping secrets as his father so you took publius off to the secret passage to hide from halicor i wish that you could show me of course if the house is locked oh but thats the wonderful thing about the secret passage said androcles you dont have to go into the house to use it you can enter the passage from outside the house come ill show you he took my hand his older brother looked dubious and shot a wary glance at eco but followed along persuaded by a newfound trust or else by his fear of being chased down and tackled again by a laughing davus androcles led us around the comer of the house and down the steep hill into the woods at the base of the house from a distance this side of the house appeared almost featureless except for the long portico along the top closer at hand i could see numerous openings set in rows not so much windows as apertures for ventilation and light set too high in the wall to be reached and too small for even a child to climb through the foundation was largely hidden by trees and dense thickets it was amid this growth that androcles showed us a path and at the paths end in what appeared at first sight to be a featureless wall was a hidden entrance a section between two upright posts appeared to be immovable but in fact was a sliding panel that could be opened just enough to allow a man to slip inside i have seen several examples of hidden doors in my life especially in my early travels but seldom had i seen one as well concealed most socalled secret entrances are not really hidden but are daunting because the means of opening them is secret this door was simple to open but would have been almost impossible to detect unless one knew of its existence the opening led to an ascending stairway and then through a very narrow dark hall that seemed to run through the very heart of the lower floors of the villa those subterranean sections which had been constructed in the excavated hillside the way was lit only by tiny openings which served as spyholes into the various rooms we passed the rooms themselves were mostly undecorated and empty except for a few crates and odd pieces of furniture some were pitch black some had not yet been properly finished by the carpenters like clodiuss house in the city the villa had been in a state of expansion at the time of its masters death full of the promise of his grandiose schemes for the future all these gloomy underground chamberswhat did clodius need them for said eco this was obviously to be more than a simple country villa i said more of a stronghold i imagine a place to store treasure stockpile weapons house a private army of gladiators or keep prisoners i hadnt thought of that yes its not hard to imagine these rooms as cells or torture chambers perhaps his city house has secret passageways in the walls as well it wouldnt surprise me more work for cyrus the architect we ascended more stairs which were lit by tiny openings with direct sunshine indicating that the stairwells were located at one end of the building we walked down more narrow corridors looked into more cavernous gloomy unfinished chambers at last there was a change in the pattern and we found ourselves in a labyrinthine passage that snaked this way and that we were somewhere in the upper older part of the villa now where the addition of a hidden passage between the existing walls had required the architect cyrus to exercise considerable ingenuity the rooms now revealed by the spyholes were adorned with opulent decorations and furnishings full of all the things that make a home except people to live there the rooms were silent and still even on a sunshiny day such as this with the first hint of an early spring in the air all the shutters were closed casting the whole house in a deepshadowed gloom at last mopsus gestured for us to stop here this is where we were when it happened who was here androcles and i and publius of course hiding from halicor publius thought it would be great fun to spy on the grownups he could hardly stop giggling whenever he looked through the hole the nearest spyhole was at eye level for a boy closer to waist high on a man so that i had to stoop to look through it the floor of the secret passage was substantially higher than that of the adjacent rooms so that i actually found myself looking down into the room beyond it appeared to be an office for transacting business and keeping records pigeonhole scroll cases lined one wall but were mostly empty their contents scattered on the floor along with various writing materials wax tablets styluses jars of ink and sheets of papyrus spattered and smeared with something that looked more like blood than ink the room reminded me of my own ransacked study so the three of you were here i said what did you see halicor and the foreman talking about publius said mopsus and not too nicely either added androcles what did they say alot of things said mopsus they talked about how impossible it was going to be to control publius especially with his father gone they argued the foreman said it was halicors fault for letting publius out of his sight halicor said that he was a tutor not a bodyguard and it wasnt his job to keep publius safe and that was what the master really cared about that sort of thing lots of yelling grownup talk and then in the deep shadows of the corridor i saw androcless eyes glitter with tears as he stepped behind his older brother holding on to him like a shield mopsus straightened his back and put on a hard face then there was yelling from somewhere else in the house i dont think halicor and the foreman heard it at first because they were yelling at each other then the door flew open so hard it banged against a shelf and knocked some things off men ran in they carried swords and there was already blood on the swords said androcles peering around his brothers shoulder mopsus wrinkled his brow and then milo came in how did you know it was milo because thats what halicor called him milo he shouted the name as if hades himself had come up through the floor i whispered to publius who is milo and he whispered back the worst man in the world except for cicero clodius was already teaching the boy to know his enemies observed eco i nodded and then what happened milo and his men swarmed into the room like bees they pushed halicor and the foreman against the wall and poked their swords at them milo was angry where is he he shouted where is publius clodius and the foreman said hes not here we dont know where he is but that just made milo angrieryou he said to halicor who are you and halicor said im just a tutor the boys tutor but the boy has run off hes hiding from me and milo shouted at him to shut up and knocked him down and kept yelling where is publius clodius and then they were stabbing the foreman and cutting off pieces of halicors fingers it was awful said androcles i thought i was going to throw up but my belly was empty i was glad when they dragged halicor and the foreman into the hall at least we couldnt see what they were doing but we could hear the screaming said mopsus we all covered our ears poor publius he could have spoken up yoiisee shouted out here i am maybe he could have saved halicor i shook my head if the men came for publius and found him theyd have had no reason to leave halicor alive what would they have done to publius said androcles taken for him for a hostage probably said eco grimly or else finished him as they finished his father two of the men were so big said mopsus shivering as he remembered even bigger than the elephant here they were the ones who did most of the cutting eco looked at me eudamus and birria never one without the other halicor screamed and screamed said mopsus i bet he would have told them where publius was if hed known but he didnt so they just kept cutting off pieces his little brother began to weep i put my arm around him we couldnt even run away or else they might have heard us said mopsus we just had to stay very still finally the screaming stopped mopsus shivered the three of us just stayed here afraid to even whisper every now and then i looked through the spyhole thinking that maybe halicor or the foreman would come back but they didnt androcles started whining saying he had to take a piss no i didnt it was publius who had to go whatever yes maybe it was publius but i told him he would be crazy to go outside because milo and his men were probably looking for him all over the place and then i think we all started to wonder about the master because how was it that milo had dared to come breaking into the house and why hadnt the master come back to stop him i think we all started to realize that something really terrible must have happened but i didnt want to say anything and neither did publius i guess because he was very quiet it was dark by that time and there didnt seem to be anyone in the house at all we got very hungry finally i sent androcles to sneak into the kitchen to get us some food because you were afraid to go yourself no because i had to stay and protect publius and finally androcles came back and said that some of the slaves were hiding in the stable and at least two of them had been killed besides halicor and the foreman and some of the bodyguards who left with the master that afternoon had come back and they were wounded because there had been a terrible battle with milo and they said that they didnt know where the master was but that hed been hurt and gone to bovillae but wasnt there any longer and all the men who had been with him were dead i think publius was very brave said androcles quietly he didnt even cry and he wouldnt eat anything he said mopsus and i could eat all the food id brought back so we spent the night hiding in the secret passageways even though it was awfully cold and dark and the next day the mistress sent some men from rome for publius and then later she shut down the house everyone left except for us and those lazy guards said androcles theyre probably awake by now theyll be wondering where we are let them wonder said his brother maybe theyll think the witches came and got us imagine if that happened and it was their fault sleeping when they should be keeping watch theyll be worried sick tell me i said do you know of any prisoners who were taken by milo prisoners said mopsus he shook his head not that we ever heard about milo killed quite a few of the masters men but everyone who wasnt killed came back sooner or later at least the men from this villa the cramped dark passageway had begun to close in around me i was ready to be outside again the boys led the way back through the winding corridors and down the stairways when we finally stepped through the hidden door and emerged into bright sunlight i heard distant voices calling out from up the hill mopsus androcles you see i told you theyd be worried said mopsus these socalled guards were they here the day that milo came i said no theyre all new all from the city they hate it here theyre always complaining saying theyre bored and there are no women about except the witches in the house down the hill and they wont have anything to do with men then ive no need to talk to them will you and your brother be all right they wont be angry at you afraid of that bunch of drunks and cowards said mopsus he had regained his former bravado ill tell them we heard a funny noise in the woods and went to take a look and theyll all go scurrying back to the mill very well then i have a request tell them nothing of our visit i certainly wouldnt tell them about the secret entrance exactly and when i get back to rome i shall make sure that your mistress knows what a clever and valuable pair of boys she has serving her here at her alban villa we left mopsus and androcles and returned up the hill skirting the courtyard in front of the villas entrance to avoid the guards as we made our way around a pile of stones and rubble i stubbed my toe against something and looked down in some surprise to see the face of a goddess staring back at me it was the marble head of vesta separated from the headless statue we had seen at the remains of the house of vestals her expression was warm and serene as befits the protector of the family hearth but as i looked at her more closely i could not help thinking that there was the faintest glimmer of malevolence in her lapis lazuli eyes and in the set of her mouth a hint of satisfaction at the way fate had dealt with the mortal who had treated her and her attendants so shabbily xxi we returned to pompeys villa the way we had come after a midday meal we mounted our horses to pay a call on senator sextus tedius the man who had found clodius and sent his body back to rome in his litter well davus i said it looks as though you shall get in some riding today after all this mornings walk worked out all the stiffness master davus smiled but when his bottom made contact with his horse i heard a stifled groan to reach the villa of senator tedius we passed through aricia where clodius had addressed the local magistrates on the day of his death though the town is larger and more hospitable than bovillae being the traditional first nights stop for many southbound travellers from rome a man could still pass through and hardly know he had been there pompeys foreman had given us directions to our destination which turned out to be a much more rustic and humble dwelling that those of clodius or the great one sextus tedius was clearly a man of wealth as the extent of the property surrounding his house testified but his dwelling was altogether lacking in ostentation it looked large enough to serve the purpose of a country villa with room for guests and gatherings but no statuary lined the road no mosaics decorated the porch no elaborate lamps hung above the door judging from his house i suspected that tediuss money was very old his taste in literature and art austere and his politics staunchly conservative pompeys foreman when he had given me directions had informed me that the senator had long been a supporter and admirer of the great one considering the personality suggested by his house and the fact that he was partial to pompey i decided that a candid and formal approach would be best when the doorkeeper inquired after my business i handed him my letter of commission from pompey and told him i wished to speak to his master after a short interval the slave summoned eco and me to the senators private study where the shutters had been thrown open to admit a view of the town of alicia below the view was sunlit but the air was bracing our host sat in an oldfashioned backless chair holding himself very upright for a man of his years the only concession to comfort was a blanket thrown across his lap to keep his legs warm his hair was white tinged with just enough yellow to suggest that he had once been blond his face and hands were darkened and leathery suggesting that he had spent much of his life outdoors and the lines around his mouth were deeply etched even so it occurred to me that he might still be a handsome man if he would only relax the severity of his countenance youre one of pompeys men he said my name is gordianus i come on the great ones behalf in this house we call my good neighbour the general by the name he was born with said tedius not harshly but firmly a mans greatness or his smallness for that matter is best left for posterity to determine while he lives a mans acts speak for themselves he looked at me shrewdly and allowed something like a smile to bend his lips but the man who sent you knows my sentiments well enough gnaeus pompey and i have often discussed such matters over a cup of wine in this very room he knows that i am a republican through and through and that i believe in the great institution of the senate not in great men if i did not believe that he was ultimately loyal to the senate himself i should be very disturbed by the way he elevates himself above the rest of us by the use of that name magnus tell me have you just come from rome we set out before daylight yesterday morning then you left before the senate was to meet at pompeys theatre i hoped to attend myself but my leg wont allow it he frowned at his left leg as if to communicate his disappointment with it i understand that a proposal to rebuild the senate house was to be put forth with the contract going to sullas boy faustus i believe that is correct i said remembering what pompey had told me and i hear there was also to be a proposal to issue the ultimate decree empowering pompey to raise troops to quell the disorder in the city perhaps as i said i left before dawn you have no news for me then yet you say that pompey sent you i come on behalf of pompey yes but not as a messenger i come to seek information not to convey it tedius raised an eyebrow i see the great one gnaeus pompey has commissioned me privately to discover everything i can about the death of publius clodius surely rome has talked of nothing else for days yes but talk and truth can be far apart pompey would know the truth does he intend to administer justice himself tedius still seemed intent on drawing information from me i think he wishes to see clearly no general can proceed through a landscape obscured by mist is it true that you and your daughter found clodius lying in the appian way who does not already know this i sent his body on to rome in my litter let me understand the sequence of events clearly when did you depart from this house the senator gazed at me for a long moment his face as unreadable as a leather mask i think he was unused to being questioned by anyone let alone a man so far beneath his rank but at last he spoke my daughter and i and our retinue left this house at about the ninth hour of the day i had planned to be in rome by nightfall when did you first realize that something was amiss on the appian way as we approached the shrine of the good goddess my daughter is a pious woman on the way to rome she customarily makes an offering at the shrine but we came upon a large entourage in great disarray with agitated slaves and bodyguards shouting and running about clearly there was something amiss as you put it i first realized that milo must be in the vicinity when i saw that wife of his fausta cornelia she was in a carriage by the side of the road with her cloak pulled tight about her her face was as white as the moon not due to cosmetics eitherand a cadre of slaves was fussing over her fanning her and cooing at her while i was watching she seemed suddenly to have had enough of them and began flailing at them the simpering slaves scattered like pigeons and milo i came upon him surrounded by some of his men all standing about with drawn swords some of the swords had blood on them i saw there were also a few bodies lying about i told my daughter to sit back draw the curtains on her side of the litter and not to show herself milos men raised their swords as my party approached but when i announced myself he called them to order are you a friend of milos senator tedius made an expression between a wince and a sneer the man has his uses i suppose i would hardly call him a friend what sort of man countenances such embarrassing conduct from his wife i dont care if she is the dictators daughter and i dont care for fellows who give themselves names which are more heroic than they are calling himself another milo of croton indeed i asked him what the trouble was he said he had been set upon by bandits bandits i suppose he wasnt prepared to say what had really happened and that was the first lie that popped into his head bandits had attacked him he said and some of his men had chased the brigands in the direction of bovillae he suggested that i turn back for my own safety how many bandits i asked oh a great many and all heavily armed he said but i suspected he was exaggerating and when he repeated his warning i told him not to be ridiculous that i had business in the city the next morning and i intended to press on then wait here with me he said until my men return and were sure the dangers over that seemed reasonable but then i saw fausta cornelia approaching with her entourage of slaves all fluttering around her like pigeons i didnot intend to spend even a moment in the company of that harlot i told milo that i felt perfectly safe under the protection of my own bodyguards i proceeded on my way down the hill towards bovillae yes i remember my daughter yes the detail has nothing to do with the incident please give me any detail that you remember sextus tedius tilted his head back and parted his lips he studied me for a long moment through narrowed eyes i could not read his expression at all very well he finally said my daughter suddenly realized that she had failed to make an offering to the good goddess tedia is very pious as i told you it seemed to her a bad omen to begin our journey without stopping at the shrine especially when we had been warned of danger she wanted to turn back but i was determined to press on i was curious i suppose i could tell that milo was lying about something but tedia was apprehensive when we passed the house of the vestals their new residence she pleaded with me to take refuge there until we were sure there was no danger my daughter is as pious towards vesta as she is towards the good goddess i told her i had no intention of hiding myself among virgins but that if she insisted i would leave her with the vestals and return for her presently once i saw that all was well in bovillae but tedia refused to be left behind she said that it was not her own safety which concerned her but mine tedia is my only child she is very loyal to me since i was determined to press on she remained with me in the litter as we came down into bovillae we passed a dead body lying by the road the corpse was very bloody with many wounds i forbade tedia to look at it but still she became frightened and urged me to turn back i paid no heed i called to the litter bearers to hurry on as we approached the inn i saw that a battle had taken place the front door and the window shutters were all broken and ajar and there were more dead men lying about i must admit that i began to feel a bit of trepidation and i whispered a prayer to mercury milo had spoken of bandits and now it appeared that these bandits had come down to bovillae ransacked the inn and murdered the customers where were milos men who supposedly had pursued these bandits had they all been killed or had they fled into the woods and where were the bandits i told the bearers to stop tedia assisted me from the litter we went among the fallen men hoping to find one of them alive and the first one we came to was publius clodius you recognized him at once the senator had not been expecting to find clodius i reasoned and the face of a dead man its features robbed of animation is not always easy to recognize how could i not know him said tedius if you had suffered through as many of the mans ranting speeches in the senate as i have he shook his head yet another fellow who gave himself a new name changing his proud patrician claudius to the plebeian clodius just to curry favour with the masses and actually enrolling himself among the plebeians giving up his patrician status his ancestors must have cursed him from hades how fitting that he should die on the road named for one of those whose name he mocked the senators jaw pulled into a frown he turned his gaze to the window and seemed lost in thought but you didnt leave him there in the road i prompted tedius sighed publius clodius was a menace to the state his death was a blessing to rome and an even greater blessing to this mountain which he had done so much to despoil and defile but he was a fellow senator after all a colleague and a claudian by blood no matter what spelling or legal fiction he affected and once a man is dead what use is there in despising him no it would not do to leave him in the road like a dead dog i sent his body on to rome in my litter instructing the bearers to deliver it with the greatest respect into the care of his wife but clodiuss alban villa was nearby why did you not have his body taken there it seemed more fitting to send him to the city and you and your daughter turned back i certainly had no intention of sitting in a litter beside a bloody corpse for three hours tedius snapped besides tedia was by that time quite distraught and i had begun to fear for our safety dont you see i believed that clodius and his fellows had been attacked by the same bandits of whom milo had spoken it seems silly now that i hadnt yet figured it out that it was milo and clodius whod had the battle but there you have it i took milo at his word that hed encountered bandits on the appian way and it appeared to me that the same bandits had also attacked clodius and his men at the inn in bovillae either before meeting milo or after clearly the road was not safe for myself or my daughter tedia and i and my bodyguards returned home on foot you walked all the way there were no horses to be had the stable in bovillae was locked and all the stable slaves had fled and me with my bad left leg that day seems to have ruined it for good he sighed and smoothed his hands over the blanket which covered his legs we made slow progress as you might imagine after a while we were overtaken by a troop of armed men coming up from the direction of bovillae led by milos famous gladiators eudamus and birria in the midst of them were five or six men with bound hands the same prisoners of whom felix and felicia had spoken i thought who were these bound men tedius raised an eyebrow that remains a bit of a puzzle doesnt it at the time i thought they must be the fictitious bandits of whom milo had spoken captured at last by his gladiators i even gave eudamus and birria a salute as they passed did you speak to them are such creatures able to speak to be candid i was too out of breath to converse and my leg had begun to ache i had stopped for a rest at a spot just below the house of the vestals after a while tedia and i pressed on by the time we got back to the shrine of the good goddess eudamus and birria had apparently rejoined milo and his entourage had moved on milo and the gladiators had gone on to clodiuss villa on the mountainside i thought where they proceeded to kill halicor and strangle the foreman and to search for young publius while the hapless boy watched and fausta tell me senator did you not pass milos wife on the road heading back towards bovillae on her way to the house of the vestals fausta no i didnt see her again that day and what business would that impious woman have had at the house of the vestals i doubt that she herself can remember a time when she was a virgin i saw no reason to mendon the virgo maximas visitor ecos mystery woman had fausta gone to the house of the vestals before tedius passed it on his way home no that was impossible since it was the triumphant eudamus and birria who would have brought clodiuss ring to fausta as a trophy and the gladiators had passed tedius while he took a rest below the house of the vestals if fausta had then gone back to the house to make her offering she would certainly have passed sextus tedius and what was i to make of the maddening detail of the unknown prisoners after all the different accounts i had heard of the clays events and all the details i had collected it seemed to me that not all the parts of the puzzle fitted together and that a vital piece must still be missing my thoughts were interrupted by a womans voice calling from the hall papa are you warm enough a moment later she appeared in the doorway at the sight of eco and me she stiffened and lowered her eyes papa i didnt realize two visitors from the city daughter explained sextus tedius they come from pompey its nothing that concerns you tedia was a tall stronglooking woman of middle years as plain and unadorned as the house in which she lived she wore no jewellery or makeup over her head she wore a white linen mantle tied at the back with a blue ribbon why had she never married she was hardly beautiful but among her class marriages are made for money and politics perhaps her father had never made the right alliances or perhaps because she was an only child and her father a widower it had been decided that she should stay with him as his caretaker the role of the dutiful daughter evidently suited her tedius had made much of her piety and her devotion to him i came to make sure you were comfortable father she said keeping her eyes averted i require nothing daughter run along then she left the room any other questions said tedius my legs begun to ache and i wish to be alone now i thought for a moment only one more question did you happen to see marc antony that day tedius raised an eyebrow young antony im not sure that i would know him if i saw him wouldnt he have been up in gaul with caesar ah no hes back in rome isnt he campaigning for something a quaestorship comes from a good family but far too radical for my tastes he wasnt with clodius that day was he antony used to be part of that circle of degenerates before he found his military career at any rate no i didnt see or hear of him that day now i trust that youll report back to the general that i gave you my full cooperation give gnaeus pompey my regards when you deliver your reconnaissance a slave showed us out in the foyer tedia suddenly joined us she looked as stern as her father but kept rubbing her hands together nervously you had no right to come here and pester my father your father agreed to see us i came on behalf of i know who sent you i overheard everything everything my father and i have no secrets from one another is your father aware of that fact my needling stiffened her resolve she stopped wringing her hand and made them into fists at her sides drawn up to her full height she was a formidable woman if pompey intends to call my father to rome to be a witness against milo its out of the question his health is far more delicate than he lets the world know his leg theres no talk of a trial and witnesses not yet anyway are you saying your father would refuse to appear at a trial im saying that you should leave us alone thats all we want you know the people in these parts to be left alone why you people from the city must continually come here making trouble your father looks like a man who can take care of himself do you judge everything by its appearance said tedia ushering us out the door and closing it behind us when we returned to pompeys villa that afternoon it seemed to me that our work in the vicinity of mount alba was done the essential truth of what had happened that day on the appian way appeared evident and though some questions remained unanswered those riddles could best be solved in rome if at all i suggested to eco that we head back to the city the next morning he disagreed but papa didnt you tell me you cant think straight in the city that your head is clearer here in the countryside lets stay on a while longer but bethesda and diana and menenia and the twins theyre all perfectly safe with pompey looking after them probably safer than they will be after we return and pompey takes back his guards we havent yet talked to anyone in aricia where clodius addressed the town senate or to anyone in lanuvium where milo was supposedly heading to install a priest pompeys a military man hell expect a very thorough report eco if i didnt know better id suspect that you want to stay here at pompeys villa for as long as you can simply to enjoy the food and the baths and the massages and the fabulous view papa dont forget the view eco well why shouldnt we take advantage of the great ones hospitality while we can you need some relaxation papa the turmoil of the city has tied you into knots and theres always the chance that if we keep digging for a while longer well uncover something completely unexpected so i allowed eco to persuade me to stay on for a few more days at pompeys alban villa the meals were sumptuous the baths steaming the beds luxurious the servants obsequious and the views of the hidden lake mirroring the stars at night of the peak of mount alba haloed by the rising sun of morning mist moving like smoke through the woods of the sun sinking like a blood red disk into the distant seaoffered unending fascination but in the end our time seemed ill spent for though we made numerous inquiries of numerous people making forays to alicia and lanuvium and back to bovillae we discovered nothing new about the circumstances of clodiuss death and nothing that contradicted or filled the gaps in what we had already learned i noticed in our trips up and down the appian way that felicia seemed to have abandoned her shrine and her brother felix his altar they had simply disappeared either they had taken my advice i thought or else i had given it too late i tired of the luxury of pompeys villa i grew impatient to return to rome i missed my family and worried about them i wanted to know what had become of pompeys plan to have the senate invoke the ultimate decree and to give him authority to restore order travellers and messengers brought news to mount alba but it was hard to trust their stories especially since they often contradicted one another had pompey been granted military control of italy and left the city to levy troops had elections at last been scheduled had there been more riots had formal charges of murder been lodged against milo i heard all these things which were credible enough but what was i to make of the tale that caesar had been seen in the forum thinly disguised or that milo had killed himself or that pompey had been assassinated by a group of radical senators at a meeting in his theatre i had complained that a man could not think in the city but after a while the confusion and ignorance in the countryside were even more maddening and so eco davus and i set out on a morning that was decidedly more springlike than wintry so mild in fact that we rode without our cloaks we should have arrived in the city not long after midday but a sudden gathering of thunderclouds opened over our heads forcing us to take refuge in the inn at bovillae until late in the afternoon we set out again as the day was waning shadows were long verging into twilight when we at last approached the outskirts of the city be careful passing the monument of basilius goes the commonplace warning we were not careful enough vigilance alone may not save a man but it may at least show him the faces of his adversaries that would have counted for much in the days that followed or it might have meant the end of me for good if i had got a better look at them as we passed the monument i noticed a few dozing drunkards slouched against the wall broadbrimmed hats pulled down to cover their eyes by the turn of his head i saw that eco took note of them as well without a word we both dismissed them as harmless but they must have been waiting to spring there must have been a scout on the road alerting them that we were corning they may have been watching and waiting for hours or days i heard a shuffle of footsteps behind us and then a cry from davus as i turned to look something heavy but soft like a club wrapped in padding struck the back of my head i lost my balance and clutched at the reins something gripped my leg and pulled i fell earth and sky changed places in the confusion i caught a glimpse of davus flying upward from his horse his arms outstretched and flailing as if he was climbing an invisible ladder in one hand he held his dagger he must have realized what was happening and had time to draw it before we were attacked but his horse had reared wildly out of his control if he had been a better horseman as i struck the hard stone surface of the appian way i heard eco call out papa where was he i rolled upright raising my hands to cover my face eco was still on his horse but several men in dark cloaks seemed to be clambering up him as if horse and man were a tower to be scaled from the corner of my eye i saw a dark shape approach i rolled away and collided with something warm and immovable it was davus flat on his back on the paving stones his eyes closed his face pale as still as death he still held his dagger clutched in his hand an image of belbos lifeless body flashed in my mind papa eco cried again then he made another muffled noise as if his mouth had been covered i reached for the dagger in davuss hand what enormous hands he had i pried at his fingers until the dagger slipped free i almost had it then darkness descended all at once as the sack was pulled over my head it swallowed my shoulders then my arms a rope slithered snakelike around my chest another rope bit into my ankles the inside of the sack tasted of onions and dirt i coughed and spat another coil of rope slipped around my throat and began to tighten what an end strangled to death inside a filthy sack on the appian way someone cursed youve got it around his neck you idiot the rope loosened then tightened again around my jaw working its way between my lips gagging me not too tight we dont want to strangle him why not say it was an accident say he died of fright save us a lot of trouble just shut up and follow orders how about the other one tied up tight good and the slave looks dead to me me too i heard the sound of a vicious kick then leave him we werent meant to take him anyway stronglooking fellow a good thing his horse threw him or wed have had our hands full enough talk bring out the wagon hooves clopped and wheels rumbled on the paving stones i was lifted aloft and dumped onto something firm but forgiving the voice that had ordered the others spoke close to my ear as for you its time to be very quiet and very still youre a sack full of onions do you understand lying in the bed of a wagon with a lot of other sacks full of onions youre going on a long trip so wriggle about and make yourself comfortable if you need to if you have to empty your bladder or your bowels go ahead and do it if you can stand to he in your own stink then dont move understand or else this something sharp poked into the small of my back i grunted the dagger poked me harder not even that much noise or next time ill push it in to the hilt now were off the driver called out an ass brayed the wagon began to roll the ruts and potholes of any lesser road would have caused it to jostle and pitch but on the smooth broad appian way the wagon hardly swayed at all i tried to lie very very still part three rex forty announced eco then he counted again wagging his finger at each scraped mark on the earth wall in turn moving his lips as he pronounced the numbers towards the end he counted aloud thirtyseven thirtyeight thirtynine forty forty days exactly perhaps youre assuming that it took them four days to bring us here i complained how can you know that it was all so miserable and confused they gave us almost no food or water and kept us blindfolded so that i never knew day from night it might have been three days or five or six might have been but wasnt said eco matteroffactly the trip from the monument of basilius to this place wherever in hades it is took four days how can you be so sure when im not they hit you on the head remember papa i think you were more dazed than you realized i was awake enough to know when we passed through rome we should have made a noise then and there and taken our chances chances papa weve been over this a thousand times we had no chance at all i had a dagger poking into me the whole time and so did you until we were through the city and well out the other side youre sure it was the fontinalis gate that we passed through certain i overheard yes i know you overheard someone asking directions to the street of the silversmiths and someone else telling them to go straight ahead and turn right exactly so at that moment we had to be passing through the fontinalis gate heading north out of town on the flaminian way past the field of mars i mused and the voting stalls they must be overgrown with weeds by now right past pompeys villa up on the pincian hill said eco ruefully maybe the great one himself looked down from his garden and thought i wonder where that wagon with all those lumpy sacks of onions is headed and when will i hear back from that finder fellow and his son if pompey has spared a thought for us at all if it wasnt pompey himself whos put us here i paced as much as i could in the cramped space of the pit and then on we rolled into the countryside heading north and west for a miserable eternity only it wasnt an eternity papa it was four days i clearly remember nonetheless i insist we draw brackets around those first four marks of yours since we cant be certain of them since you cant be certain if you draw those brackets again ill only rub them out again the two of us were playacting in a way since we had already engaged in this same argument a hundred times there was only so much to talk about stuck in a pit with bars across the top for forty days or was it closer to thirtyseven i sometimes wondered if we both had gone mad already how would we be able to tell i picked up the little stick that eco used to make his daily marks and etched brackets around the first three marks now if we count the marks remaining the undisputed number of days will be damned rats one of the creatures had sneaked into the cell again and was sniffing at the bit of bread we had put aside the previous day our keepers usually brought us fresh bread every morning but not always sometimes they skipped whole days so we had learned to save a portion of food for the lean days the rats were a new phenomenon and had appeared only in the last few days eco ran across the small cell and stamped his foot at the creature which squeaked and scurried away into a rocky crevice we hadnt managed to fill with dirt can you believe it papa the little monsters are coming out in broad daylight now not exactly broad daylight i rolled my eyes up looking beyond the iron bars overhead to the ceiling far above where gaps in the slats admitted a few beams of sunlight the pit had been dug in the earth floor of a disused building the irregular walls around us were made of packed earth and stones covering the pit and extending an unknown distance all around it for we had tried to dig at the edges without success was a grate made of iron bars if we jumped we could reach the bars this at least allowed us a way to exercise our arms every day i had been able to poke my head between the bars but there was little to see the building appeared to be a disused stable far above the grate was the ceiling which badly needed repair the place was dim and draughty but our keepers had given us plenty of smelly blankets to huddle under at night better the rats should come out in daylight than during the night i said ruefully nights in the pit were as black as pitch except for a few stars which occasionally glimmered through the holes in the ceiling in such utter darkness the scurrying and squeaking of the rats was almost more than i could stand the rats arent the only ones whore hungry said eco i know i hear your stomach growling son perhaps you should eat that crust of stale bread before the rats get to it i dont know what time do you think it is hard to say noon perhaps judging from the light maybe theyre not coming to feed us today maybe they wont come back at all i thought but didnt say it aloud though the same morbid thought must have occurred to eco from time to time abandoned entirely we would have a chance to try to dig our way out without being stopped but without food and water would our strength last that long we were at the mercy of men we never saw who had never revealed their intentions they looked after us in a desultory fashion feeding us on most days occasionally hauling up and emptying the bucket we used to relieve ourselves and supplying us with enough fresh water to drink and clean ourselves why had they not killed us and left us on the appian way as they had done with davus why had we been taken so far from rome or were we indeed such a great distance from the city perhaps the four days of travel which eco claimed to remember so clearly had been spent going in circles to confuse us why were they bothering to keep us alive at all and for how much longer would they do so what did they ultimately plan to do with us who were they forty days i said you know the story bethesda tells my voice caught in my throat saying her name aloud what had become of bethesda and diana in my absence after a certain point i had tried simply not to think about them for it was too unbearable and yet what else was there to think of that could offer me any comfort she tells that old hebrew tale she learned from her father about the virtuous man and the great flood he built a huge boat and loaded specimens of every creature on it and then it rained for forty days and nights without stopping imagine having to endure that forty days in a cramped boat stinking of every sort of animal sodden and seasick with the rain coming down at least he didnt have to go hungry said eco whose stomach growled he had all those animals he could eat i think the point was to save the animals i said anyway be glad its hardly rained at all during the one significant storm that had occurred since our captivity began rain had poured in through the leaky roof above and collected in a pool on the floor of the pit were very lucky that one of us hasnt become seriously ill not necessarily papa what do you mean if theyve kept us alive this long it must be because theyve been ordered to do so maybe if one of us fell ill theyd let us go or at least move us out of this horrible place i suppose they might oh this is maddening eco suddenly spun about and pounded his fist against the earth wall striking a spot already pummelled by many previous blows at least twice every day and sometimes in the middle of the night he would be seized by a sudden fury that could only be relieved by hitting something i envied the release this action gave him our captivity was indeed maddening and the hardest thing i had ever had to endure there is something in the spirit of a roman that cannot acquiesce to such an unnatural condition in other lands where kings rule imprisonment is a common punishment this is because a king wishes to see his enemies suffer what better way than to lock them in a cage or throw them into a pit where he can watch their inevitable physical and mental decline tell them about the suffering of their loved ones outside listen to their pleas for mercy and taunt them with falsepromises of release but in our republic punishment is not designed to bring pleasure to a given ruler it is meant to permanently remove an offender from the community either by killing him sometimes admittedly with rather gruesome punishments involved especially for religious crimes or by allowing him to choose exile instead of death the notion that anyone should be indefinitely locked away even for the most horrible crime is too cruel even for roman tastes i remembered the debate which took place in the senate when cicero was consul and announced he had uncovered a conspiracy by catilinas circle to bring down the state cicero wanted them executed on the spot others disagreed and it was caesar who had suggested that those involved be rounded up and placed under permanent arrest against this novel idea was the practical problem of where such alleged criminals were to be incarcerated since rome has no prison to speak of only a few small holding cells where malefactors are kept for a short while to await execution there was also the danger of establishing a precedent for lengthy imprisonment for once the state was allowed to take away a citizens freedom of movement where would such a course lead surely implicit in the very concept of citizenship was an individuals right to come and go as he wished unlike a slave if an individual had done something so terrible that he should no longer have the most basic right of a citizen then surely he deserved either exile or death in the end of course cicero had prevailed the alleged conspirators including marc antonys stepfather had been rounded up and strangled to death without a trial many disagreed later if not at the time and their anger harnessed by clodius eventually led to ciceros exile for sixteen months but even his worst enemies had never proposed that cicero should be put into a prison like a slavish courtier who had offended a monarch such repetitious circular meditations were my means of dealing with the madness of our situation they wore a groove into my mind just as surely as ecos fist had impressed its shape into the earth wall that held us prisoner eco stopped his pounding from the unseen world above we heard the familiar sound of a wide rickety door swing open and shut i smelled the aroma of fresh bread so faint i might have only imagined it ecos belly growled louder than ever and i began to salivate as dogs do when they know theyre about to be fed how ruthlessly imprisonment strips away a mans dignity how swiftly it reduces him to me status of an animal the next day was the fortyfirst of our captivity according to ecos reckoning i decided to calculate the exact date but the imposition of the leapmonth of intercalarius complicated the matter i knew that februarius was past we had been captured two days after the ides which in februarius fell on the thirteenth and i knew that all of intercalarius had come and gone so we were somewhere in early martius of course the leapmonth of intercalarius doesnt always have the same number of days i said its only inserted into the calendar every other year and even then not always and each time the priests adjust it according to however many days are needed to fill out the year properly eco frowned so how many days are in the leapmonth this year twentyseven i think eco shook his head dubiously that just doesnt sound right to me i thought intercalarius always had the same number of days as februarius no but besides this year februarius had only twentyfour days not twentyeight no this year januarius had twentynine days as always februarius had twentyfour intercalarius had twentyseven and martius will have the customary thirtyone eco this information has only been posted on scrolls in the forum every day since the new year began how can you not have seen it i never pay attention to such things papa i have enough garbage in my head already but how do you keep up with which days the senate is meeting and when the holidays fall and when the banks are open i ask menenia women always know these things they have an instinct for it they know which markets are open on which days and which are closed and when you have to buy extra food because theres to be a holiday and so on do you always ask menenia when you need to know the date yes say youre writing an important letter and you need to know the day of the month i ask menenia and she knows always doesnt bethesda always know the date now that you mention it try it next time you need to know ask her you mean instead of following the postings in the forum and making my own calculations just ask bethesda it cant be that simple when i think of all the hours and the days ive wasted over the years we both laughed i regrouped my thoughts so if this is indeed day fortyone how on earth do the priests calculate how many days to put into intercalarius anyway and why dont they leave februarius alone not how on earth eco but how in the heavens it all has to do with the movement of the stars and the phases of the moon and the length of the seasons and so on the years go round and round each pretty much like the last but not exactly some cycles have more days in them than others and theres no perfect system to account for the discrepancy so the calendar has to be adjusted every two years except when its not other people have other sorts of calendars you know just as other countries have kings which rome shall never have again unless it does be quiet the roman calendar is the most perfect yet devised it has twelve months except when it has thirteen as this year and all of these months have either thirtyone or twentynine days except for februarius which has twentyeight only this year according to you it has only twentyfour it works out in the end or does it i mean the calendar is so permanently out of joint now that sometimes the seasons dont match the traditional holidays yes and ive seen it get progressively worse in my lifetime i suppose it would be even worse without snipping away at februarius and inserting intercalarius as needed thats another thing papa as needed the priests always seem to decide to insert the leapmonth at the last moment cant they tell a year in advance whether theyll need it apparently not id say the roman calendar needs serious reforming its interesting that you say that your brother recently mentioned in a letter that caesar thinks the same thing its one of his pet projects when he has time in between slaughtering gauls and dictating his memoirs on horseback the general likes to fiddle with ways of fixing the calendar a new calendar for rome it would take a king to force a change like that he meant for me to laugh but i frowned instead you shouldnt talk that way eco you shouldnt even joke about it sorry papa anyway i said if caesar can fix the calendar surely you and i can at least figure out what day this is without menenia and bethesda to tell us entirely on our own now if its been i sucked in a breath as i heard the familiar rattle of the door swing open and shut in the room above i let out a low moan and slumped down against the wall bowing my head and clutching my stomach the hatch in the grate creaked open a rope slithered and i knew that a basket of fresh bread was being lowered to us eco unhooked it and attached the empty basket from yesterday i moaned again trying to make it sound as if i were stifling the sound instead of forcing it a proud citizen does not like to show weakness to the slave of his enemy whats wrong with him asked a voice from above what do you care said eco i kept my head lowered resisting an urge to look up i could never make out much of our captors faces anyway due to the dim light and the distance they were nothing more than hulking silhouettes would you empty the bucket said eco again i emptied it just yesterday please the man made a grunt of disgust oh all right heres the rope eco attached the bucket there was a faint sloshing noise as the man pulled it up fist over fist as he walked away i heard him mumble whats this there was a pause and i imagined him squinting grinding his jaw wrinkling his nose as he studied the watery contents then he resumed his walk to the door and pulled it open from somewhere farther away i heard the ghost of a hushed conversation and then a distant splash as they emptied the contents a little later the man returned and lowered the bucket back into the pit is he all right he said i stifled a moan and pulled my hands from my stomach just go away said eco coldly footsteps departed the door opened and shut after a while i said to eco how do you think it went you seemed convincing to me i nodded we both looked towards the little mound of earth which covered the body of the rat eco had killed that morning whose blood we had copiously added to our own urine in the bucket do you think well be able to catch another rat as easily i said in broad daylight if we have to eco assured me xxiii i opened my eyes to pitch darkness the air was cold and clammy stale and foulsmelling where was i the pit of course now i remembered where every day was like the last where nothing ever changed except that something was different we were not alone i felt it sensed it how not with my eyes certainly was it a noise the sound of another breath besides ecos or a feint movement or a smell yes the smell of garlic sweated from pores exhaled on the breath another stench added to the miasma that settled in the pit at night pressed down by the dank evening air my head reeled from it who eats garlic gladiators they claim it gives them stamina lets them knock down an opponent with a single breath runs the tired joke i broke into a sweat despite the chill perspiration poured off my forehead in such a torrent that i had to wipe it away with my sleeve the filthy sleeve of a tunic worn for fortyodd days in a row i could hear them breathing now even above the sudden booming of my heart who or what was in the pit with us surely no one could have entered through the grille above without waking us the hatch was too small for a man to pass through for that there was a trapdoor which was locked with a heavy chain the chain would have clanged and clattered the hinge of the trapdoor never used once since eco and i passed through it would have squealed and groaned i suddenly had a horrible intuition of how the intruders had entered and where they had come from deep in the earth a flame leaped up and a red glow illuminated the jagged fissure that had opened in the side of the pit the earth itself had gaped up the glow showed the two of them in silhouette huge hulking monstrous looming larger as they lumbered closer they must have come straight from hades eco stirred and woke papa what i touched his lips for silence but the two intruders had already seen us i saw them clearly as well for the fiery glow had seeped into every corner of the pit it glinted off the bloodencrusted swords they carried it lit up their hideous faces what do men look like who have killed hundreds of men without regret who take pleasure in cruelty who feed from the savage pleasure of extinguishing the lives of others such men look like eudamus and birria of course the two of them stood over us looking almost comic the way they leered and smirked and flared their nostrils what a despicable fate i thought that these should be the last two faces i should ever see this side of hades or no dont even think it but why not hope until the last possible moment seize hope wrap your arms tight around it strangle it the gods have been amused by your small life for fiftyodd years why should they give up on you now think among your fellow mortals who knows any more which ones are friends and which ones are foes maybejust maybe eudamus and birria are here not to slaughter you but to save you yes to rescue you from this wretched place gordianus you have no weapons but you still have your dignity stand up dont cower like a victim stiffen your spine you are a roman citizen they are another mans slaves give them the barest nod of acknowledgment try not to look at their swords show no fear look them in the eye stare them down never mind that they tower over you and the stench of garlic withers you like a leaf in autumn never mind that glint of metal you glimpse from the comer of your eye as they swing their swords aloft dont flinch what is it like to be beheaded you shake like a leaf you try to stop and yet you shake and shake and shake until i opened my eyes to the soft light that passed for morning in the pit eco leaned over me looking concerned gently shaking me papa are you all right what first you seemed to be having a horrible nightmare then you seemed to relax then you let out such a horrible noise that i had to wake you a dream just another bad dream the one about eudamus and birria yes i tried to swallow my mouth was as dry as parchment do we have any water left from yesterday a little here he dipped his cupped hand into the bucket and put it to my lips i sucked it up greedily sometimes i wish the dream would come true for better or worse if only someone would come to put an end to this misery one way or another hush papa youll feel better after youve got up and stretched a bit so began by ecos calculation our fortysecond day of captivity the fifth day of the month of martius nine days before the ides in the year without consuls what do you think is happening in rome right now papa said eco with a wistful note in his voice i cleared my throat who knows we heard all sorts of wild rumours on mount alba before we were captured some made more sense than others i cant believe that milo would kill himself for instance hes too stubborn he may have caught himself in a trap that he cant get out oј like his namesake from croton but hell see it through to the end kicking and screaming of course anything may have happened by hercules fortytwo days is an eternity long enough for the hebrew god to flood the whole world said eco wryly and long enough for the roman state to be drowned in blood i suppose but if i had to place a wager id bet on order rather than chaos in the short run anyway we know that pompey intended to get the senates authority to raise troops to quell the lawlessness in the city id bet he got his way on that pompey at the head of an army is a pretty unstoppable force eco was sceptical good for conquering foreign troops in the field maybe but what about people throwing rocks in roman alleys i cant see the clodian rabble standing up to pompeys troops soldiers cant be everywhere at once litde riots and fires can pop up anywhere at any time yes there could still be disorder even with pompeys troops in charge but only on a minor scale the forum will be safe safe enough for elections i shook my head this business with milo and clodius will have to be dealt with first can you imagine if they held the elections and milo were to win its still possible i suppose but the inevitable result would be another round of riots and that would mean open warfare with pompeys troops in the streets i cant see the senate allowing that to happen then whos running the state do you think theyve appointed pompey dictator surely not with caesar up in gaul at the head of his own army caesar might feel he had no choice but to march on rome himself i quailed at the thought of meto being swept into civil war surely not it sounds unthinkable i know but who would ever have imagined that the senate house would be burned down in broad daylight i shook my head we had already had this conversation a score of times sometimes eco assumed the voice of reason sometimes i was the insidious doubter it was impossible not to speculate on what was happening in our absence just as it was impossible to know after a long pause eco said quietly that wasnt what i meant you know what do you mean when i said what do you think is happening in rome right now i didnt mean politics or elections or any of that i meant i knew what you meant i could tell from the tone of your voice why did you change the subject then dont you want to talk about it about home thinking about them makes me feel warm at first comforted but then something cold creeps in and makes a knot in my gut as cold and hard as ice i know papa im frightened for them too weve been gone so very long now they must think were dead can you imagine bethesda grieving i can hardly bear it i know what you mean i imagine menenia weeping and it tears my heart women grievingremember fulvia and clodia that night we saw clodiuss body he was really quite an awful fellow wasnt he papa i shrugged it all depends whom you ask he was ruthless to his enemies thats for sure he caused more than his share of suffering in this world but he also gave a great deal of hope and some real power to a great many people who had neither not to mention the guarantee of enough bread in their bellies to those people hes a hero but still a vain powermad greedy man you can see that just by looking at the houses he built i suppose and yet when he died his sister wept and fulvia do you remember the way she tried to show nothing when we were in the room but afterwards in front of that crowd the way she shrieked and wailed i thought it was an act at the time but nowi think she was truly suffering lost hopeless i think of menenia and bethesda grieving for us frightened of the future and i think of clodia and fulvia and i feel a great sadness for them all he wrinkled his brow and turned his eyes upward to the patches of sunlight that showed through the bars and the roof but were still not talking about the real worry are we were talking about them grieving for us what i really meant is what if something has happened to them yes i sighed it all comes back to pompey he promised he would see that they were kept safe while we were gone pompey is a man of his word but weve been gone far longer than he could have expected he probably thinks were dead too yes probably if he thinks about us at all and what if pompey isnt in control of the city what if hes been assassinated or what if something totally mad has happened a civil war with caesar and pompeys gone off to spain to rally his army there we have no way of knowing eco no way of knowing i put my face in my hands the stable door rattled and opened eco took a deep breath the basket for bread was raised and lowered along with a bucket of fresh water whats wrong with that one my father you mean why cant you say whats wrong with your father eco sounded genuinely angry i kept my head lowered and clutched myself despair was what i felt it was simple enough to feign distress all right whats wrong with your father hes not feeling well seems to be eating the same hes hardly eating at all then what happened to all the bread i brought yesterday did you eat it all yourself taking food from your sick fathers mouth i ate what i needed the rats took the rest of it last night if you have to know the man grunted so do you need the bucket emptied again today no are you sure just go away now if you dont mind i think youre only making my father feel worse why dont you let me empty it anyway get rid of the smell for you just go away eco bent over me much as he had bent over me when he woke me from my dream that morning there was a long pause then footsteps retreated and the door swung open and shut i strained to listen and thought i could hear a murmur of discussion outside the stable we had not been able to catch another rat that day after all the next day however fortune smiled on us and not on a certain especially plump especially curious and most important for us especially slow fellowinhabitant of the pit this was good since our keeper insisted on emptying the bucket that afternoon eco assured me that his face showed great displeasure at seeing so much blood amid the urine once again there was a discussion outside the stable the voices were raised noticeably louder than before and both carried a distinct tone of recrimination the keepers seldomseen companion came in and had a look at me himself where do you hurt he asked gruffly i grunted his belly you fool said eco managing to sound as if he were both angry and anxious and trying hard to show neither our keepers withdrew in silence but there was another heated discussion outside the door receding into the unseen unknown distance since well be getting out of here soon i began why not be madly optimistic it was the fortyfourth day of our captivity seven days before the ides of martius the fourth day of my feigned malady eco had again succeeded in capturing killing and bleeding a rat his craving for a bit of bread outweighed his better judgment to quote the solemn eulogy which eco delivered as we buried the creature in a corner out of sight and hopefully out of smell yes prompted eco since well soon be out of here i think we should try to figure out as best we can who had a reason to put us here perhaps well be able to find out from our keepers if all goes well either we will be running from our keepers or they will be running from us i doubt that there will be much conversation anyway going over the known facts of our dilemma will give us something to puzzle over for an hour or two again humour me unless you have an appointment to be somewhere at a certain time i thought not well then what did we discover on the appian way or more to the point what did we not discover thats a question fit to give aristotle a headache papa you might as well ask me to prove a negative youre right step by step then if we believe the account of the priestess felicia milo and clodius met on the appian way by accident there was no ambush the two parties passed without incident until they were nearly clear of each other clodius uttered a parting insult to birria birria on impulse turned and hurled his spear at clodius it was no more premeditated than a brawl in a tavern but its possible papa that birria intended to throw the spear all along on his masters orders perhaps birria hurled an insult at clodius first and felicia didnt hear it clodius responded and birria used that as a pretext to begin the attack it could have been premeditated or perhaps milo issued an order to birria on the spur of the moment when the two parties met milo had the superior force perhaps he saw his chance to kill clodius and seized it a good point eco at any rate weve seen no evidence whatsoever that clodius planned or instigated the skirmish in any way except by hurling an insult at birria the conflict probably occurred spontaneously or possibly at milos instigation what ensues clodiuss outnumbered men are quickly overwhelmed some are killed on the spot others flee into the woods the wounded clodius without his horse and cut off from his villa by milos entourage is assisted by some five or six of his men downhill towards bovillae he takes refuge at the inn where the innkeeper knows and likes him i rubbed my hands together to warm them the pit seemed especially dank that day milos men do not follow immediately felicia says they ran about like hounds whod lost a scent until milo came up he was furious at first especially at birria because birria had attacked clodius on his own or because he had failed to finish the job said eco i suspect the first once milo calmed down he held a sort of conference and only then did he dispatch eudamus and birria and several others to pursue clodius this seems highly significant to me had milo planned all along to assassinate clodius i think his men would have been prepared to pursue clodius at once and would have done so especially since he was wounded and moving slowly on foot why did they wait i think it must be that they needed instructions from their master who was completely taken aback by what had happened why did he upbraid birria because the gladiator had acted rashly and stupidly and without his consent true milo might have been mad at his men for failing to make a clean killing of clodius but i favour the idea that the incident was spontaneous and unplanned and that when clodius made off on foot no one was quite sure what to do next but they did eventually pursue him yes because milo made a decision to finish what his men had already started without his consent which was more dangerous to him clodius wounded or clodius dead wounded clodius could return to rome rally his forces bring legal proceedings against milo for attempted murder end milos bid for the consulship if clodius was dead milo would be liable for murder but at least clodiuss followers might be paralysed with confusion and clodius himself wouldnt be around to accuse him either way milo was facing the ruin of everything hed worked for thats another reason i cant believe that the incident was premeditated to have murdered clodius by poison or stealth would have been one thing but to have done so in such a clumsy fashion could only hurt milo in the end i wonder if he thought of his namesake milo of croton in the forest trying to split that giant log and getting his hands hopelessly trapped did he hear the howling of hungry wolves as he paced there on the appian way fretting over what to do next it should have been an occasion of triumph for milo the end of clodius once and for all within his grasp but i think it must have been a very miserable moment for him but he finally decided to send his men after clodius said eco once youve wounded a dangerous beast its always best to kill it no doubt its what milo of croton would have done so he dispatched his men then waited for news rather cowardly of him not to join the battle himself if you asked him i imagine hed say he hung back to stand guard over his wife and household eco snorted derisively then his face became shadowed i had said the words sarcastically but as soon as they were out of my mouth it was hard not to think of our own loved ones and how vulnerable they were without us anyway i said not too much later along comes senator tedius and his daughter in their litter with their own retinue of household slaves and bodyguards tedius and milo recognize one another milo tells an outright lie that he was set upon by bandits and advises tedius to turn back the stubborn old senator instead presses on despite some demurral on the part of his pious daughter meanwhile down in bovillae the battle is joined the innkeepers wife whose evidence we have secondhand from her sister actually sees eudamus and birria kill one of clodiuss men on their approach to the inn theres a terrific assault which destroys all the shutters and doors on the lower floor the innkeeper is killed along with clodiuss defenders clodius somehow ends up out in the road we presume that eudamus and birria take his gold ring as a trophy and to deliver proof of his death to their master and then for some reason eudamus and birria and their men vanish for when tedius arrives a little later the battle is over and the victors are gone tedius finds the inn a shambles he sees blood and bodies scattered all about including that of clodius the innkeepers wife emerges from hiding on the upper floor she looks out the window to see tedius and his daughter leaning over clodius she goes downstairs discovers her dead husband and loses her senses tedius despite his dislike of the man and his politics does the honourable thing and loads clodius into his litter then sends the body on to rome he still thinks all the killing is the work of bandits and decides to return to aricia on foot he turns about and trudges up the hill while he stops to rest close to the house of the vestals eudamus andbirria appear on the road and pass him returning to milo how was it that he didnt see them before eudamus and birria have prisoners felicia peering out from the shrine of the good goddess also sees these prisoners who are they not any of clodiuss men the ones who fled with clodius were all killed and fulvia told me that none of her husbands men were unaccounted for so where did eudamus and birria come from and who were their prisoners the gladiators return to milo and deliver clodiuss ring proof that hes dead milo then hands it over to fausta who proceeds down the road to make her offering at the house of the vestals but somehow sextus tedius never sees her and when tedius finishes his rest and moves on by the time he reaches the shrine of the good goddess milo and all his company are gone we know that milo and the gladiators headed for the villa where they killed the foreman and halicor the tutor when they werent able to find young publius clodius why was milo seeking the boy is he really so spiteful and bloodthirsty that he wanted to murder clodiuss son or did he intend to somehow use the boy as a hostage and how did he know that young publius was staying at the villa these are the questions then for which we have no answers i picked up ecos marking stick and for each question scraped a numeral in the wall one where were eudamus and birria when sextus tedius arrived at the inn two who were the prisoners eudamus and birria herded up the road three how did fausta return down the road to make her offering at the house of the vestals without passing sextus tedius four when milo forced his way into clodiuss villa he demanded of halicor and the foreman where is publius clodius but how did he know the boy was at the villa and what did he intend to do with him i stood back and studied the marks ii iii iv they elucidated nothing the longer i looked at them the more they began to appear to be only an assemblage of upright and slanted lines signifying nothing not even the numbers in my head they were random lines etched by an idiot for one brief shuddering instant i thought i must truly have gone mad the captivity the darkness the stench the nightmares and the rats all coalesced like a black fog around my head nothing made sense nothing was real the whole drama of the murder on the appian way was only an elaborate fantasy i had contrived to amuse myself a madmans epic milo and clodius were figments of my imagination nothing existed but the pit papa are you all right what your hands shaking you dropped the stick eco stooped and retrieved it for me his voice returned me to the moment i clutched the stick in my hand more firmly than i needed to i reached out and slowly scraped another numeral into the wall keeping my hand and my voice as steady as i could and now the more immediate questions which surely must be related in some way to the first four five who waylaid us upon our return to rome we can be sure i think that they were not common kidnappers looking for a ransom theyd have wanted me to write something on a scrap of parchment to prove i was alive and theyd have figured out by now that theres no ransom to be had wed already be dead the numerals on the wall began to lose their meaning again and i looked away at the dank mound where eco had buried the newest rat that morning unless were dead already of course theyre not common kidnappers eco said pretending not to hear my muttering they acted for someone who didnt like what we were up to on the appian way more precisely someone who was afraid of the information we might be bringing back to rome therefore six to whom did we make ourselves dangerous with our investigation on the appian way but isnt it obvious papa milo of course we know he lied outrageously at caeliuss contio with that tale about an ambush and we know how to prove it its as you said to felicia when you advised her to fly south milo is in a desperate situation willing to commit desperate acts which leads us to the final question i scraped the numeral vii into the wall why were we kidnapped not killed if milo or whoever merely wanted to dispose of us why did his henchmen not murder us and steal our valuables to make the incident look like another robbery by nameless bandits by the monument of basilius if he wanted to ascertain what we had uncovered first why were we not questioned and then killed why did milo not finish us off as he finished off clodius does he have some future use for us i cant imagine what it makes me wonder whether it was milo who put us here after all who else the only other person you kept asking questions about was marc antony i said the stable door rattled open perhaps this is the day well find out whispered eco i dropped to the floor of the pit hugging myself the inspection of the bloody urine proceeded like a ritual with our keepers both of them had come in together peering into the bucket like augurs studying some poor chickens entrails your father doesnt look well said the one who usually stayed outside what have you just figured that out eco sounded outraged frightened frustrated there was a quaver in his voice some of this was acting but i could tell that the quaver came not from desperation but from its opposite a sudden exhilaration so acute it made him tremble like the plucked string of an instrument had the moment come at last yes i sensed it too a frightful wonderful rage welled up inside us both a joyous fury that had been suppressed for long days in the dark but finally finally at that very instant was ready to be released your father had better come with us said the one who usually stayed outside he bent to unlock the chain that held the trapdoor shut the two of them pulled up on the heavy iron door and let it drop back onto the grille with a clang the door of the cage was open i dont think he can stand ecos voice broke like a boys as he fussed over me acting helpless how in hades are we going to get him out complained our usual keeper get your father onto his feet somehow said the other thats it get him to raise his arms if he cant raise them himself raise them for him by hercules is the fellow still alive or not there now well each grab a forearm be careful leaning over you fool the greatest mistake a general can make as caesar and pompey would agree is to underestimate the strength of your enemy i had convinced them that i was weak in pain and very ill they took hold of my forearms to haul me up expecting a frail body that offered no resistance the instant before they heaved together i pulled downward with all my strength eco joined in jumping up to grab their arms above the elbows all could have been lost in that instant they could have kept their balance and pulled themselves free leaving me to fall onto my backside looking like an utter fool the door would have hurriedly clanged shut our keepers would have cursed us and then laughed at us and we would have been left alone in the pit once more to follow the same maddening thoughts in the same dogged circles to sleep amid rats to despair for our loved ones to lie in anguish and wonder how much longer we could bear it but that was not what happened first their heads collided with a loud knock the sound had a lower pitch than two stones struck together but higher than two hollow gourds it was one of the sweetest sounds i ever heard what followed happened very quickly one of them the one who usually stayed outside tumbled headfirst into the pit i fell upon him at once ecos marking stick was still in my hand in the past few days we had managed to sharpen it to a fine point by whetting it against some of the stones in the pit i stabbed him at least once before i realized there was no need the fall had broken his neck i turned and saw that i was alone with his lifeless body in the pit eco had already scrambled up and out i heard the sound of a struggle taking place in the stable above i put the makeshift dagger between my teeth tasting blood and leaped for the opening i grabbed one of the iron bars and pulled myself up we had practised this movement every day leaping and pulling ourselves up strengthening bur arms still i thought that pulling myself through the opening would be a greater challenge than it was instead i seemed almost to fly upward as if an unseen hand pushed me from below cold fury propelled me and the certain knowledge that fortune had turned in our direction eco and the keeper were rolling on the floor thrashing at each other eco was by far the smaller of the two but he was driven by the same fury that drove me and he was managing to hold his own i ran towards them raising the crude wooden dagger there was already a patch of blood on the mans forehead there was more blood and a loud scream when i brought the dagger down on his neck he escaped from ecos clutches and ran for the door blood spurting between the fingers that clutched his neck we followed him outside dazed by the full light of day i girded myself for more fighting but there was no one to be seen we were alone on a patch of weedy ground in front of a disused stable surrounded by trees and overgrown farmland the other one is still in the pit said eco he ran back inside lifted the trapdoor singlehanded and dropped it shut with a great clang ha see how you like that now youll tell us where we are and who you work for you son of a sow i followed eco inside still exhilarated but suddenly weary come eco wed better hurry who knows where the other one went or if he has more friends close by were not out of danger yet but papa eco the fellow is dead no eco peered down into the dim pit the man had landed in a convoluted heap that no living person could contrive still eco was unconvinced until a large rat went scurrying over the fellows head papa you lolled him no the fall broke his neck it happened in the blink of an eye too bad he should have suffered i shook my head unable to agree the fellow had never shown us any cruelty as many men would have given such power over others he had been our servant in fact bringing us food and disposing of our wastes our argument was not with him the fact that i was able to think so calmly was a dangerous sign the cold fury had begun to leak out of me the bloody stick in my hand revolted me the moment of escape towards which all had been building had come and passed if more adversaries were to arrive they would find me with my edge for violence blunted the truly dangerous part of our escape was just beginning xxiv we were alone and friendless in unknown territory we had no money we did have a days ration of bread the food that our keepers had brought for us that morning we were somewhere in the countryside that was unfortunate in a city we could have stolen what we needed new clothes to replace our filthy rags enough small coins to visit the local baths and a barber to make ourselves look respectableand then proceeded to ask questions of strangers and move about without attracting undue notice in a city we might have found someone we knew or who knew a mutual friend and so might agree to loan us money or arrange for our return to rome but the countryside was another matter walking on country roads we could not help but be conspicuous enemies searching for us would have a great advantage given our wretched appearance strangers might take us for runaway slaves despite our citizens rings it is easier to skulk through a crowded alley than across an empty field where were we from the surrounding hills and farms there was no way to tell i could determine directions by the sun but was rome north south east or west near or far there was no way to begin the journey home except to begin walking keeping out of sight as much as possible i tried to keep track of our route so that we could find our way back later but i was dazed and exhausted and every field looked the same we slept that night under the open sky we were cold and snuggled together for warmth and i woke before dawn with a gnawing in my belly andmy feet like ice but for the first night in many nights i did not dream of eudamus and birria and the sight of the open sky above when i opened my eyes was very sweet indeed we came upon a paved road that was clearly a major highway but which all roads lead to rome but only if you go in the right direction north or south i said eco scmtinized the road for a long moment south i agree do you think we might be like dogs and find our way home purely by instinct no he said bluntly he was beginning to feel hungry so was i we proceeded south avoiding other travellers as best we could when fortune smiles the fates may yet play a joke so goes the old etruscan aphorism stomachs growling feet aching we walked for hour after hour thinking that sooner or later the road must lead to some place where we could at least determine where we were we came to a region where the road traversed a series of low rolling hills so that we were able to see intermittently what was coming our way a considerable distance ahead we first saw the approaching entourage three hilltops away then two someone in their party had probably seen us first since there were so many of them and some of them had the higher vantage point of riding on horseback it would almost be more suspicious to attempt to hide beside the road than to simply pass by with heads lowered they could hardly be a search party since they were coming towards us and not from behind still we reached the next hilltop there they were cresting the hill just opposite us with a small valley between if any of them should question us i said to eco allow them no liberties we are citizens after all we have every right to be on this road wherever it is and papa and if they do speak first then we might as well ask how close the next town is and what its call papa what is it eco can you not see with your own eyes i stopped and stared at the approaching group of men they looked like serious travellers on serious business soberfaced and dusty from hard riding some were obviously bodyguards others by jupiter eco can it be eco nodded and raised his hand in a gesture of greeting after a final moment of disbelief i did the same even so the riders hardly glanced at us no doubt they took us for a pair of bearded derelicts it was tiro who gave a start muttered an exclamation of surprise and reached for his old masters sleeve the entourage came to a halt by all the gods cicero leaned forwards and peered at me as if i were some freakish curiosity being shown off in the arena can it be gordianus beneath all that hair and filth and eco youre alive both of you alive tiros voice caught in his throat he leaped from his mount and rushed to embrace us both weeping with joy cicero managed to restrain any such feelings and remained on his horse he caught our scent and made a face he stared at me and slowly shook his head gordianus you look frightful what on earth have you been up to your disappearance has been much talked about in rome said cicero that night as we dined in a private room at an inn outside the town of ariminum im surprised anyone noticed i was gone oh quite the contrary youre better known than you might think theres been no end of speculation even vendors in the fish markets talk about the inexplicable disappearance of the finder and his son so my slaves tell me anywayof course rome has been full of all sorts of strange happenings and curious rumours in the last month your vanishing was just one more but my family is well i had already asked this question more than once tiro patiently reassured me quite well just before we left rome i paid a visit to see if there was any news of you they were all in good health your wife and daughter your sons wife and children they were quite worried about the two of you of course eco shook his head we should be hurrying back to rome right now papa instead of sitting here stuffing our faces nonsense said cicero he gestured to a slave to refill my cup of watered wine and bring more food i think you have no idea just how wretched you both looked when i came upon you this afternoon fortunately the town of arirninum has good baths so we were able to get you decently washed and barbered and this inn has decent food so hopefully we can begin to fatten you up a bit as well youve almost begun to look like human beings again as for the idea that you should go riding breakneck back to rome i advise against it you need rest and recuperation good food country air and sunshine and above all the safety of travelling in an armed company oh no i insist that you stay with me at least until we reach ravenna tomorrow cicero had explained that he was on a journey to see julius caesar at the commanders winter headquarters in ravenna i had not yet discovered why he and tiro had left rome four days previously a bit of information which eco had seized upon with a good deal of gloating citing it as proof that his memory of a fourday journey at the beginning of our captivity was accurate indeed his reckoning of the days and my calculation of the date proved to be exactly right it was six days before the ides of march seventytwo days since the death of publius clodius we had been held prisoners for fortyfour days somewhere in the vicinity of ariminum where the northernmost spur of the flaminian way ends and the newer popillian way continues northward towards ravenna what else are they talking about in rome i said the vendors in the fish markets i mean i take that as a good sign that the markets are open yes things have calmed down considerably in rome since your misfortune the senate authorized pompey to raise troops to maintain order and theyve done a reasonably good job there have been some clashes between soldiers and civilians and a few minor incidents of arson but for the most part order has been restored and elections cicero winced dyspepsia or politics the question of elections became increasingly problematic untenable ultimately canyou imagine thirteen interrexes since lepidus and no elections thats over now only a few days before tiro and i left rome the senate voted to make pompey sole consul for the rest of the year his voice trailed away to a dry whisper he coughed and reached for his cup of wine the cancellation of the consular elections had to signify a great personal and political defeat for him what would become of his champion milo now would the electoral process ever return to normal cicero cleared his throat and went on there has been a great deal of wrangling and manoeuvring in the senate as you can imagine he made this comment without his usual relish cicero had made much of my wretched appearance but i began to see that he looked rather tired and drawn himself first the clodians tried to force milo to hand over his slaves for questioning milo forestalled them there eh tiro he made the slaves in question freedmen ahead of time so that even the senate couldnt round them up and torture them for evidence we countered with a demand that fulvia deliver clodiuss slaves for a bit of torture and interrogation she and her family didnt care very much for that idea cicero smiled wanly at this minor triumph since pompey became consul the clodians have been trying to force a special inquest into clodiuss death a show trial with milo being crucified like a slave is what theyd like something overblown and dramatic then theyll claim that milos offence was so spectacular that the senate had to pass a special law just to deal with it they proposed such an inquest and we countered by attaching additional legislation which specifically condemned the burning of the senate house and the attack on the house of the interrex lepidus that way all three incidents would have been condemned equally in the eyes of the law and all the malefactors would have been liable for equal penalties oh the clodians dont like the sound of that no no no they expect someone to be destroyed for the death of their precious leader but they think they can burn down half the forum and not pay for the crime well we shall see we shall see cicero threw back his head and narrowed his eyes it occurred to me that he had had too much to drink i had never ever before seen cicero inebriated he wrinkled his nose meanwhile pompey has his own ideas of how to straighten things out hes come up with a package of new laws these will speed up the courts and put down sedition he says pompeys idea of law and order is to make it easier to convict a man and to inflict harsher penalties on him never mind whether hes guilty or not some of his socalled reforms are positively ludicrous shorter trials he says thats the answer we cant afford the luxury of letting an orator take the time he needs to build an irrefutable argument no more of this nonsense of the prosecution and defence each taking a whole day to deliver their speeches instead the prosecution will be allowed two hours and the defence will be allowed three hours i suppose if an advocate is in the middle of a speech when the time runs out theyll clamp his jaw shut and witnesses witnesses will come first not last before the speeches instead of after that makes the witnesses the main focus of the trial and the speeches a mere addendum pompeys never been much of an orator himself he distrusts oratory so he wants to demote it dismiss it but to give such prominence to witnesses is pure folly anyone with sense knows that most witnesses are deluded or unreliable or bribed and no character witnesses pompey has forbidden character witnesses never mind that a man can arrange for half the senate to speak up for his good character such testimony is now irrelevant juries will now be drawn from a list of eligible names handpicked by pompey himself handpicked by a single man not even by two because we have only one consul and that one not even elected by the citizens tiro laid a restraining hand on his old masters elbow but cicero shook it off i know what im saying and im not drunk im just tired very tired travelling disagrees with me besides gordianus appreciates candour dont you gordianus ah but i forget youre one of pompeys men now arent you what do you mean one could hardly help but notice all those guards keeping watch at your house for the last month they do come from pompey dont they perhaps i said uneasy at ciceros scrutiny but for the most part glad to learn that pompey had kept his word it doesnt mean im pompeys man cicero stared into his cup and blinked gordianus i have never pretended to understand your desultory allegiances for all i know youre spying on pompey and not for him and somehow managed to talk him into guarding your family while you do it you were talking about pompeys reforms i said wanting to change the subject cicero laughed aloud how much wine had he drunk so i was you know my very favourite is the great ones brilliant new innovation for rooting out bribery if a mans convicted of bribery he can arrange for a pardon provided he can turn around and convict two other men of bribery soon everyone in rome will be standing in a circle pointing the finger of blame at the man next to him thats one way to keep everyone busy while the republic slips away from us its ludicrous it makes a mockery of the law but pompeys never understood the law never had any real respect for it any more than he respects oratory he respects institutions like the senate but only in some vague abstract sentimental way he has no regard for the law at all he doesnt see how beautiful it is how awesome how it circles and binds us all together like a golden thread he rips his way through it like a man getting rid of cobwebs he has the vulgar pragmatic mind of an autocrat cicero pressed his stomach and winced thank the gods that caelius is a tribune this year and has the power to veto any legislation that infringes on individual rights caelius has warned pompey that hell use his veto on the new laws do you know what pompey replied he said quite calmly do as you must but i shall do whatever is necessary to defend the state so typical why doesnt he just pull out a sword and brandish it in caeliuss face in the end therell be a compromise of course there always is we shall have to let pompey have his way or else hell complain that he doesnt have enough power to keep order and demand even more and where will that lead cicero made an elaborate shrug of disgust ah but gordianus youve hardly spoken at all about your travails youve hardly asked how awful for you kidnapped trundled off to some place far from rome kept in a pit who could have perpetrated such an atrocity i have wondered about that a great deal i had much time to consider it im sure you did and did you come to any conclusions did he look at me shrewdly or had his eyelids simply grown heavy from fatigue and too much drink not yet ah gordianus always the one to bide his time sift every shred of evidence seek for further revelations postpone the final judgment youd have made a terrible advocate you dont have the gift for making things up so you have no idea who kidnapped you or why we never properly saw our captors and they never gave us any clue about who employed them or why we were kept alive for that matter ah a mystery then but here you are free again at last and safe yes safe but of course it matters to me a great deal to know who treated my son and myself with such contempt were both alive and well amazingly well considering but it might easily have been otherwise if one of us had been wounded in the attack or fallen ill in that terrible place cicero nodded vaguely tiro shuddered but i will discover who was behind it i suppose the prudent course now would be to retrace our steps to find the stable where we were kept but i doubt we could find it again what do you think eco i think we were trying too hard not to be seen to memorize an unfamiliar landscape besides papa a disused stable on a derelict piece of farmland might belong to anyone finding the place wouldnt necessarily lead us to the men who captured us theyll be long gone we might make the search anyway i said we would need bodyguards of course i turned back to cicero who looked uneasy for an instant and then smiled blandly i would love to accommodate you of course gordianus but i really have no men to spare i probably havent enough protection as it is your example has illustrated all too well the lamentable danger of the roads in these dreadful days you might turn aside from your own journey for a day or two cicero join with us to search for that stable and the men who kept us impossible gordianus my own mission is too important and cannot wait tomorrow i press on to ravenna ah yes your mission cicero what is it youre seeking from julius caesar or is it a secret of state theres no secret its marcus caelius again such a busy tribune caesar wants to be able to run for consul next year but thats not possible so long as hes commanding his troops and cant come to the city so his supporters have fashioned a special exemption allowing caesar to run for consul in absentia it would set a bad precedent of course but if pompey can be made sole consul caesars supporters think its only fair that he should be able to run while hes still up in gaul it becomes an issue of preserving the peace i mean to say the balance between the great one and caesar but caelius has threatened to block the special exemption just as hes threatened to block pompeys reforms and your part cicero he shrugged certain parties have prevailed upon me to use my influence with caelius to dissuade him from baiting caesar caelius is willing to back down but both he and i would like to make sure we have a complete understanding of caesars goals and attitudes so im headed for ravenna to have a friendly discussion with caesar to clear the air so to speak wheels within wheels muttered eco better than one great wheel driving the whole engine of the world which is what some people would like to see said cicero but im pressed for time caesar will be leaving ravenna any day now heading back into the field there are rumours of a new uprising led by some gaul with a typically unpronounceable name what is it tiro vercingetorix said tiro crisply he was clearly not inebriated whatever agreed cicero so you see i have no time to go off looking for what did you call it eco a disused stable in a derelict field and neither should you gordianus dont tempt the fates youre safe in my company ill provide all your needs accompany me to ravenna tomorrow and then accompany me back to rome we should head back to rome at once said eco glumly for bethesda and menenia to suffer even one more day than they should not knowing whats become of us ah but dont you have a brother whos likely to be with caesar in ravenna said cicero yes your son gordianus the one called meto your family will have written to him about your disappearance im sure hell be as distraught as they are this is your chance to see him before he heads back north with caesar you see you must come with me to ravenna but now i think its time for everyone to retire you look weary gordianus and eco is yawning tonight youll have the best accommodations our host has to offer with a soft bed in a private room i arranged it for you myself i predict that you will sleep like stones and we did xxv caesars residence in ravenna was a large villa on the outskirts of the city with numerous tents stables and makeshift buildings set up around it like all military camps it resembled a small city where the needs of a vigorous mostly young male population with strong appetites could be accommodated on a daily basis one invariably encounters three things in such places the sight of prostitutes the constant smell of cooking and the sounds of the crudest language imaginable we arrived shortly after midday cicero and tiro went to seek an audience with caesar eco and i went in search of meto he was not hard to find a foot soldier pointed the way to a tent filled with young officers as we stepped inside there was a sudden hush which had nothing to do with us followed by a rattling noise then an outburst of raucous laughter and cursing they were playing dice the four dice being used were an oldfashioned set made of bones pointed at two ends with the numerals painted on the four flat sides a young man stepped out of the crowd and leaned forwards to scoop them up and i saw with a catch in my throat that it was meto since he had begun his career with caesar we had seen each other only a few times a year at most and never for long enough each time i saw my younger son i braced myself for an unpleasant surprise a limp a digit missing a fresh scar across his face to add to the faded one he received in his first battle so far he had kept himself intact if not unmarked each time i saw him i was struck anew by how young he still looked he was twentysix now very much a man by every measure with a few grey hairs at his temples already and a ruggedness to his features that comes from years of hot sun and cold wind but when he smiled as he scooped up the dice i could not help but see the child i had redeemed from slavery and adopted twenty years ago he had always been a goodnatured boy affectionate laughing mischievous but eventempered it was hard to imagine him killing strangers for a living meto became a soldier at the age of sixteen when he ran off to fight for catilina in the battle of pistoria he gained the scar across his face that he was still so proud of i had thought hoped that would be the end of a youthful folly but meto still sought the thing he had found with catilina he found it again in caesar and caesar fortunately had found meto discovering his talent for words and taking him into his private service as a sort of literary adjutant caesar the politician was always busy writing and publishing the memoirs of caesar the general and commanded his own private troop of wordsmiths in recent years meto had also found service as a translator having shown an aptitude for learning the gaulish dialects in addition to these sedentary pursuits he still saw plenty of battle and danger often at the side of the great general himself i could never stop worrying about him he had not yet seen us across the crowded tent as he rattled the four dice in a cup he narrowed his eyes and seemed to mutter an invocation to a god to a lover who were his gods these days who were his lovers we never talked of such things any more he gave the cup a final shake and let fly the dice a hush the rattle of bones then more laughter and curses meto himself was loudest of all raising his arms triumphantly in the air as he laughingly announced the venus throw one of each numberthe venus throw beats all pay up pay up the long sleeves of his tunic slid down his upraised arms and i noticed a new scar red and gnarled which cut across the biceps of his left arm it was ugly but seemed to cause him no awkwardness or pain he reached into his tunic for a little bag and opened it wide for the others to throw coins into then he saw eco and me i think i knew then how my own face must have looked on those occasions when i had been separated from him by great distances and had worried for him not knowing if he was alive or dead and then at last had seen him again often by surprise when he appeared in rome without announcement it was the look of a man whose eyes discern in an instant what his heart has spent long hours desiring doesnt your commander object to your gambling i said not as long as we wager only with coins that have his image on them meto laughed at his own joke roman coins do not bear the images of living men only dead ones not even caesar dared to mint a coin with his own portrait we had retired to a quieter place a tiny room in the villa that was crammed with scrolls parchments and maps there was barely room for the three of us this was the place where meto did much of his work for caesar reading and emending his latest volume of memoirs deciding on a consistent spelling of gaulish names was an ongoing crisis i gathered i asked him how he knew that eco and i had been missing diana sent a letter its a good thing you taught her to write you see though her syntax is atrocious you really should spend more time drilling her papa or else hire a decent tutor i could tell she was very upset her hand shook here ill show you he shuffled among a pile of documents and retrieved a slender folded wooden tablet i untied the ribbon that held it shut the letters etched into the wax coating on the inner surface were indeed uncertain and wavering brother we are in great worry and sadness here papa left on a journey of a few days and on the way back they were attacked and carried off him and eco there is maybe cause for hope there was a note give to the guard outside the door early this morning by a man who hid his face the note was addressed to mother but of course i had to read it for her it says do not fear for gordianus and his son they have not been harmed they will be returned to you in time but who knows who the note is from or whether to believe it it makes me more worried than before almost the city is not as wild as it was but still dangerous especially at night mother and me and menenia and titus and titania are all safe we have plenty of the great mans guards to keep us safe dont worry for us but i long for papa and eco to come home oh cybele let them come back soon i will write again when that happens or papa will write himself to you take care of yourself my brother i closed the letter my sisters grammar is poor papa but not so atrocious that you should be moved to tears said meto archly i cleared my throat i can hardly stand to think of them waiting for us worrying i arrived in ravenna only a couple of days ago from up north dianas letter was waiting for me you can imagine what a fright it gave me i petitioned caesar for leave at once to head home to try to sort things out i was planning to leave tomorrow and now here you are the gods seem to like our family dont they its because we have a family like none other said eco laughing one of everything like the venus throw i think we keep them amused well im glad they finally grew bored of watching you and me in that pit i said meto frowned in her letter diana mentions guards we have plenty of the great mans guards to keep us safe what is that about and where in hades have you been all this time so we told him the tale or most of it as briefly as we could the sun was fading before we finished i opened dianas letter and read it again more calmly who had sent the note addressed to bethesda advising her not to worry what a peculiar sort of kidnapping my wits still must have been dulled by our captivity for it was only as i reread the letter a third time that an equally obvious question occurred to me how had diana known that eco and i were attacked and abducted on our way home on the way back they were attacked and carried off she wrote who had seen it happen and who had told her about it meto found accommodations for us in the villa in a tiny room even smaller than his office it reminded me uneasily of the pit when it came time to sleep i tossed and turned for a while when eco began to snore i realized that i was so sick of being cooped up with him that i might strangle him so i gathered up a blanket and found meto who was still awake and talking with his tentmates he found a spare cot for me and i pulled it outside to a spot where i could fall asleep looking at the stars i wanted to gaze at them for hours and breathe in the clear cold air but i fell into a dreamless sleep almost at once the next morning meto took us to see caesar a guard escorted us to a courtyard inside the villa he and meto seemed to know each other quite well we sat on a bench to wait a few moments later cicero and tiro appeared formally attired in togas and escorted by the same guard i must warn you hes very busy today said the guard to cicero but ill do my best to make sure that you see him cicero and tiro sat on the bench across from us cicero looked rather peeved i thought did you not see caesar yesterday i said no we arrived in the afternoon of course when he was at his busiest you know how it is with these generals pompey is the same sometimes one has to wait days to see them youd think since im here to smooth the way for his next campaign for consul that hed see me at once but of course a man like caesar has much important business every hour is taken i nodded a few moments later the guard appeared cicero quickly stood and began straightening the folds of his toga the guard ignored him and nodded to us hell see you now as we walked past cicero i found it hard not to grin the look on his face was priceless meto had first introduced me to gaius julius caesar some years ago on subsequent occasions i never expected him to remember me but he always did caesars mind was like a fishermans net no fact or face once apprehended ever slipped away from him his study was a spacious room with tall windows thrown open to admit the morning light one wall was covered by an enormous map made of sheepskins stitched together and dyed in various colours to show the various tribes of the gauls with pictures to show their cities and strongholds what sort of place could lutetia be or alesia or cenabum which for some reason was circled in red was the island of britannia really as huge as the maps showed it to be meto had been to all these places even to britannia where the barbarians paint themselves blue he had learned the language of the bituriges and the helvetii whose very names i could hardly pronounce i had travelled much in the east but never in gaul meto had entered a world and an existence i could only wonder at and he had fallen into the orbit of a man whose force of personality i could only wonder at as well gaius julius caesar was unique among men i have never met anyone else whose intellectual and physical vigour were so keenly evident even in a glance or the exchange of a few brief words i had never had serious dealings with caesar as i had with crassus and catilina and now pompey but i could see that he abundantly possessed an element in his personality which they too possessed a drive for power and for what men call greatness but caesar seemed somehow accessible in a way the others were not he was not as frighteningly singleminded as crassus or as elusively seductive as catilina or as intimidating as pompey he seemed at once more than human and yet vulnerable a man who could both divinely inspire his men and make them feel protective of him he was quite human in his vanity at least he had begun to bald at an early age he was now in his late forties and according to meto was still selfconscious about his lack of hair he was dictating to a secretary as we entered but stood and opened his arms when he saw meto he gave him a warm embrace and kissed him on the lips so meto you shall not be deserting me after all i shall not be leaving for rome if thats what you mean my father and brother are safe and sound as you can see ah gordianus and caesar hesitated for only a heartbeat and eco the three of you look so little alike that always confuses me for a moment when i see you all together but of course the sons were chosen and adopted by their father and thus are like him in spirit not in flesh it was a false alarm then the rumour that they had been kidnapped not false at all said meto they made their escape only a few days ago and only a few miles from here that must be quite a tale you must tell me all about it caesar indicated that we should sit but you must be very busy general i said thinking of cicero waiting in the courtyard not particularly i shall be heading back to gaul in a few days but preparations proceed without me im filling the time by dictating a new chapter of my memoirs that little skirmish with the eburones last year you must remember it well meto he reached out to touch metos face meto returned his smile the moment seemed disconcertingly intimate until i realized that caesar had brushed his fingers against a very slight scar on metos cheek my father and brother were waylaid on the appian way said meto he was doing some work for pompey looking into the murder of publius clodius really now that is interesting what did you discover gordianus i looked at meto chagrined that he should bring my affairs so blatantly to caesars attention but i kept no secrets from meto and meto evidently kept no secrets from caesar i was merely able to confirm what everyone in rome already seemed to know that clodius was killed by milos slaves after an altercation on the appian way as simple as that i presume youll be giving pompey a somewhat more comprehensive report but ive made you uncomfortable gordianus i have no intention of interrogating you settling the matter of milos guilt and punishment falls to pompey not to me and quite properly so milo was his man after all until milo became ciceros man let pompey have the headache of disposing of milo and restoring order in the city i have a greater task ahead of me restoring order in gaul the chaos begun by the murder of publius clodius has reached even there remarkable isnt it the repercussions that can follow upon a single death please explain i said certain rebellious elements among the tribes hearing of the strife in rome concluded that i would be detained in ravenna indefinitely unable to rejoin my troops they seized the opportunity to instigate a revolt which has spread rapidly the first blow was struck at cenabumyou cansee it on the map there the man i personally appointed to run the roman trading post was murdered and his property plundered a young avernian named vercingetorix seems to think the time is right to make himself king of the gauls hes already managed to unite a great many tribes under him worst of all hes cut me off from the main body of my troops it poses something of a puzzle how i shall reach my men caesar studied the map and suddenly seemed very distant from us so you see a simple murder on the appian way has already had profound consequences far beyond the death of a single man publius clodius in death has caused even more havoc than he caused in life and milo has wielded his greatest influence on the course of the world as a killer instead of a consul caesar looked away from the map but you havent yet told me the story of your misfortune gordianus theres not much to tell we were waylaid in the vicinity of the monument of basilius by men whose faces we never properly saw bound inside sacks and transported to a place which turned out to be somewhere near ariminum we werent too badly treated when we made our escape one of our keepers was killed and the other escaped unfortunately i doubt that we could find the place again was there a request for ransom apparendy not though someone did send my wife an anonymous note saying that we would not be harmed and would eventually be released how curious do you think this episode was connected with your investigations for pompey perhaps caesar laughed youre a reticent fellow gordianus i respect a man whos able to say no more than he should thats rare its obvious you were never trained as an orator i should like to think i might call on you myself some day if i ever need a man of your talents and discretion that would be an honour caesar he smiled for a moment then gazed at the map again with an abstracted look the recounting of my misadventures had distracted him for a moment but now his attention had returned to the corcerning problems of gaul shall we leave you now caesar said meto i do need to return to my work now yes im glad to learn that you shall remain beside me meto especially in the days to come it was good to see you again gordianus and you too eco i wish you both a safe and uneventful journey back to rome and gordianus yes caesar when you report to gnaeus pompey say that you spoke to me and tell him if you would that i send him my warmest regards he was my soninlaw you know and still would be if ill fortune had not intervened he should have had a son from julia and i a grandson but the fates deemed otherwise and robbed us both ill do as you ask caesar the secretary called for the guard who came to escort us out the man paused shall i show the others in now caesar what others cicero and his man theyre waiting in the courtyard he insists that he has business of the greatest importance caesar pressed his fingers together and studied the map of gaul no not yet i shall finish dictating this chapter first perhaps after i take my midday meal i shall have time to receive marcus tullius cicero the guard escorted us down a hallway and back to the courtyard at our approach cicero rose to his feet before he could say a word the guard cut him off with a shake of his head cicero crossed his arms and sat down again he did not look at us as we passed by but instead pretended to find some grim fascination in the fountain in the centre of the courtyard i tried very hard not to smile xxvi we ate with meto in a large tent filled with soldiers under normal circumstances i would have judged the food barely passable and the company just tolerable after long days of captivity however and the deprivation of any variety in my tablemates the simple meal and the loud vulgar conversation made me feel that i was at a feast fit for king numa in the midst of the talk someone mentioned marc antony meto saw my reaction noticed the same reaction from eco and raised an eyebrow do you know him papa ah but thats right i introduced you to marc antony last year here in ravenna wasnt it yes hes looking very sleek said one of the men all that lolling about down in rome agrees with him i should think that rome is considered a hazardous posting these days said another he keeps himself fit doing daily drills at the widow fulvias house there was a round of suggestive grunts and laughter i turned to meto do i take it that antony is here in ravenna yes hes been in the camp for several days conferring with caesar about the situation in rome hes heading back tomorrow i think whats that look on your face papa oh nothing when this did not satisfy him i indicated that we should move outside where we could talk more discreetly well papa he said as the three of us strolled between the tents its probably nothing at all but when i told you yesterday about our investigations on the appian way i forgot to mention marc antony antony what possible connection he threatened clodiuss life last year on the field of mars chased him to a warehouse on the river where clodius hid in a cupboard under a stairway meto laughed oh that story you know it of course antony loves to tell it especially when hes a little drunk he claims he had no intention of killing clodius he just wanted to turn him into a eunuch what did they fight about who knows papa their relationship went back a very long way theyd been in love with the same woman fulvia they may have been in love with each other at some time or other for all i know they probably met on the field of mars exchanged a few friendly insults clodius said something that tugged a bit too hard on antonys balls and antony whipped out his sword but no one was hurt in the end eco groaned meto the puns meto smiled and shrugged i can keep it up all day but what has this to do with i had told meto the day before aboutmy commission from pompey but had not mentioned fulvia my meeting with her had come to seem incidental fulvia asked me to find out if antony was involved in her husbands death but hes one of the people working to bring milo to trial that proves nothing did you find any evidence to implicate him i considered this carefully no one who witnessed the event or the aftermath had anything at all to say about antony well there you have it perhaps really papa antony is a good soldier and a friend of mine i cant stand by and hear him called a murderer no one has called him a murderer meto but you seem to think he might be what had cicero said about me always the one to bide his time sift every shred of evidence seek for further revelations postpone the final judgment if fulvia were here with us now i couldnt in good conscience say that i had proved otherwise then lets go and ask him what well ask him as simple as that why not antony isnt exactly simple but hes as clear and plain to read as caesars latin come with me come with you where to antonys quarters theyre on the far side of the villa this way eco and i followed after him but meto this is mad what do you expect me to do say hello do you remember me metos father and by the way did you help murder publius clodius i imagine you can be more subtle than that papa and if he should decided to whip out his sword and give chase like he did with clodius on the field of mars you heard the fellows in the tent antonys got a bit plump attending all those dinner parties in rome maybe you can outrun him here we enter through this door as with caesar we had to apply to a guard before reaching the man himself my hope was that antony would be too busy to see us but at the sound of metos voice a head poked through the curtains to his office wearing a broad grin meto have you eaten yet ive swallowed my ration of swill for the day if thats what you mean join me anyway i managed to salvage a few edible things out of the pot who are your friends ah its your brother isnt it and your father the famous finder famous i said as we stepped through the curtains or infamous whatever come in sit manius find something else to do antony gestured to a secretary who promptly scooped up his tablet and stylus and left the room wine well that goes without saying i know how you take yours meto neat metos like me has a terrible allergy to water do you take yours watered gordianus and you eco more water than wine for me i said ive been away from wine for a while im having to get used to it again besides i added under my breath i may have to do some running soon and the same for me said eco raising an eyebrow physically antony had the potential to be mtimidating he had a wrestlers build with a muscular neck and shoulders and a broad barrel chest rather like a younger taller version of milo i thought he was only a few years older than meto probably thirty or thirtyone in profile his jutting brows and chin and his dented boxers nose gave him a rather brutish appearance but when he looked at me straight on this impression was melted away by the gentleness of his eyes and mouth and the fullness of his cheeks antony was handsome in a homely sort of way to use one of bethesdas phrases he had a sort of look that many women find irresistible and that many men trust instinctively as meto certainly seemed to do when did you arrive gordianus antony looked at me with an expression that hardly seemed that of a guileful killer or a kidnapper for that matter just yesterday oh he nodded then frowned dont tell me you came with cicero we arrived together yes but i only joined him on the last leg of the journey quite by chance thats good to hear then youre not a part of his little mission to caesar most definitely not papa and eco are here on their own business said meto really whats that said antony theyre here to investigate you meto this was really too much antony narrowed his eyes me this isnt related to that old business about king ptolemys daughter back in egypt is it i swear i never touched the child antony and meto both laughed at what was apparently an old joke no said meto its something to do with with a nasty rumour that someone started down in rome i said my son seems determined to make light of the situation but its deadly serious meto had controlled the conversation long enough since he insisted on forcing the matter i decided to make the best of it ill begin by telling you what i told caesar earlier today at the request of gnaeus pompey eco and i did a little snooping into the circumstances of the death of publius clodius outrageous as it may seem we encountered a rumour and i tell you this marc antony because youre my sons friend and i think you should know that such a thing was said about you we encountered a rumour that you were somehow involved ridiculous said antony who did not look amused i shrugged an outrageous rumour as i said im sure that no one of good sense would credit it for an instant but who would say such a thing about me antony was suddenly on his feet pacing across the small space what utter nonsense that i could have any hand at all in what happened to clodius theres no bottom to peoples vileness is there no lie so vicious that someone wont stoop to utter it cicero you heard this from cicero didnt you on the ride up no tell me the truth gordianus oh it sounds just like him telling a he so crazy that people begin to think there must be something to it ill tell you this is the last time and i mean the very last time that the old coot is going to take a piss on my head ill snatch him in the middle of his snivelling petition to caesar and throw him down a well ill twist his throat until his head snaps off hell never spread another he about me again at that moment antony looked quite capable of carrying out such threats marc antony i swear to you the rumour didnt come from cicero then where did you hear it whos saying these thing about me antonys anger was palpable and seemed to heat the whole room like a brazier but i sensed that none of his fury was directed at me it was because i was metos father i realized and therefore to be trusted and respected antony was not a simple man meto had said but clear and plain he had cause to be angry but was disciplined enough to hold his anger in check while he sought for the party that had truly offended against him it was a fish vendor wasnt it papa said eco suddenly what it was a fish vendor who told us about the rumour as i recall my elder son was not so clear and plain as antony ah was it i said by hercules you mean theyre spreading such a lie even in the marketplaces antony looked ready to smash something but refilled his wine cup instead yes i remember now i said but it was only one person who mentioned the idea to me no actually it was two people and it may be that they were simply confused because at the same time they brought up a story from last year about an altercation between yourself and publius clodius what that bit of silliness on the field of mars these people seemed to think you meant clodius actual harm if id caught him you know what i would have done id have used the flat of my sword to spank him that would have been humiliation enough what was his offence said meto the usual one not knowing when to keep his mouth shut nothing political something personal dredged up from the past antony hesitated since youve been so candid with me gordianus ill tell you clodius made a rude suggestion involving my friendship with gaius curio curio was off in asia serving as quaestor and his father had just died well its no secret how the elder curio did everything he could to come between gaius and me when we were young following ciceros advice i might add so there were we out on the field of mars and clodius said something like now that his old mans dead and out of the way i suppose you and gaius curio can finally get married which one of you will be the bride normally i might have laughed it off but he caught me on a day when i was in no mood for his needling so i pulled out my sword i suppose i looked angrier than i was its a problem i have and clodius simply panicked he shrieked and ran antony laughed at the memory and i chased after him i couldnt help myself antony clutched himself laughing if id caught him i swear id have pulled off his toga and spanked his bare bottom sent him back to the field of mars stark naked with his red cheeks glowing that would have shut him up can you imagine the mob would have deserted him hed have had to retire from public life but hed still be alive today the laughter caught in antonys throat he sighed and made a face that was hard to read he poured himself more wine drained his cup and looked at me steadily gordianus i swear to you by the shade of my father i had nothing to do with clodiuss death soi hope that youll go back and find whoever these rumour mongers were and set them straight i tried to return his gaze with one as steady its not often that i find myself the less honest of two parties in a conversation i intend to do that marc antony good such a rumour should be nipped in the bud before some scoundrel like cicero puts it to his own use oh mercury and minerva he slapped his forehead whats wrong said meto what if this awful rumour should reach all the way to fulvia since clodius died ive worked so hard to be strong for her to give her someone to lean on someone she can trust absolutely i couldnt stand it if anything should poison that but what am i saying fulvia would never believe such a rumour not for a moment she knows me better than that i shrugged and made a sympathetic smile that night we learned from tiro that after waiting in caesars courtyard all day cicero had once more failed to gain an audience with the general he would have to seek an audience again the next day and so would not be heading back to rome again until at least the day after that at the earliest to eco and me eager to return to our families this seemed an eternity but papa antonys leaving for rome early tomorrow morning said meto why dont you travel with him we could hardly presume it would be no imposition papa come ill ask him myself if you want stay where you are meto youve already put me on the spot with antony once today papa you need to go home and you need a safe escort you dont want to travel with cicero anyway do you hed drive you mad and hell travel slower go with antony he likes you couldnt you tell hell be glad to have your company and you can get to know him better and make up your mind about him if you havent already its so perfect the gods themselves must have arranged it what do you think eco i said i think i want to get back to rome as soon as possible and that caesar seems determined to keep cicero waiting as long as he can then if you really think antony would be amenable meto well ask him right now this i gathered was how things were done in caesars army having lived so long in devious rome i found it hard to get used to such forthrightness we departed for rome before dawn the journey lasted for four days and passed without incident antony seemed to be as transparent as meto had indicated he drank more than he should and when he drank he showed his emotions more plainly than most men i could imagine him killing out of pain or rage or professionally as a soldier but it was difficult to see him as a conspirator in some devious plot he was equally outspoken about those whom he hated cicero chiefly and those whom he loved curio fulvia caesar and his wife and cousin antonia in that order so far as i could tell his lack of charm was in itself charming just as his homeliness made him oddly handsome i became very relaxed in his company and began to see why meto was so fond of him on the last day we talked a little about his military service in egypt four years had passed since antony had helped the roman governor of syria to restore king ptolemy auletes to the throne that had been usurped by his daughter berenice i loved alexandria antony told me and the alexandrians loved me do you know the city oh yes i met my wife there i remembered something he had said back in ravenna antony what did you mean when you referred to that old business about king ptolemys daughter when was that jog my memory gordianus you said i swear i never touched the child it was some sort of joke you and meto both laughed anyway ah that wasnt about berenice i was referring to ptolemys other daughter and eco raised a suggestive eyebrow nothing happened she was only fourteen entirely too young for my tastes this rang true fulvia was older than antony oh some of my officers claimed i was moonstruck for the girl in a daze after id met her i still take some needling about it all nonsense though i have to admit she was quite impressive child or not remarkably beautiful i thought of my own diana only a few hours awaybeautiful no not at all plenty of women are beautiful and so are quite a few boys but not her beauty is common compared to what she possessed a certain quality i cant explain it she was unlike anyone else ive ever met except maybe caesar eco laughed a fourteenyearold girl reminded you of caesar it sounds absurd i know if shed been just a little older if this was four years ago i said shed be eighteen now the idea cast a strange look across antonys face dazed his officers had said moonstruck maybe some day i shall return to egypt to see whats become of her what do they call this unusual female antony smiled cleopatra xxvii we crossed the tiber as the light of day began to soften and approached the city the field of mars opened oh our right to our left the old city walls skirted hills covered with buildings the flaminian way ran straight ahead towards the capitoline hill with its temples clustered crownlike at the summit i had never been so glad to see a place in all my life outside the fontinalis gate we dismounted from our horses and took our leave of antony i hardly noticed the armed soldiers who flanked the gateway i had grown used to seeing soldiers at caesars camp and travelling with antony eco and i hurried through the narrow streets and cut across the forum not far from the charred ruined mass of the senate house were we saw more soldiers publicly bearing arms in the forum as if they were an occupying army rome had seen civil war and armed soldiers inside her gates but never had an army been used topolice the population by the consent of the senate people seemed to be going about their business in a normal manner but everything seemed strange to me we saw a crowd in front of the rostra gathered for what appeared to be a contio of some sort we made a wide detour to avoid it we slipped behind the temple of castor and pollux to reach the ramp which was guarded by yet more soldiers my heart was racing as we neared the top not from exertion but from excitement i crossed the street and rapped on the door of my house the door opened an ugly unfamiliar face peered out at me for an instant i was confused this was not my house my family didnt live here we were not even in rome or at least not in the rome i knew i felt as the lemures of the dead must feel when they walk the earth reduced to shadows and finding nothing as they remember it but it was my house of course the ugly face of the guard was unfamiliar because he came from pompeys household he didnt recognize me either and looked ready to break me in two if i tried to slip past him the family must be safe after all i thought i felt a giddy urge to hug him but didnt dare who are you and what do you want he snarled you stupid oaf said eco this is gordianus the owner of this house and im his son eco now run tell the he was interrupted by a cry of pure joy the guard understood at once and drew aside with a sudden smile that changed the whole nature of his face diana was suddenly before me and then pressed close to me with my arms around her bethesda and menenia appeared and the laughing twins but i saw them only uncertainly like images in water their ecstatic beaming impossibly beautiful faces glimmering through a veil of tears then i saw another familiar face he hung back from the rest so that i only glimpsed him between barrages of hugs and kisses the look on his face was not so much of joy as of intense relief clouded by embarrassment davus was alive after all i thought davus must be alive i hoped it was so i said reclining on my favourite couch with my right arm holding bethesda beside me we had eaten inside then pulled chairs and couches for everyone into the garden to enjoy the last of the day the weather was mild for the ides of march which was of course more like april figuring in the leapmonth butterflies flitted amid the columns of the peristyle the plants all around were beginning to quicken and stir with the spring the statue of minerva i noted ruefully remained broken and prostrate where she had fallen but i thought he was surely dead said eco peering at davus as if still unsure of the evidence of his eyes davus blushed under his scrutiny until a few days ago i thought the same thing i said my last glimpse of davus on the appian way was of a dead man or so i believed our captors thought so too and left him for dead i hit my head said davus quietly lowering his eyes they must have dragged me off the road behind a tomb i woke up hours later with a nasty bump on my head and when did you realize the truth asked bethesda lazily tracing her fingertips over my earlobe and neck when i reread dianas letter to meto she made no mention of davus but she knew that we had been attacked and abducted on our way back to the city how it was possible that some passerby witnessed the attack happened to recognize eco or me and felt obliged to inform the family possible but not likely it was also possible that whoever came upon davuss corpse if indeed our abductors had left it in the road just happened to recognize him as my slave and returned him to the family and that from his condition and the place where he was found and the fact that we were missing diana could have inferred that we had been attacked and abducted that chain of possibilities seemed unlikely the simplest thing is often the true thing davus must have survived i reasoned and brought home the tale of the attack that seemed unlikely too but i wanted to believe it and so i quietly did i am more pleased than i can say to discover that i was right to have first lost belbo and then you davus continued to blush and would not look me in the eye but we are all well all together i said pulling bethesda closer to me the warmth and firmness of her body the simple solid reality of it felt incredibly good to me with my other hand i reached out to diana who sat on a low chair to my left she smiled and lifted her chin as i stroked her black shimmering hair surely there was no finer or more beautiful thing in all creation i thought than dianas hair yet even as she smiled there seemed to be an anxiety that clouded her face and would not disperse perhaps she could not quite trust that all was well again after so many long days of worry eco reclined on a couch across from me with menenia beside him and titus and titania at his left hand we talked for a while longer about our captivity about the state of things in rome about bethesdas success in bending pompeys guards to her will the sky darkened and stars began to appear after a while eco and menenia sent the twins to bed and retired to their room for the night davus withdrew and a few moments later diana left the garden as well still looking uneasy bethesda and i were alone she brought her face close to mine i missed you she whispered oh bethesda i worried for you so much i worried for you too husband but thats not what i said i said i missed you she smoothed her hand over my chest and down towards my legs ending in a place that made her meaning unmistakably clear bethesda but husband you must be voracious after so long it was a curious thing but during our time in the pit i had experienced hardly any amorous impulses or fantasies at all a few times purely for physical relief i had tended to myself while eco slept i assumed he had done the same though probably more often and on a few occasions i had resorted to a certain fantasy involving a certain highborn lady and her red and white striped litter but for the most part i had retreated from my body as much as i could denying pleasure was perhaps a way of also denying the more imminent prospects of pain and death it was as if i had been buried alive which was not far from the truth now i was free and back in rome at last safe and fed and surrounded by my loved ones but i was also tired exhausted by four days of riding and still not fully recuperated from the debilitating effects of our captivity much much too tired for what bethesda wanted i thought and yet the movements of her hand began to stir me and her warmth seemed to pour a kind of vitality into my body bringing me fully to life again i felt myself sinking into a state beyond words or caring like a stone dissolving into water but not here i whispered we should go inside why bethesda so we did it there in the garden like young lovers not once but twice with the moon for a lamp the night air grew chilly but that only made the places where our flesh touched burn all the warmer only once did i have the sensation that we were being watched but when i looked around it was only the head of minerva that looked back at me lying sideways in the grass i ignored her until we were finished the second time when i looked again she still seemed to be watching me with a look of hurt in her lapis lazuli eyes and when will you tend to my needs her expression seemed to say as if singlehandedly i could put the goddess of wisdom together again and return her to her pedestal bethesda and i eventually retired to the bedroom but at some point in the night i got up to relieve myself the hulking shadow i saw across the garden alarmed me at first until i realized who it was davus i whispered why are you up pompeys guards take the night watch i couldnt sleep but you should ill need you fresh and alert tomorrow i know ill try to sleep now he began to walk off slumpshouldered i touched his arm davus i meant what i said tonight i thought we had lost you for good im glad it wasnt so thank you master he cleared his throat and looked away what was wrong with him why did he feel so guilty davus no one blames you for what happened but if id known how to ride a horse ive ridden horses all my life and they pulled me off my mount with no trouble at all but nobody pulled me off my horse i was thrown if id stayed on i could have ridden for help nonsense youd have stayed and fought and theyd have killed you for certain you did your best davus and it wasnt good enough where had he come by such a conscientious nature having been a slave all his life davus fortune smiled on you the horse threw you you were left for dead and youre alive today fortune smiled on all of us were still here arent we you should let that be enough he finally looked me in the eye master theres something i have to say you said you were glad to find out i was still alive but you cant know how glad i was today when you showed up at the door because well i cant explain it i wish i could but i cant may i go now of course davus get some sleep he lumbered away tonguetied and close to tears i thought i understood minerva who could see everything from the place where she had fallen must have had quite a laugh at me that night the next morning i asked diana to show me the note she had mentioned in her letter to meto the one that had arrived by anonymous courier addressed to her mother it was just as she had transcribed it do not fear for gordianus and his son they have not been harmed they will be returned to you in time i showed it to eco does the handwriting look familiar to you no nor to me still it tells us something the parchment is of good quality as is the ink it didnt come from a poor household moreover the spelling is correct and the letters are properly made so we may assume that the writer is educated probably a slave taking dictation do you think so to send a message such as this i imagine a man might actually write the note himself i think it might profit us to look among my records and correspondence to see if we can find another example of this handwriting i dont have many such specimens and neither do you papa most letters come on wax tablets so that you can write over them and send them back yes but we may find somethinga bill a receipt anything do you see how hes made the letter g in my name thats rather distinctive if we could find the man who makes his gs that way wed find a man who must know something about our captivity exacdy eco smiled i need to clean my study and sort through my correspondence anyway shall we start here or at my house on the esquiline here i think unless of course you want to drop by your house just to have a look at it since youve been away so long of course we should report to the great one sooner or later as if responding to a cue in a play davus appeared in the doorway a caller master anyone i know i think you gave him a nickname something silly davus looked thoughtful oh i remember baby face i turned to eco it looks like we shall be seeing the great one sooner then not later should we take cloaks davus no its mild this morning master and the sky is clear shall i shall i come with you i doubt if theres any need davus with baby face and his men to look after us stay here youve done such a good job of looking after the women in our absence i thought this would cheer him up but my words of praise only seemed to plunge davus into a deeper gloom xxviii as consul despite the fact that he retained command of his legions in spain pompey was now legally able to enter the city and might have taken up residence in his old family house in the carinae district instead he chose to remain in his villa out on the pincian hill probably because it was more defensible i thought as we ascended through the terraced gardens ringed with soldiers keeping watch among the statuary was this how a king would live if rome had a king the great one received us in the same room as before he sat in a corner with a pile of documents on his lap dictating to a secretary but as we entered he put the documents aside and dismissed the secretary he showed us onto the terrace which was bright with morning sunlight no columns of smoke marred the skyline of the city pompey had vowed to restore order and so he had youve been gone for a very long time finder i must confess i had almost given up on you it was a pleasant surprise when i received news of your return yesterday you both look well enough if a bit thinner than when i last saw you i managed to keep myself informed of your circumstances thanks to your wife you were waylaid down by the monument of basilius i understand and not too many days ago she received some sort of note advising her not to worry promising that you would eventually be freed and here you are except that our captors didnt free us great one we escaped really pompey raised an appreciative eyebrow youve had an adventure then here sit i could use a good story to distract me from my own affairs for a while begin at the beginning if pompey preferred to call it a story rather than a report i had no objection though it was clear from his frequent questions that he wanted complete details of everything we had seen heard and done on the appian way he didnt call his secretary to take notes apparently preferring to hold the relevant details in his head and to keep the information entirely to himself i held very little back from him we had struck a bargain after all the payment he had offered could never make up for the days i had lost in captivity but he had fulfilled his guarantee to keep my family safe while i was gone about certain points especially regarding the actual encounter between milo and clodius he questioned us intently eco and i had gone over the evidence so many times in our captivity that we could have answered his questions in our sleep indeed i was sick of talking and thinking about it and pompey apparently sensed this for now and then he would sit back and fall into easy conversation for a while asking if we had enjoyed the amenities of his alban villa and the skills of his cook before delving back into our discoveries along the appian way the conversation assumed a certain rhythm intense for a while and then relaxed and before i realized it the entire morning had passed pompey was not a great orator but he was a skilled interrogator long experience as a general had taught him how to brief and debrief his men no wonder his judicial reforms had placed greater emphasis on questioning witnesses and less on rhetorical summations if anything i reported startled or alarmed him including the details of our incarceration he had the control not to show it i ended my report with a brief account of our escape and a few words about our stay at caesars headquarters in ravenna pompey seemed impressed that we had met with the commander himself he said that i should convey to you his warmest regards i said did he pompey seemed vaguely amused tell me how did he treat cicero while i was considering how to answer this pompey noticed the smirk on ecos face and nodded knowingly pretty shabbily then caesar seemed to be very busy and kept putting him off i said carefully ha you mean he did everything he could to make cicero feel like an idiot its because i sent him of course i beg your pardon great one cicero was there to represent me you didnt realize that finder what did he tell you he was acting all on his own not exactly he fooled you then admit it well cicero has fooled all of us at one time or another so why not you too what a fox he is im sure he put on quite an air acting the great saviour of the state who must dash here and there making sense of all the strife and linking everything together the fact is i sent cicero to ravenna to bargain with caesar for me right now you see i have the power i need to do certain things that need doing but caesars faction in the senate could still cause me an awful lot of headaches theyre wary of me they fret about this sole consulship of mine to balance things out they insist that caesar have a chance to stand for consul next year even if hes absent in gaul well why not caelius was the sticking point threatening to veto the special exemption for caesar that made things interesting then theres this new uprising among the gauls caesar is eager to tidy things up in rome before he heads north that made things even more interesting oh ill give caesar what he wants of course but one must always negotiate a bit so i thought who better to send as my envoy than cicero theres caesar harried and pressed and getting ready to leave on a dangerous campaign and who should show up for an audience but a man he absolutely cant stand marcus cicero caesar will take out his irritation on poor cicero but at the same time hell have to acknowledge that ive done him a favour meanwhile cicero will have a chance to feel that hes powerful and important since hes the only person who can knock any sense into that blockhead caelius and hell feel absurdly beholden to me for giving him such a grave responsibility letting him into the game making him a mediator between caesar and myself and if nothing else the trip has got cicero out of my hair for a while i blinked and nodded thinking that i really had no understanding of politics and politicians at all well finder i appreciate your honesty and thoroughness i also appreciate your suffering at the hands of your captors if you were a soldier i would say that you had served beyond the call of duty you shall be rewarded i dont forget these things thank you great one if you wish you may keep my guards at your house i would appreciate that great one for how long for the duration of the current crisis there will be a resolution rather soon now i think he took a long sip of wine you know finder you and your son are not the only ones whove faced danger in the last month or so ive had my own small adventures trying to keep my head attached to my shoulders i dare say i could have used a man of your skills here in rome to help me make sense of it all adventures great one there are those who say milo is quite determined to do me in really dont blanch finder i wont assign you to investigate milos intentions i have enough people looking into that already and you deserve a rest still i rather wish you had been here to help me deal with the episode of licinius the butcherpriest i beg your pardon great one licinius the mans a butcher and a priest hes a popa the one who actually cuts an animals throat when the priests make a sacrifice this licinius does the bloody work while the others tend to the chanting and incense but in his own time he runs a butcher shop in the arcade along the circus maximus convenient eh i dare say some of the flesh thats been sacrificed to the gods one day ends up being sold to mere hungry mortals the next but the fellow seems to be fairly respectable for a priest my dealings with him started a few days before the senate voted to make me sole consul licinius showed up at my door one night explaining who he was and begging to see me for the sake of my own safety he said i had to think twice before admitting a professional slaughterer into my presence he took a sip of wine licinius apparently has a regular clientele of bodyguards and gladiators from the circus his place is something of a gathering place for big meateaters that day a group came in to gorge themselves on blood sausages and wine they got very drunk on the blood as much as the wine licinius said and let it slip that they were part of a plot by milo to assassinate me when they realized the butcher was listening they backed him against a wall and put a knife to his ribs saying theyd kill him if he told anyone after he closed up his shop for the day he came here quite distraught i heard him out then summoned cicero to see what he had to say in milos defence before licinius was halfway through his story cicero launched into a blistering assault on the mans character called him a butcher masquerading as a priest said hed drawn more blood with his knife than any of the men he was accusing said he was likely to be a paid assassin himself because he was bankrupt and desperate for money and on and on do you see the lapse in logic finder how was it that cicero happened to know so much about this obscure butcher from the circus maximus how was it that he arrived at my house already armed with arguments against him unless there really was a plot and cicero already knew something about it i dont accuse cicero i dont believe he would actively take part in a conspiracy to kill me but i think milos gladiators must have warned milo that the butcher had overheard them and milo must have mentioned it to cicero so that cicero wasnt entirely surprised when he saw licinius when the butcher lifted up his tunic to show where the gladiators dagger had been pushed against his ribs cicero brayed like a donkey that little scratch do you expect us to be impressed with that you want us to believe a big strong gladiator made that tiny scratch youve obviously used one of your wifes hairpins and scratched yourself and even then not much for a butcher youve awfully squeamish about drawing any of your own blood then while cicero was still ranting a man claiming to be a friend of the butcher showed up wanting to see him i let licinius meet the fellow in the anteroom but of course i had the anteroom watched and a moment later a guard came in to tell me that liciniuss socalled friend was trying to bribe him to keep his mouth shut right here under my own roof that was quite enough for one day i sent licinius home under guard i locked up the fellow who tried to bribe him who was a mere errand runner and knew nothing and i told cicero to get out of my sight before i throttled him and what came of all this i said eventually i put the evidence before the senate when milo spoke he claimed that hed never seen most of the gladiators in question some of them he admitted to having owned at one time but he said he had manumitted them long ago and was no longer responsible for them as citizens they couldnt be tortured for evidence of course and they kept their mouths shut milo suggested that licinius the butcher had overheard a drunken fantasy and misunderstood most of it i had no real proof to the contrary and thats where the matter rests for now pompey gazed at the city below perhaps i could have used your help to get at the truth of the matter finder but you werent here believe me great one i would much rather have been here than where i was yes yes i know that you faced great hardship i dont dismiss your suffering but i tell you some days it isnt easy being pompey the great i spent the next few days undisturbed eco and i passed the time by looking through every scroll arid scrap of parchment in our two houses trying to find a match to the handwriting in the note to bethesda we were unsuccessful but after a while sorting through mementos and old correspondence became an end in itself a nostalgic respite from the world i needed this period of distraction i was being reunited with my life i had thought falsely that once i was back in rome i could get on with my business without missing a step but the experience in the pit had frightened and disturbed me more than i could acknowledge at the time i found myself in a sort of twilight state not yet ready to move on from bethesda i could not have asked for more comfort and support she never once said a word of blame for my having placed myself in such great danger she never called me a vain thoughtless fool as i had called myself a thousand times while i was in the pit she saw that i needed her complete attention and unconditional affection and she gave it to me i began to think that i had married a goddess diana was more problematic if she had been angry with me for putting her through so much worry for making her feel abandoned and bereft i might have understood but her behaviour was more puzzling than that she had always been inscrutable to me even more so than her mother past experience had taught me sometimes with a rude shock that she was capable of thoughts and actions i could not possibly anticipate so i tried not to worry overmuch about her seeming coolness her brooding melancholy her new habit of staring into the middle distance davus was equally perplexing i had thought that my whispered conversation with him in the garden had put everything right and that he would stop skulking about and avoiding my gaze instead this guilty behaviour only became worse what was wrong with him just when i was beginning to feel fully settled again and fully engaged in these family concerns distraction arrived in the form of a red and white striped litter it was inevitable that clodia would call on me sooner or later just as a summons from pompey had been inevitable there was even a part of me that had been looking forward to her arrival with a certain impatience when davus showed in the same haughty slave who had summoned me to her litter before i tried to suppress a smile eco was away that day tending to his own affairs what choice did i have but to go by myself as i was leaving through the foyer i met bethesda coming in from outside she had surely seen the litter and knew where i was going i held my breath but she only smiled as we passed and said take care of yourself husband then she stopped pulled my face to hers and gave me a long deep kiss she laughed as she walked away pompeys politics bethesdas sense of humour my seventeenyearold daughters moods what else did i need to add to the list of things i would never ever comprehend a moment later i was beside clodia in her litter moving through the streets of the palatine she took my hand and gave me a sidelong soulful look gordianus the rumours weve heard about you so awful such an ordeal for your family tell me everything i shook my head no im in much too good a mood to spoil it with unpleasant talk is it so painful for you to remember she drew her eyebrows together it had to be a trick of the soft filtered light that there was not a wrinkle on her face gordianus what are you grinning at the light inside this litter the warmth of your body that elusive unforgettable scent of yours men live and die nations rise and fall but some things never change gordianus what an extraordinary woman you are clodia shall i live and die and never make love to you gordianus did she actually blush no that was impossible clodia was beyond blushing it had to be a trick of the light like the perfection of her skin gordianus ive come on behalf of fulvia you must know that she tried to make her voice businesslike but she couldnt help smiling is that what you told my wife when she looked into the litter to say hello to you of course then we talked about the weather dont you love an early spring my wife is a goddess you know any mortal woman would be insanely jealous of you she tilted her head i agree she must be divine any man married to a mere mortal would have succumbed to me long ago but i thought perhaps you considered me a goddess oh no clodia i most definitely consider you a woman there is no question of that we smiled at each other then our smiles wavered a cloud obscured the sun changing the light inside the litter neither of us looked away is something about to happen gordianus said clodia i hardly recognized her voice i took a deep breath and squeezed her hand after a moment she pulled it away able to read my touch i shrugged if something were to happen between us clodia then everything would change the play of light inside this litter the warmth of your body that elusive unforgettable scent they would never be the same again and i want them never to change she seemed to tremble then laughed softly men she said in a disparaging but not unfriendly way for a moment i thought i had hurt her and felt a strange thrill then i realized i was being absurd a few moments alone with clodia could bring out the peacock in any man what did you discover then on the appian way her voice was casual again anything new of importance i hardly know where to start were almost at fulvias house arent we why dont you come in with me and listen along with fulvia the look on her face made it clear that this was not possible perhaps afterwards on the way home you can give me a private report she said yes if you wish her litter deposited me on the steps leading up to the entrance a guard showed me inside the lofty rooms were still unfinished and haphazardly furnished without its master and its architect the house of clodius was frozen in time the room where fulvia and her mother awaited me was brighter and warmer than before but sempronia still kept a blanket over her lap and gave me an icy look i sensed that there were others in the room and felt a unexpected thrill of relief as fulvia introduced them gordianus i think you already know feucia keeper of the shrine of the good goddess on the appian way and her brother felix attendant to the altar of jupiter in bovillae you took my advice then i said to felicia my brother and i discussed it for all of an hour then gathered up what we needed and headed for rome before dawn the next morning weve hardly left this house since felicia was as striking as ever even as a suppliant in another womans home she carried herself with the same intriguing infuriating nonchalance i wont let them leave said fulvia theyre too valuable as witnesses and too vulnerable milo must have heard by now that there were witnesses to his crimes felix and felicia are safe with me and quite comfortable quite quite comfortable agreed felix whose face looked fuller than i remembered it witnesses i said is there to be a trial oh yes said fulvia there have been delays pompey had to reorganize the courts to his liking and milo has made a bigger spectacle of himself than he ever put on with his gladiators stalling and blustering and using every kind of legal manoeuvre to wriggle his way out of the inevitable but my nephew appius is finally ready to bring the case once the charges are officially filed it will be only a matter of days until we crush the bastard for good sempronia ground her teeth and spat on the floor we heard of your misfortune said fulvia please as i just told your sisterinlaw i have no more stomach for talking about it good said fulvia bluntly im sick of mulling over misfortunes myself its the future i want to think about now felix felicia please leave us felix crept out obsequiously his sister followed behind him flashing a very inappropriate smile at me fulvia made a face what trash those people are my skin crawls every time theyre near me the man eats like a pig said sempronia and the woman snoops everywhere then pretends to be a halfwit when i catch her at it litter trash declared fulvia i should think your late husbands wide circle of friends must have acquainted you with many people no better or worse i said watch your tongue finder snapped sempronia fulvia waved a hand to caution her mother gordianus is our guest and we have unfinished business with him do we i said i realize that you never formally agreed to the proposition i made to you yet you set out to investigate my husbands death anyway i suspect you must have been employed by a certain other person how else to explain the presence of his bodyguards at your house but in light of the fact that you directed valuable witnesses to come to my house for protection i did it as much for their sake as for yours i said she paused taken aback by my bluntness maybe so but the action still marks you as a friend to our cause did you accept my proposition after all do you have anything to report to me about marc antony you mean yes i hesitated what was the figure you promised she named the sum ill settle for half that amount i said to make up the difference i want you to give me two of your slaves she looked dubious if youre looking for more bodyguards i should tell you that the best of my men are each worth considerably more than the sum i just named no fulvia its not protectors im looking for i only want two small boys who reside at your alban villa brothers their names are mopsus and androcles what the stableboys sempronia smirked is that how your tastes run finder clodia must be telling the truth when she says that youve never tried to touch her despite all her rubbing up against you i bit my tongue i sighed and shrugged i can only say that i intend to put the boys to better use than you have fulvia did you realize that they saved your sons life when milo and his men stormed the villa what because they happened to be in that secret passageway with him and managed to keep from blubbering is that how your son explained it i think neither of you give the boys enough credit theyre only stableboys gordianus perhaps but ill wager that they grow up twice as clever and resourceful as anyone else in your household fulvia raised an eyebrow if you want the two slaves as part of your payment gordianus you may have them good shall i make my report yes marc antony had nothing whatever to do with your husbands death as simple as that you have my word your word said sempronia icily fulvia began to pace before the open windows what else can i offer you certainty is a strange thing aristotle showed that no man can prove that a particular thing did not happen i carried your question with me everywhere on the appian way fulvia and into the pit where i resided for forty days and even to antony himself in ravenna i travelled back to rome beside him making my own judgment antony is completely innocent of spilling your husbands blood despite his feelings for you sempronia looked disgusted the scoundrel seduced you then as well fulvia glared at her leave the room mother sempronia made a great show of gathering up her blanket and straightening her weary limbs she did not deign to look at me as she left for the first time i found myself alone with fulvia i sensed a difference in her at once when she stopped her pacing and turned towards me her face seemed to belong to a different woman younger and more vulnerable youre sure of this finder antony is innocent of this crime at least she smiled but there were also tears in her eyes what emotions raged inside her always held in check to keep others from seeing theres hope then i may have a future after all with antony but hes already married to his cousin does he intend to divorce antonia no thats impossible a divorce now would destroy him hes suggested that i consider marrying curio instead his boyhood friend his boyhood lover you can say the word i think of the two of them as fabled greek warriors like achilles and patroclus but would you settle for being briseis she looked at me blankly the allusion escaped her and so failed to insult her she was not the literary type are you thinking of marriage again so soon i said curio and i shall wait until an appropriate time but such a marriage why not the two of us love antony and always have and antony loves the two of us more than anything else certainly more than he loves antonia but clodius clodius is dead she said grimly and i intend to see him revenged but antony is alive and curio is alive and unmarried i have to think of the days to come who knows what the future will bring her smile was gone so were her tears do you want your payment now yes thank you ill have the silver brought up and counted and the two stableboys ill collect them at my leisure i left fulvias house in high spirits it was the ebullience of being free again after having been captive of being back in the city where i was known and others had need of me the heft and jingle of new silver in my purse also helped as did the satisfaction of having acted on pure impulse when i requested the two boys from fulvia i felt quite content with myself and with my place in the world at that moment my mood changed abruptly when i saw that clodias litter was gone her haughty handsome young slave remained along with a sufficient bodyguard to see me safely home i hope you wont mind walking he said practically sneering but where is clodia she remembered more pressing business but i had things to tell her things she wanted very much to hear i suppose she decided they werent so important after all the slave was absurdly patronizing shall we be going you can manage the walk cant you or shall i send someone to hire a litter now he was being deliberately insulting i considered giving him a friendly lecture he was young and beautiful now and he had his mistresss favour but for how long had he seen what became of the long line of those who had pleased his mistress before him but what was the point the slave was simply deluded what he took to be my humiliation clodias abrupt departure was precisely the opposite i had wounded her after all so badly that she fled i gordianus had hurt clodia it was a triumph i told myself and answered myself yes of the sort that pyrrhus was famous for the light inside the litter the warmth of her body that elusive unforgettable scent something told me i would never experience these things again xxix oyer the next few days as had been the case all through the period of our absence from rome there were continual contios in the forum at which the radical tribunes railed against milo i myself stayed safely bolted behind the doors of my own house but eco who made a point of attending these contios assured me that they were peaceable affairs kept that way by the presence of pompeys troops i dont know which would dismay me more i told him seeing a contio erupt into a riot or seeing roman citizens being cowed by roman soldiers papa something had to be done about the violence then we might as well have a king thats what it feels like now seeing soldiers in the streets its like being in alexandria where you see king ptolemys men everywhere you go well lets hope pompeys soldiers do a better job of keeping the peace said eco really papa you sound almost nostalgic for the good old days of blood in the streets im not sentimental about the past eco only fearful for the future meanwhile papa the rest of us are living in the present nobody else objects to seeing a few soldiers in the forum not yet when i told bethesda about my acquisition of mopsus and androcles she took the news that there would soon be two more mouths to feed children no less and boychildren at that with more equanimity than i expected did i seem so frail that she felt obliged to indulge me no matter what madness i came up with had the spirit of minerva entered her when the statue fell and broke making her permanently serene her own explanation was simpler she had always enjoyed eco and meto when they were boys she said if the fates had led two more boys to my household then she would do her best to welcome them managing to feed the household had always been a challenge especially at present since davus seemed to eat even more than belbo had but she would manage dianas reaction was even more surprising she had hated it when eco and menenias twins supplanted her as the baby of the family but she had matured a great deal since then and i had no intention of making her accept mopsus and androcles as little brothers they would simply be household servants still i anticipated that diana might be diffident or even averse to the idea i had no idea that it would cause her to break into tears and run from the room what in jupiters name was that about i said to eco she doesnt seem to like the idea but why the tears shes seventeen shell cry at anything bethesda says diana never shed a tear while we were gone then i should have said shes seventeen shell cry at nothing you know its time she married papa thats probably what its about the idea of new children in the house makes her realize that she probably wont be here much longer herself do you really think thats it i have no idea have you given any thought to finding her a husband lately eco when have i had time youre the one whos been out and about going to all these contios i hardly think ill find a fit husband for my little sister among that rabble maybe menenia has a cousin the right age i suggested or maybe meto knows of an officer whos eligible i suppose it is something we need to start working on i admitted but you know what i really need to get done i need to have the statue of minerva repaired a few mornings later one of ecos bodyguards returned to the house in a state of great excitement davus showed him into my study theres a contio about to start down in the forum he said a little out of breath from running up the ramp and the master says you must come but why he only says that you must hes waiting for you there davus and i followed the man back to the forum a considerable crowd had gathered the tribune plancus was already speaking not far from the rostra a squadron of armed soldiers were stationed on the steps of the ruined senate house the sight of them did lend a certain gravity to the proceedings i had to admit we found eco in the crowd whats this about i whispered if the rumours are true plancus is going to introduce but look hes just brought them onto the platform with him four men led by another walked onto the rostra all of them looking nervous and out of place plancus reached for the leader and pulled him to the centre of the platform citizen tell these good men your name the man answered with an inaudible mumble the crowd jeered and laughed citizen said plancus goodnaturedly youll have to speak up see those soldiers over on the senate house steps pretend youre speaking to them my name is marcus aemilius philemon the man shouted there was a round of cheering and applause tell us philemon said plancus do you remember where you were on the day that publius clodius was murdered indeed i do i was with these four other men on the appian way we were travelling on foot headed for neapolis and how far did you get that day to bovillae what happened there we came upon what looked like a battle where was this at the inn the crowd now listened with rapt attention philemon cleared his throat and continued there seemed to be a group inside the inn and a group outside and the ones outside were after the ones inside theyd broken down the door they kept forcing their way in and dragging out the men one at a time and stabbing them to death right there in the road there was blood all over the place a horrifying sight im sure said plancus what did you do we shouted at them what are you doing and they said weve got publius clodius trapped like a rat and were going to cut his tail off they were laughing quite a lot having a good time of it they you say did you recognize any of these men i knew two of them right away we all did those two famous gladiators of milos eudamus and birria they were the ones who seemed to be doing most of the killing blood all over them what did you do then we shouted at them to stop what they were doing i may be only a freedman but i wasnt going to stand by and watch while slaves murdered a citizen this elicited noises of approval from the crowd freedman you may be said plancus but its a worthy citizen wholl stand up for his fellow roman you tried to stop this atrocity then my friends and i went at them but ill tell you not one of us has ever been a soldier or a gladiator they beat us back then they chased after us we had daggers but these fellows were gladiators and armed with swords i wont say i did a brave thing turning and running but ill challenge any man here to stand nose to nose with the likes of eudamus or birria and not flinch this elicited some sympathetic murmurs still you did a brave thing citizen you and your fine friends here i should hope that if ever some scoundrel like milo sends his slaves after me or my loved ones therell be citizens like you to come to my rescue plancus led the crowd in an outburst of cheering and applause but philemon plancus continued how is it that were only now hearing about this why did you not come forward before when we were all in a state of confusion about what happened on the appian way because weve only now had the chance to come forward for two months we were all held prisoner by milo at his villa in lanuvium this created a great stir in the crowd explain philemon said plancus when eudamus and birria and their men came after us we all split up and headed away from the road we thought we might be able to lose them in the hills and the woods but there were plenty of them after us and they caught us one by one until theyd rounded up all five of us they tied us up and herded us like prisoners back through bovillae and up the appian way slaves did this to citizens men in the crowd shook their fists and shouted curses at milo burn his house someone shouted burn down the villains house i looked uneasily at the soldiers who stood rigidly at attention on the senate house steps plancus quieted the crowd so that philemon could go on they took us up the hill to milo he was standing in the road with a lot of men around him when he saw us he stamped his foot and had a tantrum like a child i thought that was the end of us that theyd kill us right there in the road but milo ordered his men to gag us and put bags over our heads then we were shoved into some sort of wagon or carriage and they took us to a place a few miles away milos own villa in lanuvium as it turned out they locked us in an underground storage room and thats where we stayed for two long months while they fed us on kitchen scraps and mouldy bread then we heard from one of the men guarding us that milo had finally made up his mind to have us killed i dont want to say too much about how we escaped as there were those in milos villa who helped us do it you said you were prisoners for two months yelled someone in the crowd but its been more like three months since clodius was killed what have you been doing in the month since you escaped why havent we heard from you before i can answer that said plancus these men have been lying low are you surprised milo spared their lives once but what would stop him from killing them if he could catch them a second time now it finally looks as if milo will be brought to justice after all and so these men have come forward truth bides its time but is it the truth shouted another man in the crowd the whole story sounds suspicious to me you clodians looked everywhere and you never could find anybody who saw the actual killing and now youve suddenly come up with five witnesses who claim they were there on the spot and if it seems a bit funny that we havent heard from them in all this time oh thats because they just happen to have been held prisoner for a couple of months its all a bit incredible if you ask me do they have any proof that milo held them captive one of the four men ran to the front of the platform and shook his fist proof you want proof of something i can think of a way to prove whether or not you have blood in your veins there were more shouts and threats the mood began to turn ugly i looked towards the soldiers was it my imagination or had they all moved a few steps closer plancus shook his head and gestured for calm but more and more shouting matches began to break out i nudged eco who nodded his consent and we made our way out of the crowd so papa the mystery of the prisoners on the road is solved i nodded not clodiuss men after all just hapless travellers who happened to stumble upon the fracas i can see why eudamus and birria hunted them down but why didnt they kill them on the spot why did they spare them their recklessness had already got their master into enough trouble for one day who knew who these five fellows were or whether some powerful patron might be offended if they were killed milo must have thought it was better to simply hold them prisoner until the storm passed instead the storm only kept building you heard what philemon said just before they escaped milo had finally made up his mind to get rid of them probably some slave in milos villa took pity on them and helped them get away there were sceptics in the crowd i suppose it is a rather incredible story but it all sounds only too credible to us eh eco the next morning pompeys legislation to reform the law courts proposed a month before was officially voted on and approved by the senate immediately appius claudius brought formal charges against milo accusing him of the crime of political violence in the murder of their uncle under pompeys new rules for the courts each side was allowed ten days to prepare for the trial rome held its breath if convicted milo would be subject to immediate permanent exile and the confiscation of almost all his possessions he would be disgraced and dispossessed he would be finished in rome forever but what if he was absolved i tried to imagine the reaction in the city i could envision only endless flames rubble and bloodshed could even pompey with his troops contain such a whirlwind reason morality and simple pragmatism argued that any verdict other than guilty was impossible except except that milo had cicero on his side and as i had learned from long sometimes bitter experience with cicero for the defence anything was possible xxx the trial of titus annius milo began on the morning of the fourth day of the month of aprilis with the examination of witnesses in the courtyard of the temple of liberty presiding over the court from a raised tribunal was the former consul lucius domitius ahenobarbus a grimjawed humourless former consul handpicked by pompey himself and purely as a formality approved by a vote of the peoples assembly testimony was given before a panel of potential jurors who sat on raised benches on either side of the courtyard this panel had been selected from a list of eligible senators and men of property drawn up by pompey of these eightyone would ultimately be chosen by lot to make up the jury milo and his advocates cicero and marcus claudius marcellus sat with their secretaries on benches feeing the tribunal as did the prosecutors clodiuss nephew appius claudius publius valerius nepos and marc antony also present were numerous officers of the court including a battery of secretaries to record the testimony in tironian shorthand a huge crowd gathered at the open end of the courtyard to view the proceedings those with foresight sent slaves ahead to save places for them eco and i with our long experience of trials had managed to secure excellent seats in the tenth row davus and one of his fellow bodyguards had arrived well before dawn with our folding chairs and dozed on them until we arrived latecomers without chairs crowded into every vacant nook and cranny and continually tried to push their way in from the forum pompey was not present nor were pompeys soldiers who seemed so omnipresent everywhere else in the city even pompey would not dare to post armed troops at a roman trial surely they would not be needed even the clodians would not dare to disrupt a roman trial a political gathering was one thing a public trial the most sacred of roman institutions the cornerstone of roman justice was another matter the first witness to be called was gaius causinius schola one of the men who had accompanied clodius on horseback that day on the appian way he testified that clodiuss party had met and passed milos larger party close to the tenth hour of the day that a scuffle had broken out among the rearguard of the two parties for reasons he did not know though he suspected that milos men had started it that when clodius turned and cast a dark look at birria the gladiator hurled a spear at clodius and wounded him knocking him from his horse fighting broke out and schola himself was knocked from his horse and driven into the woods by milos slaves he remained in hiding until well after dark then made his way to clodiuss villa where he found that the place was in shambles and that the foreman and the tutor halicor had been murdered the next day he returned to rome in essentials scholas story matched what i had learned from felicia though in the finer details he cast clodius in an even more innocent light when the time for crossexamination arrived a thrill of anticipation passed through the crowd as milo cicero and marcellus conferred milo and cicero remained seated their colleague marcellus stepped forward someone in the crowd shouted lets see cicero no lets see milo with his head on a stick marcellus ignored them he was a seasoned orator used to the give and take of debates in the senate and catcalls from the rabble at trials so schola he began you claim that the incident on the appian way occurred at the tenth hour of the day and yet there was an eruption of jeering from the crowd drowning him out marcellus scowled and waited for the noise to subside but as soon as he opened his mouth again the jeering recommenced even louder he opened his arms in an appeal to domitius on the tribunal then gave a start as a stone the size of a childs fist came hurtling through the air and struck him in the back he whirled about and stared at the crowd with a look of utter shock on his face the mob still screaming and jeering began to rush towards the tribunal pouring in along the sides of the seated crowd knocking down bystanders and stampeding over broken folding chairs eco and i seemed to be safe enough since we were seated near the centre of the seated spectators with plenty of occupied chairs all around us then a group of men came scrambling right through the midst of the seated crowd stepping on peoples laps and shoulders domitius rose to his feet and shouted furiously at the prosecutors they shrugged helplessly making an elaborate mime of being unable to hear him and equally unable to do anything about the unruly crowd the panel of potential jurors men of substance who were not easily intimidated shook their heads and looked thoroughly disgusted milo cicero and marcellus together with their secretaries gathered up armfuls of scrolls and wax tablets and rushed to join domitius on the tribunal as the mob drew closer and showed no sign of stopping milo and his party retreated into the temple of liberty leaving domitius to stand with his hands on his hips defying the mob to violate a sacred temple but the mob seemed satisfied to have silenced marcellus and driven milo to flight they occupied the tribunal and in a jubilant mood began to stamp their feet and recite lewd chants about milos wife fausta when it became evident that order was not going to be restored jurors and peaceful spectators who had not already fled began to disperse eventually there was a rumour that pompey was coming with a troop of armed soldiers this caused the mob to abandon the tribunal and scatter in all directions thus ended the first day of milos trial the next day began much as the first except that the room for spectators was more constricted thanks to the soldiers who now flanked the courtyard on either side at domitiuss insistence pompey had assigned troops to keep order during the trial roman justice would be carried out with the assistance of roman steel the hearing of witnesses resumed with the testimony of various persons from the vicinity of bovillae beginning with felicia like an actor finally allowed to have a major role she seemed determined to make the most of her time as a witness she flashed her incongruous smile and projected her sultry demeanour while the advocates examined and crossexamined her many of the spectators meanwhile seemed to be examining her in another way the day was off to an appropriately bizarre beginning her brother felix testified next about the comings and goings of the victims and their pursuers including the bound prisoners who were now known to be philemon and his companions philemon himself testified reiterating the story he had told at the contio the wife of the slain innkeeper at bovillae did not appear she was still in seclusion down in rhegium i assumed her sister and brotherinlaw the current keepers of the inn gave secondhand testimony about what the widow had told them and described the gory aftermath the virgo maxima told of the visit by an unknown woman offering thanks to the goddess for the death of publius clodius this account so inflamed the clodians that for a while it seemed there might be another disturbance pompeys soldiers eventually moved to drive off some of the more vocal agitators order was restored but by this point domitius was ready to adjourn the court for the day the third day of testimony began with the last of the witnesses from the vicinity of bovillae senator sextus tedius was called he rose from the front row of spectators and hobbled before the court using a cane and dragging his lame left leg i was in the second row of spectators that day and was close enough to see his daughter tedia sitting next to the chair he had vacated looking after him with a worried expression normally she would have assisted him i thought probably he did not care to be seen accepting a womans help in front of the court senator tedius repeated the story he had told me that he had left for rome in his litter accompanied by his daughter and some slaves that he had encountered milo who warned him of fictitious bandits but had pressed on to bovillae where he found clodiuss abandoned body in the road apparently dragged there by his killers and had sent it on to rome in his litter it was now evident that tedius must have arrived while eudamus and birria and their men were off in the woods hunting for philemon and his companions after dispatching clodius to rome tedius returned by foot towards aricia and told of seeing the prisoners being marched up the road while he rested at a spot close to the new house of the vestals a man named quintus arrius a colleague of clodius testified that he had helped to interrogate clodiuss slaves after the incident one of them a personal secretary had confessed under torture that for months he had provided information on clodiuss movements to an agent of milos therefore arrius suggested milo was regularly kept apprised of clodiuss comings and goings and could have premeditated the apparently chance encounter on the appian way cicero during crossexamination scoffed at this idea pointing out that schola had testified on the first day that clodius left his villa suddenly upon hearing the news of the death of cyrus the architect therefore how could milo even with an inside source have predicted their encounter then cicero called a witness himself marcus cato who descended from the raised benches where the potential jurors sat cato perhaps the only person in the court even more staid and conservative than domitius the judge gave secondhand testimony to the effect that a certain marcus favonius had passed along a remark to him which clodius had made exactly three days before the fatal incident and what was this remark this jewel this bit of wisdom from the lips of publius clodius said cicero cato looked at domitius and the panel of jurors clodius told favonius that titus annius milo would be dead within three days there was a stir of excitement in the court catos a liar and a drunk someone yelled whats he doing sitting with the jury if hes a witness cicero spun about who impugns the judgment of pompey it was the great one himself who personally selected marcus cato to sit among the jurors and why because catos integrity and honesty are absolutely beyond doubt any man who says otherwise only shows himself to be a fool this was true enough whatever one thought of his politics cato was not a man to lie but the story he told was only secondhand clodius supposedly said something to favonius who said something to cato and cicero i noticed made no refutation of the accusation that cato was a drunkard a lifetime of hard drinking showed in the statesmans rheumy eyes whatever effect cicero had hoped to achieve by catos testimony was entirely negated by what followed the last witnesses to be heard were sempronia and fulvia each told how clodiuss body had arrived at his house on the palatine borne in a strangers litter unaccompanied by friends or any sort of explanation they described the shocking condition of his corpse they explained how the surviving friends and slaves who had been with him made their way back to rome one by one each adding another horrifying detail to the catastrophe that had occurred on the appian way they spoke of clodiuss young son publius who was missing and unaccounted for all that night and of their grief and worry when they learned of the slaughter at clodiuss alban villa sempronia dour smug sempronia broke down and wept and seemed to become the image of every mans anxious fretful grandmother fulvia who began with a stiff emotionless recitation of the facts ended with a shrieking lament that eclipsed even her agony on the night of her husbands death she wept pulled at her hair and tore her stola i heard more weeping nearby and saw that the daughter of sextus tedius had covered her face with her hands her father stared straight ahead apparently embarrassed by such a display but tedia was not the only one who shed tears i thought it could only be a miracle that kept the clodians from erupting into another riot until i looked around and saw that many of them were weeping uncontrollably cicero did not dare to crossexamine the women the court adjourned at the tenth hour thus ended the third day of milos trial and the last day of testimony one hundred days had passed since the death of publius clodius one more day and the fate of titus annius milo would be decided late that afternoon the tribune plancus held a final contio on the subject of clodiuss death he urged clodiuss followers to come out in force the next morning to hear the actual pleading of the case the speeches for the prosecution and defence would be delivered in the open forum which would accommodate a great many more spectators than the courtyard of the temple of liberty those who had loved clodius must make themselves seen and heard said plancus so that the jurors could know the will of the people and they must encircle the court completely so that once the outcome of the trial became evident the treacherous coward milo would have no opportunity to slip away before the verdict was announced that night over dinner eco and i gave bethesda a full account of the days events she seemed to approve of fulvias performance a womans grief is sometimes the only weapon she has think of hecuba and the trojan women fulvia has used her grief where it will have the most effect i wonder why they didnt call clodia to testify said diana who had been so listless throughout the meal that i thought she wasnt listening that would only have detracted from fulvias grief said eco and it would have distracted the jurors reminding them of certain rumours of what went on between clodia and her brother and after what cicero did to her the last time she appeared at a trial i should be surprised if she ever appeared at one again said bethesda has she attended this trial i havent seen her i said and changed the subject like many people in rome that night i imagine i had a hard time sleeping i tossed and turned and finally got out of bed i went to my study and looked for something to read i scanned the little title tags that hung from the scrolls in their pigeonholes muttering to myself now what is the play that has that famous quote about the gods bringing about an unexpected end euripides isnt it and why is it on my mind tonight oh yes i know because it always reminds me of the trial of sextus roscius when i first worked for cicero his first great triumph in the courts and when it was all over almost over i remember quoting that bit of euripides to tiro tiro was so young then only a boy i was so young then too but what is the play not the trojan women or hecuba that was bethesda who mentioned hecuba at dinner tonight no its from the bacchae and there it was at my fingertips i pulled it from the hole found some weights and unrolled it on a table it was one of the oldest books i owned but was still in good condition the passage i was thinking of was at the very end delivered by the chorus of frenzied dionysian revellers the gods have many guises the gods bring crises to climax while man surmises the end anticipated has not been consummated but god has found a way for what no man expected so ends the play what no man expected could cicero pull it off could he deliver a speech one of those famous logictwisting doubtdefying hilarious wrenching speeches of his that would actually convince the jurors to declare milo not guilty it seemed impossible but so had many another case where cicero had snatched triumph from despair if anyone could do it as i was rolling up the scroll i ripped a bit of parchment at the top i cursed it was such an old scroll when and where had i got it ah yes cicero himself had given it to me as he had given me many books since this had been the first he had even inscribed it as i recalled i unrolled it enough to read the message he had written across the top in his own hand to gordianus fondly with bright hopes for the future my blood froze i had known all along of course still to see the proof before me i found the message that had been left for bethesda and put it side by side with the scroll do not fear for gordianus and his son they have not been harmed they will be returned to you in time there could be no doubt the proof was there in the peculiar shape of the letter g indeed in the way my name was written in each case i had looked at other messages from cicero in my possession but not one of them had been in his own hand they had all been written by tiro or some other secretary but the dedication on the bacchae was assuredly in his hand for i had been there when he inscribed it davus mumbled in his sleep when i shook him the other bodyguards stirred in their beds davus wake up what he blinked then gave a start and jerked away from me as if i were a monster master please his voice cracked like a boys what in hades was wrong with him davus its only me wake up i need you im going out the walk to ciceros house had never seemed so long my blood pounded in my ears i didnt wake eco to come with me though he had as great a grievance against cicero as i did what i had to say to cicero i would say by myself xxxi ciceros doorkeeper perused me through the peephole a little later he opened the door for me allowing davus to enter and wait in the foyer the interior of the house was ablaze with lights no one would be abed early in ciceros house on this night as i was led to the study i heard ciceros voice echoing down the hallway and then tiro laughing out loud i was shown into the room cicero and tiro both greeted me with a smile gordianus cicero stepped forward and embraced me before i could stop him it was a politicians embrace he seemed to encircle me completely and yet hardly touched me anywhere he stepped back and looked at me like a shepherd at a lost lamb so at the very last moment youve come to me can i dare to hope gordianus that this means youve come to your senses at last oh yes cicero i have definitely come to my senses my mouth was suddenly so dry that i could hardly speak you sound like you need something to drink cicero nodded to the doorkeeper who disappeared i should tell you the speech is already pretty much done but its not set in stone better late than never what are you talking about well with the way youve been running back and forth to fulvias house and all that time you spent with marc antony on the road you must be well up on what the prosecution has in mind for tomorrow i can use that sort of information to make sure that all my rebuttals are on target the fewer surprises theyre able to spring on me the better oh gordianus you gave me a scare this time i thought we had lost you for good but here you are back where you belong i looked around the room tiro sat amid masses of rolled and rumpled parchment is caelius here wheres milo merely saying his name made me clench my fists i took a deep breath caelius is home at his fathers house probably sleeping like a baby shouldnt he be here with you working on his speech actually ah heres something to wet your throat tiro would you like a cup as well i thought of refusing but i needed the drink i raised an eyebrow as it passed my lips it must have been the best vintage in the house isnt it a bit premature to be celebrating cicero ah you appreciate the falernian good your appearance in my house is adequate cause for celebration gordianus wheres milo i said not here as you can see hes at home with fausta i imagine dreaming sweet dreams of the consulship that will be his next year did you especially want to see him that was a difficult question to answer no i said i wanted to keep my head and that might not be possible in milos presence i finished my cup of wine gordianus you look a fright we must finish our business as quickly as we can so that you can go home and get some sleep now you asked about caelius giving a speech actually only one advocate will speak for milo tomorrow myself the rest have all run scared then even caelius i had finally managed to dampen his ebullience thats not the case at all this idea that his friends have all deserted milo is a vicious rumour put about by the clodians the same people who keep claiming that milo wants to assassinate pompey and bring down the state they hope to make me look like a fool and to intimidate everyone else into abandoning milo but ill tell you the best men in rome are still solidly behind milo and would gladly have appeared as character witnesses on his behalf but pompeys reforms eliminated character witnesses i could have had former magistrates and consuls lined up the whole length of the forum reciting milos virtues for hours but pompey wants only material witnesses to speak people like that parade of disreputable characters weve had to put up with for the last three days if milos friends are still behind him why are you the only one giving a speech for him again pompeys reforms the defence is allowed only three hours three hours to make a case you know how it was before a man usually had two or three advocates all speaking for as long as they wished i hardly need to tell you that im usually just beginning to warm up after three hours the simple truth is i didnt want to share the time with anyone else its even worse for the prosecution they have only two hours well let their three advocates go tripping over one another rushing through their notes theyll make hasty confused speeches and then i shall use my time to draw the jurors slowly steadily irresistibly into our camp he poured himself a straight cup of the falernian when had cicero begun to drink like other men dont think i cant do it he went on wait until you hear the speech its my masterpiece gordianus am i boasting tiro or am i simply telling the truth tiro smiled its a very fine speech i have never written a finer one and my powers of delivery have never been greater i shall seize the jurors from the first words i shall clutch them to me like a lover until i have nothing more to say and after im done ill defy any man to take a stand against milo wine and curiosity had cooled my anger i decided to listen for a while bide my time and hear him out it was the last time i would ever do so once id said what id come to say there would never again be words between us of any sort how will you do it cicero how will you seduce the jurors well i cant go through the whole speech for you right now there isnt time he smiled crookedly besides you might yet be a spy for the enemy gordianus have you come to ferret out my puns and double meanings before theyre ready i wont have my metaphors and historical allusions anticipated and headed off by the prosecutors but ill give you a general outline perhaps it will give you some ideas of how you might help me help you perhaps theres a weak point in the prosecution that ive missed something you know of that i dont some point they intend to emphasize that i havent foreseen youve probably been privy to information which even my spies have missed all that lolling about in clodias litter making camp with antonyyoure a valuable man to know gordianus ive always said so and ive never turned my back on you no matter how wrongheaded youve been from time to time i cant tell you how glad i was when the doorkeeper came to say that you were here i can think of no one i had rather see on this night gordianus the finder always full of surprises he shall help me add the final crowning touches to my masterpiece i said those very words did i not tiro you did indeed tiro looked very weary with his delicate constitution he should have been in bed i thought or did he blink and lower his eyes to avoid looking at me had tiro been part of the plot against me the idea sickened me but tiros loyalty to cicero had always eclipsed everything else in his life the main thrust of my argument cicero went on full of excitement will be that it was clodius who planned an ambush on milo and that milo had no choice but to defend himself it was justifiable homicide and what about the facts cicero i said oh i shall remind the jury of certain facts such as the fact that clodius had a long history of criminal behaviour against the gods and the state and the fact that even as he was setting out on the appian way he had legislation in the works to reorganize the voting system so as to give himself and his rabble of freedmen even greater power and i certainly shall not let anyone forget the fact that clodius was one of the most lecherous and debauched men ever to plague this city but clodius did not ambush milo must i say it more slowly clodius did not ambush milo cicero paused this matter of an ambush who plotted against whom who was lying in wait its all academic in a way dont you see consider it a literary device my young friend marcus brutus says that i should argue from the assumption that milo assassinated clodius intentionally knowingly and with foresight and declare that the homicide was justifiable on the grounds that milo acted to save the state from a dangerous man well brutus might get away with that argument but not me it would only remind the listeners of my own handling of catilina and his supporters milo must not suffer for the controversies of my own consulship so that line of defence is closed to us on the other hand i might argue that neither milo nor his men were ultimately responsible for clodiuss death at least not technically that may well be the case as im sure you discovered for yourself in your investigations what are you talking about dont be coy with me gordianus its much too late for that however to argue for milos outright innocence i would have to introduce some rather arcane reasoning and besides that approach would fail to make any thematic sense it would neglect the most persuasive argument of all that clodius was an immediate danger to milo and a perennial danger to the state no i shall use the argument of an ambush cicero there was no ambush by either side yes but how do you know that gordianus because i went there i saw the place i spoke to the witnesses ah you went you saw you spoke but the jurors will have done none of these things it is up to me to shape their perceptions but the jurors have already heard the witnesses yes and thats unfortunate these innovations of pompey the traditional sequence is for the advocates to make their arguments first and shape the jurors opinions before they ever hear a witness but never mind do you think the jurors will still be thinking about that whore of a priestess and her pathetic brother or that incredibly common woman from the inn after theyve heard me plead milos case for three hours i think not he saw the look of consternation on my face and smiled you fail to understand i see you doubt that any speech could be so persuasive but believe me this is my best speech by far the finest piece of oratory ive ever devised you cant imagine the labour thats gone into it the guile you mean gordianus he shook his headnot in disgust he was too ebullient for thatbut in dismay very well then guile composition craft guile call it what you will where did you ever come by this naive overweening reverence for the absolute and utter truth this peculiar obsession where has it ever got you if simple truth alone could send armies into battle and sway jurors if men could be made to respond as they should by telling them the truth do you think i would use any other tool it would all be so easy then but truth is not enough often its the very worst thing for a man with a cause and so we have oratory the beauty the power of words thank the gods for the gift of oratory and thank the gods for men who are clever enough and wise enough to bend the truth a bit every once in a while in order to keep the state free and in one piece the important thing about tomorrows hearing is not to determine who did what to whom on the appian way the important thing the absolutely vital thing is that at the end of the day milo must go free if the truth hinders that objective then it must be dispensed with it serves no purpose cant you see that gordianus its such an elementary matter i had heard enough and my captivity was that an elementary matter ciceros face went blank what do you mean while i was trapped in that stinking pit someone wrote an anonymous note to my wife telling her not to worry i found another bit of writing an old old inscription in a scroll that matched the handwriting of that note exactly you wrote the note cicero do you deny it he clasped his hands behind his back and began to pace he glanced at tiro who watched him expectantly with furrowed brows i wrote the note to your wife yes what was your part did you know from the beginning did you plan the attack on me he made a face like a man who must step into something soft and smelly when we learned that you had set out for bovillae milo became convinced that you had become a danger to him it was all he talked about for days who knew what you would find out for whom were you really working i tried to dissuade him but milo is a stubborn man he became determined to remove you to kill me you mean to prevent you from returning to rome yes his first intention was to have you killed i forbade it do you hear me gordianus i forbade him to kill you and your son i reminded him of the men he was keeping locked up at his villa in lanuvium the witnesses his men had captured on the appian way if he could hold those men prisoner then why not you and your son i insisted that you be spared do you understand milo compromised and agreed merely to detain you and only until the crisis was over then you and eco would be released unharmed the men who escaped from lanuvium said that milo had made up his mind to kill them that was only a rumour even if it was true it had nothing to do with you i had milos word that you would come to no harm milos word did you come to harm were you badly treated there you see he kept his word to me even so i felt deeply concerned for your family knowing how dear you are to them how much they would miss you and worry about you i was not so hard and cold that i could ignore that so i wrote that note to your wife to allay her fears i wrote it with my own hand and had it delivered by an illiterate slave i should have known you would find me out in the end gordianus nothing escapes you but it was the right thing to do i cant regret having done it even now he stood erect with his chin up like an officer whose honour had been impugned over an act of bravery i gaped at him youre actually proud of yourself arent you proud because you browbeat milo into kidnapping me instead of murdering me i saved your life gordianus and proud of yourself for writing two lines to my wife instead of setting me free he sighed at my obstinacy sometimes gordianus in defence of liberty actions which might otherwise be reprehensible become not only justified but unavoidable i shook my head tiro did you hear that are you copying it down surely your master can use that in his speech tomorrow cicero pressed his fingertips together gordianus some day you will reflect on this episode and realize that you were called upon to make a sacrifice for the good of the state it may have been a misjudgment on milos part thinking he had to get you out of the way for a short while you should be flattered that he thought you so dangerous but consider the greater context ultimately it is a good thing an exceedingly good thing that clodius is dead and it will be an unmitigated disaster if milos enemies succeed in sending him into exile a disaster for milo you mean yes and a disaster for me and for anyone who cares about preserving rome as a republic we need men like milo and cato and yes like myself there are none of us to spare youve dealt with pompey now youre acquainted with caesar do you really wish to leave eveiything up to them if it comes to that if all the good men are picked off one by one and the power of the senate dwindles to nothing and caesar and pompey are the only men left standing how long do you think their partnership will last can you imagine another civil war gordianus youre old enough to remember marius and sulla how much more terrible would it be this time with the whole world in flames who will be left to pick up the pieces he bowed his head as if the hour suddenly weighed on him everything i do everything is to avert that course of events consider that gordianus and then consider this little thing this little injustice that milo has done you that you were detained for a few days of your life do you wish to be repaid somehow is it restitution that you want would that satisfy you or can you make the effort to see the greater picture and to arrive at some sense of proportion about your part in it this trial is not just about milo and clodius its about the future of the republic if the truth must be bent if you and your family must suffer a bit in the name of that cause then so be it he lifted his head and stared at me steadily waiting for my reaction the beauty the power of words i finally said mocking him curse the gods who gave us oratory and curse the clever men like you who make a travesty of words like liberty and justice this matter is not finished between us marcus cicero as for milo hopefully my grievance with him will be settled for me when the court decides his fate tomorrow i turned to leave then looked back at tiro he had remained silent and averted his eyes during the whole exchange did you know of this i said when tiro hesitated cicero answered for him tiro knew nothing about the kidnapping milo and i never discussed it in his presence the fact is i didnt trust him to keep his mouth shut about it tiro has always had a soft spot for you gordianus even i weakened and wrote that note to your wife tiro might have been even more foolish he knew nothing i stared at tiro who still would not look me in the eye so you deceived tiro as well i can believe that hes not the actor you are cicero his surprise and relief when we met on the flaminian way were too genuine to be a pretence but tiro tiro look at me you must have suspected something who else but milo had a reason to kidnap us how could cicero not have known tiro bit his lower hp the thought did occur to me but i simply didnt ask i suppose i didnt really want to know theres been a great deal else on my mind tell me just one thing then tiro only one thing and the absolute truth will you do that for me tiro looked at me rather forlornly this speech for milo is it as good as cicero claims it is or is that only his vanity speaking tell me what you really think the truth gordianus nothing else ciceros speech for milo is tiro sighed cicero has never written a better speech no one has that is my honest opinion if anything can save milo this is the speech to do it the jurors will weep it will be ciceros finest hour this was not what i wanted to hear may the gods help us all i thought as i hurried from the room and left them to go about their work as i made my way home some of ciceros phrases kept ringing in my head try as i might to shut them out all of it had been nonsense of course but some had been more nonsensical than the rest i might argue that neither milo nor his men were ultimately responsible for clodiuss death at least not technically that may well be the case as im sure you discovered for yourself in your investigations however to argue for milos outright innocence i would have to introduce some rather arcane reasoning what in hades could he have meant by that i almost wished i had kept a cooler head and asked him there was no turning back now he had probably meant nothing at all i told myself but was simply spinning words filling me with doubt throwing dust in my eyes just as he would try to do to the jurors in the morning xxxii on the fourth and final day of milos trial i awoke to birdsong in the garden new flowers had bloomed overnight bees and butterflies were already at work doting on the blossoms i was tempted to forget the trial and stay home why not spend the day enjoying the warm sunshine of aprilis in my garden but the plaintive eyes of the staring broken minerva would not let me forget what was about to transpire in the forum davus and a fellow bodyguard had risen long before cockcrow to go down with folding chairs to save places for us it was a good thing for i had never seen the forum so thronged with spectators by order of pompey all taverns were closed for the day pompey no doubt intended to head off the threat of drunken rioters but the radical tribunes must have been pleased for their own reasons with the taverns closed even their least civicminded supporters had nowhere better to be than in the forum attending the trial despite the crush davus had doggedly held on to our seats near the front of the crowd dominating everything were pompeys troops wherever there was an elevated place temple steps or a bit of wall or ramp or pedestal the soldiers had already occupied it the night before a ring of troops completely encircled the forum at the various points of entry they pulled aside perfectly peaceable citizens to search for concealed weapons pompey himself was said to be in his stronghold in the treasury building from which he would not stir until a verdict was announced i felt as if i had awakened in some other city that morning a place ruled by a military autocrat except that autocrats do not allow public trials there was a sense of confusion and uncertainty in the air almost of unreality and yet everything proceeded smoothly milo and cicero had shown up before most of the crowd travelling in a plain closed litter so that their arrival went unnoticed which was no doubt as they wished it they stayed out of sight in the litter ringed by bodyguards until it was almost time for the trial to begin the three prosecutors arrived on foot to a great deal of cheering surrounded by an entourage of secretaries and bodyguards the officials of the court brought out three large urns these contained the wooden balls on which each potential juror had written his name balls were chosen by lot until eightyone jurors had been selected among them marcus cato i noticed after the speeches by the prosecution and the defence each side would be allowed to remove fifteen more jurors leaving fiftyone men to decide the verdict domitius called the court to order the prosecutors commenced with their arguments at once as cicero had predicted their three orations seemed unduly short more like synopses than fullblown speeches they were potent nonetheless in typical fashion the prosecutors divided various aspects of the case between them according to their skills and dispositions i knew little about valerius nepos but i had heard that his forte was narrative and so was not surprised that he gave the opening argument he described the actual incident with dramatic flourish using the full range of his ringing voice and dwelling on gruesome details to elicit groans and cries of outrage from the spectators his final lament was so full of grief that it seemed all he could do to keep from tearing out his hair nepos would have made quite a performer on the stage i thought bringing blind oedipus or the tormented ajax to life marc antony the tactician delivered the middle speech he made the case that milo had deliberately plotted to murder clodius citing evidence that milo had spies among clodiuss slaves and going over and over the complicated chronology of milos and clodiuss movements on the day of the murder antony was the right man for a speech that dwelled by necessity on such a concentration of details a more emotional speaker like nepos wailing over timetables would have risked looking absurd a staid orator like pompey would have put his listeners to sleep antonys blend of soldierly gruffness with an innate sincerity of purpose kept the jurors full attention appius claudius the dead mans nephew delivered the emotional finale a eulogy full of pathos seemingly overcome by grieј he was often choked with tears and had to struggle to regain his composure in a ringing summation he made proud references to the greatness of clodiuss forebears and to the poignant irony that he should have met such a brutal death on the famous road which appius claudius caecus had built and along which stood the tombs and shrines of so many members of his noble family during these speeches i looked to see the reactions of milo and cicero most defendants bring a horde of family members to cluster around them during the trial but milo sat alone his arms tightly crossed granted his parents were dead but where was his wife it would count against him that fausta cornelia was nowhere to be seen during her husbands ordeal given her reputation i could imagine the sort of jokes the clodians would come up with to explain her absence and what was milo thinking to show up at his own trial in a snowwhite toga without even a loose stitch much less a tear in it his hair looked freshly dipped and combed and his jaw was so cleanshaven that he must have seen his barber that very morning before he left his house i had to shake my head at such audacity even the always sardonic caelius at his trial had had the sense drummed into him by cicero to wear an old threadbare toga and to look at least a bit dishevelled and caeliuss parents had shown up in torn clothes with their eyes red from crying and baggy from lack of sleep a roman defendant is expected to look as wretched as he possibly can in order to play upon the sympathy of the jurors this is often merely a formality but everyone goes along with it out of respect for legal tradition by showing up looking as if he were paying court to a widow or posing for his portrait milo was deliberately thumbing his nose not only at the jury but at the whole judicial process perhaps this was one of the things on his advocates mind that day cicero looked uncommonly distracted and completely transformed from the previous night where was his excitement his ebullience his eyes were shifty his jaw tight and he gave a start at every unexpected noise from the crowd he fiddled with scraps of parchment scribbled notes on a wax tablet kept whispering to tiro and seemed hardly to listen to the prosecutors only once did he seem to come to life during antonys speech antony was trying to imply that milo paused to water his horses in bovillae to kill time while he waited for a report that clodius had left his villa and was on his way so that milo could be sure to pass clodius on the road in order to stage a deliberate attack on him to frame his accusation antony needed to establish the exact hour at which the incident took place and stressed the point by repeatedly asking when was clodius killed when i ask you when was clodius killed cicero in a loud voice quipped not nearly soon enough in the immediate silence that followed there was some scattered laughter but also expressions of shock among the jurors and then a sudden welling of outrage among the spectators ciceros icy grin vanished milo stiffened even antony who had faced barbarians in battle and had no cause to feel threatened by the crowd backed away from the rostra and turned pale i looked behind me to see what they saw a sea of upraised fists and angry shouting faces the fury on those faces was not of the opportunistic sort one sees on looters or soldiers it had a kind of fiery purity like the madness of religious ecstatics it was a fearsome thing even some of pompeys soldiers visibly flinched to see it these were clodiuss people the angry and dispossessed the degraded the hopeless they were a force to be reckoned with i thought in that instant that the trial was about to come to an abrupt end there would be a riot murder mayhem massive bloodshed no matter that pompeys troops were everywhere the crowd would swallow up the soldiers along with everyone else but even in the act of cursing and shaking their fists the clodians restrained their violence the climax of the day promised them a deeper satisfaction their dead leaders vindication and the final destruction of milo the soldiers banged the butts of their spears against the paving stones and clanged their swords against their greaves until the crowd eventually quieted down antony managed a smile the time in fact cicero was the tenth hour of the day the crowd roared with laughter ciceros face was like wax antony finished his speech appius claudius delivered his encomium to his uncle which drove much of the crowd and even some of the jurors to tears better that they should grieve than riot i thought and then it was time for cicero to speak surely it must be some sort of ruse i thought as cicero knocked his wax tablet to the ground and stumbled against his chair was he feigning clumsiness in a bid for sympathy from a hostile audience the same people who had been weeping only moments before began to laugh and make catcalls milo scowled crossed his arms tightly across his chest and rolled his eyes up to heaven tiro bit his lower lip and pressed his hands against the sides of his face then seemed to realize what he was doing drew back his hands and made his face like a statues ciceros voice shook as he began his speech it had quavered in just that way the first time i heard him speak in public at the trial of sextus roscius but that had been a lifetime ago and since then cicero had become the leading orator of his time moving from triumph to triumph even in his darkest days when clodius was working to have him exiled his defiance and sense of selfrighteousness had always given him a steady voice if not always steady friends but now his voice shook distinguished jurors distinguished what an opportunity you have today what a vital decision is yours to make yours to make and yours alone shall a good man an upstanding citizen an untiring servant of the state should he be forced to pine away in miserable hardship indeed shall rome herself be made to suffer endless ongoing humiliations or shall you put an end that is by your staunch courageous wise decision shall you put an end to the long persecution of both the man and his city by lawless hooligans there was another outburst from the crowd the noise was almost like a physical assault cicero appeared to quail before it shrinking back on the rostra where was the strutting cock who tended to swagger rather than fret before a hostile crowd i was still inclined to think that his timidity was some sort of pose what other possibility was there the furore at last quieted enough for him to continue when my client and myself when we first took up politics yes but when will you give it up shouted someone in the crowd not soon enough answered a chorus of voices to raucous laughter when we first took up politics cicero went on at a higher pitch we held high hopes that honourable rewards for honourable service would come our way instead we suffer a constant burden of fear milo has always been especially vulnerable for he has deliberately deliberately and bravely placed himself on the foremost i mean to say in the forefront in the struggle of true patriots against enemies of the state there was another outburst so loud it hurt my ears milo had sunk so low in his chair and hugged himself so tightly that he appeared to have melted his expression was one of utter disgust tiro flinched every time cicero stammered and began to bite his nails from that point on the roar of the crowd was almost constant whenever cicero did manage to make himself heard he seemed to be uttering confused fragments from more than one speech on several occasions he clearly lost his place muttered to himself and started at some point he had already covered his voice continually shook even knowing his general intention to accuse clodius of an ambush and to exonerate milo completely it was impossible for me to make any sense of his argument from the looks on their faces the jurors were equally confounded ciceros orations had roused many reactions in me over the years outrage at his willingness to twist the truth admiration approaching awe at his ability to construct a logical argument simple wonder at his prodigious ego grudging respect for his loyalty to his friends dismay at his shameless demagoguery for cicero was always ready to exploit his listeners religious sentiments and sexual prejudices to his ownends now i began to feel something i had never felt before something i would have thought impossible i began to feel embarrassed for cicero this should have been his finest hour when he defended sextus roscius and risked offending the dictator sulla he had been too young to know better inciting the people against catilina had been almost too easy destroying clodia in his speech for marcus caelius had been an act of personal vengeance this was a situation that required true bravery and heroic stamina if he could have stood his ground against the angry mob if he could have stared them down and by the sheer power of his oratory compelled them to listen what a crowning accomplishment that would have been whether he won the case or not he could have attained a kind of glory even in failure instead he was the very portrait of a man cowed by fear he stuttered averted his eyes broke out in a sweat stumbled over his lines he was like an actor crippled by stage fright no man could be blamed for being intimidated by that crowd but from cicero such a reaction was difficult to stomach the wretchedness ofhis performance robbed his words of any weight they might have possessed the few audible portions of his speech seemed disconnected forced artificial insincere i seemed to be watching a secondrate actor doing a poor parody of cicero more than feeling embarrassed i almost felt pity for him milo became increasingly agitated until he seemed about to come out of his skin he kept jumping towards tiro engaging him in whispered arguments milo i suspected wanted to call cicero from the rostra and speak extemporaneously in his own defence tiro managed to argue him out of it the crowd soon learned to make a game of their outbursts i have seldom seen a mass of people act with such seeming singlemindedness they would grow just quiet enough to allow cicero to be heard then would laugh when he stuttered or misspoke then would wait until the critical moment of the point he was making and let out a deafening roar their performance was uncanny as if orchestrated by an invisible hand the spirit of clodius himself seemed to guide them that day the debacle seemed to go on forever in fact it lasted for considerably less than the three hours allotted for the defence eventually cicero neared the end of his speech milo was born to serve his country surely it cannot be right that he should be forbidden to die within her boundaries then let him take his own life right now someone shouted distinguished jurors can you possibly see fit to banish him from our soil send a man such as milo into exile and he would be eagerly welcomed by every other city in the world then send him send him exile exile the word became a chant that echoed all through the forum cicero did not wait for the chant to die down in order to finish his speech he continued in a hoarse voice amid the growing roar of the crowd i strained to hear him urgently i ask you honourable jurors when you cast your votes be brave enough to act as you truly think is right do that and believe me your integrity and courage and sense of justice will surely please the one who chose this jury by fixing on the best and bravest and wisest men in rome was that then the ultimate appeal that a vote to acquit milo would be pleasing to the great one the sole consul and selector of judges and juries if that was his final argument it was just as well that ciceros voice was drowned out by the mob once the speeches were finished each side was allowed to excuse fifteen of the jurors this was done quickly as both prosecution and defence had already drawn up their lists of those they considered undesirable all that remained was for the fiftyone remaining jurors to vote each was given a tablet with wax on each side with the letter a for absolve stamped on one side and the letter c for condemn stamped on the other the juror wiped out one of the letters leaving the other to show his judgment these were collected before they were counted so that the vote of each juror was kept secret domitius presided over the counting of the tablets as they were separated into two groups from where i sat i could see that one group was about three times higher than the other domitius announced the results the vote to condemn was thirtyeight the vote to absolve was thirteen the defeat was crushing even so milo had gathered more support from the jury than i expected strangely enough i felt a sudden twinge of sympathy for him he was responsible for some of the darkest days of my life he had deliberately separated me from my family and treated me like an animal yet the time i had spent in captivity had also made me consider the harsh reality of the exiles existence ait off forever from his heartland from the places of his childhood and the people he loves from the only life he has known forbidden ever to return even in death i had had a taste of that despondency at milos hand now milos world was at an end just as i had almost felt pity for cicero i almost felt it for milo there was an outcry of triumph from the crowd expressionless milo rose stiffly from his chair and went directly to the closed litter in which he had arrived cicero looking dazed followed him in addition to their own bodyguards pompeys soldiers formed a cordon around the litter to ensure its safe passage out of the forum pompey must be pleased i thought after a shaky beginning on the first day of the trial he had managed to establish order and order of a sort had prevailed to the end the question of milo had been settled milo would trouble him no more and neither would cicero at least for a while now the great one could turn his attention to the glodian radicals what punishment would be appropriate for those who instigated the burning of the senate house rome craved law and order and rome was about to get it in the short term at least taverns reopened as soon as the trial was over the clodians would drink to celebrate milos supporters would drink to drown their misery i decided to stay behind locked doors over dinner i revealed to the family what i had discovered the previous night regarding milos responsibility for abducting eco and me and ciceros knowledge of it eco was not surprised bethesda and menenia were outraged diana began to cry and left the room we discussed the trial which had done the job of punishing milo for us he was already being penalized to the full extent of the law and there was nothing more that we could do to him as for cicero bethesda vowed to put an egyptian curse on him i myself was less certain about how to deal with him certainly there could be no more friendly commerce of any kind between our houses ever again i had come close to making a full break with cicero in the past now it was done but beyond that it was difficult to see what sort of satisfaction we might obtain against him at least for the time being we discussed and argued long into the night the lamps grew dim and the slaves refilled them we had eaten our fill but gradually grew hungry again bethesda produced another course we discussed and argued some more at some point i realized how inexplicably happy i was i was safe in my home in the heart of the city content with my family finally out of harms way was everyone else in rome like myself heaving a great sigh of relief the world had been turned upside down and given a great rattling shake soldiers had been given the run of a roman court a man who called himself sole consul was acting suspiciously like a dictator and cicero cicero had fallen apart during the most important speech of his life these were grave omens surely more meaningful and menacing than the usual run of omens those dubious fires and strange cloud formations seen in the sky by professional mystics but now i felt that the world was at last right side up again and my feet were finally back on solid ground the immediate overwhelming problem of milo had been taken care of however messily things could only get better even bethesda looked especially beautiful that night perhaps some of this was the glow of the wine or even the glow ofher warm cooking in my belly looking at her in the lamplight made me think of diana where was diana i would send davus to go and find her i thought but davus wasnt in the room either i would go and find her myself i knocked on the wall outside her curtained door there was no answer i thought she must be asleep or not in the room at all but as i pushed the curtain aside there was a shuffling noise the room was dimly lit by a single lamp diana seemed to be in the act of throwing a coverlet off her bed she slipped back onto the bed and sat against the wall papa what are you doing here daughter only a few moments ago you were weeping for all that eco and i suffered are you so unhappy to see me now oh papa its not that then what is it diana youve seemed so unhappy ever since i came back i might almost think you werent glad to see me at all i said it as a joke but the look on her face gave me pause whats the matter diana eco thinks its because you want to get married and leave home or dont want to get married and leave home oh papa she turned her face away have you at least talked to your mother about it whatever it is she shook her head diana i know ive been away and since i came back ive been more preoccupied than i should be but these are not normal times i hope things will be better now but your mother is always here and i know she cares mother would kill me diana whispered hoarsely oh shes the last person i can tell this took me aback was the problem really as great as diana imagined or was it a trifle that a young girl had blown out of all proportion as i wondered how to proceed i walked around her bed and glimpsed the chamber pot though i looked away from it almost at once the dim lamplight happened to fall on it in such a way that i saw its contents in an instant diana are you sick have you been throwing up she realized what i had seen and tried too late to push the pot out of sight with her foot at the same time i was startled by another sound behind me and turned to see davus how had he entered the room so quietly davus what are you doing here no one called you go away this doesnt involve you oh yes said diana it does no diana but it does involve davus papa it does then i realized the obvious so did bethesda i imagine who stood in the doorway wearing a look that could turn a man to stone xxxiii i needed a drink more than that i needed to get away from my house i could take only so much of diana weeping bethesda stamping her feet the broken minerva staring at me i did not want to overhear the whisper of my slaves saying whats to be done with her or whats to be done with him or i knew it all along where can a man go to forget his cares in the middle of the night i had not set foot in the place the poet catullus called the salacious tavern in almost exactly four years since the final day of another trial that of marcus caelius eco and i found it easily enough tramping through the warehouse district to the northwest of the palatine hill accompanied by his bodyguards without davus of course until we came to the upright pillar in the shape of a phallus and the door lit up by a phallusshaped lamp the place had not changed a bit it reeked of smoke from cheap lamp oil and the fumes of cheap wine the general roar was punctuated every now and again by the rattle of dice and the cries of winners and losers the few women in the place were clearly for sale most of the men appeared to be in a good mood insofar as the clientele of the salacious tavern had any interest in politics they were likely to be clodian sympathizers while eco and i looked for a bench to accommodate ourselves and our bodyguards i overheard several snatches of conversation cicero might as well have had his tongue cut out maybe thatll be next if pompey ever has the guts to make himself dictator and starts handing out some real justice the idea of milo heading off for massilia where hell stuff himself with mussels and wallow with gaulish whores what kind of punishment is that did antonys speech make any sense to you at all only a little more than ciceros i wept i tell you wept when his nephew talked about him dying alone and bleeding on the appian way he was a great man we finally found a place a serving boy brought us wine at once the vintage was as foul as the service was quick eco what am i going to do with them a good question papa how did it happen i think you know how its done papa you know what i mean is she absolutely certain about her condition she seems to be so was bethesda after she questioned her when did it happen papa the first time i mean assuming there was more than one occasion do you remember the day the contio turned into a riot and belbo was killed and the next day you and i decided to merge our households you brought your bodyguards along with you and gave me davus to replace belbo apparently that very first night he was under my roof oh no yes what in hades are you smiling at am i well its just at least davus wasnt my slave any longer when it happened technically thank the gods for that id given him to you to be your personal bodyguard so youre saying none of this is your concern no papa thats not what i meant im concerned of course but deciding what to do with davus is entirely up to you thank you very much the serving boy made a fortuitous appearance to refill our cups he saved my life that day you know i said whats that the riot the massacre in the forum when milo and caelius escaped dressed up like slaves i came very close to being killed myself it was davus who plucked me out of the crowd hes no coward thats for sure ill say it takes a brave man to fiddle with his masters daughter right under his roof and on his first day in the house what could he have been thinking what was he thinking with you mean not with his head diana claims its not his fault of course i think some of it must be his fault papa i know what she means and so do you she says that she was the one who initiated the matter you make it sound like a legal contract she may have initiated it but he was the one who should have refused i told you diana was starting to have an eye for young men i told you it was time for her to marry an eye for young men i nodded youll have to admit davus is just what they like big as hercules handsome as apollo and as stupid as an ox an ox in rut at that where in hades is that serving boy do you feel like doing some gambling papa i had to laugh out loud eco i feel like ive been doing nothing but gambling for months now i think id like to stop gambling for awhile and just drink exactly just drink the serving boy arrived we complained that the taverns cups were absurdly small he made a face to show that he had heard this before so diana is absolutely certain said eco his speech was beginning to slur yes i didnt inquire for the precise details eco but its been over three months since the two of them met and bethesda says that dianas schedule is considerably more reliable than the roman calendar no leapmonths for some reason eco found this hilarious i waited for him to finish cackling anyway its all a great mess so you mean all the time davus was with us on the appian way he was thinking about diana no doubt just as you were missing menenia and i and afterwards when we were abducted and he was thrown from his horse and then came to his senses and went back to the house yes eco the two of them were under the same roof every day all day and can you believe that bethesda never noticed of course bethesda was distraught over the two of us and busy managing pompeys guards and trying to keep the household running diana was probably her least worry still how could bethesda not have smelled something brewing i think what this means papa is that diana has proved herself to be more clever and conniving than her mother actually i think i knew that already yes diana outwitted bethesda she hid her trysts with davus all those days we were gone and all the days weve been back please eco i dont want to think about it and she also managed to hide her condition from bethesda which was quite a feat of course that couldnt go on forever all this time shes been growing more and more miserable and davus has been acting like the treasury slave caught with his hand in the coffer so to speak yes i could tell he was guilty of something its a terrible betrayal isnt it he was supposed to be guarding me and my family and instead papa davus is a man and diana like it or not is a woman davus is my slave and diana is my daughter meto was a slave before you adopted him and bethesda was a slave before you set her free and married her but eco was only a little boy and bethesda was carrying diana what was i to do have my daughter born a slave you could set davus free make him a citizen then he could out of the question reward him for what hes done then the only alternative short of putting him to death is to sell him preferably to a new master somewhere far far away or you could sell him to the galleys or mines if you really wanted to punish him hes young and strong enough that hed probably survive a few years of that most men would have had him beaten senseless and put in chains the moment they found out and done something almost as bad if not worse to the daughter involved in the old days a good father would have had both parties put to death on the spot and never have blinked an eye eco stop oh all this smoke is giving me a headache i dont want to think about it any more look isnt that i peered through the orange reek of hazy lamplight over there in the corner it is who would have thought it i got up and walked not entirely in a straight line across the room sitting alone in the corner was tiro exercising your rights as a freedman to go out drinking and whoring in the middle of the night i said surely cicero wouldnt approve tiro looked up at me bleakly but didnt speak the atmosphere in this place can hardly be good for your health i said and this wine would rot anybodys stomach is there room on that bench for me i cant stop you from sitting wherever you want citizen tiro lets have no hard feelings between you and me i put my arm around him gordianus youre drunk and you will be too soon enough do you come here often he finally smiled a bit every now and then sometimes i just have to get away and sometimes i saw that he was looking at one of the women for sale tiro you dog are you telling me that you have a secret life that cicero wouldnt approve of why not hes done things behind my back that i dont approve of hasnt he gordianus if i had known at the time if there had been any way for me to stop it no tiro not another word about that not tonight i have too much else on my mind that im trying to forget i summoned the serving boy to refill tiros cup i couldnt believe your masters performance today hes not my master any longer you know that sorry habit what in hades was wrong with him he seemed so sure of himself last night so confident he was pure cicero i wanted to strangle him when you saw him yes but hes been up and down for days now giddy and sure of himself one moment blind with despair the next you have no idea how this crisis weighed on him how many friends deserted him over milo how shabbily pompey and caesar have been treating him you know his achilles heel his digestion hes hardly been able to eat a thing for days he wakes up in the middle of the night with cramps its been a terrible ordeal a crushing burden what he allowed milo to do to you i know you said not to speak of it but i have to that was out of character for him and you know it just as out of character as what happened today thank the gods its over at least ive seen cicero under pressure but ive never seen any orator fell apart as he did today what a spectacle you sound as though you enjoyed it gordianus oddly enough i actually felt a bit sorry for him but a great many people appeared to relish it that mob cicero was right to be afraid of them pompeys troops were there to keep order oh really and would they have protected cicero if someone had started throwing stones at him what do you mean who knows what secret orders pompey gave to his men i cant believe pompey was ready to be rid of milo hed just as soon be rid of cicero too if there was an easy way would his soldiers have defended cicero if it had come to that or would they have looked the other way just for a few moments can you think of a more convenient way to get rid of cicero for good with no blame attached to the great one himself you shake your head gordianus but believe me cicero had good reason to be frightened for his life today he simply panicked then something like that oh it was excruciating to watch yes i saw you squirming all through the speech and milo was practically frothing at the mouth now he talks as if its ciceros fault that he was convicted thats nonsense he says they should have explained the full circumstances and argued for his technical innocence no matter how embarrassing it might have looked or how unlikely my head was muddled with wine tiro seemed to be echoing something cicero had said the night before i hadnt understood cicero either what are you talking about technical innocence and i know what youll ask next was the speech really that good thats the truly painful thing all the hours we put into that speech and then to have it blown away like dust in the wind it just might have got milo off who knows you can judge for yourself when we publish it therell have to be revisions of course then the world can see ciceros case for milo laid out in all its perfection without the distraction of that howling mob alas too late for milo tiro what was that you said about by hercules theres someone i dont care to see it was good talking to you gordianus as he rose from the bench i squinted through the orange haze to see who had arrived i didnt recognize him at first until i heard someone call his name philemon i felt an impulse to introduce myself i looked around for eco but couldnt find him in the haze was i that drunk at last i spotted him off in a little anteroom playing at dice faintly above the roar i heard him cry menenias name for luck philemon was looking for a place to sit i waved him over do i know you citizen i couldnt blame him for being wary not yet but we have something in common we both like cheap whores and rancid wine a bit more than that sit ill buy you a cup id rather you bought me a whore maybe i will i suppose it wasnt easy doing without for all that time what while i was stuck in milos villa at least that swine will never spend another holiday there i suppose not have you finished that cupalready you must have another philemon was behind me in inebriation but he quickly caught up he seemed to revel in repeating the story that had made him one of the prosecutions chief witnesses he launched into the tale with no prompting from me the wine seemed to loosen his lips all right he said at one point the way i told it in court i made us out to be a bit more heroic than we were there ive admitted it what do you mean well its true enough that when we came upon eudamus and birria and realized what they were up to boasting about trying to kill clodius we shouted at them to stop yes and then you said you and your friends rushed at them but they beat you back and pursued you he laughed sheepishly right except that we never rushed at them i mean this was eudamus and birria grinning and covered with blood rush at them i think not we turned tail and ran and they came after us its nothing to be ashamed of i assured him no but try telling it that way in front of a crowd of a few thousand people did you sweeten the truth about anything else he shook his head then shuddered you cant imagine it being tied up at the mercy of creatures like that my blood was like iced water the first big fight they had when they marched us through bovillae i thought id empty my bowels a fight what do you mean an argument among themselves pretty fierce i thought maybe theyd kill each other and leave us alone something about where to go next and what to do about clodius i suppose they were arguing over what to do with his body but his body was already gone senator tedius had arrived on the scene loaded it into his litter and sent it on to rome ah yes thats right maybe thats what they were arguing about then wondering where the body had gone i suppose that gave them a start yes i suppose thats what milo was so furious about when they brought him the news what do you think he wanted them to bring back clodiuss head for a trophy he appears to have ended up with clodiuss ring that should have been enough id think i imagined eudamus or birria slipping it off the corpses finger i swallowed hard i wonder if milo intends to take the ring to massilla with him a comfort for his exile philemon wasnt listening yes senator tedius i saw him testify at the trial today we passed him in the road you know between bovillae and the place where milo was waiting just sitting by the side of the road with his bodyguards looking pleased with the world youd think he might have helped us he thought you were the bandits whod killed clodius and that milos men had simply rounded you up ha its a joke of the gods isnt it did you ask him for help a lot of good that would have done he practically saluted those two monster gladiators as we passed by i felt like a trussedup gaul in some generals triumphal parade maybe you should have appealed to his daughter for help his daughter philemon looked at me blearily and shook his head i took it i had offended him by suggesting he might have appealed to a woman for help even fathers of errant daughters and husbands of imperious wives must go home some time and so before the first hour of the day eco and i departed from the shelter of the salacious tavern and made our way up the palatine hill i remember very little of that walk except that far too much of it was far too steep like old sextus tedius labouring up the appian way i kept having to sit and catch my breath growing older is a torment and being drunk is a comfort only to a point after which it becomes a torment too with sunrise would come a new day everything would be put back as it was eco and menenia and the twins would return to the house on the esquiline i would send home pompeys guards with heartfelt thanks and a sigh of relief of course some things could not be so easily undone at least the crisis of the last few months was over i washed my hands of everyone concerned milo clodia fulvia cicero and their respective satellites could all join clodius in hades an end had been put to that story for good so i thought wending my way up the palatine hill it was that hour of day when a man can still see only dimly though dawn is near at hand but in my befuddled state i didnt even realize that i was still in the dark or that a light would soon be breaking part four ring xxxiv it can be fixed of course said the artisan but but it will cost me i said that goes without saying the materials the labour the highly trained labour i remind you these things involve considerable expense then why the hesitation he shook his head i cant guarantee that the work will keep in fact to be honest with you i dont think that the breaks in the statue can be repaired in a fully satisfactory manner satisfactory in a way that would be both artistically pleasing and structurally sound you see if you look here at the point where the break began you can see the traces of a tiny fissure that was there to start with youre saying that the statue had a flaw all along oh yes here where the metals so thin see how the lip of the break shears in a different pattern that shows there was already a thin spot with a hairline crack you would never have noticed it from the outside of course it looked perfectly sound but it was obviously cast with a flaw granted no statue should be pushed from its pedestal but given such an unfortunate event this was the weakest point and this is where the breakage inevitably occurred then it ran up along this thin spot where the folds of the goddesss robes are thinnest then across the top of her hips after all the bloodshed i had seen in my life it seemed foolish to be squeamish about a statue but there was something gruesome about the scarred chipped metal that showed along the rupture that had torn her in half and something distasteful about examining her so intimately from the inside out on the surface she was so serenely perfect gleaming seemingly indestructible on the hollow inner surface she was all a mass of protruding plugs and rough spots and blisters and all the time she had towered on her lofty pedestal overlooking my garden radiating wisdom there had been a terrible flaw inside her a murderous mob had knocked her from her pedestal and the flaw had torn her apart now the artisan was telling me that there was no satisfactory way to put her back together again but i cant just leave her lying here in the garden like this staring up at me every time i pass wisdom in two pieces with weeds growing up around her the statue could always be melted down of course you wouldnt recover more than a small fraction of the value i shook my head out of the question the statue like the house was a legacy of my old patrician patron lucius claudius cicero himself had envied her melt her down never but what was to be done i had slept for only a few hours after returning from the tavern but the moment i awoke to the exclusion of all other problems my mind had settled on the minerva nothing would really seem right until she was back on her pedestal the artisan rubbed his chin thoughtfully there was said to be no man in rome who knew more about casting bronze he was a small bearded fellow a greek the property of a foundry owner for whom i had once solved a problem involving a missing slave and a statue that seemed too heavy you might be able to make a bust out of her the greek suggested what if you made a clean cut straight across below her breasts it was clear that the fellow might be a skilled artisan but he was no artist nor did he seem to have any religious respect for the statue at all i suppose it was a hazard of his work dealing so much with the malleability and tensile strength of various alloys that he should lose touch with the mystery inside the metal i simply want her put back into one piece again can it be done or not oh it can be done the greek turned aside for a moment i knew he was rolling his eyes at my roman wilfulness but youll be able to see the patch if you look for it and it wont hold forever a sharp knock an earthquake lets do it as i said it will be expensive are you authorized to bid for your master i am then lets bargain the lowest figure the man would settle for was still too much for the household coffers to bear but i would get the money somehow i dismissed him and stepped from the garden into my study what was next for the day i felt surprisingly energetic for having whiled away so many drunken hours the night before and peculiarly sanguine considering the storm clouds that had burst in my own home when such a bright mood comes to a man of my years i think it is best to enjoy it without question pompeys guards had already left while i slept eco and menenia were busy transporting their household back to the esquiline it was remarkable how many objects had gravitated from their house to mine during their stay i would miss seeing the twins toys little painted ships and carved chariots and egyptian board games with brightly coloured pebbles but i would not miss tripping over them bethesda felt obliged to oversee the move she had apparently said whatever she had to say to diana the night before diana herself stayed out of sight davus had apparently decided that there was an urgent need for a lookout on the roof and had stationed himself there conveniently out of the way i clapped my hands one of the slaves who was helping eco stopped and looked into the room do you know where my daughter is i said in her room i think master he looked uncomfortable they all knew about diana by now of course go and tell her i wish to see her yes master my heart sank when she stepped into the room she looked much too haggard for a girl of seventeen who was carrying a child i felt many things anger apprehension regret but nothing as strong as the impulse to put my arms around her and simply stand that way for a moment pressing her to me it was diana who broke the embrace and stepped away averting her eyes was it awful after i left last night i said mother you mean she managed a little smile not as awful as i expected she blustered and shrieked at first but once she calmed down she acted more disappointed than angry i dont understand her she was born a slave herself now she acts as if i was born to marry a patrician and ive spoiled it it is precisely because your mother was born a slave that she wants you to marry well i suppose today shes simply ignoring me i sighed i know how that feels all too well but diana how is your health i know less than i should of whats to be expected with such things your mother would know that was her first concern after her tantrum last night she asked me a lot of questions everything seems to be as it should be though i do feel wretched much of the time thats been the worst tiling about all this worrying and wanting to talk to her about it and wanting to talk to you papa and being afraid to at least thats over i fiddled with a stylus perhaps youre not fit for this pregnancy again im woefully ignorant of specifics but im sure your mother knows of ways to no papa i dont want to end it what is it that you do want diana papa dont you understand im in love with davus she shuddered and blinked her lips trembled diana please dont cry any more your eyes are red enough as it is but whatever idea you may have in your mind concerning davus dismiss it but davus and i impossible diana but why not mother was a slave you married her didnt you and that was because she was pregnant with me wasnt it meto was a slave when he was a little boy and eco was hardly better a street urchin but you adopted them why should it be any different diana no the tears came at full flood oh youre no better than she is what hypocrites you both are well im not a vestal virgin you cant bury me alive just because i love a man im not ashamed that im carrying his child why dont you yell a bit louder so they can hear you at ciceros house now i suppose youll go running from the room no why should i it doesnt matter where i am im miserable youre a man you cant know how miserable i am id want to die if it wasnt for the baby so much for my sanguine mood diana well talk more about this when i get back where are you going the day is still young i have an errand to run down the appian way if nothing else it will give me an excuse to spend another night away from this house diana retreated back to her room i stepped into the garden avoided minervas accusing stare and climbed the ladder to the roof i came upon davus near the front of the house sitting with his arms around his knees when he heard me he gave such a start i thought he might fall to the street below by hercules belbo be careful davus he mumbled hurriedly righting himself and standing what davus master not belbo oh of course what was i thinking belbo had the common sense to be careful on a rooftop and he never took advantage of a member of my family oh master davus dropped to his knees those in the room below must have flinched at the concussion he bowed his head and clasped his hands have mercy on me dont torture me master kill me outright if you must torture is worse for big strong fellows like me every slave knows that little weaklings are tortured for a while and then they die but with a man like me it could go on for days and days im not afraid to die master but i beg you and how would you prefer to be executed davus he turned pale and swallowed cut off my head master that is not the part of you which has offended me he shuddered and looked up at me with wide eyes dont geld me master i couldnt stand to be a eunuch oh have pity on me stop davus stop stop stop whatever am i going to do with you do you seriously imagine that i might have you killed what else can i hope for master its the best punishment i can expect then what are you doing here master why are you still here waiting for your fate why havent you jumped off the roof and run away you wouldnt have much chance of escaping but its better than death stow away on a boat leaving ostia go into exile like milo why didnt you run away last night because yes because of what davus whats kept you here to face your punishment master must you make me say it its because of her diana i cant leave as long as shes here where else would i go what would be the point i should die without her oh davus i shook my head minerva lay in pieces in my household and venus reigned supreme we set out on the appian way at the sixth hour of the day when the sun was straight overhead pompeys stableman agreed to lend me horses after i reminded him who i was and told him i still had business to do for his master this was a small harmless he since my business with pompey was done or so i thought at the time the stableman with a broad grin brought out three horses i was startled to see that they were the very same horses we had ridden before all three mounts it turned out had returned to the stable together and riderless on the day we were attacked i felt at once reassured and a little apprehensive to be setting out from rome astride the same beast as before i was not sure what to make of the omen but i was determined to go ahead the objective of the trip was simple i wanted to collect mopsus and androcles the two stableboys i had acquired from fulvia i left eco behind and took only davus with me the third horse was for the boys to share on the ride back i expected that we would spend the night at the inn in bovillae davus was as quiet as a mute until we passed the monument of basilius he wore a deep frown and grew increasingly agitated master master are you sure sure of what davus are you sure that you want me with you why not one of the other bodyguards are you afraid of the horse davus you cant claim to have no experience of riding now this is your second trip on the same horse this beast threw you true but when a mans beenthrown the only thing to do is to get back on its not the horse master i like this horse actually i think she trusts me lets hope you give her no cause to regret that davus frowned besides i went on i could hardly leave you at home in my absence given the circumstances could i you mean because of your daughter no because of my wife i shouldnt care to return home and find that bethesda had killed you while i was gone davus swallowed hard still master i dont understand why youre taking me with you just the two of us i dont quite understand that myself reason has fled i give myself over to impulse we shall see where the road takes us but master we already know that do we it leads yonder to mount alba i laughed out loud what a remarkable wit you have davus davus laughed too but only halfheartedly was that because he feared me or because he did not quite grasp the joke it was springtime on the appian way the weather was mild and there was birdsong on the air the grass was green along the road and spangled with flowers slaves and oxen laboured in the fields there was a great deal of traffic in both directions sheep and cattle being led to market messengers on horseback the utters and carriages of the rich the whole world seemed to be awakening from a cold dream of winter i was hungry by the time we passed through bovillae but i decided to press on to clodiuss villa as we passed the altar of jupiter i caught a glimpse of felix sitting against an oak tree dozing in the dappled shade we passed the road leading up to the new house of the vestals and farther on on the opposite side of the way the shrine of the good goddess there appeared to be a gathering of women inside to judge from the utters and carriages and idle attendants outside as we passed i heard chanting from within and recognized felicias whimsical singsong perhaps nothing much had changed in her world despite the bloody scene that had unfolded before her eyes and all the commotion it had caused we approached clodiuss villa this time by the road leading up to it and were seen and challenged long before we reached the top when a group of very roughlooking slaves barred our way i produced the scrip from fulvia transferring ownership of the two stableboys fortunately one of the slaves could read if barely he slowly mouthed each word then handed the square of parchment back to me good riddance i say those two are nothing but trouble always getting above themselves taking them back to the city are you thats my intention he shook his head therell be no end of trouble for them to get into there well come on theyll be in the stable i imagine the boys remembered us at once they seemed especially delighted to see davus or the elephant as mopsus called him when i told them they no longer belonged to their mistress but to me they were puzzled at first but together they mounted the third horse readily enough as we set out they seemed suddenly to realize that they were leaving for good mopsus turned about and hooked his thumbnail under his front teeth to make a clicking sound at the older slaves they were leaving behind goodbye you nogood drunkards his little brother copied him and the insults degenerated into references to various bodily functions the slaves standing in the road watching the departure feigned outrage and pretended to look about for stones to throw some of them laughed out loud how had i described to bethesda the new acquisitions for the household two highspirited boys and very clever theyll put new life in the house that was before i realized that new life was already on the way thanks to diana and davus and i had assumed that the woman who tamed pompeys bodyguards would have no trouble controlling two boys now i began to wonder davus seemed finally to relax a bit i realized that he felt safer with mopsus and androcles along surely i would not try to murder him in front of two laughing boys it was late in the afternoon when we returned to bovillae i wanted nothing more than some of the hostesss excellent cooking and a reasonably clean place to sleep we would make an early bed and be up and ready to leave before dawn at first i thought that our hostess had lost weight and changed her hair somehow then i realized it was a different woman behind the counter she had the same eyes but was thinner and prettier or would have been except for her drawn expression i told her we needed accommodation for the night youre early for that she said smiling wanly the first of the day so you can have first pick is there much choice not really its all one room but some folks prefer to be against the wall instead of out in the middle or closer to the stairs or the window come up and ill show you then you can bring up your things to mark your places i followed her up the stairs the upper floor of the inn was much as i expected a single room with a few small windows and some pallets for sleeping this will do i said davus take the boys and see that the horses are properly tended to at the stable up the way yes master he clomped heavily down the stairs mopsus and androcles slipped past him and flew down the steps as if they were all in a race the woman moved to the head of the stain and smiled wistfully after them i have a little boy myself she said only a baby well if youre satisfied then ill be this must have been the window where you stood and watched i said walking to the open shutters and gazing out what do you mean after the battle was over and you dared to come out from under the bedding your sister told me that you went to the window to have a look and saw that everyone had already left except for sextus tedius who must have just arrived i peered out the window imagining the scene dead bodies and pools of blood scattered about the litter and its attendants sextus tedius and his daughter discovering clodiuss body who are you there was a tremor in her voice my name is gordianus i came this way on a mission from the widow fulvia in februarius i spoke to your sister she told me what she had learned from you about the battle between milo and clodius you are the innkeepers widow arent you she relaxed a little yes my sister told me about you and about your handsome young bodyguard that must have been him with you just now i smiled yes i remember she took a liking to davus it seems shes not the only one whats that never mind tell me did you really go all the way to rhegium to stay with an aunt the woman looked at me cautiously no thats just what we decided to tell people then your sister wasnt completely candid when i asked if i could talk to you i was out of my head for a long time my sister wanted to protect me if she told you that you couldnt see me that was the truth i wanted very much to ask you about what you saw that day so did others my sister kept them all away she wasnt afraid to testify to the court herself someone would have to come forward she said but she protected me and now the trial is over and here you are again back from rhegium so to speak yes back from rhegium she gave me a weak smile it feels good to be here to be working again i always loved it before working with marcus what you saw that day she shook her head i still cant talk about it not at all she gripped the stair railing and drew several quick breaths i never talk about it i only told my sister about it once right after it happened after that neither of us could bear to talk about it again i understand her sisters judgment had been correct the woman would have been useless to the court as a witness she was shaking now it was hard to imagine her giving testimony in the heated atmosphere that had stifled even ciceros tongue she looked down the stairway even now every time i go down these stairs i think ill find him as i found him that day your husband yes all bloody and still do you need my help to walk down the stairs perhaps but not yet i dont want to move shall i go find your sister or her husband no they must be sick of me by now but not half as sick of me as i am of them she said with sudden vehemence the way they moved in and took over this place all for the sake of my little boy they say keeping it in trust for him but they act as if its their tavern now as if marcus never existed they wont even say his name for fear of upsetting me oh if only everything could be as it was before curse milo and clodius both curse the gods i thought she would weep but her eyes remained dry she steadied herself and breathed deeply what was it you wanted to know i wrinkled my brow can you speak about that day or not why dont you ask me and find out i looked out the window up the road davus and the boys had finished stabling the hones and were playing some sort of game with a leather ball all three of them laughing like children what sort of father would davus make i looked back to the widow what was left to ask her it seemed that all the missing details had been supplied the events of that day had been discovered one by one and put in order the incident on the appian way had been fully documented and justice had been dispensed her testimony had not been needed after all still what did you see when you looked out this window after the battle she lowered her eyes bodies blood the senator and his daughter and their retinue the senators litter eudamus and birria milos men no they were all gone i dont know where they were off chasing a fellow called philemon and some friends of his who had the bad fortune to stumble upon the scene oh i never heard about that your sister didnt tell you philemon testified on the same day she did the widow shook her head she was afraid of upsetting me i suppose go on what else do you want to know she had a grim determined look on her face you looked out this window you saw tedius and his daughter the litter the retinue and clodius yes they were leaning over him and you knew it was clodius yes how she shrugged by his face you could see his face he must have been lying on his back then yes he was on his back looking up at them the skin prickled at the base of my skull what did you say clodius was on his back looking up at the senator and his daughter you mean his eyes were open and staring in death no i mean what i say he was looking at them and they were looking at him she frowned trying to remember they talked a bit back and forth then tedius and his daughter helped clodius stand up and get into the litter i looked down at the road picturing the scene then turned to the widow it was possible of course that grief had made her mad are you saying that clodius was alive yes only barely i suppose but your sister made it seem that clodius was dead when tedius found him that was the way she told it to me and to the court she said that you saw the senator and his daughter put clodius into their litter but she said nothing to indicate that clodius was still alive i tried to remember exactly what she had said he was alive the widow said probably she misunderstood me i was raving when i told her what had happened what id seen i hardly knew what i was saying perhaps the way i told it to her it was unclear perhaps you and your sister seem to have been unclear with each other on a number of points but sextus tedius told the story the same way he made no mention of clodius being alive when he found him but clodius was alive he was stiff and limping and bloody and they had to help him into the litter but he was alive i assure you unless dead men can walk and talk he was still alive and my husband was dead lying at the foot of these stairs why are you doing this to me suddenly she turned and ran down the stairs weeping at last i looked out the window staring hard at the empty road as if by concentration alone i could conjure up the lemures of the dead to reenact their final moments of life oh what a grand and terrible power that would be xxxv it was twilight when we arrived at the house of sextus tedius i was very hungry and very tired of riding i told the boys to watch the horses and sent davus ahead of me to rap on the door the doorkeeper took a long time to answer and even longer to confer with his master and return at last i was invited inside sextus tedius received me in the same room as before the windows were opened to show the town of aricia below a pool of pale blue shadows surmounted by rooftops glinting with the last of the days sunlight tedius sat upright in his oldfashioned backless chair despite the warmth of the day a blanket was thrown over his legs it was the left leg that was crippled i remembered he ran a dark leathery hand through his white hair and appraised me shrewdly i remember you he said pompeys man the one who came around asking all the questions not all the questions i should have asked apparently have you come here again on behalf of the great one as i believe you put it before in a way yes pompey hired me to find out everything i could about the incident on the appian way i thought i had done that but i appear to have been mistaken speak plainly i intend to i hope youll do the same sextus tedius he raised an eyebrow at this but said nothing is your daughter here i asked i cant imagine that my daughters whereabouts could be of any concern to you nonetheless i should like very much to speak to both of you together he lowered his white brows and studied me for a long moment you know something dont you i know more now than i did an hour ago i should like to know everything ah to know everything what a curse that would be for a mortal tedia he raised his voice tedia come into the room and join us his daughter emerged from the hallway she was dressed as i had seen her before without jewellery or makeup and wearing a white linen mantle over her head tied with a blue ribbon at the back she stood rigidly upright with a grim look on her face tedia always eavesdrops on my conversations said sextus tedius it makes it much easier for me to remember all the details afterwards my father and i have no secrets from one another she stood behind him and laid her hands on his shoulders i saw your father testify at the trial repeating the same story he told to me i thought you were determined to keep him away from the trial tedia in the end it seemed better to make an appearance she said clodius was sent back to rome in our litter after all to have refused to explain how that occurred could have excited comment i see and the story you told tedius was entirely credible after all you merely left out certain details such as the fact that clodius was alive when you came upon him how do you know that said tedia she began to knead her fathers shoulder in the same way that i had seen her nervously wring her hands at our first meeting if one of our slaves has talked your slaves are loyal there was another witness not at the trial no the witness was away from rome that day down in rhegium i was told sextus tedius winced almost imperceptibly his daughter had squeezed his shoulder too hard clodius deserved to die she said perhaps yet i saw you weep when fulvia testified a woman can feel pity for a widow without feeling sorry that her husband is dead i see and how exactly did clodius die i held my breath i had no means to compel her to speak if she chose not to her father reached up and clutched one of her hands with a gesture of restraint but she seemed not to notice her face was adamant i killed him she said but how why why her voice rose because a more impious man never blighted the earth you must have learned of his crimes when you were pestering everyone on this mountain he cut down the sacred grove of jupiter merely to add some rooms to his house imagine evicting a god to make room for himself and what he did to the vestals was unspeakable driving them from their ancient house defrauding them treating them like common business rivals to be cheated and driven into the dirt did he think he could commit such crimes and go unpunished publius clodius had been committing many crimes of many sorts for years without being punished i said all the more reason that the time had come said tedia sternly he was alive when you came upon him at the inn very much alive but near death surely how can you say that were you there to judge i shall tell you how it was daughter sextus tedius scowled and shook his head father i have nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear it began as my father told you we were on our way to rome we came upon milo in the aftermath of the skirmish he lied and told us there were bandits about i was afraid and wanted to turn back but my father insisted that we press on and so we did the goddess vesta was guiding us that day i have no doubt of that we arrived at the inn in bovillae and saw the carnage there i thought i would faint from fright i felt such a tremor and a coldness inside me now i know it was only the goddess stirring in me preparing me for the task at hand there were bodies scattered in the road blood everywhere it was strange to come to a place one has seen so many times and passed without a thought such a common familiar ordinary place and to witness such horror and devastation everything seemed unreal as if i were delirious with fever i helped my father from the litter and we walked among the bodies there was no one to be helped they were all dead then we heard a voice from inside the tavern a thin weak cry for help clodius appeared at the door his clothes were torn he was wounded he clutched a bloodsoaked rag to his shoulder he spoke through gritted teeth help me he said all the others had died defending him you see said sextus tedius his men were loyal no one can deny that he staggered out of the tavern tedia continued he tripped and dropped to his knees then rolled onto his back groaning and keeping his shoulder from touching the ground he seemed comfortable that way lying on his back we leaned over him his voice was hoarse and strained hardly more than a whisper take me home he said not back to the villa theyll look for me there take me to rome in your litter hide me from them from the bandits said my father and clodius laughed a hissing hateful laugh what perfect white teeth he had the only bandits on this road are milos gladiators he said they chased me here and tried to kill me but something scared them off quickly hide me in your litter so we helped him to his feet and then into the litter i could see that my father was uncertain what to do next i drew him aside where the slaves couldnt hear tedius grunted id have sent him back to his villa whether he wanted to go there or not but milo was in the way i had no intention oftrying to slip by milo making myself a spy in the service of that jackal clodius nor did i wish to hand clodius over to that liar milo perhaps if wed left him there hed simply have bled to death or milos men would have come back and finished him off but there he was in our litter getting blood on the pillows i made the decision said tedia her voice was like cold iron it came to me all at once i happened to look up at the inn and saw her in the window of the upper storey her face seemed to hover there like a portrait in a frame i saw the face of vesta and i knew what to do i shook my head the face you saw was the poor terrified widow of the innkeeper tedia looked at me disparagingly how do you know what i saw were you there i saw no point in contradicting her how did you kill him she removed her hands from her fathers shoulders and reached up to undo the blue ribbon that secured the linen mantle at the back of her head she wound the ends of the ribbon around her strong supple hands and pulled it taut i killed him with this i only wish the goddess could have watched but i had to do it inside the litter out of sight the slaves were there they had no business seeing i climbed into the litter and moved behind him father climbed in after me and we let the curtains drop i slipped the ribbon over his neck father held him from the front we could never have managed it if he hadnt already been weakened by his wounds said tedius matteroffactly look at us an old crippled man and a woman but we managed it i saw the body i said the wound at his shoulder was deep he probably would have died anyway dont be so sure said tedius ive seen plenty of battles and plenty of soldiers who looked to be in worse condition than clodius did who nonetheless recovered there was a surprising amount of life still left in that jackal i know i watched the last of it leave him unmolested he might very well have survived the trip back to rome he would still be alive today you claim credit for his death then you seem to be proud of it im proud of my daughter yes you have a son dont you gordianus i remember he was with you when you last came here well im like every other man i would like to have had a son to watch him grow to manhood to see him prove his courage in battle and show his convictions in the forum but i had no son i only had a daughter but that daughter has always been faithful to me and never disappointed me and when her mother died she willingly took her place no man could ask for a better daughter and now look what shes done she accomplished what no man was able to do either by battle or by using the law she put an end to publius clodius an enemy of the state a menace to decency a blight on the republic a disgrace to his ancestors and it was my daughter who finally put an end to him the gods and goddesses manifest their wills in mysterious ways gordianus theyd had enough of publius clodius and snuffed him out who am i an old lame senator to question their choice of a vessel i studied the two of them so grimly selfsatisfied models of stern roman virtue why didnt you push his body from the litter and leave him by the road then why did you send him on to rome the litter was polluted by his blood and offal said tedia i could never enter it again it was his last request of us to send him home her father said its as i said to you before once a man is dead what use is there in despising him no i wouldnt leave him lying in the road like a dead dog i sent his body on to rome and told the bearers to deliver it with great respect into the care of his widow his ring i said remembering his body arrived without his ring did you take it from him tedia lowered her eyes that was a mistake i thought it would be pleasing to the goddess you were the woman who went to the house of the vestals and offered clodiuss ring for a prayer of thanksgiving yes i suddenly understood the strange look i had seen on philemons face in the salacious tavern i had asked why he had not appealed to tediuss daughter for help when he was herded in bondage up the appian way past the place where tedius was resting below the house of the vestals what i had taken for offence was merely puzzlement philemon had never seen tedia for tedia had been up at the house of the vestals you hid your face from the virgo maxima i said you disguised your voice yes otherwise the vestals would have known me werent you proud of what youd done i felt no need to boast or show my face i was a mere vessel for the goddess and it was to the goddess alone that i wished to offer the ring but the virgo maxima refused to take it she said that such an offering would be impious i shook my head everyone thinks it was milos wife who tedia laughed i could tell she was not accustomed to laughing fausta cornelia that blasphemous cow its hard to imagine her making a prayer for anything except perhaps for the gods to bring her a new lover every day what a great joke that anyone should have mistaken her for me where is the ring now why do you ask because i should like to return it to the family you admit that taking it was a mistake the goddess has no use for it to keep it as a trophy surely would be hubris a curse on your own house tedia considered this and seemed about to speak but her father shook his head the ring is the only real evidence against us all that weve told you is only a story from our own lips your witness at the tavern that girl in the window i suppose may have seen that clodius was still alive but she couldnt have seen into the litter no one saw the actual moment of his death except my daughter and me the vestals know that a woman brought them clodiuss ring but they never saw the womans face only the fact that we possess the ring offers any proof of what we did why should we give it up to you gordianus what will you tell the family of clodius that you recovered the ring from the true killers of their beloved a woman and a lame old man shall we have to suffer their revenge what should i tell them that i happened to find it by the side of the road think tedia of the tears you shed when you heard the testimony of fulvia do you really want to keep the ring she took a breath and began to move but her father clutched her arm only if you make an oath gordianus said tedius no promises there will be if you want the ring youll make an oath never to repeat what you heard here today and in return we shall give it to you think gordianus what purpose will it serve to incite the clodians against my daughter and me the mob has finally been assuaged by milos conviction youll simply make fools of them and set them rioting again think how irritated pompey will be to discover that his court failed to find the whole truth and that the conviction of milo is flawed rome has been ripped apart by what happened here on the appian way but now the people have been pacified and the wicked on both sides have been punished clodius is dead milo is exiled what purpose could there possibly be in delivering a last revelation except to massage your own vanity to show off your perseverance and cleverness make the oath i require return the ring to the one who loved clodius best and leave the rest to the gods i walked to the window below the town of aricia where clodius had given his final address had darkened to a jumble of deep blue shadows i thought for a long time what did i owe to milo who had committed such a grievous offence against me and would have killed me outright if cicero had not restrained him what did i owe to cicero who acquiesced to my abduction or to the friends and heirs of clodius who instigated the riots that resulted in the sacking of my house and the death of belbo what did i owe to rome itself for who could say any longer what rome was or would become in the next few years all was in flux all was chaos and confusion i found myself confronted by what i most craved the truth but i also found myself utterly alone even eco was not there to share the discovery or advise me that was just as well i doubted that he would have approved of the decision i made i turned back to sextus tedius you have my word i swear by the shade of my father that ill keep your secret bring me the ring tedia left the room while she was gone a slave entered with a burning taper and lit the lamps dispelling the growing darkness tedia returned and dropped the ring into my open palm looking glad to be rid of it it was heavy made of solid gold i saw the name p clodius pulcher engraved on it but was at a loss to see any other ornament surely there should be some reference to the glories of his illustrious ancestors then i held it to the light and noticed the honeycomb pattern scored into the glittering surface of the ring itself inside and out little interlocking polygons like the perfectly fitted stones which paved the appian way the ring was the very image of the great road cast in a circle without beginning or end a homage to the place where its wearer had fallen to his enemies and breathed his last with a blue ribbon wound tight around his throat that night we slept in an inn in aricia the tavern below was loud and smoky and the bedding had ticks in it but i slept better there than i should have in bovillae with all its phantoms living and dead i was up before dawn and woke the boys all three of us had to shake davus to get him up we were on the road before the first hour and made swift progress we reached the city before midday i had three last calls to pay and then i could turn my back for good on all that had happened on the appian way xxxvi mopsus and androcles grew increasingly excited as we made our way through the forum and up the ramp to the palatine both were wideeyed at the sight of so many buildings and people davus put on a slightly snobbish air the city slave condescending to the country slaves i remembered his own consternation at finding himself in the countryside for the first time in his life but said nothing all three of them grew quiet as we neared the house davuss face grew long the boys drew closer together we had hardly stepped into the foyer before bethesda appeared so these are the new slaves she said ignoring davus yes this is mopsus and this is his brother androcles boys this is your new mistress the boys lowered their eyes and sneaked glances at her androcles whispered in his older brothers ear shes beautiful bethesdas lips almost formed a smile she was resplendent in a saffroncoloured stola and a simple silver necklace with hair done up very high on her head in such a way that the strands of grey looked like white veins snaking through shimmering black marble i was almost as awed by her as the boys were you both look agile and energetic she said making the words sound more like a judgment than a compliment i suppose we shall find ways to keep you busy you might be good at carrying messages i imagine except that you must be ignorant of the city you shall have to do a great deal of exploring in the next few days to acquaint yourselves with the seven hills right now you must be hungry after your trip davus will show you where the kitchen is wont you davus yes mistress davus was the most awed by her of anyone it was remarkable how small a space such a large fellow could seem to occupy and how quickly he could make his exit from a room bethesda and i were left alone husband i did a great deal of thinking yesterday so did i you and i must have a serious talk can it wait i have a few more errands to finish today and then i suppose but by the end of the day i want a resolution to this matter of diana and your and davus i agree shall we talk this evening then yes our eyes met and it hardly seemed necessary to talk at all we were agreed about what to do i had lived with her long enough to be able to read that much from her eyes i ate a quick meal of olives cheese and fresh bread then headed out again i took davus with me though a protector hardly seemed necessary the streets seemed almost preternaturally calm after the furore of recent days the great one had moved into the city and was in residence at his house in the carinae district as i had hoped he agreed to see me almost at once the house in the carinae was a sprawling old villa surrounded by newer taller buildings it had been owned by pompeys family for generations there was a musty smell everywhere in the house and in the room where pompey gave audiences there were no fabulous views only a glimpse of an inner courtyard with a modest fountain the room was full of old trophies from various military campaigns some brought back by pompey from the east some acquired by his father exotic weapons and bits of armour statuettes of obscure gods shadow puppets from the parthian borderlands and antique theatre masks from greece lurking discreedy in the corners and shadows as always were the soldiers responsible for his safety pompey sat beside a little table stacked high with scrolls at my approach he put aside the document he was reading finder i was surprised when the doorkeeper announced you i didnt expect to see you again and i didnt expect to be able to see you so soon you happen to have come at the one hour of the day when i do not already have some prior obligation do we have unfinished business i came to ask a favour great one good i always like it when im asked for favours whether i grant them or not it gives me a chance to live up to my name what is it you want finder i understand that a part of the penalty against milo will be the confiscation of his estate not quite his entire estate i think we may allow him to take along a few personal slaves and such to begin his new life in massilia first everythings to be liquidated to pay off his creditors which number into legions after that we shall see how much is left for the treasury the estate shall be picked quite clean before the scavenging is finished i should like to be listed among his creditors oh i have a hard time imagining that you lent him money finder or did you render services that were never paid for neither of those things i have a grievance against milo he was the man responsible for abducting me and my son and holding us prisoner for over a month since i last spoke to you i acquired proof of this i see practically speaking you have no legal recourse against him the mans been convicted and will soon be gone for good he wouldnt be here to stand trial if you did bring charges against him i realize that which is why i came to you great one i see what is it you want i wish to be recognized by the state as one of milos creditors i want a settlement from his estate and what is the price for what you and your son suffered at his hands that can hardly be estimated but there is an amount ill settle for i named it a rather precise sum said pompey how did you come by it during the worst of the clodian riots my house was ransacked a statue of minerva in my garden was overturned and damaged thats the cost to repair it i see is that fair asking milo to pay for damage that was done by his enemies not fair in a legal sense true but perhaps i could paraphrase something you once said great one whats that stop quoting laws to us we carry pastduebills pompey found this richly amusing i like you finder in coming years i should like to think that you will be on my side i dont understand great one oh i think you do very well then how shall we do this he called for a secretary who composed a memorandum in duplicate one copy was pressed flat and added to an already high stack in a cabinet against the wall pompey signed the other his secretary rolled it tightly and applied a daub of red wax into which pompey pressed his ring there have that delivered to milos house good luck collecting it there are quite a few rather important people ahead of you on the other hand yours is likely to be the smallest bill perhaps the estate will pay it off first simply to get rid of it thank you great one certainly he smiled made a gesture of dismissal and strolled across the room a moment later he turned back surprised to see that i was still there what now finder i feel a certain conflict great one between an oath i took and a prior obligation to yourself yes now that the trial of milo is done do you have any further interest in discovering what happened on the appian way im not sure what you mean if i were to tell you that milos men gravely perhaps fatally wounded clodius but that someone elsesomeone entirely removed from their mutual sphere of enmity actually finished him off are you saying that the final blow was delivered by a third party i have taken an oath not to speak of the details i see pompey considered this then i suggest that you keep your mouth shut should i great one yes by all means dont break an oath on my account clodius is dead and burned to ashes milo is ruined and about to leave rome for good so much for those two my next task shall be seeing to the punishment of the parties responsible for burning the senate house the state must deal evenly with all disturbers of the peace you see or there can be no law and order could this revelation of yours have any effect on that i think not great one then its irrelevant and of no interest to me the murder of clodius is old business do you understand finder there was a note almost of menace in his voice yes great one i think i do the inside of milos house seemed oddly familiar though i had never been there before the mosaics on the floor the pale ochre colour of the walls as well as various objects in the foyer and what i could glimpse of the nearby rooms reminded me at once of ciceros house having no sense for such things himself milo had slavishly emulated his great friends impeccable taste the place also reminded me in an odd way of clodiuss great house on the palatine for it was clearly in a state of chaos but where i had seen clodiuss house in the process of being decorated and refurbished milos house was the reverse in the process of being undecorated and dismantled paintings had been removed from the walls and stacked upright precious objects were being boxed up curtains had been removed from doorways and neatly folded on little tables like clodiuss mansion on the night of his murder there was an air of distraction and abandonment in milos house occasionally a slave would pass by on some errand looking unhappy and hardly glancing at me i began to think i had been forgotten finally the slave who had admitted me returned and gestured for me to follow him deeper into the house was i a fool leaving davus outside and going to face milo alone i braced myself for the confrontation i was not sure how i would feel when i saw him he had done me a great wrong and i had every reason to despise him and yet oddly the experience of my incarceration made me feel a kind of sympathy for him it is a terrible thing for a man to lose all his dreams to have everything taken away from him except the bare means of sustenance milo had risen from obscurity to a position of great power the consulship itself had been within his grasp then his world had been shattered in a moment and his destiny had gone spiralling out ofhis control he had played a dangerous game and in the end had lost eveiything whether he deserved his fate or not the totality ofhis ruin moved me nevertheless i intended to tell him what i thought ofhis treatment of me and to demand restitution the slave showed me to a room with a decidedly feminine atmosphere the walls were painted with scenes of peacocks in full fan strutting across wildly blooming gardens a low dresser was covered with little cosmetics boxes jewellery cases brushes and burnished hand mirrors all made of fine woods and metals inlaid with precious stones across the room a riot of colourful gowns and stolas spilled from an open wardrobe dominating the room was a large sleeping couch with a diaphanous red canopy the air was scented with jasmine and musk sounds of splashing and laughter came from a doorway at the far side of the room which evidently led to a private bath i could hear both male and female voices where had the doorkeeper taken me and why had he gone off without announcing me i cleared my throat as loudly as i could the laughter and splashing stopped there was dead silence i cleared my throat again and called out milo the response was silence then a burst of laughter and splashing louder than before wait there called a womans voice i heard whispered conversation and more laughter finally she appeared in the doorway wearing a loose unbelted gown which did very little to conceal the plump voluptuous contours of her body masses of gingercoloured hair were piled and pinned atop her head whatever she had been doing in her bath she had managed not to get her hair wet i had met her father once long ago the dictator sulla had been near the end of his life fausta cornelia must have been no more than a child then thirty years later she was still too young to show the ravages of severe dissipation which had ruined her fathers looks but there was a decided family resemblance the same fair complexion the same carnivorous smile the same wilful fire behind the eyes she was not graceful when she moved some part of her body always seemed to jiggle or sway instead of grace she exuded a ripe fleshiness and even from a considerable distance i could feel the radiant heat of her body flushed and pink from her hot bath her high birth had attracted two promising husbands other attributes had attracted a steady string of lovers and i was being given a good look at them so youre the finder she said yes i came to see your husband on a matter of business my husband isnt here no i looked towards the door to the bath i could still hear an occasional splash and the sound of voices if milo were here do you think id be taking a bath with two of his gladiators she looked to see if her candour would shock me i did my best to keep a blank expression i realize that milo must be very busy during his last days in rome i said it isnt absolutely necessary that i see him face to face but i do want to make sure that he receives this i held up the little scroll with pompeys seal she rolled her eyes oh not another bill thank the gods i kept my own income even if it is in my brothers name she took the scroll from me and walked down a short hallway she jiggled a good deal behind as well i noticed we came to a cluttered room filled with documents my husbands study she announced with an air of distaste from here he was going to run the republic what a joke that turned out to be i suppose therell never be another man like my father a real man who can bring this unruly town to heel im not so sure of that i said quietly thinking of pompey and of caesar she didnt hear this is the latest pile of bills she said indicating a tall box overflowing with scrolls and scraps of parchment shall we toss yours on top there but dont be surprised if it gets moved to the bottom or lost altogether whos attending to sorting out all these bills is your husband doing it himself gods no milos a wreckage he can hardly sort out which shoe to put on first in the morning one peek inside this room and hes reduced to a blubbering baby no this will all be dealt with after he leaves cicero will take care of it or tiro will i should say tiro is a wonder at organizing things i see here then lets put my request aside from all the rest if you would tell cicero to honour it first tell him that gordianus the finder insists cicero will know why so will tiro she looked at me wryly and you think i dont i know who you are finder im more aware of my husbands affairs than you seem to think he was quite bent on killing you you know it was all he talked about for days really her candour about her lovers was not nearly as startling as her candour about her husbands plots oh yes milo considered you to be quite a menace you should be honoured i suppose of course towards the end he was seeing an assassin in every cupboard and a spy behind every bush you obsessed him for a while cicero kept telling him that he was blowing any threat you posed out of all proportion cicero said that your reputation was grossly inflated that you were barely competent really and that milo should stop worrying about you how kind of cicero he was trying to protect you you fool but milo was determined to see you dead in a cold sweat about it in the end cicero made him agree to a compromise and milo simply had you abducted but you must be as clever and persevering as he thought you escaped before the trial came up by hercules what a fright you must have given cicero when you popped up on the road right in front of him she emitted a short barking laugh i only wish i could have appreciated the humour at the time cant we all say that in retrospect if only id known that marrying milo would turn into such a joke and that horrible day on the appian way when i thought i was living through a nightmare it was really all a grotesque farce from beginning to end the cruellest irony of all was that milo never intended to kill clodius the fight broke out on its own and when milo sent his men after clodius he ordered them to spare him the gladiators still swear that they didnt touch clodius at the inn is that a fact do you doubt it come ill let them tell you the story themselves she took me back to her room boys you can come out of the bath now my visitor has promised not to bite you first one appeared then the other the two of them could not possibly have fitted through the door at once they woreloincloths but were otherwise naked and still damp from their bath two great steaming masses of hairy flesh each of them twice the size of an ordinary man i noticed that they were nicked with little scars here and there but were mostly unmarked as one might expect of gladiators who had never lost a match they moved with surprising lightness and grace considering their bulk unlike fausta nothing shook or jiggled when they walked for all their fleshiness their muscles were as solid as marble i winced to see their famously ugly faces so close eudamus and birria i whispered they walked across the room with supreme nonchalance pushed aside the diaphanous drapery and lay down side by side on faustas sleeping couch the frame groaned and sagged under their weight my husband intends to take them with him to massilia said fausta wistfully hell need protection of course but gods i shall miss the two of them i take it that you dont intend to accompany your husband into exile follow milo to massilia to live among greeks and gauls and washedup roman windbags i had sooner live out my days on milos pig farm down in lanuvium i looked at eudamus and birria warily are you sure they can talk it seems almost too much to expect doesnt it given all their other talents but yes they can actually speak though its birria who does all the talking eudamus is the shy one because hes so much prettier i suppose the less repulsive of the two made a simpering smile and actually blushed the uglier one wrinkled his nose and grunted boys this is gordianus i was telling him a few things about the day that clodius died and he didnt believe me do you want us to tear his head off his shoulders no birria perhaps some other time do you remember how the fight started that day of course birria crossed his arms behind his head showing off biceps as big as his head we met that fool clodius on the road which might have been trouble right off but we passed without a hitch everything as smooth as silk but the fool couldnt let the opportunity pass to shout an insult at us at the last moment and you lost your temper didnt you fausta commiserated i did i threw my spear at him i meant it to whizz by his head but he made a move and it hit his shoulder birria laughed knocked him clean off his horse and i didnt even mean to then it was mars in charge and every man for himself we got the best of them pretty soon they were running like rabbits into the woods and down the road then the master sent you after them prompted fausta after he threw his tantrum agreed birria and what were his instructions birria stretched on the couch his legs reached so far over the end that he was almost able to touch his toes to the floor the master said kill all the rest if you have to but take clodius alive dont harm a hair on his head or ill send the lot of you off to the mines so we chased the fool down to bovillae where he was holed up inside the inn we had to go in and drag his men out one by one the stupid innkeeper got in the way eudamus took care of him we had the situation under control and all that was left was to drag clodius out of the inn by the scruff of his neck then that fellow philemon and his friends came along he pitched a fit shouted some threats and shook his fist at us but as soon as we took two steps towards him he let out a squeal and turned tail he and his friends scattered all over the place so we went after them what else could we do eudamus chased one i chased another and all our men followed along youd think that someone would have had the sense to stay and keep a watch on clodius but no one thought to he shrugged bunching a great mass of muscles around his oxlike neck everything was crazy that day i shook my head at the simplemindedness of it and when you finally rounded up the witnesses and came back clodius was gone i nodded because sextus tedius had already come along and dispatched him to rome in his litter while you were off chasing philemon yes but we didnt know that protested birria when we got back to the inn we couldnt figure out where in hades clodius had got to so you argued about it for a while that was the hushed argument philemon only half overheard without understanding birria shrugged we decided to head back and ask the master what to do clodius was wounded we figured he couldnt get far and on the way you passed sextus tedius resting below the house of the vestals and he saluted you while his daughter we just ignored the old senator and hurried back to the master he took one look at the prisoners saw that we didnt have clodius and threw another tantrum while he paced up and down we loaded the prisoners into a wagon and sent them on to the masters villa at lanuvium along with the mistress then the master decided that clodius would probably make a run back to his villa on the mountain so thats where we headed but when you got there you didnt find clodius we searched everywhere in the stable behind the rock piles all through the house we started threatening the slaves in charge the foreman and that fellow halicor wheres publius clodius the master kept yelling you were looking for clodius at the villa not for his son that was a dirty lie the clodians put out afterwards saying the master went on a hunt for clodiuss little boy what would we have done with him we didnt even know the boy was there and we certainly never saw him it was clodius himself we were hunting for the master was frantic that we couldnt find him he kept asking us how badly clodius was wounded he figured that clodius must be hiding in the hills and my dear husband dreaded what would happen next added fausta now that blood had been spilled and clodius would be mad for revenge milo didnt know that clodius was dead until he sneaked back into the city the next day then of course we heard the story about how sextus tedius had found the body and we figured out what must have happened did you really i said and the next step was for milo to concoct his own fanciful version of the incident all that nonsense about clodius setting an ambush for him it was a good try said fausta wistfully but there was no way for him to wriggle out of it in the end was there not even with cicero on his side and what a mess he made of things the irony you see is that milo never intended to have clodius killed nor to harm his little boy once clodius was wounded by you birria you very very naughty boy milo simply wanted clodius to be taken alive to keep him safe and quiet until we could figure out what to do next but philemon drew the men away from the inn either clodiuss wounds were worse than everyone thought or else yes milo suggested to cicero that someone else might have actually finished him off how could that have happened clodius had plenty of enemies on mount alba hed stirred up a lot of trouble any local person passing by who happened to see that clodius was wounded and alone might have been tempted to take advantage of the situation and there were reports that clodius had strangulation marks on his throatyou mentioned them yourself to cicero eudamus and birria both swear that they never touched his throat so where did those marks come from unless some unknown party throttled clodius while they were off chasing philemon that would explain why sextus tedius found him lying dead in the road when he was still alive in the tavern when birria and eudamus took after philemon she sighed sounding more bored than weary that was a theory that milo proposed anyway but cicero said there was no use in pursuing it why try to convince the jury that youre technically innocent by some convoluted logic saying your men only wounded clodius and someone else killed him theyll never believe it whether its true or not make no apologies and argue selfdefence if philemon hadnt appeared we might have taken clodius alive but sextus tedius showed up at just the wrong moment and then he sent the body on its way to rome without our knowing it do you grasp the irony gordianus oh yes i said more than you know fausta sighed all this dwelling on the past is depressing me you should run along now gordianus id just finished my bath when you arrived and now its time for my massage she brightened unless youd like to join me i think not are you sure eudamus and birria give quite an extraordinary massage twenty fingers between them nineteen actually since eudamus lost one in a fight and such power they could break me in two like a twig but they leave me feeling as light and airy as a cloud they could handle two of us as easily as one it might be rather interesting the look on her face left no doubt about her meaning and your husband he wont be back for hours are you certain reasonably certain i remembered fausta cornelias penchant for getting caught in compromising positions and imagined milo walking in on the four of us it was not the kind of confrontation i cared to have with milo on the eve of his exile though it might have amused fausta cornelia a great deal alas i have a final errand i must attend to before the day is done she pouted her lips and shrugged regrets then gordianus shall i tell my husband that you came by to bid him farewell please do xxxvii on such a magnificent spring afternoon with flowers in bloom and the sun spreading warmth from a cloudless sky i knew where i would find her we made our way through the cattle market west of the palatine and across the old wooden bridge where are we going master said davus to the other side of the tiber i should have thought that was obvious davus frowned it was time for me to stop teasing him i thought i would not be his master much longer i would miss the particular relationship that had grown up between us actually davus were going to a garden villa on the west bank of the tiber across from the field of mars a beautiful spot with a rustic little villa and a green meadow surrounded by tall trees and a strip of land on the riverbank excellent for swimming i would prefer that you told no one of this visit not even eco and certainly not bethesda can you keep a secret i should have thought that was obvious master he said with a sigh after a while we left the road we passed beneath a shadedappled canopy of berry bushes and emerged onto a wide green meadow alive with hovering insects and butterflies the long villa was to the left just as i remembered but she would not stay inside on a day such as this i told davus to find a shady place to wait for me and i crossed the meadow the high grass pulling at my feet through a stand of tall trees i glimpsed fleeting patches of sunlight on the river i also saw her tent on the riverbank with its red and white stripes shivering in the breeze and nearby the matching red and white stripes of her litter where it had been set down on higher ground if the litter was here then so was she no one noticed my approach no one was posted to watch all her litter bearers and bodyguards were down in the river swimming and splashing each other and playing some sort of game with a leather ball i came to the tent and circled around to the side which faced the river and the swimmers all the flaps had been rolled up to let in the breeze and the view she half sat half reclined on a high pillowstrewn couch swathed in a gown made of some diaphanous golden fabric with a cup of wine in her hand and a forlorn expression on her face she looked as if she might be watching a tragic play instead of a group of naked slaves cavorting in the water she saw me and gave a start then recognized me and managed a wan smile a handmaiden seated on the rug at the foot of her couch scrambled to her feet as i approached then looked to her mistress for instructions at a nod from clodia the girl left the tent gordianus said clodia her voice was like the languid music of the river her scent of spikenard and crocusoil suffused the warm air inside the tent her flesh seemed to glow in the soft filtered light i hurt your feelings the other day i said did you she turned her eyes back to the bathers i think so for that i apologize no need id already forgotten pains and pleasures have all been dulled for me since since your brother died she lowered her eyes the one pain that never grows less sharp i suppose you must take some comfort from what happened at the trial i have no taste for trials any more but milo was punished and cicero barely stumbled through his speech she laughed softly and nodded yes i should like to have seen that but none of this will bring him back to me no but sometimes people are willing to settle for justice or revenge i learned my lesson when i tried to take revenge on marcus caelius what use is any of it in the end i spoke carefully taking vengeance on those who killed him would that bring you no satisfaction why do you keep bringing this up gordianus i have no appetite for revenge she took a deep breath and exhaled it my brother gave a great many people a great many reasons to want him dead im not a fool or blind i know the way he was and the life he lived i loved publius more than anything else in the world there was nothing about him i would have changed but sooner or later given the game he played and the rules he broke a bad end was waiting for him theyre all playing the same game and i suspect they shall all meet a violent end pompey and caesar caelius and antony even cicero so long as publius was a player i had some interest in the contest but now she sighed i simply he here and watch my beautiful young men enjoy themselves in the water i dont even see the young men any more i watch the water the way it sparkles and slides off them the way it flows towards the sea never stopping never turning back it all used to mean something to me i think but i cant remember what are you so miserable clodia miserable that seems too strong a word i seldom weep anymore or wake up from nightmares about his death i just feel very tired she smiled crookedly i must look frightful no clodia you look beautiful unspeakably beautiful she reached for my hand i looked into her eyes for a moment then had to look away i watched the bathers in the way that she watched them abstractly and without really seeing them only their movements and the play of light on their wet flesh then the abstract became concrete i suddenly recognized one of them by hercules what is it gordianus one of your men the one with the red face and ice blue eyes the man was diving for the leather ball he screwed his face up just as he did on that night he confronted me on the palatine hill after ransacking my house you know him said clodia he was one of the looters who plundered my house and wrecked my statue of minerva one of the men who murdered my slave belbo i wouldnt be surprised the fellows a former gladiator clodius owned him then freed him so he could go on the grain dole since then hes been passed around the family as a bodyguard he caused some sort of trouble among my nephews slaves i ended up with him only a few days ago they thought i should like looking at him i suppose but you say he wrecked your house and killed a man very dear to me i see what shall we do about it i have no proof no one was there to see him do it except his friends maybe it was one of his friends who killed belbo perhaps hes innocent though he seemed to be the leader why worry over details this isnt a court we both know his sort im sure hes done something or other he deserves to die for shall i take care of it for you gordianus what do you mean i could have the fellow drowned right here and now it would only take a word to my chief bodyguard a man like that would put up quite a struggle i imagine but between my bodyguards and litter bearers there are enough strong men out there to hold him down for however long it takes you could have the pleasure of watching shall i give the order youre serious arent you yes but only if you want it shall i give the order i considered it in a single afternoon i had been invited by fausta cornelia to take part in an orgy and by clodia to watch a man die by my order such opportunities were the prerogatives of kings and emperors why should i refuse perhaps i had never really known the meaning of justice or truth but once i thought i did and the illusion had comforted me now everything had changed all my bearings had slipped out of sight i felt dizzy and disoriented was the world spinning out of control or was it only me no i finally said your brother is dead and so is belbo and no amount of killing will bring them back the river flows only forwards clodia smiled ruefully very well the fellow shall never know how close he came to being drowned like a dog but ill remember what you told me i shall keep a close eye on him from now on clodia yes hold out your hand she did so with an arched eyebrow expecting some trick i placed her brothers ring on her open palm she sighed shuddered sobbed and caught a breath to steady herself where did you find it if i say that i found it lying beside the appian way will you be satisfied she looked at the ring for a long time with an expression of such tenderness that i realized how foolish i was to think that i could hurt her what could she feel for me or for any man compared to what she had felt for her brother why did you bring it to me why not to fulvia shes his widow yes but fulvia has already moved on shes planning her next marriage and perhaps the next marriage after that shes looking towards the future not the past but publiuss son his little boy if you think your nephew should have the ring i leave that decision to you i decided to return it to the one who loved him most she closed her hand tightly around it and shut her eyes a single tear ran down her cheek i turned and retraced my footsteps in the soft earth going back the way i had come at the corner of the tent i turned back she blinked her eyes open i almost forgot i said i want to invite you to a wedding a wedding in your family dont tell me its your daughter diana im afraid so but shes only a child not any longer time flies but i shouldnt come im not related and hardly close enough to the family it would be most unconventional all the better i suspect it will be a most unconventional marriage your daughter is following after her father then the thought gave me pause farewell clodia farewell gordianus she gave me a parting glance then leaned back among the pillows holding the ring to her breast i walked back across the meadow to davus clodia had it exactly right diana was following after me they were all following after me if only i knew where i was going if only i had the vaguest idea of what was in store for any of us davus was resting in the shade of an oak tree at my approach he rose to his feet and brushed himself off if only i knew where i was going i muttered thinking aloud but master i should have thought that was obvious what he smiled were going home now arent we i heaved a sigh of great relief yes davus home note the sources for the murder of clodius and milos trial are remarkable in themselves the text of ciceros oration for milo which has come down to usmost likely an idealized version of the speech he intended to give prettied up for publicationgives us one view of events and a clearly prejudiced and deliberately skewed one at that if it was all we had to go on it would still make a great story but we should have no idea of what really happened on the appian way and if cicero had been able to deliver the speech intact things might have turned out differently such at least was the substance of a bitter jest by milo when cicero proudly sent him a copy milo remarked that it was a good thing the orator had not been able to deliver such a stirring speech otherwise milo would still be back in rome and not in exile in massilia enjoying the excellent mullets fortunately in the next century the scholar quintus asconius pedianus wrote some study guides for his sons to use when reading ciceros orations and one of these surviving commentaries analyses the pro milone it reads today as a sort of precursor to the true crime genre asconius gives us fascinating details about the desperate parliamentary manoeuvres and frantic damage control by both sides in the wake of clodiuss death he describes the nutsandbolts conduct of the trial including the selection of the jury most important he gives us an account of the murder completely at odds with the one cicero puts forth in ciceros day as now defence lawyers were not ashamed to come up with fanciful even outrageous angles to absolve their clients then as now courtroom sideshows and overlong trials were a serious problem though pompeys oneday solutioni might strike even the most televisionweary american as too extreme the pro milone is available in the penguin edition of selected political speeches of cicero translated by michael grant and in volume of the loeb classical library editions of cicero translated by n h watts who also includes an abbreviated version of asconiuss commentary the complete text of asconius can be found in commentaries on five speeches of cicero edited and translated by simon squires bristol classical press and bolchazycarducci publishers our knowledge of the tumultuous events of bc comes from numerous sources which vary gready in importance and reliability including the histories and commentaries of appian caesar velleius paterculus plutarch quintilian and dio cassius and the letters of cicero crucial to any depiction of the murder and trial is an unravelling of the conflicting details and the tangled sequence of events three works by modern historians have done much to sort things out albert c clarks annotated edition of the pro milone oxford at the clarendon press a w lintotts cicero and milo journal of roman studies and james s reubels the trial of milo in bc a chronological study transactions of the american philological association in deference to his scholarship and for the sake of consistency i have chiefly relied on reubels chronology how crucial was the murder of clodius to subsequent events as the assassination of archduke francis ferdinand in sarajevo in is generally regarded as the spark that ignited world war i so the murder of clodius can be regarded as precipitating a chain of events that led to civil war between pompey and caesar and the final dissolution of the roman republic as michael grant notes the pro milone casts a lurid light upon the savage chaos and vendetta which signalized these last moribund years of the republic and helped to make it inevitable that this once mighty institution should come to an end and be replaced by an autocracy claude nicolet argues the point even more explicitly in the world of the citizen in republican rome university of california press the intervention of pompeys troops was indeed prophetic it sounded the knell of the free republic and by the same token of roman political and forensic eloquence the roman mob thought it had gained a victory by intimidating cicero and driving milo into exile but all it had done was to prepare the way for civil war and thereby the empire most of my research was conducted at doe library and somewhat surreptitiously in the classics reading room at the university of california at berkeley i want to express my personal thanks to penni kimmel for reading the manuscript to rick solomon for various sorts of indulgence and inspiration to pat urquhart for his technical assistance with the map to terri odom for reading the galleys and to my editor at st martins press keith kahla
