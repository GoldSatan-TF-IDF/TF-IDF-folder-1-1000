krispos the emperor i krispos sopped a heel of bread in the fermented fish sauce that had gone over his mutton he ate the bread in two bites washed it down with a final swallow of sweet golden vaspurakaner wine set the silver goblet back on the table before he could even let out a contented sigh barsymes came into the little dining chamber to clear away his dishes krispos cocked an eyebrow at the eunuch chamberlain how do you time that so perfectly esteemed sir he asked its not sorcery i know but it always strikes me as magical the vestiarios hardly paused as he answered your majesty attention to your needs is the proper business of every palace servitor his voice was a tone for which videssian had no name halfway between tenor and contralto his long pale fingers deftly scooped up plates and goblet knife and fork and spoon set them on a vermeil tray as barsymes worked krispos studied his face like any eunuch gelded before puberty the vestiarios had no beard that was part of what made him look younger than he was but not all his skin was very fine and had hardly wrinkled or sagged through the many years krispos had known him being a eunuch he still had a boys hairline and his hair was still black though that at least might have come from a bottle suddenly curious krispos said how old are you barsymes do you mind my asking when i became avtokrator of the videssians i would have sworn on phos holy name that you had more years than i now though id take oath the other way round i would not have your majesty forsworn either way barsymes answered seriously as a matter of fact i do not know my exact age if i were forced to guess i would say we were not far apart and if your majesty would be so gracious as to forgive me memories are apt to shift with time and you have sat on the imperial throne foris it twentytwo years now yes of course the twentyyear jubilee was summer before last twentytwo years krispos murmured sometimes the day when he walked down to videssos the city to seek his fortune after being taxed off his farm seemed like last week hed had more muscle than brains back thenwhat young man doesnt the only trait he was sure he kept from his peasant days was a hard stubbornness sometimes like tonight that trek down from his village seemed so distant it might have happened to someone else he was past fifty now though like barsymes he wasnt sure just how old he was the imperial robes concealed a comfortable potbelly his hair had gone no worse than iron gray but white frosted his beard his mustache even his eyebrows perverse vanity kept him from the dye pothe knew he was no boy any more so why pretend to anyone else will your majesty forgive what might perhaps be perceived as an indiscretion barsymes asked esteemed sir these days id welcome an indiscretion krispos declared one of the things i do miss about my early days is having people come right out and tell me what they think instead of what they think will please me or whats to their own advantage go on say what you will nothing of any great moment the vestiarios said it merely crossed my mind that you might find it lonely eating by yourself at so many meals banquets can be dull too krispos said but that wasnt what barsymes meant and he knew it here in the residence where the avtokrator and his family had more privacy than anywhere else not much by anyone elses standard barsymes for instance was in the habit of dressing krispos every morning meals should have been a time when everyone could just sit around and talk krispos remembered many such mealshappy even if sometimes short on foodin the peasant huts where hed grown to manhood maybe if dara were still alive his marriage to his predecessors widow began as an alliance of convenience for both of them but despite some quarrels and rocky times it had grown into more than that and dara had always got on well with their sons too but dara had gone to phos light or so krispos sincerely hoped almost ten years before since then evripos and katakolon i suppose are out prowling for women krispos said thats what they usually do of nights anyhow being the ages they are yes barsymes said tonelessly he had never prowled for women nor would he sometimes he took a sort of melancholy pride in being above desire krispos often thought he must have wondered what he was missing but hed never have the nerve to ask only those far from the palace quarter imagined the avtokrator as serene and undisputed master of his household krispos sighed as for phostis well i just dont know what phostis is up to right now he sighed again phostis his eldest his heirhis cuckoos egg hed never known for sure whether dara had conceived by him or by anthimos whom hed overthrown the boys no young mans nowlooks were no help for he looked like dara krispos doubts had always made it hard for him to warm up to the child hed named for his own father and now now he wondered if hed been so nearly intolerable as he was growing into manhood he didnt think so but who does looking back on his own youth of course his own younger years were full of poverty and hunger and fear and backbreaking work hed spared phostis all that but he wondered if his son was the better for it he probably was there were those in videssos the city who praised the hard simple life the empires peasants led who even put into verse the virtues that life imbued into those peasants krispos thought they were full of the manure theyd surely never touched with their own daintily manicured fingers barsymes said the young majesty will yet make you proud fondness touched his usually cool voice since he could have no children of his own he doted on the ones hed helped raise from infancy i hope youre right krispos said he worried still was phostis as he was because of anthimos blood coming through the man krispos had supplanted in daras bed and then in the palaces had had a sort of hectic brilliance to him but applied it chiefly in pursuit of pleasure whenever phostis did something extravagantly foolish krispos worried about his paternity was phostis really spoiled from growing up soft or asked the cold suspicious part of krispos that never quite slept and that had helped keep him on the throne for more than two decades was he just getting tired of watching his father rule vigorously did he want to take the empire of videssos into his own young hands krispos looked up at barsymes if a man cant rely on his own son esteemed sir upon whom can he rely present company excepted of course your majesty is gracious the vestiarios dipped his head as i said however i remain confident phostis will satisfy your every expectation of him maybe was all krispos said accepting his gloom barsymes picked up the tray and began to take it back to the kitchens he paused at the doorway will your majesty require anything more of me no not for now just make sure the candles in the study are lit if youd be so kind i have the usual pile of parchments there waiting for review and i cant do them all by daylight i shall see to it barsymes promised eranything besides that no eminent sir nothing else thank you krispos said hed had a few women in the palaces since dara died but his most recent mistress had seemed convinced he would make her relatives rich and powerful regardless of their merits which were slender hed sent her packing nownow his desire burned cooler than it had in his younger days little by little he thought he was beginning to approach barsymes status he had never said that out loud and never would for fear both of wounding the chamberlains feelings and of encountering his pungent sarcasm krispos waited a couple of minutes then walked down the hall to the study the cheerful glow of candlelight greeted him from the doorway as usual barsymes gave flawless service the stack of documents on the desk was less gladsome sometimes krispos likened that stack to an enemy city that had to be besieged and then taken but a city had to be captured only once the parchments were never vanquished for good hed watched anthimos ignore administration for the sake of pleasure perhaps in reaction he ignored pleasure for administration when the pile of parchments was very high as tonight he wondered if anthimos hadnt known the better way after all without a doubt anthimos had enjoyed himself more than krispos did now but equally without a doubt the empire was better served now than it had been during anthimos antic reign reed pens and the scarlet ink reserved for the avtokrator of the videssians alone stylus and waxcovered wooden tablets and skyblue sealing wax waited in a neat row at the left edge of the desk like regiments ready to be committed to battle against the implacable enemy feeling a moments foolishness krispos saluted them clenched right fist over his heart then he sat down and got to work topping the pile was a tax report from the frontier province of kubrat between the paristrian mountains and the istros river north and east of videssos the city when krispos reign began it had been the independent khaganate of kubrat a barbarous nation whose horsemen had raided the empire for centuries now herds and farms and mines brought gold rather than terror south of the mountains solid progress there he thought he scrawled his signature to show hed read the cadaster and approved its revenue total the second report was also from kubrat even after most of a generation under videssian rule the prelate of pliskavos reported heresy and outright heathenism remained rife in the province many of the nomads would not turn aside from their ancestral spirits to worship phos the good god the empire followed and the folk of videssian stock subject for centuries to the invaders from the steppe had fallen into strange usages and errors because they were so long cut off from the mainstream of doctrine in videssos krispos reinked the pen reached into a pigeonhole for a blank parchment krispos avtokrator to the holy sir balaneus greetings he wrote and then paused for thought the pen scratched across the sheet as he resumed by all means keep on with your efforts to bring kubrat and its inhabitants back to the true faith the example of our new perfectly orthodox colonists should help you use compulsion only as a last resort but in the end do not hesitate as we have only one empire so we must have only one faith within it may phos shine his light on your work he sanded the letter dry lit a stick of sealing wax at one of the candles on the desk let several drops fall on the letter and pressed his ring into the blob of wax while it was still soft a courier would take the letter north tomorrow balaneus ought to have it in less than a week krispos was pleased with the prelate and his work he was also pleased with his own writing he hadnt done much of it before he became emperor but had grown fluent with a pen since another tax report followed this one from a lowland province in the westlands across the strait called the cattlecrossing from videssos the city the lowland province yielded four times as much revenue as kubrat krispos nodded unsurprised the lowlands had soil and climate good enough for two crops a year and had been free of invasion for so long that many of the towns there had no walls that would have been unimaginableto say nothing of suicidalin halfbarbarous kubrat the next report was sealed it came from the latest videssian embassy to mashiz the capital of makuran krispos knew he had to handle that one with careful attention the kings of kings of makuran were the greatest rivals videssian avtokrators faced and the only rulers they recognized as equals he smiled when he broke the seal and saw the elegant script within it was almost as familiar as his own hand iakovitzes to the avtokrator krispos greetings he read moving his lips slightly as he always did i trust you are cool and comfortable in the city by the sea were skotos hell to be charged with fire rather than the eternal ice mashiz would let the dark god get a good notion of what he required krispos smile broadened hed first met iakovitzes when he was nine years old when the videssian noble ransomed his family and other peasants from captivity in kubrat in the more than forty years since hed seldom known the plump little man to have a kind word for anyone or anything warming to his theme if that was the proper phrase iakovitzes continued rubyab king of kings has gone and done something sneaky i have not yet learned what it is but the little waxed tips to his mustaches quiver whenever he deigns to grant me an audience so i presume it is something not calculated to make you sleep better of nights your majesty ive spread about a few goldpiecesthe makuraners coin only silver as you know so they lust for gold as i do after pretty boysbut without success as yet i keep trying the smile left krispos face hed sent iakovitzes to makuran precisely because he was so good at worming information out of unlikely places he read on other than his mustaches rubyab is being reasonably cooperative i think i shall be able to talk him out of restoring that desert fortress his troops won in our last little skirmish for the donative you have in mind he also seems willing to lower the tolls he charges caravans for permission to enter videssos from his realm that in turn may should but probably will not enable those thieves to lower their prices to us good krispos said aloud hed been after makuran to lower those tolls since the days of rubyabs father nakhorgan if the king of kings finally intended to yield there and to restore the fortress of sarmizegetusa maybe iakovitzes was reading too much into waggling waxed mustachios another cadaster followed iakovitzes letter from makuran krispos wondered if barsymes deliberately arranged the parchments to keep him from being stupefied by one tax list after another the vestiarios had served in the palaces a long time now his definition of perfect service grew broader every year after scrawling i have read itkrispos at the bottom of the tax document krispos went on to the parchment beneath it like balaneus missive this one also came from an ecclesiastic here a priest from pityos a town on the southern coast of the videssian sea just across the rhamnos river from vaspurakan the humble priest taronites to krispos avtokrator greetings may it please your majesty i regret i must report the outbreak of a new and malignant heresy among the peasants and herders dwelling in the hinterlands of this phosforsaken municipality krispos snorted why that sort of news was supposed to please him had always been beyond his comprehension formal written videssian he sometimes thought was designed to obscure meaning rather than reveal it his eyes went back to the page this heresy strikes me as one particularly wicked and also as one calculated as if by the foul god skotos to deceive both the lightminded and those of a certain type of what might in other circumstances be termed piety as best i can gather its tenets are the more krispos read the less he liked the heretics if taronites had things straight believed the material world to have been created by skotos not phos phos light then inhabited only the soul not the body in which it dwelt thus killing for example but liberated the soul from its trap of corrupting flesh arson was merely the destruction of that which was already dross even robbery had the salutary effect on its victim of lessening his ties to the material if ever a theology had been made for brigands this was it taronites wrote this wickedness appears first to have been perpetrated and put forward by a certain thanasios wherefrom its adherents style themselves thanasioi i pray that your majesty may quickly send both many priests to instruct the populace hereabouts on proper doctrine and many troops to lay low the thanasioi and protect the fearful orthodox from the depredations may phos be with you always in your struggle for the good on the petition krispos wrote your requests shall be granted then he picked up stylus and tablet and scribbled two notes to himself for action in the morning to see oxeites the ecumenical patriarch on sending a priestly delegation to pityos and to write to the provincial governor to get him to shift troops to the environs of the border town he read through the note from taronites again put it down with a shake of his head a naturally argumentative folk the videssians were never content simply to leave their faith as they had found it whenever two of them got together they tinkered with it theological argument was as enjoyable a sport as watching the horses run in the amphitheater this time though the tinkering had gone awry he used the third leaf of the waxed tablet for another selfreminder to draft an imperial edict threatening outlawry for anyone professing the doctrines of thanasios patriarch too he scribbled adding excommunication to outlawry would strengthen the edict nicely after that he was relieved to get back to an ordinary unthreatening tax register this one from the eastern province of develtos made him feel good a band of invading halogai from the far north had sacked the fortress of develtos not long after he became avtokrator this year for the first time revenues from the province exceeded what theyd been before the fortress fell well done he wrote at the bottom of the register the logothetes and clerks who handled cadasters for the treasury would know he was pleased without their patient usually unloved work videssos would crash to the ground as emperor krispos understood that when hed been a peasant hed loved tax collectors no better than any other kind of locust he got up stretched rubbed his eyes working by candlelight was hard and had grown harder the past few years as his sight began to lengthen he didnt know what he would do if his eyes kept getting worse would he have to have someone read each petition to him and hope he could remember enough to decide it sensibly he didnt look forward to that but had trouble coming up with any better answer he stretched again yawned until his jaw creaked the best answer right now is some sleep he said aloud he lit a little lamp at one of the candles then blew them out the smell of hot wax filled his nostrils most of the torches in the hallway had gone out the guttering flames of those that still burned made krispos shadow writhe and swoop like something with a life of its own the lamp he carried cast a small wan pool of light around him he walked past barsymes chamber hed lived there once himself when hed been one of the rare vestiarioi who were not eunuchs now he occupied the room next door the imperial bedchamber hed slept there longer than in any other quarters hed ever had sometimes that just seemed a simple part of the way his world worked tonight though as often happened when he thought about it he found it very strange he opened the double doors inside the bedchamber someone stirred ice ran up his back he stooped to pluck a dagger from his scarlet boot filled his lungs to shout for help from the haloga guards at the entranceway to the imperial residence avtokrators of the videssins too often died in unpeaceful ways the shout died unuttered krispos quickly straightened this was no assassin in his bed only one of the palace serving maids she smiled an invitation at him he shook his head not tonight drina he said i told the esteemed sir i intended to go straight to sleep thats not what he said to me your majesty drina answered shrugging her bare shoulders gleamed in the lamplight as she sat up taller in bed the lamp left most of the rest of her in shadow making her an even greater mystery than woman ordinarily is he said to come make you happy so here i am he must have misheard krispos didnt believe that not for a minute barsymes did not mishear his instructions every so often he simply decided not to listen to them this seemed to be one of those nights its all right drina you may go in a small voice the maid said may it please your majesty id truly sooner not the vestiarios would be most displeased if i left you who rules here barsymes or i but krispos did not say that not out loud he ruled the empire but around the palaces what was pleasing to the vestiarios had the force of law some eunuch chamberlains used their intimacy with the avtokrator for their own advantage or that of their relatives barsymes to his credit had never done that in exchange krispos deferred to him on matters affecting only the palaces so now he yielded with such grace as he could very well stay if you care to no one need know well sleep on opposite sides of the bed drina still looked worried but like any good servant knew how far she could safely push her master as you say your majesty she scurried over to the far side of the bed here you rest where ive been lying ill have warmed it for you its not winter yet by the good god and im no invalid krispos said with a snort but he pulled his robe off over his head and draped it on a bedpost then he stepped out of his sandals blew out the lamp and got into bed the warm silk of the sheets was kind to his skin as his head met the downfilled pillow he smelled the faint sweetness that said drina had rested there before him for a moment he wanted her in spite of his own weariness but when he opened his mouth to tell her so what came out was an enormous yawn he thought he excused himself but fell asleep so fast he was never sure he woke up some time in the middle of the night that happened more and more often as the years went by he needed a few seconds to realize what the round smoothness pressed against his side was drina breathed smoothly easily carefree as a sleeping child krispo envied her lack of worry then smiled when he thought he was partly responsible for it now he did want her when he reached over her shoulder to cup her breast in his hand she muttered something drowsy and happy and rolled onto her back she hardly woke up as he caressed her and then took her he found that kind of trust strangely touching and tried hard to be as gentle as he could afterward she quickly slipped back into deep sleep krispos got out of bed to use the chamber pot then lay down beside her again he too was almost asleep when he suddenly wondered not for the first time whether barsymes knew him better than he knew himself the trouble with the hall of the nineteen couches phostis thought was that the windows were too big the ceremonial hall named back in the days when videssian nobles actually ate reclining was cooler in summer than most thanks to those large windows but the torches lamps and candles needed for nighttime feasts were lodestones for moths mosquitoes water bugs even bats and birds watching a crisped moth land in the middle of a bowl of pickled octopus tentacles did not inflame the appetite watching a nightjar swoop down and snatch the moth out of the bowl made phostis wish hed never summoned his friends to the feast in the first place he thought about announcing it was over but that wouldnt do either inevitably word would get back to his father he could already hear krispos peasantaccented voice ringing in his ears the least you could do son is make up your mind the imagined scolding seemed so real that he whipped his head around in alarm wondering if krispos had somehow snuck up behind him but nosave for his own companions he was alone here he felt very much alone one thing his father had succeeded in doing was to make him wonder who cared for him because he was himself and who merely because he was junior avtokrator and heir to the videssian throne asking the question though often proved easier than answering it so he had lingering suspicions about almost everyone he knew you wont need to look over your shoulder like that forever your majesty said vatatzes who was sitting at phostis right hand he trusted vatatzes further than most of his friends being only the son of a midlevel logothete the youth was unlikely to have designs on the crown himself now he slapped krispos on the shoulder and went on surely one day before too long youll be able to hold your feasts when and as you like one more word and he would have spoken treason phostis friends frequently walked that fine line so far to his relief nobody had forced him to pretend not to hear something he too wonderedhow could he help but wonderhow long his father would stay vigorous it might be another day it might be another twenty years no way to tell without magic and even that held risks greater than he cared to take for one thing as was but fitting the finest sorcerous talent in the empire shielded the avtokrators fate from those who would spy it out for another seeking to divine an emperors future was in and of itself a capital crime phostis wondered what krispos was doing now administering affairs probably that was what his father usually did a couple of years before krispos had tried to get him to share some of the burden hed tried too but it hadnt been pleasant work especially because krispos stood behind him while he shuffled through parchments again he could almost hear his father hurry up boy one way or another you have to decide if you dont do it who will and his own wail but what if im wrong you will be sometimes krispos had spoken with such maddening certainty that he wanted to hit him you try to do a couple of things you try not to make the same mistake twice and you take the chance to set one right later if it comes along put that way it sounded so easy but after a couple of days of case after complex case phostis concluded ease in anythingfishing swordswallowing running an empire anythingcame only with having done the job for years and years as most young men do he suspected he was brighter than his father he certainly had a better education he was good at ciphering he could quote secular poets and historians as well as phos holy scriptures and he didnt talk as if hed just stepped away from a plow but krispos had one thing he lacked experience his father did what needed doing almost without thinking about it then went on to the next thing and took care of that too meanwhile phostis himself floundered and bit his lip wondering where proper action lay by the time he made one choice three more had grown up to stare him in the face he knew hed disappointed his father when he asked to be excused from his share of imperial business how will you learn what you need to know save by this work krispos had asked but i cant do it properly hed answered to him that explained everythingif something didnt come easy why not work at something else instead krispos had shaken his head wouldnt you sooner find that out now while im here to show you what you need then after im gone and you find the whole sack of barley on your back at once the rustic metaphor hadnt helped persuade phostis he wished his familys nobility ran back farther than his father wished he wasnt named for a poor farmer dead of cholera vatatzes snapped him out of his gloomy reverie what say we go find us some girls eh your majesty go on if you care to youll probably run into my brothers if you do phostis laughed without much mirth as much at himself as at evripos and katakolon he couldnt even enjoy the perquisites of imperial life as they did ever since hed discovered how many women would lie down with him merely on account of the title he bore much of the enjoyment had gone out of the game some nobles kept little enclosures where they handraised deer and boar until the animals grew tame as pets then theyd shoot them phostis had never seen the sport in that or in bedding girls who either didnt dare say no or else turned sleeping with him into as coldblooded a calculation as any krispos made in the agelong struggle between videssos and makuran hed tried explaining that to his brothers once not long after katakolon then fourteen seducedor was seduced byone of the women who did the palace laundry exalted by his own youthful prowess hed paid no heed whatever to phostis as for evripos hed said only do you want to don the blue robe and live out your life as a monk suit yourself big brother but its not the life for me had he wanted a monastic life it would have been easy to arrange but the sole reason hed ever considered it was to get away from his father he lacked both a monkish vocation and a monkish temperament it wasnt that he sought to mortify his flesh but rather that heusuallyfound loveless or mercenary coupling more mortifying than none he often wondered how he would do when krispos decided to marry him off he was just glad that day had not yet arrived when it did he was sure his father would pick him a bride with more of an eye toward advantage for the imperial house than toward his happiness sometimes marriages of that sort worked as well as any others sometimes he turned to vatatzes my friend you know not how fortunate you are coming from a family of but middling rank all too often i feel my birth more as a cage or a curse than as something in which to rejoice ah your majesty youve drunk yourself sad thats all it is vatatzes turned to the panpiper and pandoura player who made soft music as a background against which to talk he snapped his fingers and raised his voice here you fellows give us something lively now to lift the young majestys spirits the musicians put their heads together for a moment the man with the panpipes set them down and picked up a kettleshaped drum heads came up all through the hall of the nineteen couches as his hands evoked thunder from the drumhead the pandoura player struck a ringing fiery chord phostis recognized the vaspurakaner dance they played but it failed to gladden him before long almost all the feasters snaked along in a dance line clapping their hands and shouting in time to the tune phostis sat in his place even when vatatzes tugged at the sleeve of his robe finally with a shrug vatatzes gave up and joined the dance he prescribed for me the medicine that works for him phostis thought he didnt want to be joyous though discontent suited him when he got to his feet the dancers cheered but he did not join their line he walked through the open bronze doors of the hall of the nineteen couches down the low broad marble stairs he looked up at the sky gauging the time by how high the waning gibbous moon had risen somewhere in the fifth hour of the night he judgednot far from midnight he lowered his eyes the imperial residence was separated from the rest of the buildings of the palace compound and ncreened off by a grove of cherry trees to give the avtokrator and his family at least the illusion of privacy through the trees phostis saw one window brightly lit by candles or lamps he nodded to himself yes krispos was at work there with peasant persistence his father kept on fighting against the immensity of the empire he ruled as phostis watched the window went dark even krispos occasionally yielded to sleep though phostis was sure he would have evaded it if he could somebody stuck his head out through one of the halls many big windows come on back your majesty he called voice blurry with wine its just starting to get bouncy in here go on without me phostis said he wished hed never gathered the feasters together the ease with which they enjoyed themselves only made his own unhappiness seem worse by comparison he absently swatted at a mosquito there werent as many out here away from the lights with the last lamps extinguished in the imperial residence it fell into invisibility behind the cherry grove he started walking slowly in that direction he didnt want to get there until he was sure his father had gone to bed haloga guardsmen stood outside the doorway the big blond northerners raised their axes in salute as they recognized phostis had he been a miscreant the axes would have gone up too but not as a gesture of respect as always one of the palace eunuchs waited just inside the entrance good evening young majesty he said bowing politely to phostis good evening mystakon phostis answered of all the eunuch chamberlains mystakon was closest to his own age and hence the one he thought most likely to understand and sympathize with him it hadnt occurred to him to wonder how mystakon felt going through what should have been ripe young manhood already withered on the vine so to speak is my father asleep he is in bed yes mystakon answered with the peculiarly toneless voice eunuchs could affect to communicate subtle double meanings phostis however noticed no subtleties tonight all he felt was a surge of relief at having got through another day without having to confront his fatheror having his father confront him i will go to bed too prominent sir he said using mystakons special title in the eunuch hierarchy everything is in readiness for you young majesty mystakon said a tautology phostis would have been shocked were his chamber not ready whenever he needed it if you would be so kind as to accompany me phostis let the chamberlain guide him down the hallways he could have navigated blindfolded in the torchlight the souvenirs of long centuries of imperial triumph seemed somehow faded indistinct the conical helmet that had once belonged to a king of kings of makuran was just a lump of iron the painting of videssian troops pouring over the walls of mashiz was a daub that could have depicted any squabble phostis shook his head was he merely tired or was the light playing tricks on his eyes his bedchamber lay as far from krispos as it could in a tuckedaway corner of the imperial residence it had stood empty for years maybe centuries until he chose it as a refuge from his father not long after his beard began to sprout the door to the chamber stood ajar butteryellow light trickling through the opening said a lamp had been kindled do you require anything further young majesty mystakon asked some wine perhaps or some bread and cheese or i could inquire if any mutton is left from that which was served to your father no dont bother phostis said more sharply than hed intended he tried to soften his voice im content thank you i just want to get some rest as you say young majesty mystakon glided away like many eunuchs he was soft and plump he walked in soft slippers silently and with little mincing steps with his robes swirling around him as he moved he reminded phostis of a beamy merchant ship under full sail phostis closed and barred the door behind him he took off his robe and got out of his sandals they were allred like his fathersabout the only imperial prerogative he shared with krispos he thought bitterly he threw himself down on the bed and blew out the lamp the bedchamber plunged into blackness and phostis into sleep he dreamed hed always been given to vivid dreams and this one was more so than most in it he found himself pacing naked and fat through a small enclosure food was everywheremutton bread and cheese jar upon jar of wine his father peered at him from over the top of a wooden fence phostis watched krispos nod in sober satisfaction and reach for a hunting bow next thing he knew he was awake his heart pounding his body bathed with cold sweat for a moment he thought the darkness that filled his sight meant death then full awareness returned he sketched phos suncircle above his chest in thanks as he realized his nightmare was not truth that helped calm him until he thought of his place at court he shivered maybe the dream held some reality after all zaidas went down on his knees before krispos then to his belly letting his forehead knock against the bright tesserae of the mosaic floor in full proskynesis up up krispos said impatiently you know i have no great use for ceremonial the wizard rose as smoothly as he had prostrated himself yes your majesty but you know the respect a mage will show to ritual without ritual our art would fall to nothing so youve said many times these past many years krispos answered now the ritual is over sit relax let us talk he waved zaidas to a chair in the chamber where hed been working the night before barsymes came in with a jar of wine and two crystal goblets the vestiarios poured for emperor and mage then bowed himself out zaidas savored his wines bouquet for a moment before he sipped he smiled thats a fine vintage your majesty krispos drank too aye it is pleasant i fear ill never make a proper connoisseur though its all so much better than what i grew up drinking that i have trouble telling whats just good from the best zaidas took another longer pull at his goblet what we have here your majestry is among the best let me assure you the mage was a tall slim man about a dozen years younger than krisposthe first white threads were appearing in the dark fabric of his beard krispos remembered him as a skinny excitable youth already full of talent it had not shrunk with his maturity barsymes returned now with a tureen and two bowls porridge with salted anchovies to break your fast your majesty excellent sir the porridge was of wheat silky smooth and rich with cream the anchovies added piquancy krispos knew that if he asked his cook for plain lumpy barley porridge the man would quit in disgust as with the wine he knew this was better but sometimes he craved the tastes with which hed grown up when his bowl was about half empty he said to zaidas the reason i asked you here today was a report ive had from the westlands about a new heresy that seems to have arisen there by this account its an unpleasant one he passed the mage the letter from the priest taronites zaidas read it through his brow furrowing in concentration when he was done he looked up at krispos yes your majesty if the holy sirs tale is to be fully credited these thanasioi seem most unpleasant heretics indeed but while there is some considerable connection between religion and sorcery id have thought youd go first to the ecclesiastical authorities rather than to a layman like me in most cases i would have in fact ive already directed the ecumenical patriarch to send priests to pityos but these heretics sound so vileif as you say taronites is to be believedthat i wondered if they have any connection to our old friend harvas zaidas pursed his lips then let air hiss out between harvasor perhaps his proper name was rhavashad dealt the empire fierce blows in the north and east in the first years of krispos reign he was or seemed to be a renegade priest of phos who had gone over to the dark god skotos and thus prolonged his own wicked life more than two centuries beyond its natural terms with help from zaidas among others videssian forces had vanquished the halogai that harvas led at pliskavos in kubrat his own power was brought to nothing there but he had not been taken alive or dead what precisely do you wish me to do your majesty zaidas asked you head the sorcerers collegium these days my friend and you were always sensitive to harvas style of magic if anyone can tell through sorcery whether harvas is the one behind these thanasioi i expect youre the man is such a thing possible what with the little we have to go on here krispos tapped taronites letter with a forefinger an interesting question zaidas looked through rather than at krispos as he considered at last he said perhaps it may be done your majesty though the sorcery required will be most delicate a basic magical principle is the law of similarity which is to say like causes yield like effects most effective in this case i believe would be an inversion of the law in an effort to determine whether like effectsthe disruption and devastation of the empire now and from harvas past depredationsspring from like causes you know your business best krispos said hed never tried to learn magical theory himself what mattered to him were the results he might attain through sorcery zaidas however kept right on explaining perhaps to fix his ideas in his own mind the law of contagion might also prove relevant if harvas was in physical contact with any of these thanasioi who then came into contact with the priest taronites directly or indirectly such a trace might appear on the parchment here under normal circumstances two or three intermediate contacts would blur the originator beyond hope of detection such was harvas power however and such was our comprehension of the nature of that power that it ought to be detectable at several more removes just as you say krispos answered agreeably perhaps because of his lectures at the sorcerers collegium zaidas had a knack for expounding magecraft so clearly that it made sense to the avtokrator even if he lacked both ability and interest in practicing it himself he asked how long before you will be ready to try your sorcery that faraway look returned to zaidas eyes i shall of course require the parchment here then the research required to frame the precise terms of the spell to be employed and the gathering of the necessary materials not that those cant proceed concurrently of course your majesty were it war i could try tomorrow or perhaps even tonight i would be more confident of the results obtained though if i had another couple of days to refine my original formulation take the time you need to be right krispos said if harvas is at the bottom of this we must know it and if he appears not to be we must be certain hes not concealing himself through his own magic all true your majesty zaidas tucked the letter from taronites into the leather pouch he wore on his belt he rose and began to prostrate himself again as one did before leaving the avtokrators presence krispos waved a hand to tell him not to bother nodding the wizard said i shall begin work at once thanks zaidas if harvas is on the loose krispos let the sentence slide to an awkward halt if harvas was stirring up trouble again he wouldnt sleep well until the wizardprince was beaten or until he was beaten himself in the latter case his sleep would be eternal zaidas knew that as well as he did one way or the other your majesty we shall know he promised he bustled off to begin shaping the enchantments he would use to seek harvas presence krispos listened to his footfalls fade down the corridor he counted himself lucky to be served by men of the quality of zaidas in his less modest moments he also thought their presence reflected well on his rule would such good and able men have served a wicked foolish master he got up from his seat stretched and went out into the corridor himself coming his way was phostis both men young and not so young stopped in their tracks krispos in the doorway his heir in the middle of the hall among all the other things phostis was he served as a living reminder that krispos rule would not endure forever krispos remembered taking him from the midwifes arms and holding him in the crook of his elbow now they were almost of a height phostis still lacked an inch maybe two of krispos stature but dara had been short phostis was also a living reminder of his mother take away his neatly trimmed dark beardthese days thick and wiry youths downiness almost goneand he wore daras face his features were not as craggy as krispos and his eyes had the same distinctive small fold of skin at the inner corner that daras had good morning father he said good morning krispos answered wondering as always if he was phostis father the young man did not look like him but he did not look like anthimos either phostis did not have krispos native obstinacy that was certain the one time hed tried showing the lad how the empire worked phostis quickly lost interest krispos heart ached over that but hed seen enough with anthimos to know a man could not be forced to govern against his will good morning was as much as krispos and phostis usually had to say to each other krispos waited for his eldest son to walk by without another word as was his habit but phostis surprised him by asking why were you closeted with zaidas so early father theres some trouble with heresy out in the westlands krispos spoke matteroffactly to keep phostis from knowing he was startled if the youngster did want to learn he would teach him more likely though krispos thought with a touch of sadness phostis asked just for zaidas sake the wizard was like a favorite uncle to him what sort of heresy phostis asked krispos explained the tenets of the thanasioi as well as he could from taronites description of them this question surprised him less than the previous one theology was videssos favorite intellectual sport laymen who pored over phos holy scriptures were not afraid to try conclusions with the ecumenical patriarch himself phostis rubbed his chin as he thought a gesture he shared with krispos then he said in the abstract father the doctrines sound rigorous yes but not necessarily inspired by skotos their followers may have misinterpreted how these doctrines are to be applied but to the ice with the abstract krispos growled what matters is that these maniacs are laying the countryside to waste and murdering anyone who doesnt happen to agree with them save your precious abstract for the schoolroom son i simply started to say phostis threw his hands in the air oh whats the use you wouldnt listen anyhow muttering angrily under his breath he marched down the corridor past krispos the senior avtokrator sighed as he watched his sons retreating back maybe it was better when they just mouthed platitudes at each other then they didnt fight but how phostis could find anything good to say about heretics who were also bandits was beyond krispos only when his heir had turned a corner and disappeared did krispos remember that hed interrupted the lad before he finished talking about the thanasioi he sighed again hed have to apologize to phostis the next time he saw him all too likely phostis would take the apology the wrong way and that would start another fight well if it did it did krispos was willing to take the chance by the time he thought of going down the corridor and apologizing on the spot though it was too late phostis had already left the imperial residence krispos went about the business of governing with only about threefourths of his attention for the next couple of days every time a messenger or a chamberlain came in the avtokrator forgot what he was doing in the hope the fellow would announce zaidas sorcery was ready every time he was disappointed he went back to work in an evil temper no miscreants were pardoned while zaidas prepared his magic when at lastwithin the promised two days though krispos tried not to notice thatzaidas was on the point of beginning he came himself to let the emperor know krispos set aside with relief the cadaster he was reading lead on excellent sir he exclaimed one difficulty with being avtokrator was that going anywhere automatically became complicated krispos could not simply walk with zaidas over to the sorcerers collegium no he had to be accompanied by a squad of haloga bodyguards which made sense and by the dozen parasol bearers whose bright silk canopies proclaimed his officewhich to his way of thinking didnt throughout his reign hed fought hard to do away with as much useless ceremonial as he could he knew he was losing the fight custom was a tougher foe than harvas bloodmaddened barbarians had ever been at last though not too interminably much later he stood inside zaidas chamber on the second story of the sorcerers collegium one big blond axeman went in there with him and the wizard two more guarded the doorway the rest waited outside the building with the parasol bearers zaidas drew forth the parchment on which taronites had written his accusations against the thanasioi he also produced another parchment this one yellowed with age seeing krispos raised eyebrow he explained i took the liberty of visiting the archives your majesty to secure a document indited personally by harvas my first spell will compare them against each other to determine whether a common malice informs both i see krispos said more or less truthfully by all means carry on as if i were not here oh i shall your majesty for my own safetys sake above any other reason zaidas said krispos nodded that he understood completely hed seized the crown after anthimos intent on destroying him by sorcery botched an incantation and slew himself instead zaidas intoned a lowvoiced prayer to phos ending by sketching the suncircle over his heart krispos imitated the gesture the haloga guard did not like most of his fellows in videssos the city he still followed his own nations fierce and gloomy gods the wizard took from a covered dish a couple of redbrown shriveled objects the dried heart and tongue of a porpoise he said they shall confer invincible effect on my charm he cut strips off them with a knife as if he were whittling soft wood then tossed those strips into a squat bowl of bluish liquid with each additional fragment the blue deepened stirring his mix lefthanded with a silver rod zaidas chanted over the bowl and used his right hand to make passes above it he frowned i can feel the wickedness we face here he said his voice tight and tense now to learn whether it comes from one parchment or both he took the stirring rod and let a couple of drops of the mixture in the bowl fall on a corner of the letter from the archives the one harvas had written the liquid flared bright red just the color of freshspilled blood zaidas drew back a pace though he was a layman he drew the suncircle again even so by the good god he murmured now sounding shocked and shaken i never imagined a response as intense as that green even perhaps yellow but he broke off staring at harvas letter as if it were displaying its fangs i take it you expect the petition from taronites to do the same if harvas has a hand in turning the thanasioi loose on us krispos said i sincerely hope the solution does not turn crimson your majesty zaidas said that would in effect mean harvas lurked just outside the temple wherein taronites was writing but the change of color will indicate the degree of relationship between harvas and these new heretics more cautiously than he had before the wizard daubed some of the liquid onto taronites letter krispos leaned forward waiting to see what color the stuff turned he did not know whether it would go red but he expected some change and probably not a small one by zaidas choice of words so did he but the liquid stayed blue both men stared at it for that matter so did the bodyguard krispos asked how long must we wait for the change to take place your majesty if it was going to occur it would have done so by now zaidas answered then he checked himself i must always bear in mind that harvas is a master of concealment and obfuscation being such he might be able to evade this test porpoise heart or no but there is a cross check i do not think he can escape try as he might the wizard picked up the two parchments touched the damp spots on them together being directly present in the one letter harvas essence cannot fail to draw forth from the other any lingering trace of him he held the two parchments against each other long enough to let a man draw five or six breaths then separated them the blue smear on taronites petition remained blue not green yellow orange red or even pink zaidas looked astonished krispos was not only astonished but also profoundly suspicious he said are you saying this means harvas has nothing whatever to do with the thanasioi i find that hard to believe so do i your majesty zaidas said if you ask what i say i say the connection between the two is all too likely my magic however seems to be saying something else again but is your magic right or have you just been deceived krispos demanded can you tell me for certain one way or the other i know you understand how important this is not just to me but to videssos now and in the future yes your majesty having faced harvas once having seen the evils he worked and those to which he inspired his followers i know you want to be as positive as possible as to whether youand weconfront him yet again that is well put krispos said he doubted he could have been so judicious himself truth was as soon as hed seen taronites letter the fear of harvas rose up in his mind like a ghost in one of the romances that the booksellers hawked in the plaza of palamas no matter what zaidas magical tests said about the thanasioi his own terror spoke louder to him so he went on excellent sir have you any other sorceries you might use to find out whether this one is mistaken let me think zaidas said and proceeded to do just that for the next several minutes standing still as a statue in the center of his study suddenly he brightened i know something which may serve he hurried over to a cabinet set against one wall and began opening its small drawers and rummaging through them the haloga guardsmen moved to place himself between krispos and zaidas in case the wizard suddenly whipped out a dagger and tried to murder the avtokrator this he did though zaidas was a longtime trusted friend and though the chamber doubtless held weapons far more fell than mere knives krispos smiled but did not seek to dissuade the northerner who was but doing his duty as he reckoned best zaidas let out a happy grunt here we are he turned around displaying not a dagger but rather a piece of highly polished translucent white stone this is nicomar your majesty a variety of alabaster when properly evoked it has the virtue of generating both victory and amity thus we shall see if any amity so to speak lies between the two letters now in our possession if so we shall know harvas indeed has a hand in the heresy of the thanasioi alabaster you say krispos waited for zaidas to nod then continued some of the ceiling panels in the imperial residence are also of alabaster to let in more light why dont ah victory and amity always dwell under my roof he thought of his unending disagreements with phostis when properly evoked i said the stone brings forth those virtues zaidas answered smiling the evocation is not easy nor is the effect lasting oh krispos hoped he didnt sound too disappointed well go ahead and do what you need to do then the wizard prayed over the gleaming slab of nicomar and anointed it with sweetsmelling oil as if it were being made a prelate or an emperor krispos wondered if he would be able to feel the change in the stone as even a person of no sorcerous talent could feel the curative current that passed between a healerpriest and his patient to him though the nicomar remained simply a stone he had to trust that zaidas knew what he was about with a final pass that seemed to require nearly jointless fingers zaidas said the good god willing we are now ready to proceed first i shall examine the letter known to have been written by harvas he set the nicomar over the place where he had previously splashed his magical liquid fierce red light blazed through the stone krispos said this tells us what we already knew so it does your majesty zaidas answered it also tells me the nicomar is performing as it should he lifted the thin slab of stone and held it over a brass brazier from which the pungent smoke of frankincense coiled slowly toward the ceiling before krispos could ask what he was doing he explained i fumigate the nicomar to remove from it the influence of the parchment it just touched thus on the crucial test to come the workings of the law of contagion shall not be permitted to influence the result do you see without waiting for krispos reply the wizard set the polished alabaser down on the letter from taronites krispos waited for another flash of red but only a steady blue light penetrated the nicomar what does that mean krispos asked half hoping half dreading zaidas would tell him something other than the obvious but the wizard did not your majesty it means that so far as my sorcery can determine no relationship whatever exists between the thanasioi and harvas i still find that hard to believe krispos said as i told you before so do i zaidas answered but if you have a choice between believing whatever you happen to feel at the moment and that which has evidence to support it which course will you take i trust i know you well enough to know what you would say were it a matter of law rather than one of magic there you have me krispos admitted you are so confident in what these conjurations tell you then i am your majesty were it anyone but harvas the first lest alone would have contented me with the confirmation of its import by the nicomar i would stake my life on the accuracy of what i have divined today you may be doing just that you know krispos said with u grim edge to his voice zaidas looked startled for a moment then nodded yes thats so isnt it harvas on the loose once more would terrify the bravest he spat on the floor between his feet to show his rejection of the evil god skotos the god harvas had for a patron but by phos the lord with the great and good mind i tell you again that harvas is in no way connected to the thanasioi misguided they may be guided amiss by harvas they are not he sounded so certain that krispos had to believe him despite his own misgivings as the sorcerer had said evidence counted for more than vague feelings and if harvas dread hand did not lie behind the thanasioi why how dangerous could they possibly be the avtokrator smiled over the past couple of decades hed faced and overcome enough merely human foes to trust he had their measure thank you for relieving my mind excellent sir your reward will not be small he told zaidas then because the wizard had a habit of putting such rewards into the treasury of the sorcerers collegium he added keep some for yourself this time my friend i command it you neednt fear for that your majesty zaidas said in fact i have already received the same instruction from one i reckon higher in rank than you normally the only entity a videssian would reckon higher in rank than his avtokrator was phos krispos though knew perfectly well about whom zaidas was talking chuckling he said tell aulissa i say she is a good sensible woman and makes you an excellent wife be sure you listen to her too i will pass your words to her as you say them zaidas promised with some other women i might not for fear of inflaming their notions of how important they are in the scheme of things but since my dear aulissa is as sensible as you say i know shell accept the compliment for what its worth and not a copper more the two of you are a good deal alike that way krispos said youre lucky to have each other even when dara was still alive hed sometimes envied zaidas and aulissa their tranquil happiness they seemed to know each others needs and adjust to each others foibles as if they were two halves of the same person his own marriage had not been like that he and dara got along well enough on the whole but theyd always had their fall storms and wintry blizzards along with the warmth of summer zaidas and his wife seemed to live in late spring the year round the wizard said besides your majesty aulissa has noted that sotades is now twelve years old the boy will soon begin his serious schooling which as she pointed out requires serious quantities of gold ah yes krispos said wisely though as avtokrator he had not had to worry about the expense of educating his sons every scholar in the city was eager to have any or all of them as his pupils having taught the emperors child could only improve a savants reputation and one of those children would likely be avtokrator himself one day in krispos experience scholars were no more immune to seeking influence than any other men i am relieved for you your majesty and for the empire of videssos zaidas said nodding toward the table where hed carried out his magic im relieved too krispos picked up the letter from harvas which the wizard had used and quickly read it it was the one wherein harvas declared he had cut out iakovitzes tongue because the diplomats freedom with it displeased him krispos was not sorry to put down the parchment that had been far from the worst of harvas atrocities being spared the worry of another round of them was worth a goodly sum of gold when the avtokrator left the conjuration chamber the haloga guard fell in behind him the two axemen who had stood watch at the doorway preceded him out of the sorcerers collegium the parasol bearers had been sitting around outside the building and passing the time with the rest of the squad of imperial guards their canopies fluttered in agitation when the avtokrator reappeared after a moment though they formed themselves into the neat pairs that always accompanied krispos in public on the trip back to the palace compound their presence was pure ostentation for almost the entire short journey was under covered colonnades not for the first timenot for the hundredthkrispos wished hed been able to get away with cutting the stifling ceremonial that surrounded him every hour of the day and night but by the horror that thought evoked in the palace staff in officials of the government and even among his guards he might have proposed offering sacrifice to skotos on the altar of the high temple fights against custom just were not winnable he turned around glanced back north toward the sorcerers collegium he would reward zaidas well indeed not least for relieving his mind if the thanasioi had come up with their foolish heresy all on their own he was sure he would have no trouble putting them down in his two decades and more as avtokrator after all hed gone from one triumph to another why should this struggle be any different ii from the outside phos high temple seemed more massive than beautiful the heavy buttresses that carried the weight of the great central dome to the ground reminded phostis of the thick columnar legs of an elephant one of the immense beasts had been imported to videssos the city from the southern shore of the sailors sea when he was a boy it hadnt lived long save in his memory a poem hed read likened the high temple to a glowing pearl concealed within an oyster he didnt care as much for that comparison the temples exterior was not rough and ugly as oysters were just plain and its interior outshone any pearl phostis climbed the stairway from the paved courtyard surrounding the high temple up to the narthex or outer hall being only a junior avtokrator he was less hemmed round with ceremony than his father only a pair of haloga guardsmen flanked him on the stairs many nobles hired bodyguards none of the other people heading for the service paid phostis any special heed the high temple was not crowded in any case not for an early afternoon liturgy on a day of no particular ritual import instead of going up the narrow way to the screenedoff imperial niche phostis decided to worship with everyone else in the main hall surrounding the altar the halogai shrugged and marched in with him hed been going into the high temple for as long as his memory reached and longer hed been just a baby when he was proclaimed avtokrator here for all that infinite familiarity though the temple never failed to awe him the lavish use of gold and silver sheeting the polished mossagate columns with the acanthus capitals the jewels and motherofpearl inserts set into the blond oak of the pews the slabs of turquoise pure white crystal and rose quartz laid into the walls to simulate the sky at morning noon and eventide for all these he had perspective he had grown up among similar riches and lived with them still but they served only to lead the eye up and up to the great dome that surmounted the altar and the mosaicwork image of phos in its center the dome itself had the feel of a special miracle thanks to the sunbeams that penetrated the many small windows set into its base it seemed to float above the rest of the temple rather than being a part of it the play of light off the goldfaced tesserae set at irregular angles made its surface sparkle and shift as one walked along far beneath it phostis could not imagine how the merely material might better represent the transcendence of phos heaven but even the glittering surround of the dome was secondary to phos himself the lord with the great and good mind stared down at his worshipers with eyes that not only never closed but also seemed to follow as they moved if anyone concealed a sin that phos would see it his long bearded visage was stern in judgment in his left hand the good god held the book of life wherein he recorded each mans every action with death came the accounting those whose evil deeds outweighed the good would fall to the eternal ice while those who had worked more good than wickedness shared heaven with their god phostis felt the weight of phos gaze each time he entered the high temple the lord with the great and good mind shown in the dome would surely grant justice but mercy few men are arrogant enough to demand perfect justice for fear they might get it the power of that image reached even the heathen halogai they looked up trying to test their stares against the eternal eyes in the dome as generations of men and women had learned before them the test was more than any a mere man could successfully undertake when they had to lower their gaze they did so almost furtively as if hoping no one had noticed them withdrawing from a struggle its all right bragi nokkvi phostis murmured as he sat between them no man can count himself worthy to confront the good god the big blond northerners scowled bragjs cheeks went red with his fair pale skin the flush was easy to track nokkvi said we are halogai young majesty our life is to fear nothing to let nothing overawe us in this picture dwells magic to make us reckon ourselves less than what we are his fingers writhed in an apotropaic sign measured against the good god we are all less than we think ourselves to be phostis answered quietly that is what the image in the dome shows us both his guards shook their heads before they could argue further though a pair of bluerobed priests their pates shaven their beards bushy and untrimmed advanced down the aisle toward the altar each wore on his left breast a clothofgold circlet symbol of the sun the greatest source of phos lights the gemencrusted thuribles they swung emitted great clouds of sweetly fragrant smoke as the priests passed each row of pews the congregants sitting in it rose to their feet to salute oxeites ecumenical patriarch of the videssians who followed close behind them his robe was of gold tissue heavily overlain with pearls and precious stones in all the empire only the avtokrator himself possessed more splendid raiment and just as footgear all of red was reserved for the emperor alone so only the patriarch had the privilege of wearing skyblue boots a choir of men and boys sang a hymn of praise to phos as oxeites took his place behind the altar their sweet notes echoed and reechoed from the dome as if emanating straight from the good gods lips the patriarch raised both hands over his head looked up toward the image of phos along with everyone in the high temple save only his own two bodyguards phostis imitated him we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind oxeites intoned by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor all the worshipers repeated phos creed it was the first prayer a videssian heard being commonly uttered over a newhorn babe it was the first prayer a child learned it was the last utterance a believer gasped out before dying to phostis it was as utterly familiar as the shape of his own hands more prayers and hymns followed phostis continued to make his responses without much conscious thought the ritual was comforting it lifted him out of himself and his petty cares of the moment transformed him into part of something great and wise and for all practical purposes immortal he cherished that feeling of belonging perhaps because he found it here so much more easily than in the palaces oxeites had the congregation repeat the creed with him one lust time then motioned for the worshipers to be seated phostis almost left the high temple before the patriarch began his sermon sermons being by their nature individual and specific took him out of the sense of belonging he sought from worship but since he had nowhere to go except back to the palaces he decided to stay and listen not even his father could rebuke him for piety the ecumenical patriarch said i would like to have all of vou gathered together with me today pause for a moment and contemplate the many and various ways in which the pursuit of wealth puts us in peril of the eternal ice for in acquiring great stores of gold and gems and goods we too easily come to consider their accumulation an end in itself rather than a means through which we may provide for our own bodily survival and prepare a path for our progeny our progeny phostis thought smiling the videssian clergy was celibate if oxeites was preparing a path for his progeny he had more sins than greed with which to concern himself the patriarch continued not only do we too readily value goldpieces for their own sake those of us who do gain riches whether honestly or no often also endanger ourselves and our hope of joyous afterlife by grudging those who lack a share however small of our own good fortune he went on in that vein for some time until phostis felt ashamed to have a belly that was never empty shoes on his feet and thick robes and hypocausts to warm him through the winter he raised his eyes to the phos in the dome and prayed to the lord with the great and good mind to forgive him his prosperity but as his gaze descended from the good god to the ecumenical patriarch he suddenly saw the high temple in a new disquieting light till this moment hed always taken for granted the flood of goldpieces that had been required to erect the temple in the first place and the further flood that had gone into the precious stones and metals that made it the marvel it was if those uncounted thousands of goldpieces had instead fed the hungry shod the barefoot clothed and warmed the shivering how much better their lot would have been he knew the temples aided the poor his own father told and retold the story of spending his first night in videssos the city in the common room of a monastery but for oxeites who wore clothofgold to urge his listeners to give up what they had to aid those who had not struck phostis as nothing less than hypocrisy and worse still oxeites himself seemed to have no sense of that hypocrisy anger drove shame from phostis how did the ecumenical patriarch have the crust to propose that others give up their worldly goods when he said not a word about those goods the temples owned did he think they somehow acquired immunity from being put to good usebeing put to the very use he himself advocatedbecause they were called holy by the tone of his sermon he very likely did phostis tried to understand his way of thinking tried and failed the junior avtokrator again glanced up toward the famous image of phos how did the lord with the great and good mind view calls to poverty from a man who undoubtedly possessed not just one but many sets of regalia the value of any of which could have supported a poor family for years phostis decided the good god would set down grim words for oxeites in his book of judgment the patriarch kept preaching that he did not realize the contradiction inherent in his own views irked phostis more with every word he heard he hadnt enjoyed the courses in logic krispos ordained for him but theyd left their mark he wondered if next he would hear a raddled whore extolling the virtues of virginity it would he thought be hardly less foolish than what he was listening to now we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor oxeites proclaimed for the last time even without his robes he would have been tall and slim and distinguished with a pure white beard and silky ryebrows he surely combed when he wore the patriarchal vestments he seemed to the eye the very image of holiness but his words rang hollow in phostis heart most of the worshipers filed out of the high temple after the liturgy was over a few though went up to the ecumenical patriarch to congratulate him on his sermon phostis shook his head bemused were they deaf and blind or merely out to curry favor either way phos would judge them in due course as he walked down the steps from the temple to the surrounding courtyard phostis turned to one of his guardsmen and said tell me nokkvi do you halogai house your gods no richly in your own country nokkvis iceblue eyes went wide he threw back his head and boomed laughter the long blond braid he wore bounced up and down as his shoulders shook when he could speak again he answered young majesty in halogaland we have not so much for ourselves that we can give our gods such spoils as you fashion for your phos in any case our gods care more for blood than for gold there we feed them well phostis knew of the northern gods thirst for gore the holy kveldulf a haloga who came to revere phos was reckoned a martyr in videssos his own countrymen had slaughtered him when he tried to convert them to worshiping the lord with the great and good mind indeed the halogai would have been far more dangerous foes to the empire did they not incessantly shed one anothers blood nokkvi stepped down on the flat flagstones of the courtyard when he turned to look back at the high temple his gaze went wolfish he said i tell you this too young majesty let hut a few shiploads full of my folk free to reive in videssos the city and your god too will know less of gold and more of blood maybe that savor will better satisfy him phostis gestured to turn aside the northerners words the empire was still rebuilding and repeopling towns that harvas halogai had sacked around the time he was born but even having such a store of riches here in the imperial capital was a temptation not just to the fierce barbarians from the north hut also to avaricious men within the empire any store of riches was such in fact he stopped his mouth falling open all at once he began to understand how the thanasioi came by their doctrines the great bronze valves of the doorway to the grand courtroom slowly swung open seated on the imperial throne krispos got a sudden small glimpse of the outside world he smiled the outside world seemed only most distantly connected to what went on here he sometimes wondered whether the grand courtroom wasnt even more splendid than the high temple its ornaments were less florid true but to them was added the everchanging spectacle of the rich robes worn by the nobles and bureaucrats who lined either side of the colonnade leading from the bronze doors to krispos throne the way between the two columns was a hundred yards of emptiness that let any petitioner think on his own insignificance and the awesome might of the avtokrator in front of the throne stood half a dozen haloga guardsmen in full battle gear krispos had read in the histories of previous reigns that one emperor had been assassinated on the throne and three others wounded he did not aim to provide similarly edifying reading for any distant successor a herald distinguished by a whitepainted staff had his place beside the northerners he took one step forward the courtiers left off their own chattering into the silence the herald said tribo the envoy from nobad son of gumush the khagan of khatrish begs leave to approach the avtokrator of the videssians his trained voice was easily audible from one end of the grand courtroom to the other let tribo of khatrish approach krispos said let tribo of khatrish approach sprung from the heralds thick chest the words might have been a command straight from the mouth of phos from a small silhouette in the bright but distant doorway tribo grew to mansize as he sauntered up the aisle toward the throne he slowed every so often to exchange a smile or a couple of words with someone he knew thereby largely defeating the intimidation built into that walk krispos had expected nothing less khatrishers seemed born to subvert any existing order even their nation was less than three centuries old born when khamorth nomads from the plains of pardraya overran what had been videssian provinces to some degree they aped the empire these days but their ways remained looser than those that were in good form among videssians tribo paused the prescribed distance from the imperial throne sinking down to his knees and then to his belly in full proskynesis some videssian rituals could not be scanted as the envoy remained with his forehead pressed against the polished marble of the floor krispos tapped the left arm of the throne with a squeal of gears it rose several feet in the air the marvel was calculated to overawe barbarians from his new height krispos said you may rise tribo of khatrish thank you your majesty like most of his folk the ambassador spoke videssian with a slight lisping accent in videssian robes he could have passed for an imperial but for his beard which was longer and more unkempt than even a priest would wear the khagans of khatrish encouraged that style among their upper classes to remind them of the nomad raiders from whom they had sprung tribo was also unvidessian in his lack of concern for the imperial dignity cocking his head to one side he remarked i think your chair needs oiling your majesty you may be right krispos admitted with a sigh he tapped the arm of the throne again with more metallic squeaks servitors behind the courtroom wall returned him to his former place tribo did not quite smirk but the expression he assumed shouted that he would have in any other company he definitely was less than overawed krispos wondered if that meant he couldnt be reckoned a barbarian perhaps so khatrishs usages were not those of videssos but they had their own kind of understated sophistication all that was by the waythough krispos did make a mental note that he need not put the crew of musclemen behind the wall next time he granted tribo a formal audience the avtokrator said shall we to business then by all means your majesty tribo was not rude certainly not by his own peoples standards and not really by the empires either he just had a hard time taking seriously the elaborate ceremonial in which videssos delighted the moment matters turned substantive his halflazy halfinsolent manner dropped away like a discarded cloak as avtokrator krispos had the privilege of speaking first i am not pleased that your master the khagan nobad son of gumush has permitted herders from khatrish to come with their flocks into territory rightfully videssian and to drive our farmers away from the lands near the border i have written to him twice about this matter with no improvement now i bring it to your attention i shall convey your concern to his mighty highness tribo promised he in turn complains that the recently announced videssian tariff on amber is outrageously high and is being collected with overharsh rigor the second point may perhaps concern him more than the first krispos said amber from khatrish was a monopoly of the khagans his profits on its sale to videssos helped fatten his treasury the tariff let the empire profit too krispos had also beefed up customs patrols to discourage smuggling in his younger days hed been to opsikion near the border with khatrish and seen amber smugglers in action the firsthand knowledge helped combat them tribo assumed an expression of outraged innocence the khagan nobad son of gumush wonders at the justice of a sovereign who seeks lower tolls from the king of kings on his western border at the same time as he imposes higher ones to the detriment of khatrish a low mutter ran through the courtiers few videssians would have spoken so freely to the avtokrator krispos doubted whether nobad knew about his discussions with rubyab of makuran over caravan tolls tribo however all too obviously did and served his khagan well thereby i might reply that any soverigns chief duty is to promote the advantage of his own realm krispos said slowly so you might were you not phos vicegerent on earth tribo replied the mutter from the nobles got louder krispos said i do not find it just eminent envoy for you who are a heretic to use to your own ends my position in the faith as practice within videssos i crave your majestys pardon tribo said at once krispos stared suspiciously he hadnt thought things would be that easy they werent tribo resumed since you reminded me i am a heretic in your eyes i will employ my own usages and ask you where in the balance justice lies videssian orthodoxy held that phos would at the end of time surely vanquish skotos theologians in the eastern lands of khatrish and thatagush however had needed to account for the eruption of the barbarous and ferocious khamorth into their lands and the devastation resulting therefrom they proclaimed that good and evil lay in perfect balance and no man could be certain which would triumph in the end anathemas from videssos the city failed to bring them back to what the empire reckoned the true faith abetted by the eastern khagans they hurled anathemas of their own krispos had no use for the balancer heresy but he had trouble denying that it was just for khatrish to expect consistency from him concealing a sigh he said room for discussion about how we impose the tariffs may possibly exist your majesty is gracious tribo sounded sincere maybe he even was as may be krispos said i also have complaints that ships from out of khatrish have stopped and robbed several fishing boats off the coast of our dominions and even taken a cargo of furs and wine off a merchantman if such piracy goes on khatrish will face the empires displeasure is that clear yes your majesty tribo said again sincerely videssos navy was vastly stronger than khatrishs if the avtokrator so desired he could ruin the khaganates sea commerce without much effort good krispos said mind you ill expect to see a change in what your people do fancy promises wont be enough anyone who didnt spell that out in large letters to a khatrisher deserved the disappointment he would get but tribo nodded krispos had reason to hope the message was fully understood he asked have you any more matters to raise at this time eminent envoy yes your majesty may it please you i do the reply caught krispos by surprise the agenda hed agreed upon with the khatrisher before the audience was complete but he said as he had to speak then thank you for your patience your majesty but for the theological er discussion we just had i would not presume to mention this however i know you believe that we who follow the balance are heretics still i must question the justice of inflicting upon us your own different and if i may say so more pernicious heresies eminent sir i hope you in turn will forgive me but i havent the faintest idea of what youre talking about krispos answered tribos look said hed thought the emperor above stooping to such tawdry denials that only perplexed krispos the more as far as he knew he was telling the truth then the ambassador said as scornfully as he could to a sovereign stronger than his own do you truly try to tell me you have never heard of the murderous wretches who call themselves thanasioi ah i see by your face that you have yes i have at my command the most holy sir the ecumenical patriarch oxeites is even now convening a synod to condemn them but how do you know of their heresy so far as i have learned its confined to the westlands near our frontier with makuranerheld vaspurakan few places in the empire of videssos lie farther from khatrish that may be so your majesty but merchants learn the goods most worth shipping a long way are those with the least bulk tribo said ideas so far as i know have no bulk at all perhaps some seamen picked up the taint in pityos be that as it may we have bands of thanasioi in a couple of our coastal towns krispos ground his teeth if khatrish held thanasioi their doctrines had undoubtedly spread to videssian ports as well and that meant videssos the city probablyno certainlyhad thanasioi prowling its streets by the good god eminent envoy i swear weve not tried to spread this heresy to your land very much the opposite in fact your majesty has said it tribo said by which krispos knew that were he addressing anyone save the avtokrator of the videssians he would have called him a liar perhaps realizing that even by khatrisher standards hed been overblunt the envoy went on i pray your forgiveness your majesty but you must understand that from the perspective of my master nobad son of gumush stirring up religious strife within our bounds is a ploy videssos might well attempt yes i can see that it might be knspos admitted you may tell your master though that its a ploy i dont care to use since videssos should have only one faith im not surprised to find other sovereigns holding the same view please note i intend it for a compliment when i say that for an avtokrator of the videssians you are a moderate man tribo said most men who wear the red buskins would say there should be only one faith through all the world and that the one which emanates from videssos the city krispos hesitated before he answered tribos compliment had teeth in it because videssos had once ruled all the civilized world east of makuran universality was a cornerstone of its dealings with other states and of its theology to deny that universality would give krispos nobles an excuse to mutter among themselves he wanted them to have no such excuses at last he said of course there should be only one faith how else may a realm count on its folk remaining loyal to it hut since we have not met that ideal in videssos we would be in a poor position to pursue it elsewhere besides eminent envoy if you accuse us of introducing a new heresy into khatrish you can hardly at the same time accuse us of trying to force your people into orthodoxy tribos mouth twisted into a smile that lifted only one corner of it the first argument has some weight your majesty as for the second one id like it better in a school of logic than i do in the world you could well hope to throw us into such religious strife that your folk might enter khatrish and be acclaimed as rescuers your master nobad son of gumush is well served in you eminent envoy krispos said you see more facets in a matter than a jeweler could carve thank you your majesty tribo actually beamed coming from a man with twentytwo years on the throne of videssos theres praise indeed i shall convey to his mighty highness that videssos is itself plagued by these thanasioi and not responsible for visiting them upon my country i hope you do for that is the truth your majesty tribo prostrated himself once more then rose and backed away from the throne until he had gone far enough to turn around without offending the avtokrator of the videssians as far as krispos was concerned the ambassador could simply have turned his back and walked away but the imperial dignity did not permit such ordinary behavior in his presence he sometimes thought of his office as having a personality of its own and a stuffy one at that before he left the grand courtroom he reminded himself to have the gear train behind his throne oiled good morning your majesty with a mocking smile on his face evripos made as if to perform a proskynesis right in the middle of the corridor by the good god little brother let it be phostis said wearily youre just as muchand just as littleavtokrator as i am thats true for now but ill forever be just as little avtokrator as you are where after a while i wont be just as much do you expect me to be happy about that just because you were born first im sorry your majesty the scorn evripos put into the title was withering but you ask too much phostis wished he could punch his brother in the face as he had when they were boys but evripos was his little brother now only in age he had most of a palm on phostis in height and was thicker through the shoulders to boot these days hed be the one to do most of the punching in a fight i cant help being eldest any more than you can help being born second phostis said only one of us will be able to rule when the time comes thats just the way things are but who better than my brothers to be your lapdogs evripos broke in looking down his long nose at phostis like phostis he had his mothers distinctive eyes but the rest of his features were those of krispos phostis also suspected evripos had more of their fathers driving ambition than he himself had or perhaps it was simply that evripos was in a position where ambition stood out more if events continued in their expected course phostis would be the avtokrator of the videssians evripos wanted the job but was unlikely to get it by any legitimate means phostis said little brother you and katakolon can be my mainstays on the throne better to have family aid a man than outsiderssafer too if i can trust you he added to himself so you say now evripos retorted but ive had to read the historians just as you have once one son becomes emperor whats left for the others nothing maybe less they only show up in the books because theyve raised a rebellion or else because they get a name for debauchery who gets a name for debauchery katakolon asked as he came down the corridor of the imperial residence he grinned at his two grimfaced brothers me i hope youre well on your way to it thats certain phostis told him the remark should have been cutting instead it came out with an unmistakable ring of envy katakolons grin got wider phostis felt like punching him too but he was evripos size or bigger like evripos he favored krispos in looks of the three of them though he had the sunny disposition being the heir set heavy responsibilities on phostis evripos saw only phostis standing between him and what he wanted both older brothers had better claims to the throne than katakolon who didnt seem interested in sitting on it anyhow all he wanted was to enjoy himself which he did evripos said his imperial majesty here is deigning to parcel out to us our subordinate duties once he becomes senior avtokrator well why not katakolon said thats how its going to be unless father ties him in a weighted sack and flings him into the cattlecrossing father might too the way they go at each other had evripos said that phostis probably would have hit him from katakolon it was just so many words not only was the youngest brother slow to take offense he had trouble giving it too katakolon went on i know one of the subordinate duties id like come the day supervising the treasury subbureau that collects taxes from within the city walls by the good god why evripos said beating phostis to the punch isnt that rather too much like work for your taste that subbureau of the treasury collects tax receipts from and generally has charge of the citys brothels katakolon iicked his lips im certain any avtokrator would appreciate the careful inspection id give them for once phostis and evripos looked equally disgusted it wasnt that evripos failed to delight in venery he was at least as bold a man of his lance as katakolon but evripos did what he did without chortling about it to all and sundry afterward phostis suspected he was disgusted with katakolon more for revealing a potential vulnerability than for his choice of supervisory position phostis said if we dont stick together brothers there are plenty in the city who would turn us against one another for their own benefit rather than ours im too busy with my own tool to become anyone elses katakolon declared at which phostis threw up his hands and stalked away he thought about going to the high temple to ask phos to grant his brothers some common sense but decided not to after oxeites hypocritical sermon the high temple an edifice in which he had taken pride like almost every other citizen of videssos the city and indeed of the videssian empire now seemed only a repository for mountains of gold that could have been better spent in countless other ways he could hate the ecumenical patriarch for that alone for destroying the beauty and grandeur of the temple in his mind as he stamped out of the imperial residence a pair of halogai from the squadron at the entrance attached themselves to him he didnt want them but knew the futility of ordering them back to their postthey would just answer in their slow serious northern voices that he was their post instead he tried to shake them off they were after all encumbered with mail shirts helms and twohanded axes for a little while he thought he might succeed sweat poured down their faces as they sped up to match his own quick walk and their fair skins grew pink with exertion but they were warriors in fine fettle and refused to wilt in heat worse than any for which their northern home had prepared them they clung to him like limpets he slowed down as he reached the borders of the palace compound and started across the crowded plaza of palamas he thought of losing himself among the swarms of people there but before he could transform thought to deed the halogai moved up on either side of him and made a break impossible he was even glad of their presence as he traversed the square their broad mailed shoulders and forbidding expressions helped clear a path through the hucksters soldiers housewives scribes whores artists priests and folk of every other sort who used the plaza as a place wherein to sell to buy to gossip to cheat to proclaim or simply to gawp once phostis got to the far side of the plaza of palamas he headed east along middle street without even thinking about it he walked past the red granite pile of the government office building before he consciously realized what hed done a few more blocks a left turn and his feet would have taken him to the high temple even though the rest of him didnt want to go there he glared down at his red boots as if wondering if his brothers had somehow suborned them with slow deliberation he turned right rather than left at the next corner he made a lew more turns at random leaving behind the familiar main street of videssos the city for whatever its interior might bring him the halogai muttered back and forth in their own language phostis could guess what they were saying something to the effect that two guards might not be enough to keep him out of trouble in this part of town he pushed ahead anyhow reasoning that although bad things could happen odds were they wouldnt away from middle street and a few other thoroughfares videssos the citys streetslanes might have been a better word or even alleysforgot whatever they might have known about the idea of a straight line the narrow little ways were made to seem narrower still because the upper stories of buildings extended out over the cobblestones toward each other the city had laws regulating how close together they could come but if any inspector had been through this section lately hed been bribed to look up with a blind eye toward the scrawny strip of blue that showed between balconies people on the streets gave phostis curious looks as he walked along it was not a district in which nobles in fine robes commonly appeared no one bothered him though evidently two big haloga guards were enough a barmaidpretty girl of about his own age stopped and smiled at him she drew up one hand to toy with her hair and incidentally show off her breasts to the best advantage when he didnt pause she gave him the twofingered street gesture that implied he was effeminate the shops in this part of town kept their doors closed when a customer opened one phostis saw its timbers were thick enough to grace a citadel but for their doors probably just as thick houses presented blank fronts of stucco or brick to the street though that was normal in videssos the city most dwellings being built around courtyards here it seemed as if they were making a point of concealing whatever they had phostis was on the point of trying to make his way back to middle street and his own part of town when he came upon men in ragged cloaks and workers tunics and women in cheap faded dresses filing into a building that at first looked no more prepossessing than any other hereabouts but on its roof was a wooden tower topped with a globe whose gilding had seen better days this too was a temple to phos though as different from the high temple as could be imagined he smiled and made for the entrance hed wanted to pray when he left the palaces but hadnt been able to stomach listening to oxeites celebrate the liturgy again maybe the good god had guided his footsteps hither the ordinary people going in to pray didnt seem to think phos had anything to do with it the stares they gave phostis werent curious they were downright hostile a man wearing the bloodstained leather apron of a butcher said here friend dont you think youd be more content praying somewheres else somewhere fancy like you are a woman added she didnt sound admiring to her the word was one of reproach some of the shabby band of worshipers carried knives on their belts in a rundown part of the city like this snatching up paving stones to hurl would be the work of a moment the halogai realized that before phostis did and moved to put themselves between him and what could become a mob wait he said neither northerner even turned to look at him keeping their eyes on the crowd in front of the little temple they wordlessly shook their heads he was barely tall enough to peer at the people over their armored shoulders pitching his voice to carry to the videssians he declared ive had my fill of worshiping phos at fancy temples how can we hope the good god will hear us if we talk about helping the poor in a building richer than even the avtokrator enjoys no one had noticed his red boots behind the halogai they would be all but invisible like the people in the streets the congregants must have taken him for merely a noble out slumming his words made the city folk pause and murmur among themselves after a small pause the butcher said you really mean that friend i do phostis answered loudly by the lord with the great and good mind i swear it either his words or his tone must have carried conviction lor the band of worshipers stopped scowling and began to beam the butcher who seemed to be their spokesman said friend if you do mean that you can hear what our priest the good god bless him has to say we dont even ask that you keep quiet about it afterward for its sound doctrine am i right my friends everyone around him nodded phostis wondered whether this congregation employed friend as a general term or if it was just the mans way of speaking he rather hoped the former was true the usage might be unusual among phos followers but he liked its spirit still grumbling the halogai grudgingly let him go into the temple though one preceded him and the other followed close behind a few icons with images of phos hung on the roughly plastered walls otherwise the place was bare of ornament the altar behind which the priest stood was of carven pine his blue robe of the plainest wool lacked even a clothofgold circle above his heart to symbolize phos sun the good gods creed and liturgy though remained the same regardless of setting phostis followed this priest as easily as he had the ecumenical patriarch the only difference was that this ecclesiastic spoke with an upcountry accent even stronger than that of krispos who had worked hard to shed his peasant intonation the priest came from the west phostis judged not from the north like his father when the required prayers were over the priest surveyed his congregants i rejoice that the lord with the great and good mind has brought you back to me once more friends he said his eyes fixed on phostis and the haloga guards as he uttered that last word as if he wondered whether they deserved to come under it giving them the benefit of the doubt he continued friends we have not been cursed with much in the way of material abundance again he gave phostis a measuring stare i praise the lord with the great and good mind for that for we have not much to give away before we come to be judged in front of his holy throne phostis blinked this was not the sort of theological reasoning he was used to hearing this priest took off from the point at which oxeites had halted but he unlike the patriarch lacked hypocrisy he was plainly as poor as his temple and his congregation that in and of itself inclined phostis to take him seriously he went on how can we hope to rise to the heavens while weighted down with gold in our belt pouches i will not say it cannot be friends but i say that few of the rich live lives sufficiently saintly to rise above the dross they value more than their souls thats right holy sir a woman exclaimed someone else a man this time added tell the truth the priest picked that up and set it into his sermon as neatly as a mason taking a brick from a new pile tell the truth i shall friends the truth is that everything the foolish rich run after is but a snare from skotos a lure to drag them down to his eternal ice if phos is the patron of our souls as we know him to be then how can material things be his concern the answer is simple friends they cannot the material world is skotos plaything rejoice if you have but little share therein would it were true for all of us the greatest service we can render to one who knows not this truth is to deprive him of that which ties him to skotos thereby liberating his soul to contemplate the higher good yes a woman cried her voice high and breathy as if in ecstasy oh yes the butcher who had spoken to phostis still sounded solid and matteroffact i pray that you guide us in our renunciation of the material holy sir let your own knowledge of moving toward phos holy light be your guide friend the priest answered what you renounce is yours only in this world at best will you risk an eternity in skotos ice for its sake only a fool would act so were no fools the butcher said we know he broke off to give phostis yet another measuring stare by this time phostis was sick of them whatever he had been about to my he reconsidered starting again after a barely noticeable pause we know what we know by the good god the rest of the people in the shabby temple knew whatever it was the butcher knew they called out in agreement some loudly some softly all with more belief and piety in their voices than phostis had ever heard from the prominent folk who most often prayed in the high temple his brief anger at being excluded from whatever they knew soon faded he wished he could find something to believe in with as much force as these people gave to their faith the priest raised his hands to the heavens then spat between ills feet in ritual rejection of skotos he led the worshipers in phos creed one last time then announced the end of the liturgy as phostis turned and left the temple once more bracketed fore and aft by his bodyguards he felt a sense of loss and regret on returning to the mundane world that hed never known when departing from the superficially more awesome setting of the high temple an impious comparison crossed his mind it was almost as if he were returning to himself after the piercing pleasure of the act of love he shook his head as the priest had said what were those thrashings and moanings what were any earthly delights if they imperiled his soul excuse me someone said from behind him the butcher phostis turned so did the halogai with him the axes twitched in their hands as if hungry for blood the butcher ignored them he spoke to phostis as if they were not there friend you seem to have thought well of what you heard in the temple thats just a hunch of mine mind youif im wrong you tell me and ill go my way no good sir youre not wrong phostis wished hed thought to say friend too well too late now he continued your priest there preaches well and has a fiery heart like few ive heard what good is wealth if it hides in a hoard or is wantonly wasted when so many stand in need what good is wealth the butcher said and let it go at that if his eye flicked over the fine robe phostis wore they did so too fast for the younger man to notice the butcher went on maybe you would like to hear more of what the holy sirhis names digenis by the wayhas to say and hear it in a more private setting phostis thought about that maybe i would he said at last for he did want to hear the priest again had the butcher smiled or shown triumph his courtsharpened suspicions would have kindled but the fellow only gave a sober nod that convinced phostis of his sincerity if nothing more he decided he would indeed try to have that more private audience with digenis hed found this morning that shaking off his bodyguards was anything but easy still there might be ways katakolon stood in the doorway to the study waiting until krispos chanced to look up from the tax register he was examining eventually krispos did he put down his pen what is it son come in if you have something on your mind by the nervous way in which katakolon approached his desk krispos could make a pretty good guess as to what it might be his youngest son confirmed that guess when he said may it please you father i should like to request another advance on my allowance his smile usually so sunny had the hangdog air it assumed whenever he had to beg money from his father krispos rolled his eyes another advance what did you spend it on this time an amberandemerald bracelet for nitria katakolon said sheepishly whos nitria krispos asked i thought you were sleeping with varina these days oh i still am father katakolon assured him the other ones new thats why i got her something special i see krispos said he did too in a strange sort of way katakolon was a lad who generally liked to be liked with a youths enthusiasm and stamina he also led a love life more complicated than any bureaucratic document krispos knew a small measure of relief that hed managed to remember the name of his sons currentor by the sound of things soon to be current but onefavorite he sighed how much of an allowance do you get every month twenty goldpieces father thats right twenty goldpieces do you have any idea how old i was son before i had twenty goldpieces to my name let alone twenty every month of the year when i was your age lived on a farm that grew only nettles and you ate worms three meals a day katakolon finished for him krispos glared his son said you make that same speech every time ask you for money father maybe i do krispos said thinking about it he was suddenly certain he did that annoyed him was he getting predictable as he got older being predictable could also be dangerous but he added youd be better off if you hadnt heard it so many times youve committed it to memory yes father katakolon said dutifully may i please have the advance sometimes krispos gave in sometimes he didnt the cadaster hed put down so he could talk with his son brought good news the fisc had gained more revenue than expected from the province just south of the paristrian mountains the province where hed been born gruffly he said very well i suppose you havent managed to bankrupt us yet boy but not another copper ahead of time till after midwinters day do you understand me yes father thank you father little by little katakolons merry expression turned apprehensive midwinters day is still a long way off father like anyone who knew krispos well the avtokrators third son also knew he was not in the habit of making warnings just to hear himself talk when he said something he meant it try living within your means krispos suggested i didnt say i was cutting you off without a copper only that i wouldnt give you any more money ahead of time till then the good god willing i wont have to do it afterward either but you notice i didnt demand that yes father katakolons voice tolled like a mourning bell krispos fought to keep his face straight he remembered how much hed hated to be laughed at when he was a youth cheer up son by anyones standards twenty goldpieces a month is a lot of money for a young man to get his hands on youll be able to entertain your lady friends in fine style during that little while when youre not in bed with them katakolon looked so flabbergasted krispos had to smile i recall how many rounds i could manage back in my own younger days boy i cant match that now but believe me ive not forgot ten whatever you say father i do thank you for the advance though id be even more grateful if youd not tied that string round its leg katakolon dipped his head and went off to pur sue his own affairsvery likely krispos thought in the most literal sense of the word as soon as his son was out of earshot krispos did laugh young men could not imagine what being older was like they lacked the experience perhaps because of that they didnt believe older men retained the slightest notion of what being young meant but krispos knew that wasnt so his younger self dwelt within him yet covered over with years but still emphatically there he wasnt always proud of the young man he had been hed done a lot of foolish things as young men will it wasnt because hed been stupid hed just been callow if hed know then what he knew now he laughed again this time at himself graybeards had been singing that song since the world began he went back to his desk and finished working through th tax register he wrote i have read and approvedkrispos in scarlet ink at the bottom of the parchment then without so much as looking at the report that lay beneath it he got up from the desk stretched and walked out into the hallway when he got near the entrance to the imperial residence h almost bumped into barsymes who was coming out of th small audience chamber there the vestiarios eyes widen slightly id expected you would still be hard at the mornings assemblage of documents your majesty to the ice with the mornings assemblage of documents barsymes krispos declared im going fishing very well your majesty i shall set the preparations in train directly thank you esteemed sir krispos said even something a simple as a trip to the nearest pier was not free from ceremony for an avtokrator of the videssians the requisite twelve para sol bearers had to be rounded up the haloga captain had to he alerted so he could provide the even more requisite squadron of bodyguards krispos endured the wait with the patience that years of waiting had taught him he chose several flexible cane rods each a little taller than he was from a rack in a storage room and a rather greater number of similar lengths of horsehair line in the tackle box beside the rack of fishing poles were a good many barbed hooks of bronze he preferred that metal to iron though softer it needed less care after being dunked in salt water off in the kitchens a servant would be catching him cockroaches for bait hed done it himself once but only once it scandalized people worse than any of anthimos ingenious perversions had ever managed to do all is in readiness your majesty barsymes announced after a delay shorter than krispos had expected he held out to the emperor an elaborately chased brass box from makuran krispos accepted it with a grave nod only tiny skittering noises revealed that inside the elegant artifact were frantic brownblack bugs about the size of the last joint of his thumb the palace compound boasted several piers at widely spaced points along the sea wall krispos sometimes wondered if theyd been built to give an overthrown avtokrator the best chance for escape by sea as he and his retinue paraded toward the one closest to the imperial residence though he stopped worrying about blows against the state or against his person when he stepped down into the little rowboat tied there he was as nearly free as an emperor could be oh true a couple of halogai got into another rowboat and followed him as he rowed out into the lightly choppy waters of the cattlecrossing their strokes were strong and sure scores of narrow inlets pierced the rocky soil of halogaland so its sons naturally took to the ocean and true a light war galley would also put to sea in case conspirators mounted an attack on the avtokrator too deadly for a pair of northern men to withstand but the galley stayed a good quarter mile from krispos rowboat and even the houndlike halogai let him separate himself from them by close to a furlong he could imagine he sat alone on the waves in his younger days he had never thought of fishing as a sport he might favor it was something he occasionally did to help feed himself when he had the time now though it gave him the chance to escape not only from his duties but also from his servitors something he simply could not do on land being the man he was hed also become a skillful fisherman over the years whatever he did for whatever reasons he tried to do well he tied a cork float to his line to keep his hook at the depth he wanted it to that hook he wired several little pieces of lead from the tackle box to help it have the semblance of natural motion in the water then he opened the bait box barsymes had given him seized a roach between thumb and forefinger and impaled it on the hooks barbed tip while he was catching the roach a couple of others leapt out of box and scuttled around the bottom of the rowboat for the moment he ignored them if he needed them later hed get them they werent going anywhere far he tossed the line over the side the float bobbed in the greenblue water krispos sat holding the rod and let his thoughts drift freely sea mist softened the outline of the far shore of the cattlecrossing but he could still make out the taller buildings of the suburb known simply as across he turned his head behind him videssos the city bulked enormous past the grand courtroom and the hall of the nineteen couches stood the great mass of the high temple it dominated the capitals skyline from every angle also leaping above the rooftops of other buildings was the red granite shaft of the milestone at the edge of the plaza of palamas from which all distances in the empire were reckoned sunlight sparked from the gilded domes that topped the dozensperhaps hundredsof temples to phos in the city krispos thought back to his own first glimpse of the imperial capital and the globes flashing like suns themselves under the good gods sun the cattlecrossing was full of ships lean war galleys like the one that watched him trading ships full of grain or building stone or cargoes more diverse and expensive little fishing boats whose crews scoured the sea not for sport but for survival watching them pull their nets up over the side krispos wondered whether they might not work harder even than farmers a question that had never crossed his mind about any other trade his float suddenly jerked under the water he yanked up the rod and pulled in the line a shimmering blue flying fish twisted at the end of it he smiled grabbed it and tossed it into the bottom of the boat it wasnt very big but it would be tasty maybe his cook could make it stretch in a stewor maybe hed catch another one he foraged in the bait box grabbed another cockroach and skewered it on the hook to replace the one that had been the luckless flying fishs last meal the roachs little legs still flaide as it sank beneath the sea after that krispos spent a good stretch of time staring at the float and waiting for something to happen fishing was like that sometimes he had sometimes thought about asking zaidas if sorcery could help the business along but always decided not to catching fish was only part of the reason he came out here in the little boat the other part the bigger part was to get away from everyone around him making himself a more efficient fisherman might net him more fish but it would cost him some of the precious time he had to himself besides if fishing magic were possible the hornyhanded sunbrowned sailors who made their living from their catch would surely employ it no maybe not it might be feasible hut too expensive to make it worthwhile for anyone not already rich to afford it zaidas would know maybe he would ask him and maybe he wouldnt now that he thought about it he probably wouldnt his float disappeared again when he tried to pull up the rod this time it bent like a bow he pulled once more and once more the fish fought back he walked his hands up to the tip of the rod then pulled in the line hand over hand by the good god heres a treat indeed he exclaimed when he saw the fat red mullet writhing on his hook he snatched up a net and slid it up over the fish from below the mullet was as large as his forearm and meaty enough to feed several had he fished for a living he could have sold it in the plaza of palamas for a fine price videssos the citys gourmets reckoned it their favorite even to the point of nicknaming it the emperor of fishes though called red the mullet had been brownish with yellow stripes when he took it from the sea it turned a crimson almost the color of his boots however as it struggled for its life then slowly began to fade toward gray mullets were famous for their spectacular color changes krispos remembered one of anthimos revels where his predecessor had ordered several of them slowly boiled alive in a large glass vessel so the feasters could appreciate their shifting hues as they cooked hed watched with as much interest as anyone else only looking back on it did it seem cruel perhaps a sauce with garlicflavored egg whites would do this one justice he thought even the head of a mullet pickled in brine was esteemed a delicacy hed have to talk with the cook when he went back to the imperial residence he gently set the prized catch in the bottom of the rowboat treating it with far more care than he had the flying fish if hed used fishing as anything but an excuse to get away from the palaces he would have rowed back to the pier with as much celerity as his arms could give him instead he caught another cockroach rebaited the hook and dropped the line into the water again he quickly made another catch but it was only an ugly tasteless croaker he pulled the barbed hook out of its mouth and tossed it back into the water then opened the bait box for another bug after that he sat and sat for a long time waiting for something to happen and accepting with almost trancelike calm the nothing that fate was giving him the boat shifted gently in the waves his stomach had been a bit uncertain the first few times he went to sea with greater familiarity the motion had come to soothe him it was as if he sat in a chair that not only rocked but also swiveled of course he did not take the rowboat out on stormy days either your majesty the call across the water snapped krispos out of his reverie he looked back toward the dock from which hed rowed out expecting to see someone standing there with a megaphone instead a rowboat was approaching his own as fast as the man in it could ply the blades he wondered how long the fellow had been hailing him before he noticed the halogai who had been fishing too grabbed for their oars and moved to block the newcomers path he paused in his exertion long enough to snatch up a sealed roll of parchment and wave it in their direction after that krispos bodyguards let him come on but rowed beside him to make sure he could try nothing untoward if his precious message proved a ruse proskynesis in a rowboat was impractical the fellow with the parchment contented himself with dipping his head to krispos panting he said may it please your majesty i bring a dispatch just arrived from the environs of pityos he handed krispos the parchment across the palms breadth of water that separated their boats as often happened krispos had the bad feeling his majesty was not going to be pleased scrawled on the outside of the parchment in a hasty hand was for krispos avtokratorvital that he read the instant received no wonder the messenger had leapt into a rowboat then krispos flicked off the wax seal with his thumbnail then used a scaling knife from the tackle box to slice through the ribbon that held the parchment closed when he unrolled it he found the message inside written in the same hand as the warning of urgency on the outer surface it was also to the point troop leader gainas to krispos avtokrator greetings we were attacked by thanasioi two days march southeast of pityos i grieve to report to your majesty that most of the forces sent there not only yielded themselves up to the heretics and rebels but indeed took their cause against the rest the leader of this action was the merarch livanios the chief aide to our commander briso because of this those loyal to you were utterly defeated the priests we were escorting to pityos were captured and most piteously massacred may the good god redeem their souls forgive one of my lowly rank for writing to you directly your majesty but i fear i am the senior loyal officer left alive the thanasioi must now be reckoned to control the whole of this province skotos surely awaits them in the world to come krispos read through the message twice to make sure hed missed nothing he started to toss it down with the fish hed caught but decided it was too likely to be ruined by seawater he stowed it in the tackle box instead then he seized the rowboats oars and headed back for the pier the messenger and the halogai followed in his wake as soon as he reached the dock he tossed the tackle box up onto the tarred timbers then scrambled up after it he grabbed the box and headed for the imperial residence at a trot that left the parasol bearers hurrying after him and complaining loudly as they did their futile best to catch up even the halogai who hadnt gone to sea needed a hundred yards and more before they could assume their protective places around him hed taken the thanasioi too lightly before that wouldnt happen now he wrote and dictated orders far into the night the only pauses he made were to gulp smoked pork and hard cheesecampaigning foodand pour down a couple of goblets of wine to keep his voice from going raw not until hed got into bed his thoughts whirling wildly as he tried without much luck to sleep did he remember that hed left the mullet of which hed been so proud lying in the bottom of the boat ill civil war religious war krispos didnt know which of the two was worse now he had them both wrapped around each other worse yet fall was not far away if he didnt move quickly rain would turn the westlands dirt roads to gluey mud that made travel difficult and campaigning impossible that would give the heretics the winter to consolidate their hold on pityos and the surrounding territory but if he did move quickly with a scratch force he risked another defeat defeat was more dangerous in civil war than against a foreign foe it tempted troops to switch sides figuring out which course to take required calculations more exacting than hed needed in years i wish iakovitzes were here he told barsymes and zaidas as he weighed his choices come to that i wish mammianos were still alive when it came to civil war he always had a feel for what to do when he was not young even in the first days of your majestys reign zaidas said and he was always fat as a tun such men are prime candidates for fits of apoplexy so the healerpriests advised me when he died up in pliskavos krispos said i understand that i miss him all the same most of these young soldiers i deal with lack sense it seems to me this is a common complaint of the older against the young zaidas said moreover most of the younger officers in your army have spent more time at peace than was usual in the tenure of previous avtokrators barsymes said perhaps your majesty might do more to involve the young majesties in the preparations against the thanasioi i wish i knew how to do that krispos said if they were more like me at the same age thered be no problem but his own first taste of combat had come at seventeen against kubrati raiders hed done well enough in the fighting then puked up his guts afterward but he said again shaking his head as if it were a complete sentence he made himself amplify it phostis has chosen now to get drunk on the lord with the great and good mind and on the words of this priest hes been seeing will you reprove piety barsymes asked his own voice reproving not at all esteemed sir along with our common videssi language our common orthodox faith glues the empire together that among other things is what makes the thanasioi so deadly dangerous they seek to soak away the glue that keeps all videssos citizens loyal to her but neither would i have my heir make himself into a monk not when emperors find themselves forced to do unmonkish things forbid him to see this priest then zaidas suggested how can i krispos said phostis is a man in years and a man in spirit even if not exactly the man i might have wished him to be he would defy me and he would be in the right one of the things you learn if you want to stay avtokrator is not to fight wars you have no hope of winning you have three sons your majesty barsymes said the vestiarios was subtle even by videssian standards but could be as stubborn in his deviousness as any blunt straightforward ironheaded barbarian aye i have three sons krispos raised an eyebrow katakolon would no doubt be willing enough to go on campaign for the sake of the camp followers but how much use hed be in the field is another question evripos now evripos is a puzzle even to me he doesnt want to be like his brother but envies him his place as eldest zaidas spoke in musing tones if you ordered him to accompany the army you send forth and gave him say spatharios rank and a place at your side that might make phostiswhats the word i wantthoughtful perhaps worried you mean krispos found himself smiling spatharios was about the most general title in the imperial hihierarchy though it literally meant sword bearer aide more accurately reflected its import an emperors spatharios even when not also the emperors son was a very prominent personage indeed krispos smile got wider zaidas perhaps ill dispatch you instead of iakovitzes on our next embassy to the king of kings you have the plotters instinct id not mind going your majesty if you think i could serve you properly the wizard answered mashiz is the home of many clever mages of a school different from our own id learn a great deal on such a journey im certain he sounded ready to leave on the instant one of these years then i may send you krispos said you neednt go pack though as things stand i need you too much by my side it shall be as your majesty wishes of course zaidas murmured shall it krispos said on the whole ill not deny it has been as i wish more often than not but i have the feeling that if i ever start to take success for granted it will run away from me and ill never see it again that feeling may be the reason youve held the throne so long your majesty barsymes said an avtokrator who takes anything for granted soon finds the high seat slipping out from under his fundament i watched it happen with anthimos krispos glanced at the eunuch in some surprise barsymes seldom reminded him of having served his predecessor he cast about for what barsymes in his usual oblique way might be trying to tell him at last he said anthimos example taught me a lot about how best not to be an avtokrator then you have drawn the proper lesson from it barysmes said approvingly in that regard his career had a textbook perfection whose like would be difficult to find so it did krispos voice was dry had anthimos granted to ruling even a tithe of the attention he gave to wine wenching and revelry krispos might never have tried to supplant himand if he had he likely would have failed but that was past for the historians now too he said esteemed sir draft for me a letter of appointment for evripos naming him my spatharios for the upcoming campaign against the thanasioi not one for phostis as well your majesty the vestiarios asked oh yes go ahead and draft that one too but dont give it to him until he finds out his brother was named to the post stewing him in his own juices is the point of the exercise eh as you say barsymes answered both documents will be ready for your signature this afternoon excellent i rely on your discretion barsymes ive never known that reliance to be misplaced when he was new on the throne krispos would have added that it had better not be misplaced here either now he let barsymes add those last words for himself as he knew the vestiarios would little by little over the years hed picked up some deviousness himself phostis bowed low before digenis gulping a little he told the priest holy sir i regret i will not be able to hear your wisdom for some time to come i depart soon with my father and the armament he has readied against the thanasioi if it suited you lad you could remain in the city and learn despite his wishes digenis studied him the priests thin shoulders moved in a silent sigh but i see the world and its things still hold you in their grip do as you feel you must then all shall surely result as the lord with the great and good mind desires phostis accepted the priests calling him merely lad though by now digenis of course knew who he was hed thought about telling digenis to address him as your majesty or young majesty but one of the reasons he visited the priest again and again was to rid himself of the taint of sordid materialism and learn humility humility did not go hand in hand with ordering a priest about but even though he sought humility he embraced it only so far trying to justify himself he said earnestly holy sir if i let evripos serve as my fathers aide it might give my father cause to have him succeed rather than me and so digenis said would the empire crumble to pieces on account of that is your brother so wicked and depraved that he would cast it all into the fire to feed his own iniquity better even perhaps that he should so the generations which come after us would have fewer material possessions with which to concern themselves evripos isnt wicked phostis said its just that that you have become accustomed to the idea of one day setting your baser parts on the throne the priest interrupted not only accustomed to it lad but infatuated with it do i speak the truth or a lie the truth but only after a fashion phostis said digenis eyebrow was silent but nonetheless eloquent flustered phostis floundered for justification and remember holy sir if i succeed you will already have imbued me with your doctrines which i will be able to disseminate throughout the empire evripos though remains attached to the sordid matter that skotos set before our souls to entice them away from phos light this is also a truth however small digenis admitted with the air of a man making a large concession still lad you must bear in mind that any compromise with skotos that you form in your mind will result in compromising your soul well let it be each man must determine for himself the proper path to renunciation and that path is oftenalwaysstrait if you do accompany your father on this expedition of his what shall your duties be for a good part of it probably nothing at all phostis answered explaining well go by ship to nakoleia to reach the borders of the revolted province as quickly as we can then we march overland to harasos rogmor and aptos my father is arranging for supplies to be ingathered at each from aptos well strike toward pityos thats the leg of the journey where well most likely start real fighting in spite of his efforts to sound disapproving he heard the excitement in his own voice war to a young man who has never seen it face to face owns a certain glamour krispos never talked about fighting save to condemn it to phostis that was but another reason to look forward to it the priest just shook his head how your grand cavalcade of those who love too well their riches shall progress concerns me not at all i fear for your soul lad the only piece of you truly deserving of our care without a doubt you will abandon my teachings and return to your old corrupt ways just as a moth seeks a flame or a fly a cow turd ill do no such thing phostis said indignantly ive discovered a great deal from you holy sir and would not think of turning aside from your golden words ha digenis said do you see even your promises of piety betray the greed that remains yet in your heart golden words to the ice with gold yet still it holds you in its honeyed grip sticking you down so skotos may seize you im sorry phostis said humble now it was only a figure of speech i meant no harm by it ha digenis repeated there are tests to see whether you have truly embraced piety or are but dissembling perhaps even to yourself give me one of those tests then phostis said by the lord with the great and good mind holy sir ill show you what im made of you are less easy to test than many might be you know lad the priest said at phostis puzzled look he explained another young man i might send past a chamber wherein lay some rich store of gold or gems for those who came to man hood in hunger and want such would be plenty to let me look into their hearts but you gold and jewels have been your baubles since you were still pissing on your fathers floor you might easily remain ensnared in spiritual error and yet pass them by so i might phostis admitted almost in despair he cried out but i would prove myself to you holy sir if only i knew how digenis smiled he pointed to a curtained doorway in the rear wall of the dingy temple over which he presided go through there then and it may be you shall learn something of yourself by the good god i will but when phostis pulled aside the curtain only blank blackness awaited him he hesitat his guardsmen waited for him outside the temple the great concession they would make assassins might await him in the darkness he steadied himself digenis would not betray him so very conscious of the weight of the priests gaze on his back he plunged ahead the curtain fell back into place behind him as soon as he turned a corner the inside of the passage was so absolutely black that he whispered phos creed to hold away any supernatural evils that might dwell there he took a step then another the passage sloped steeply down to keep from breaking his neck he put his arms out to either side and shifted this way and that until one outstretched finger brushed a wall that wall was rough brick it scraped his fingertips but he was glad to feel it even so without it he would have groped around as helplessly as a blind man in effect he was a blind man here he walked slowly down the corridor in the darkness he could not be sure whether it was straight or followed a gently curving path he was certain it ran under more buildings than just the temple to phos he wondered how old it was and why it had been built he also wondered if even digenis knew the answers to those questions his eyes imagined they saw shifting swirling colored shapes as if he had shut them and pressed knuckles hard against his eyelids if any beings phantasmagorical did lurk down here they could be upon him before he decided they were something more than figments of his imagination he said the creed under his breath again he had gonewell he didnt know how far he had gone but it was a goodly waywhen he saw a tiny bit of light that neither shifted nor swirled it spilled out from under the bottom of a door and faintly illuminated the floor just in front of it had the tunnel been lit he never would have noticed the glow as things were it shouted its presence like an imperial herald phostis fingers slid across planed boards after so long scratching over brick the smoothness was welcome whoever was on the other side of the door must have had unusually keen ears for no sooner had his hand whispered over it than she called enter in friendship by the lord with the great and good mind he groped for a latch found it and lifted it the door moved smoothly on its hinges though but a single lamp burned in the chamber its glow seemed bright as the noonday sun to his lightstarved eyes what he saw though left him wondering if those eyes were playing tricks on him a lovely young woman bare on a bed her arms stretched his way in open invitation enter in friendship she repeated though he was already inside her voice was low and throaty as he took an almost involuntary step toward her the scent she wore reached him had it had a voice that would have been low and throaty too a second longer look told him she was not quite bare after all a thin gold chain girded her slim waist its glint in the lamplight made him take another step toward the bed she smiled and moved a little to make room beside her his foot was already uplifted for a third stepwhich would have been the last one he neededwhen he caught himself almost literally by the scruff of the neck he swayed off balance for a moment but in the end that third step went back rather than ahead you are the test against which digenis warned me he said and felt himself turn red at how hoarse and eager he sounded well what if i am the girls slow shrug was a marvel to behold so was the long slow stretch that followed it the holy sir promised me you would be comely and he told the truth do as you will with me he shall never know one way or the other how not he demanded his suspicions aroused now along with his lust if i have you here of course youll bear the tale back to the holy sir by the lord with the great and good mind i swear i will not she said her tone carried conviction he knew he should not believe her but he did she smiled seeing shed got through to him were all alone only the two of us down here whatever happens happens and no one else will ever be the wiser he thought about that decided he believed her again whats your name he asked it was not quite a question out of the blue the girl seemed to understand that olyvria she answered her smile grew broader as if by their own will rather than hers her legs parted a little when phostis raised his left foot he did not know whether he would go toward her or away he turned took two quick strides out of the chamber and closed the door behind him he knew that if he looked on her for even another heartbeat he would take her as he leaned against the bricks of the passageway and tried to find a scrap of his composure her voice pursued him why do you flee from pleasure not until she asked him did he fully comprehend the answer digenis test was marvelous in its simplicity only his own conscience stood between himself and an act that however sweet went square against everything the priest had been telling him digenis teaching must have had its effect too regardless of whether the priest learned what hed been up to phostis knew he would always know since he found that reason enough to abstain he supposed he had met the challenge even so he made as much haste as he could away from that dangerous doorway although olyvria did not call to him again when he looked back to find out whether he could still see the light trickling under the bottom of the door he discovered he could not the passage did have a curve to it then a little while later he came upon another door with a lighted lamp behind it this time he tiptoed past as quietly as he could if anyone in the chamber heard him sheor perhaps hegave no sign not all tests phostis told himself as he pressed ahead had to be met straight on pitch darkness or no he could see olyvrias lovely body with his minds eye he was sure both his brothers would have enjoyed themselves immensely while failing digenis test had he not become dubious of the pleasures of the flesh exactly because they were so easy for him to gain he might well have failed too in spite of all the priests inspiring words moving along without light made him realize how very much he depended on his eyes he could not tell whether he was going uphill or down left or right just when he began to wonder if the passage under the city ran on forever he saw a faint gleam of light ahead he hurried toward it when he pulled aside the curtain that covered the entrance to the tunnel he found himself back in the temple again he stood blinking for a few seconds as he got used to seeing once more digenis did not seem to have moved while he was gone he wondered how long that had been his sense of time seemed to have been cast into darkness down in the tunnel along with his vision digenis studied him the priests eyes were so sharp and penetrating that phostis suspected he might have been able to see even in the black night of the underground passage after a moment digenis said the man who is truly holy turns aside from no test but triumphantly surmounts it quite against his conscious will phostis thought of himself triumphantly surmounting olyvria turning his back on the distracting mental image he answered holy sir i make no special claim to holiness of my own i am merely as i am if i fail to please you drive me hence your father or rather your acceptance of his will has already sufficed in that regard but while not a man destined to be renowned among phos holy elite you have not done badly i admit digenis said that was as near to praise as he was in the habit of coming phostis grinned in involuntary relief the priest added i know it is no simple matter for a young man to reject carnality and its delights thats true holy sir only after phostis had replied did he notice that this once digenis sounded remarkably like his father his opinion of the priest went down a notch why couldnt old men leave off prating about what young men did or didnt do what did they know about it anyhow they hadnt been young since before videssos was a city as the saying went digenis said may the good god turn his countenanceand his continenceupon you during your wanderings lad and may you remember his truths and what you have learned from me in the hour when you will be tested all in earnest may it be so holy sir phostis answered though he didnt understand just what the priest meant by his last comment werent his lessons phos truth in and of themselves he set that aside for later consideration bowed deeply to digenis and walked out of the little temple his haloga guards were down on one knee in the street shooting dice they paid off the last bet and got to their feet back to the palaces young majesty one asked thats right snorri phostis answered i have to ready myself to sail west he let the northerners escort him out of the unsavory part of the capital as they turned onto middle street he said tell me snorri how are you better for having your mail shirt gilded the haloga turned back puzzlement spread across his blunt features better young majesty i dont follow the track of your thought does the gilding make you fight better are you braver on account of it does it keep the iron links of the shirt from rusting better than some cheap paint might none of those young majesty snorris massive head shook slowly back and forth as if he thought phostis ought to he able to see that much for himself in fact he likely was thinking something of the sort phostis didnt care buoyed by digenis inspiring word and by pride at turning down what olyvria had so temptingly offered he had at the moment no use for the material things of the world for everything which had throughout his life stood between him and hunger discomfort and fear as if fencing with a rapier of logic he thrust home why have the gilding then he didnt know what hed expectedmaybe for snorri to rush out and buy a jug of turpentine so he could remove the offending pigment from his byrnie but whether the gilding helped the haloga or not he was armored against reasoned argument he answered why young majesty i like it i think its pretty thats plenty for me the rest of the trip to the palaces passed in silence lines creaked as they ran through pulleys the big square sail swung to catch the breeze from a new angle waves slapped against the bow of the triumphant as the imperial flagship turned toward shore krispos knew more than a little relief at the prospect of being on dry land to stay the voyage west from videssos the city had been smooth enough hed needed to use the lee rail only once the galleys and transport ships never sailed out of sight of land and beached themselves every evening that wasnt why krispos looked forward to putting in at nakoleia the trouble was hed grown to feel isolated cut off from the world around him in his week at sea no new reports slacked up on his desk his cabin in fact had no desk only a little folding table he felt like a healerpriest forced to remove his fingers from a sick mans wrist in the middle of taking his pulse he knew that was foolish a week was not a long time to he away from events anthimos even while physically remaining in videssos the city had neglected his duties for months on end the bureaucracy kept he empire more or less on an even keel that was what bureaucracy was for but krispos would be glad to return to a location more definite than somewhere on the videssian sea once he landed the lodestone that was the imperial dignity would attract to his person all the minutiae on which he depended for his understanding of what was going on in videssos you cant let go even for a second he murmured whats that father katakolon asked embarrassed at getting caught talking to himself krispos just grunted by way of reply katakolon gave him a quizzical look and walked on by katakolon had spent a lot of time pacing the deck of the triumphant the week at sea was no doubt his longest period of celibacy since his beard began to sprout hed likely do his best to make up for lost time in the joyhouses of nakoleia the port was getting close now its gray stone wall was drab against the greengold of ripening grain in the hinterland behind it blue in the distance hills rose up against the sky the fertile strip was narrow along the northern coast of the westlands the plateau country that made up the bulk of the big peninsula began to rise less than twenty miles from the sea katakolon went by again krispos didnt want him not right now phostis he called phostis came not quite fast enough to suit krispos not quite slow enough for him to make an issue out of it how may i serve you father he asked the question was properly deferential the tone was not again krispos decided to let it lie he stuck to the purpose for which hed called his son when we dock i want you to visit all merarchs and officers of higher rank remind them they have to take extra care on this campaign because they may have thanasioi in their ranks we dont want to risk betrayal at a time when it could hurt us most yes father phostis said unenthusiastically then he asked why couldnt you simply have your scribes write out as many copies of the order as you need and distribute them to the officers because i just told you to do this by the good god krispos snapped phostis glare made him realize that was taking authority too far he added besides i have good practical reasons for doing it this way officers get too many parchments as is who but phos can say which ones theyll read and which ones theyll toss into a pigeonhole or into a well without ever unsealing them but a visit from the avtokrators son that theyll remember and what he says to them and this is an important order do you see i suppose so phostis said again without great spirit but he did nod ill do as you say father well i thank your gracious majesty for that krispos said phostis jerked as if a mosquito had just bitten him in a tender place he spun round and stalked away krispos immediately regretted his sarcasm but nothing could recall a word once spoken hed learned that a long time before and should have had it down pat by now he stamped his foot angry at himself and phostis both he peered out toward the docks the fleet had come close enough to let him pick out individuals the fat fellow with six parasol bearers around him would be strabonis the provincial governor the scrawny one with three asdrouvallos the city eparch he wondered how long theyd been standing there waiting for the fleet to arrive the longer it was the more ceremony theyd insist on once he actually got his feet on dry land he intended to endure as much as he could but sometimes that wasnt much along with the dignitaries stood a lean wiry fellow in nondescript clothes and a broadbrimmed leather travelers hat krispos was much more interested in seeing him than either strabonis or asdrouvallos imperial scouts and couriers had an air about them that once recognized was unmistakable the governor and the eparch would make speeches from the courier krispos would get real news he called for evripos his second son was no quicker appearing than phostis had been frowning krispos said if id wanted slowcoaches id have made snails my spatharioi not you two sorry father evripos said though he didnt sound particularly sorry at the moment krispos wished dara had borne girls sonsinlaw might have been properly grateful to him for their elevation in life where his own boys seemed to take status for granted on the other hand sonsinlaw might also have wanted to elevate themselves further regardless of whether krispos was ready to depart this life he made himself remember why hed summoned evripos when we land i want you to check the number and quality of remounts available here and also to make sure the arsenal has enough arrows in it to let us go out and fight is that martial enough for you yes father ill see to it evripos said good i want you back with what i need to know before you sleep tonight make sure you take special notice of anything lacking so we can get word ahead to our other supply dumps and have their people lay hold of it for us tonight now evripos didnt try to hide his dismay i was hoping to to find someone soft and cuddly krispos shook his head i dont care what you do along those lines after you take care of what i ask of you if you work fast youll have plenty of time for other things but business first you dont tell katakolon that evripos said darkly you complain because i dont treat you the same as phostis and now you complain because i dont treat you the same as katakolon you cant have it both ways son if you want the authority that comes with power you have to take the responsibility that comes with it too when evripos didnt answer krispos added dont scant the job mens lives ride on it oh ill take care of it father i said i would after all and besides youll probably have someone else taking care of it too so you can check his answers against mine thats your style isnt it evripos departed without giving krispos a chance to answer krispos wondered whether he should have left his sons back in videssos the city they quarreled with one another they quarreled with him and they didnt do half as much as might some youngster from no particular family who hoped to be noticed but nothey needed to learn what war was about and they needed to let the army see them an avtokrator who could not control his soldiers would end up with soldiers controlling him the triumphant eased into place alongside the dock strabonis peered down into the ship seen close up he looked as if hed yield gallons of oil if rendered down even his voice was greasy welcome welcome thrice welcome your imperial majesty he declared we honor you for coming to the defense of our province and are confident you shall succeed in utterly crushing the impious heretics who scourge us im glad of your confidence and i hope i will deserve it krispos answered as sailors stretched a gangplank painted with imperial crimson from his vessel to the dock he too remained confident he would beat the thanasioi hed beaten every enemy hed faced in a long reign save only makuranand no avtokrator since the fierce stavrakios had ever really beaten makuran while even stavrakios victory did not prove lasting but strabonis sounded as if defeating the heretics would be easy as a promenade down middle street krispos knew better than that he walked across the gangplank to the dock strabonis folded his fat form into a proskynesis rise krispos said after a week aboard the rolling ship solid ground seemed to sway beneath his feet asdrouvallos prostrated himself next as he got back to his feet he started to cough and kept on coughing till his wizened face turned almost as gray as his beard a tiny fleck of bloodstreaked foam appeared at one corner of his mouth a quick flick of his tongue swept it away phos grant your majesty a pleasant stay in nakoleia he said his voice gravelly success against the foe as well thank you excellent eparch krispos said i hope youve seen a healerpriest for that cough oh aye your majesty more than one as a matter of fact asdrouvallos bony shoulders moved up and down in a shrug theyve done the best they can for me but its not enough ill go on as long as the good god wills and afterward well afterward i hope to see him face to face may that day be years away krispos said though asdrouvallos who was not much above his own age looked as if he might expire at any moment krispos added by all means consider your oration as given i do not require you to tax your lungs videssos has quite enough taxes without that your majesty is gracious asdrouvallos said in truth krispos was concerned for the eparchs health and in showing that concern hed also managed to take a formidable bite out of speeches yet to come he wished he could have found some equally effective and polite way to make strabonis shut up the provincial governors speech was long and florid modeled after the rhetoricsoaked orations that had been the style in videssos the city before krispos timeand probably would be again once his peasantbred impatience for fancy talk was safely gone he tried clearing his throat strabonis ignored him at last he started shifting from foot to foot as if he urgently needed to visit the jakes that got strabonis attention as soon as he subsided so did krispos wiggles the governor sent the avtokrator an injured look krispos pretended not to see after that he had to endure only an invocation from the hierarch of nakoleia who proved himself a man able to take a hint by making it mercifully brief then krispos could at last talk with the courier who had waited through the folderol with more apparent patience than the avtokrator could muster the fellow started to prostrate himself never mind that krispos said any more nonsense and ill die of old age before i get anything done by the good god just tell me what you have to say aye your majesty the couriers skin was brown and leathery from years in the sun which only made his surprised smile seem brighter that smile however quickly faded your majesty the news isnt good i have to tell you that the thanasioi put your supply dumps at harasos and rogmor to the torch the one three days ago the other night before last damagemm theres a lot of it im sorry to say krispos right hand clenched into a fist a pestilence he ground out between his teeth that wont make the campaign against them any easier no your majesty the courier said im sorry to be the one who gives you that word but its one you have to have youre right i know its not your fault krispos had never made a habit of condeming messengers for bad news see to yourself see to your horse notell me your name first so i can commend you to your chief for good service the couriers flashing smile returned im called evlalios your majesty hell hear from me evlalios krispos promised as the courier turned away krispos started thinking about his own next step if he hadnt already known the thanasioi now had a real soldier at their head the raids on his depots would have told him as much bandits might have attacked the dumps to steal what they needed for themselves but only an experienced officer would have deliberately wrecked them to deny his foes what they held soldiers knew armies did more traveling encamping and eating than fighting if they couldnt get where they needed to go or if they arrived half starved they wouldnt be able to fight hed already sent phostis and evripos on errands that left katakolon he called ceremonial had trapped his youngest son whod been unable to sneak off and start sampling the fleshly pleasures nakoleia had to offer what is it father katakolon sounded like a martyr about to be slain for the true faith im afraid youll have to keep your trousers on a bit longer my boy krispos said at which his son looked as if the fatal dart had just struck home ignoring the virtuoso mime performance krispos went on i need an accounting of the contents of all the storehouses in this town and i need it tonight see the excellent asdrouvallos here no doubt hell have a map to send you on your way from one to the next as fast as you can go oh yes your majesty asdrouvallos said even the short sentence was enough to set him coughing again by his expression katakolon hoped the eparch wouldnt stop unfortunately lor him asdrouvallos drew in a couple of deep sobbing breaths and managed to break the spasm if the young majesty will just accompany me trapped katakolon accompanied him krispos watched him go with a certain amount of satisfactionwhich he thought was more in the way of satisfaction than katakolon would get tonight now all three of his sons however unwillingly were doing something useful if only the thanasioi would yield so readily he feared they wouldnt that theyd known just where he was storing his supplies forced him to relearn a lesson in civil war he hadnt had to worry about since he vanquished anthimos uncle petronas at the start of his reign the enemy thanks to spies in his camp would know everything he decided almost as soon as he decided it hed have to keep moves secret until just before he made them and so would his officers hed have to remind them about that forgetting his thought of a moment before that all his sons were usefully engaged he looked around for one to yell at then he remembered and laughed at himself he also remembered hed sent phostis out on precisely that mission his laugh turned sour how was he supposed to beat the thanasioi if he found himself turning senile before he ever met them in battle sarkis reminded phostis of a plump bird of prey the vaspurakaner cavalry commander was one of krispos longtime cronies and close to krispos in yearswhich to phostis way of thinking made him about ready for the boneyard a great hooked beak of a nose protruded from his doughy face like a big rock sticking out of a mud flat he was munching candied apricots when phostis came into his quarters too which did not improve the young mans opinion of him as he already had a score of times that afternoon and evening phostis repeated the message with which krispos had charged him hed give krispos no chance to accuse him of shirking a task once accepted sarkis paused in his methodical chewing only long enough to shove the bowl of apricots toward him he shook his head not quite in disgust but not quite politely either sarkis heavylidded eyespiggy little eyes phostis thought distastefullyglinted in mirth your first campaign isnt it young majesty he said yes phostis said shortly half the officers hed seen had asked the same question most of them seemed to want to score points off his inexperience but sarkis just smiled showing orange bits of apricot be j tween his heavy teeth i wasnt much older than you are now when i first served under your father he was still learning how to command then hed never done it before you know and he had to start at the top and make soldiers whod been leading armies for years obey him it couldnt have been easy but he managed if he hadnt you wouldnt be here listening to me flapping my gums no i suppose not phostis said he knew krispos had started with nothing and made his way upward largely on his own his father went on about it often enough but from his father it had just seemed like boasting sarkis made it feel as if krispos had accomplished something remarkable and that he deserved credit for it phostis however was not inclined to give krispos credit for anything the vaspurakaner general went on aye hes a fine man your father take after him and youll do well he swigged from a goblet of wine at his elbow then breathed potent fumes into phostis face the throaty accent of his native land grew thicker phos made a mistake when he didnt let krispos be born a prince the folk of vaspurakan followed phos but heretically they believed the good god had created them first among mankind and thus they styled themselves princes and princesses the anathemas videssian prelates flung their way were one reason most of them were well enough content to see their mountainous land controlled by markuran which judged all forms of phos worship equally false and did not single out vaspurakaners for persecution even so many folk from vaspurakan sought their fortune in videssos as merchants musicians and warriors phostis said sarkis has my father ever asked you to conform to videssian usages when you worship whats that sarkis dug a finger into his ear conform you say no never once if the world wont conform to us princes why should we conform ourselves to it for the same reason he seeks to bring the thanasioi to orthodoxy by the doubt in his voice phostis knew he was asking the question as much of himself as of sarkis but sarkis answered it he doesnt persecute princes because we give no trouble outside of our faith you ask me the thanasioi are using religion as an excuse for brigandage thats evil on the face of it not if the material world is itself the evil phostis thought he kept that to himself instead he said i know some vaspurakaners do take on orthodoxy to help further their careers you call them tzatoi in your language dont you so we do sarkis said and do you know what that means he waited for phostis to shake his head then grinned and boomed it means traitors thats what we of vaspurakan are a stubborn breed and our memories long videssians are much the same phostis said when my father set out to reconquer kubrat didnt he take his maps from the imperial archives where theyd lain unused for three hundred years he blinked when he noticed hed used krispos as an example if sarkis also noticed he didnt remark on it he said young majesty he did just that i saw those maps with my own eyes when we were planning the campaign and faded ratchewed things they werethough useful nonetheless but three hundred yearsyoung majesty three hundred years are but a fleabite on the arse of time its likely been three hundred eons since phos shaped vaspur the firstborn from the fabric of his will he grinned impudently at phostis as if daring him to cry heresy phostis kept his mouth shut krispos had baited him too often to make it so easy to get a rise out of him he did say three hundred years seems a long enough time to me ah thats because youre young sarkis exclaimed when i was your age the years seemed to stretch like chewy candy and i thought each one would never end now i havent so much sand left in my glass and i resent every grain that runs out yes phostis said though hed pretty much stopped listening when sarkis started going on about his being young he wondered why old men did that so much it wasnt as if he could help being the age he was but if he had a goldpiece for every time hed heard thats because youre young he was sure he could remit a years worth of taxes to every peasant in the empire sarkis said well ive kept you here long enough young majesty when you get bored with chatter just press on thats the advantage of rank you know you dont have to put up with people you find tedious only my father phostis thought a single exception that covered a lot of ground but that was not the sort of thought he could share with sarkis or indeed with anyone save possibly digenis he was somehow sure the priest would understand though to him any concern not directly related to phos and the world to come was of secondary importance having been given an excuse to depart he took advantage of it even with an army newly arrived and crowding its streets nakoleia seemed a tiny town to anyone used to videssos the city tiny backwater provincial the scornful adjectives came readily to phostis mind whether or not they were true they would stick nakoleia was sensibly laid out in a grid he made his way back to krispos through deepening dusk and streaming soldiers without undue difficulty his fathers quarters were at the eparchs residence across the town square from the chief temple to phos like many throughout the empire that building was i modeled after the high temple in the capital phostis first reaction was that it was a poor cheap copy his second contrary one was to wish fewer goldpieces had been spent on the structure he stopped in his tracks halfway across the square by the good god he exclaimed careless of who might hear him im on my way to being a thanasiot myself he wondered why that hadnt occurred to him sooner much of what digenis preached was identical to the doctrines of the heretical sect save that he made those doctrines seem virtuous whereas to krispos they were base and vicious given a choice between his fathers opinions and those of anyone else phostis automatically inclined to the latter the irony of his position suddenly struck him what business had he sallying forth to crush the vicious heretics when he agreed with most of what they taught he imagined going to i krispos and telling him that it was the quickest way he could think of to unburden himself of all his worldly goods it would also forfeit the succession if anything would suddenly that mattered a great deal the avtokrator was a great power in the ecclesiastical hierarchy if he were avtokrator he could guide videssos toward digenis teachings if someone stodgy or orthodoxevripos sprang to mindbegan to wear the red boots persecution would continue it behooved him then not to give krispos any reason to supplant him with that thought in mind he hurried across the cobblestones toward the eparchs mansion the halogai newly posted outside it stared suspiciously until they recognized him then swung up their axes in salute his father as usual was wading through documents when he came into the chamber krispos looked up with an irritated frown what are you doing back here already i sent you out to i know what you sent me out to do phostis said i have done it here he pulled a parchment from the pouch on his belt and threw it down on the desk in front of krispos these are the signatures of the officers to whom i transmitted your order krispos leaned back in his seat so he could more easily scan the names when he looked up the frown had disappeared you did well thank you son take the rest of the evening as your own i have no more tasks for you as you say father phostis started to walk away the avtokrator called him back wait dont go off angry how do you think ive slighted you now the way krispos put the question only annoyed phostis more forgetting he intended to keep on his fathers good side he growled you might sound happier that i did what you wanted why should i krispos answered you did your duty well i said as much but the task was not that demanding do you want special praise every time you piddle without getting your boots wet they glowered at each other in mutual incomprehension phostis wished hed just shown krispos the parchment instead of giving it to him then he could have torn it up and thrown it in his face as it was he had to content himself with slamming the door behind him as he stamped out full darkness had fallen by the time he was out on the plaza again the haloga guards gave him curious looks but his face did not encourage questions only when hed put the eparchs residence well behind him did he realize he had no place to go he paused plucked at his bearda gesture very like his fathersand tried to figure out what to do next drinking himself insensible was one obvious answer torches blazed in front of all the taverns he could see and doubtless on ones he couldnt as well he wondered if the innkeepers had imported extra wine from the countryside while the imperial armys quartermasters brought their supplies into nakoleia it wouldnt have surprised him to sordidmaterialsists the arrival of so many thirsty soldiers had to look like a bonanza he didnt take long to decide against the taverns he had nothing against wine in its place it was healthier to drink than water and less likely to give you the flux but drunkenness tore the soul away from phos and left it base and animalistic easy meat for the temptations of skotos the state of his soul mattered a great deal to him at the moment the less he did to corrupt it the surer his hope of heaven he glanced across the square to the temple its entrance was also lit and men filed in to pray some by the way they walked had got drunk first phostis lip curled in contempt he didnt want to pray with drunks he didnt want to pray in a building modeled after the high temple either not when he discovered himself in sympathy with the thanasioi a breeze from off the videssian sea had picked up with the coming of evening it was not what sent a chill through him so long as his father held the throne he was in deadly dangerhad placed himself there in fact the instant he understood what digenis preaching implied the odds that krispos would turn away from materialism were about as slim as those of oranges sprouting from stalks of barley having been born with nothingas he never tired of repeatingkrispos put about as much faith in things as he did in phos so what did that leave phostis didnt want to drink and he didnt want to pray he didnt feel like fornicating either though the whores of nakoleia were probably working even harder than the tavernersand probably cheating their customers less in the end he went back aboard the triumphant and curled up in the bunk inside his tiny cabin after a few hours ashore even the small motion of the ship as it rocked back and forth beside the dock felt strange before long though it lulled him to sleep horns blared pipes shrilled and deeptoned drums thumped videssos banner gold sunburst on blue flew tall and proud at the head of the army as it marched forth from nakoleias land gate many of the horsemen had tied blue and yellow strips of cloth to their mounts manes the sea breeze stirred them into a fine martial display people packed the walls of nakoleia they cheered as the army rode out of the city some of the cheers krispos thought had to be sincere some were probably even regretful from tavernkeepers and merchants whose business had soared thanks to the soldiers and a fewkrispos hoped only a fewwere lies from the throats of thanasioi spying out his strength he turned to phostis whose horse stood beside his as they watched the troops ride past go back to noetos who commands the rear guard tell him to have his men be especially alert to anyone sneaking out of nakoleia we dont want the heretics to know exactly what all we have along with us not everyone leaving the city is sneaking out phostis answered i know krispos said sourly like every army this one had its camp followers women and occasional men of easy virtue also following the imperial force was a larger number of sutlers and traders than krispos was happy about he went on what can i do with our bases at harasos and rogmor burned out ill need all the help i can get feeding the troops harasos and rogmor phostis said raising an eyebrow id not heard that then you might be the only one in the whole army who hasnt krispos gave his eldest an exasperated glare dont you take any notice of whats going on around you they hit both caches while we were still asea by the good god they seemed to know what we were up to almost before we did how do you suppose they managed to learn where we were storing supplies phostis asked in a curiously neutral voice as ive said over and over krispos rubbed phostis nose in his inattention we have traitors among us too i wish i knew who they were by phos id make them regret their treachery but thats the great curse of civil war the foe looks just like you and so can hide in your midst dyou see hm oh yes of course father krispos sniffed phostis hadnt looked as if he was paying attention his face had a withdrawn preoccupied expression if he wouldnt give heed to something that was liable to get him killed what would hold his interest krispos said i really wish i knew how the heretics heard about my plans theyd have needed some time to plan their attacks so they must have known my route of march about as soon as i decided on it maybe even before i decided on it hed hoped the little joke would draw some kind of reaction from phostis but the youngster only nodded he turned his horse toward the rear of the army ill deliver your order to noetos repeat it back to me first krispos said wanting to make sure phostis had done any listening to him at all his eldest reacted to that with a scowl he gave back the order in a precise emotionless voice then rode away krispos stared after himsomething about the set of his back wasnt quite right krispos told himself he was imagining things hed pushed phostis too far there asking him to repeat a command as if he were a raw peasant recruit with manure on his boots of course raw peasant recruits had more incentive to remember accurately than did someone who could aspire to no higher station than the one he already held it was in fact difficult to aspire to a lower station than raw peasant recruit about the only thing lower than peasant recruit was peasant krispos knew about that sometimes he wished his sons did too the army was riding forward phostis back that brought him toward noetos twice as fast as he would have gone otherwise and cut in half his time to think he had a pretty good idea how the thanasioi had learned where the imperial army would set up its supply dumps hed named them for digenis he hadnt intended to betray his fathers campaign but would krispos believe that phostis didnt for a moment imagine krispos wouldnt find out he did not see eye to eye with his father but he did not underestimate him either nobody incapable stayed on the throne of videssos for more than twenty years when krispos set his mind to learning something sooner or later he would and when he did phostis wasnt sure what the consequences of that would be but he was sure theyd be unpleasantfor him they wouldnt stop at scolding either ruining a campaign was worse than a scolding matter it was the sort of matter that would put his head on the block were he anyone but a junior avtokrator given his fathers penchant for evenhandedat the moment phostis thought of it as heavyhandedjustice it might put his head on the block anyway he wondered whether he ought to pass his fathers order on to noetos if he truly adhered to the principles of the thanasioi how could he hinder the cause of his fellow believers but if he had any thought for his own safety how could he not transmit the order krispos would descend on him like an avalanche for that and if his fathers suspicions were aroused his own role in the matter of the supply dumps grew more likely to emerge what to do no more time for thoughtthere was the rearguard commanders banner blue sunburst on gold the reversed imperial colors marked the rear of the army and out from under the banner straight toward him rode noetos a solid middleaged officer like so many who served under krispos unflappable rather than brilliant he saluted and called out in a ringing voice how may i serve you young majesty uh phostis said and then uh again he still hadnt made up his mind in the end his mouth answered not his brain my father bids you to be especially alert for anyone sneaking out of nakoleia lest the stranger prove a thanasiot spy he hated himself as soon as he had spoken but that was too latethe words were gone they proved not to matter though noetos saluted again clenched fist over his heart and said you may tell his imperial majesty the matter is already being attended to then one of the officers eyelids fell and rose in an unmistakable wink you can also tell krispos not to go trying to teach an old fox how to rob henhouses illpass on both those messages phostis said faintly he must have looked a trifle walleyed for noetos threw back his head and let go with one of those deep manly chortles that never failed to turn phostis stomach you do that young majesty he boomed thisd be your first campaign wouldnt it aye of course it would good for you youll learn some things youd never find out in the palaces yes im discovering that phostis said he started back toward the front of the army that was a slower trip than the one from the front to the rear guard for now he was moving with the stream and gaining more slowly on any point within it he had the time to think he could have used before he certainly was learning new things away from the palaces not least among them how to be afraid much of the time he doubted that was what noetos had meant the baggage train traveled in the center of the strungout army the safest position against attack beeves shambled along lowing wagons rattled and squeaked and jounced ungreased axles squealed loud and shrill enough to set phostis teeth on edge some of the wagons carried hardbaked bread others fodder for the horses others arrows tied in neat sheaves of twenty ready to be popped into empty quivers still others carried the metal parts and tackle for siege engines whose timbers would be cut and trimmed on the spot under direction of the military engineers noncombatants traveled with the baggage train healerpriests in robes of blue rode mules that alternated between walk and trot to keep up with the longerlegged horses a few merchants with stocks of fancy goods for officers who could afford them preferred buggies to horseback so did some of the loose women any army attracts though others rode astride with as much aplomb as any man some of the courtesans gave phostis professionally interested smiles he was used to that and found it unsurprising after all he was young reasonably well favored rode a fine horse and dressed richly if a woman was mercenary or desperate enough to sell her body to live he made a logical customer as for buying such a woman thoughhe left that to his brothers then one of the women not only waved but smiled and called out to him he intended to ignore her as he had all the others but something about hermaybe the unusual combination of creamy skin and black black hair that framed her face in ringletsseemed familiar he took a longer look and almost steered his horse into a boulder by the side of the road hed seen olyvria naked and stretched out on a bed somewhere under videssos the city he felt himself turn crimson what did she expect him to do ride over and ask how shed been since she put some clothes on maybe she did because she kept on waving he looked straight ahead and dug his knees into his horses ribs urging the beast up into a fast canter that hurried it away from the baggage train and the nowdressed wench he thought hard as he drew near krispos what war olyvria doing here anyhow the only answer that occurred to him was spying for digenis he wondered if shed somehow sailed with the imperial army if not shed made better time overland than hed have thought possible for anyone but a courier he wondered if he ought to tell his father about hershe certainly was the sort of person about whom krispos worried but his father had no reason to believe he knew anything about her and she was likely a thanasiot herself he had no reason to give her away not even his own advantage krispos rode at the head of the army phostis came up and delivered both messages from noetos krispos laughed when he heard the second one he is an old fox by the good god he said then he turned serious again i would have failed in my duty though if id failed to give him that order theres a lesson you need to remember son an avtokrator cant count on things happening without him he has to make sure they happen yes father phostis said he hoped dutifully he knew krispos lived by the principles he espoused his father had given the empire of videssos two decades of stable government but at the cost of turning fussy driven and suspicious hed also developed an alarming facility for picking thoughts out of phostis head you no doubt have in mind that youll do it all differently when your backside warms the throne i tell you lad there are but two ways mine and anthimos better you should shoulder the burden yourself than let it fall on the empire so youve said more than once phostis agreed more than a thousand times he meant hearing the resignation in his voice krispos sighed and returned his attention to the road ahead phostis started to carry the argument further but forbore hed been about to put forward the wisdom and reliability of a small group of trusted advisors who might carry enough of the administrative burden to keep it from overwhelming an avtokrator before he spoke though he remembered the false friends and sycophants hed already had to dismiss people who sought to use him for their own gain just because advisors were trusted did not mean they wouldnt be venal he jerked on the reins his horse snorted indignantly as he pulled its head away from that of krispos mount but conceding his father a point always annoyed him by riding away from krispos he wouldnt have to concede anything either to his father or to himself by the end of the day the imperial army had moved far enough inland to make sunset a spectacle very different from what phostis was used to having land all around seemed suddenly confining as if he were closed off from the infinite possibilities for travel available at videssos the city even the sounds were strange night birds unknown in the imperial capital announced their presence with trills and strange drumming noises krispos tent however did its best to recreate the splendor of the imperial palaces using canvas rather than stone torches and bonfires held night at bay officers going in and out took the place of the usual run of petitioners some emerged glum others pleased again as it would have been back in the city as in the capital phostis had no choice but to establish his own lodging uncomfortably close to that of his father also as in videssos the city he did choose to stay as far from krispos as he could the servitors who raised his tent carefully did not raise their eyebrows when he ordered them to place it to the rear and off to one side of krispos larger grander shelter phostis ate from the cookpot the halogai set up in front of krispos pavilion he ran no risk of bumping into his father there by all accounts krispos habit on campaign was to share the rations of his common soldiers so he was probably off somewhere standing in line with a bowl and a spoon like any cavalry trooper had he sampled his own guards stew that evening he would not have been happy with it it had a sharp bitter undertaste that made phostis tongue want to shrivel up the halogai liked it no better than he and were less restrained in suggesting appropriate redress maybe if so bad next time we cut up cook and mingle his meat with the mush one of them said the rest of the northerners nodded so soberly that phostis who had at first smiled began to wonder if the haloga was joking hed hardly finished supper when his guts knotted and cramped he made for the latrines at a dead run and barely managed to hike up his robes and squat over a slit trench before he was noisomely ill wrinkling his nose at the stench he got painfully to his feet a haloga crouched a few feet away another came hurrying up a moment later before he could tear down his breeches he cried in deep disgust oh by the gods of the north ive gone and shit myself phostis made several more trips out to the slit trenches as the night wore on he began to count himself lucky that he hadnt had to echo the halogas melancholy wail more often than not several guardsmen were at the latrine with him finally some time past midnight he found himself alone in the darkness out there hed gone a good ways away from his tent in the hope of finding untrodden unbefouled ground just as he started to squat someone called from beyond the slit trenches young majesty his head went up in alarmit was a womans voice but what he had to do was more urgent than any embarrassment when hed finished he wiped sick sweat from his forehead and started slowly back toward his tent young majesty the call came again this time he recognized the voice it was olyvrias what do you want with me he growled havent you seen me mortified enough here and back in the city you misunderstand young majesty she said in injured tones she held up something in the dark he couldnt tell what it was i have here a decoction of the wild plum and black pepper that will help relieve your distress had she offered him her body he would have laughed at her hed already declined that when he was feeling perfectly fine but at the moment he would have crowned her empress for something that stopped his insides from turning inside out he hurried over to her skipping across slit trenches as he went she held a small glass vial out to him distant torchlight reflected faintly from it he yanked off the stopper raised the vial to his lips and drank thank you he saidor started to for some reason his mouth didnt want to work right he stared at the vial he still held in his hand all at once it seemed very far away and receding quickly agonizingly slow a thought trickled across his brain ive been tricked he turned and tried to run but felt himself falling instead ive been unconsciousness seized him before he could find the word stupid iv lets get moving krispos said irritably wheres phostis taken himself off to anyhow if he thinks ill hold up the whole army for his sake hes wrong maybe hes fallen into the latrine evripos said bad food was a risk on campaign plenty of halogai had been running back and forth in the night the gibe might have been funny had evripos sounded less hopeful it was true krispos said i havent time for anyones nonsense today sonhis or yours he turned to one of his guardsmen skalla stick your head into his tent and rout him out aye majesty like a lot of his fellows skalla looked even fairerpaler was probably a better wordthan usual this morning he strode off to do krispos bidding but returned to the imperial pavilion a moment later with a puzzled expression on his face majesty he is not there the coverlet is thrown back as if hed got out of his cot but he is not there well the ice take it where is he then krispos snapped what evripos had said sparked a thought he told skalla pick a squad of guards and go up and down the slit trenches in a hurry to make sure he wasnt taken ill there aye majesty skallas voice was doleful for one thing now that morning had come the latrines were busy anyone who spotted phostis there would have raised an uproar for another pick men the flux missed krispos said i wouldnt want the stink to make them sick all over again i thank you majesty the halogai were not what one would call a cheerful folk but skalla seemed more pleased with the world that did not mean he and the squad of guardsmen had any luck turning up phostis when he came back to report failure to krispos the avtokrator said im not going to wait for him by the good god lets get everyone moving hell turn up where else is he going to go and when he does i shall have a word or two with hima pungent word or two skalla nodded from everything krispos had gleaned of how life worked in halogaland sons there knew better than to give already grizzled fathers more gray hair he let out a mordant chuckleit sounded too good to be true the imperial army did not get moving as fast as he would have wanted it was newly mustered and still shaking down hed been sure phostis would appear before the troops really started heading south and west but his eldest did not appear evripos opened his mouth to say something that surely would have proved illadvised krispos glare made certain it never crossed the barrier of his sons lips by the time the army had been an hour on the road krispos anger melted into worry he sent couriers to each regiment to summon phostis by name the couriers returned to him phostis did not krispos turned to evripos fetch me zaidas at once evripos did not argue the wizard not surprisingly had a good notion of why hed been summoned he came straight to the point when was the young man last seen ive been trying to find out krispos answered he seems to have been taken with the same flux that seized a fair number of the halogai last night several of them saw him once or more than once squatting over a latrine trench no one though has any clear memory of spotting him there after about the seventh hour of the night an hour or so past midnight then hmm zaidas eyes went far away into a place krispos could not follow despite that though he was a thoroughly practical man the first thing to determine your majesty is whether he be alive or dead youre right of course krispos bit his lip for all his quarrels with his eldest for all his doubts as to whether phostis was his eldest he discovered he feared for phostis life as might any father true or adoptive can you do that at once eminent and sorcerous sir a hedge wizard could do as much your majesty with the abundance of phostis effects present here the mage answered smiling an elementary use of the law of contagion these effects once handled by the young majesty retain an affinity for him and will demonstrate it under sorcerous prodding assuming of course that he yet remains among the living aye assuming krispos said harshly find out at once then if we can go on making that assumption of course your majesty have you some artifact of your sons that i might use krispos pointed theres his bedding slung over the back of the horse he should be riding will that do excellently zaidas rode over to the animal at which krispos had pointed and pulled a coverlet from the lump of cincheddown bedding this is a very basic spell your majesty one that requires no apparatus merely a concentration of my will to increase the strength of the link between the blanket here and the young majesty just get on with it krispos said as you say zaidas laid the blanket across his knees as he switched the reins to his left hand he chanted briefly in the archaic dialect of videssian most often used in the liturgy for phos temple at the same time moving his right hand in small swift passes above the coverlet the square of soft wool rippled gently like the surface of the sea when stirred by a soft breeze phostis is alive zaidas declared in a voice that brooked no contradiction had he left mankind the coverlet would have lain quiescent as it did before i completed the incantation thank you eminent and sorcerous sir krispos said some of the great weight of worry hed borne rolled off his shoulderssome but far from all the next question followed like one winter storm rolling into videssos the city hard on the heels of another having found that he is among the living can you now learn among which living folk he is at the moment zaidas nodded not in answer krispos thought but to show hed expected the avtokrator would ask that yes your majesty i can do so he said its not quite so simple a spell as the one i just used but like it springs from the workings of the law of contagion i dont care if it springs from the ground when you pour pig manure around the place where you planted it krispos answered if you can work your magic while we move so much the better if not ill give you all the guards you need for as long as you need them that shouldnt be necessary zaidas said i think i have with me all i shall require he drew from a saddlebag a short thin stick and a small silver cup from his canteen he poured wine into the cup until it was nearly full then passed it to krispos hold this a moment your majesty if you would be so kind as soon as he had both hands free he teased a fuzzy length of wool loose from phostis blanket then wrapped it around the stick he held out a hand for the silver cup which krispos returned to him when he had it back he dropped in the stick so it floated on the wine this spell may also be accomplished with water your majesty but i am of the opinion that the spirituous component of the wine improves its efficacy however you think best krispos said listening to zaidas cheerfully explain how he did what he did helped the emperor not think about all the things that could have happened to phostis the wizard said once i have chanted the little stick here by virtue of its connection to the wool that was once connected to your son will turn in the cup to reveal the direction in which he lies this spell as zaidas had said was more intricate than the first one hed used he needed both hands for the passes and he guided his horse by the pressure of his knees at the climax of the incantation he stabbed down at the floating stick with a rigid forefinger crying out at the same time in a loud commanding voice krispos waited for the stick to quiver and point like a welltrained hunting dog instead it spun wildly in the cup splashing wine up over the edge and then sinking out of sight in the rich ruby liquid krispos stared what does that mean your majesty if i knew i would tell you zaidas sounded even more surprised than the avtokrator had he paused for a moment to think then went on it might mean this blanket was in fact never in direct contact with phostis but no he shook his head that cannot be either had the blanket no affinity for your son it would not have responded to the spell that showed us he is alive yes i follow your reasoning krispos said what other choices have we next most likely or so it seems to me is that my sorcerous efforts are somehow being blocked to keep me from learning where the young majesty is zaidas said but you are a master mage one of the leaders of the sorcerers collegium krispos protested how can anyone keep vou from working what you wish several ways your majesty i am not the only sorcerer of my grade within the empire of videssos another master or perhaps even a team of lesser wizards may be working to keep the truth from me notice the spell did not send us off in a direction that later proved false but merely prevented us from learning the true one that is an easier magic i see krispos said slowly you named one way or possibly even two in which you could be deceived are there others yes zaidas answered i am a master in wizardry based on our faith in phos and rejection of his dark foe skotos the mage paused to spit this is you might say a twopoled system of magic the halogai with their many gods or the khamorth of the steppe with their belief in supernatural powers animating each rock or stream or sheep or blade of grass view the world from such a different perspective that their sorcery is more difficult for a mage of my school to detect or counter the same applies in lesser degree to the makuraners who filter the power of what they term the god through the intermediary of the prophets four assuming this blocking magic is from some school other than ours can you fight through it krispos asked your majesty there i am imperfectly certain in theory since ours is the only true faith magic developed from it will in the end prove mightier than that based on any other system in practice mans creations being the makeshifts they are a great deal depends on the strength and skill of the mages involved regardless of the school to which they belong i can try my utmost but i cannot guarantee success do your utmost krispos said i suppose you will need to halt for your more complicated spells ill leave you a courier send word the moment you have results of any sort i shall your majesty zaidas promised he looked as if he wanted to say something more krispos waved for him to go on he did i pray you forgive me your majesty but you might also be wise to send out riders to beat the countryside ill do that krispos said with a sinking feeling zaidas was warning him not to expect success in a huny if at all the squads of horsemen clattered forth some ahead of the army some back toward nakoleia others out to either side of the track no encouraging word came from them by sundown krispos and the main body of his force rode on leaving zaidas behind to set up his search magic a company stayed with him to protect him from thanasioi or simple robbers krispos waited and waited for the courier to return at last just as weariness was about to drive him to his cot the fellow rode into the encampment seeing the question in the emperors eyes he just shook his head no luck krispos said for the sake of being sure no luck the courier answered im sorry your majesty the wizards magic failed again more than once from what he told me grimacing krispos thanked the man and sent him to his own rest he hadnt really believed zaidas would stay baffled he lay down on the cot as hed intended but found sleep a long time coming stupid the word slid sluggishly through phostis mind because he saw only darkness he thought for a confused moment that he was still back at the latrines then he realized a bandage covered his eyes he reached up to pull it off only to discover his hands had been efficiently tied behind his back his legs at knees and ankles he groaned the sound came out muffledhe was also gagged he groaned again anyhow his head felt like an anvil on which a smith about as tall as the top of the high temples dome was hammering out a complicated piece of ironwork he was lying on something hardboards he found out when a splinter dug into the thin strip of flesh between blindfold and gag adding to the pounding agony behind his eyes were squeaks and jolts im in a wagon or maybe a cart he thought amazed and impressed that his poor benighted brain functioned at all he groaned one more time hes coming around said somebodya manabove and in front of him the fellow laughed loudly and raucously its took him long enough it has it has shall we let him see where hes going another voice a womans asked after a moment phostis recognized it olyvrias he ground his teeth in helpless fury he felt hed already used up all the groans in him the manthe driversaid nah our orders was to bring him the first stage of the way to livanios without him knowin nothin about it thats what your pa done said and thats what we does so dont go untyin him either you hear me i hear you syagrios olyvria answered its too bad wed all be happier if we could get him cleaned up a bit ive smelled worse out in the fields at manuring time syagrios said the stink wont kill him and it wont kill you neither phostis had been aware of a foul smell since his wits returned he hadnt realized he was the cause of it he must have gone on fouling himself after olyvrias potionthe one that was supposed to end his internal turmoilforced him down into oblivion ill have revenge for that by the good god he thought ill he gave up no vengeance seemed savage enough to suit him olyvria said i wish he would have come and talked with me when he saw me by the baggage train he recognized me i know he did i think i could have persuaded him to come with us of his own will i know he follows thanasios gleaming path at least in large measure syagrios gave a loud skeptical grunt how dyou know that he wouldnt bed me when he had the chance olyvria answered her companion grunted again in a slightly different tone well maybe it dont matter though our orders was to snatch him fast as we could and we done did it livanios will be happy with us so he will olyvria said she and syagrios went on talking but phostis stopped heeding them he hadnt figured out for himselfthough he supposed he should havethat his kidnappers were thanasioi as it did olyvria the irony of that struck him though in his case the impact was far more forcible given any sort of choice in the matter he would have picked a different way of coming into their number but they had not given him any choice he closed his lips on the gag and tried to draw a tiny bit of the cloth into his mouth he needed several tries before he nipped it between upper and lower front teeth after working awhile on chewing through it he decided that was easier said than done he labored instead to get it down so his mouth would be free just when he thought hed succeed about the time he got to wherever livanios was the top edge of the gag slid down over his upper lip not only could he talk now if he had to he could also breathe much more easily even though he could talk he resolved not to lest his captors gag him more securely but his body tested his resolve in ways he hadnt anticipated at last he said could you people please stop long enough to let me make water syagrios startled jerk shook the whole wagon by the ice howd he get his mouth loose he turned around then growled well why should we bother you already stink we arent just stealing him syagrios were bringing him to us olyvria said theres no one on the road why shouldnt we just stand him up and let him do what needs doing it wont take long why should we you didnt lift him in there and you wont have to lift him out the man grumbled a little longer then said all right have it your way he must have pulled on the reins the jingle of harness ceased as the wagon stopped phostis felt himself lifted by arms as thick and powerful as any halogas he leaned against the side of the wagon on legs that did not want to hold him up syagrios said go ahead and piss be quick about it its not that simple for him you know olyvria said here waitill help the wagon shifted behind phostis as she got down he listened to her come around and stand by him she hiked up his robe so he wouldnt wet it as if that werent mortification enough she took him in hand and said go on now you wont splash on your boots syagrios laughed coarsely you hold him like that for very long and hell be too stiff to piss at all phostis hadnt even thought about that aspect of things what rang through his mind was his fathers voice back at nakoleia asking him if he wanted praise for piddling without getting his feet wet at the moment such praise would have been welcome he relieved himself as fast as he could never before had the phrase possessed such real and immediate meaning for him his sigh when he was through was involuntary but heartfelt the robe fluttered down around his tied ankles syagrios picked him up and grunting lifted him back into the wagon the fellow talked like a villain and without phostis excuse for filth was none too clean but he had brute strength to spare he set phostis down flat in the wagon bed then returned to his place and got his team moving once more you want to gag him again he asked olyvria no phostis saidquietly so they would see he did not have to be gagged then he used a word most often perfunctory for an avtokrators son please it was not perfunctory now i think id better olyvria said after a brief pause she must have swung round on the seat her feet came down in the wagon close by phostis head im sorry she told him as she slipped the gag over his mouth and tied it behind his neck but we just cant trust you yet her fingers were smooth and warm and briskly capable had she given him the chance he would have bitten them to the bone he didnt get the chance he was already discovering she knew how to do much more than lie temptingly naked on a bed that discovery would have surprised his brothers even more than it did him evripos and katakolon were convinced lying naked on a bed was all women were good for since he was less concerned about finding them there he found it easier to envision them doing other things but not even he had imagined finding one who made such an effective kidnapper olyvria got back up beside syagrios she remarked apparently to no one in particular if he gets that one off hell regret it ill make him regret it syagrios sounded as if he looked forward to doing just that phostis who had already started working on the new gag decided not to go on he chose to believe olyvria had given him a hint the day was the longest driest hungriest and generally most miserable hed ever endured after some endless while he began to see real black rather than gray through the blindfold the air grew cooler almost chilly night he thought he wondered if syagrios would drive straight on till dawn if syagrios did phostis wondered if he would still be alive by the time his eyes saw gray once more but not long after dark syagrios stopped he picked phostis up leaned him against the side of the wagon then descended picked him up again and slung him over his shoulder like a sack of chickpeas behind him olyvria got the horses moving at a slow walk from ahead came a metallic squawk of rusty hinges then the scrape of something moving against resistance from dirt and gravel a gate opening phostis thought hurry up an unfamiliar male voice said here we go syagrios answered he picked up his pace by their hoofbeats so did the horses behind him as soon as they stopped the gate went scrapesqueak closing phostis thought the slam of a bar falling into place confirmed that ah good syagrios said think we can untie him for now and take the rag off his eyes i dont see why not the other man said if he gets away from this place by the good god hes earned it and didnt i hear hes halfway set foot on the gleaming path himself aye ive heard that too syagrios laughed thing is i didnt get to be as old as i am believing everything i hear set him down so i can cut the ropes easier olyvria said syagrios put phostis onto the ground more carefully than if hed been chickpeas but not much somebodypresumably olyvriaslit his bonds then slid the blindfold from his face he blinked his eyes filled with tears after a day in enforced darkness even torchlight seemed shockingly bright when he tried to lever himself up neither arms nor legs would obey him he set his teeth against the pain of returning blood pins and needles was too mild a phrase for it it felt more like nails and spikes they got worse with every passing moment until he wondered if the maltreated members would fall off it will ease soon olyvria assured him he wondered how she could knowhad she ever been trussed up like a suckling pig on its way to market but she was right after a little while he tried again to stand this time he made it though he swayed like a tree in a windstorm he dont look too good said the fellow who went with this farmhouse phostis supposed it was though the man lean pale and furtive looked more like a sneakthief than a farmer hell be hungry syagrios said and tired syagrios seemed very much the stalwart bruiser phostis had expected he wasnt even of average height for a videssian but had shoulders as wide as any halogas and arms thick with corded muscle at some time in the unknown past his nose had intercepted a chair or other instrument of strong opinion a big gold hoop dangled piratically from his left ear phostis pointed at it i thought folk who followed the gleaming path didnt wear ornaments like that syagrios startled stare quickly slid into a scowl none of your cursed business what i wear or dont he began folding one big hand into a fist wait olyvria said this is something he needs to know she turned to phostis youre right and yet youre wrong when we go among men not of our kind sometimes lack of ostentation can betray us we have the right to disguise our appearance just as we may deny our creed to save ourselves phostis bit down hard on that one a videssians faith was his proudest possession many had been martyred for refusing to compromise the creed letting a manor a woman dissemble in time of danger went square against everything hed ever been taught but also made good sense from a practical standpoint slowly he said my father will have a hard time sifting those who follow thanasios ways from the generality then krispos wouldnt have looked for that most heresies believing themselves orthodox trumpeted their tenets and made themselves easy targets but suppressing the thanasioi would be like striking smoke which gave way before blows yet was not destroyed thats right olyvria said well give the imperial army more trouble than it can handle before long well give the whole empire more trouble than it can handle her eyes sparkled at the prospect syagrios turned to the fellow whod let them into the courtyard wheres the food he boomed slapping his bulging belly with the palm of one hand no matter what olyvria said phostis had trouble picturing him as an ascetic ill get it the skinny man said and went into the house phostis needs it more than you olyvria said to syagrios so he answered i was the one with the wit to ask for it of course our friend here wasnt likely to listen to the likes of him phostis thought he deliberately avoided naming the other man that showed more wit than hed credited syagrios with having if he ever escaped but did he want to escape he shook his head bewildered he didnt know what he wanted he didnt know what he wanted that is until the fellow who looked like a thief came out with a loaf of black bread some runny yellow cheese and a jar of the sort that commonly held cheap wine then his growling stomach and spitfilled mouth loudly made their wishes known he ate like a starving badger the wine mounted from his belly to his head he felt more nearly human that he had since he was drugged but that wasnt saying much he asked may i have a cloth or a sponge and some water to wash myself and some clean clothes if there are any the skinny fellow looked at syagrios syagrios for all his bluster looked at olyvria she nodded the skinny fellow said to phostis youre my size near enough you can wear one of my old tunics ill get it theres a pitcher and a sponge on a stick in the privy phostis waited until he had the rough colorless homespun garment in his hands then headed for the privy the robe he wore was worth dozens of the one he put on but he made the exchange with nothing but delight he looked down at himself as he came out of the privy he was no peacock like some of the young men who swaggered around videssos the city displaying themselves and their finery on holidays even if hed had such longingsas katakolon did to some degreekrispos wouldnt have let him indulge them having been born on a farm krispos still kept the poor mans scorn for fancy clothes he couldnt afford himself nonetheless phostis was sure hed never worn anything so plain in his whole life the thin man pointed at him see without the embroidered robes he looks like anybody else thats what thanasios says bless himtake away the riches that separate one man from another and were all pretty much the same what we have to do is make sure nobody has riches the lord with the great and good mind will love us for that other way to make us all the same is let everybody have riches syagrios cast a covetous eye on the befouled robe phostis had been so happy to remove clean that up and itd bring a pretty piece of change no olyvria said try to sell it and you shout here i am to krispos spies livanios ordered us to destroy everything phostis had when we took him and thats what well do all right all right syagrios said voice surly still seems a waste though the skinny man rounded on him your theologys not all it should be the goal is the destruction of riches says thanasios not the equality for phos best loves those who give up all they have for the sake of his truth oh i dont know about that syagrios said if all were alike poor or rich we wouldnt be jealous of each other and if jealousy aint a sin what is eh he set hands on hips and smiled triumphantly at the thin man ill tell you what the other answered hotly ready as any videssian to do battle for the sake of his dogmas no you wont olyvrias tone reminded phostis of the one krispos used when delivering judgment from the imperial throne the forces of materialism are stronger than we are if we quarrel among ourselves we are lost so we shall not quarrel syagrios and the skinny fellow both glared at her but neither one of them carried the argument any further phostis was impressed he wondered what power olyvria had over her henchmen whatever it was it worked maybe she carried an amulet or would a heretics charm be efficacious then again were the thanasioi heretics or the most perfect of the orthodox before phostis could formulate an answer to either of those questions the skinny man jerked a thumb in his direction and said what do we do with this one tonight keep watch on him olyvria said tomorrow we move on im going to tie him up too just in case the skinny fellow said if he gets loose the imperial executioners have a lot of ways to keep you alive when youd rather be dead i dont think we need to do that olyvria said this time though her tone was doubtful and she looked to syagrios for support the short muscular man shook his head he sided with the thin fellow olyvrias mouth twisted but she gave over arguing with a shrug she turned to phostis and said i think youd be safe unbound but they dont trust you enough yet try not to hate us for it phostis also shrugged i wont deny ive thought long and hard about becoming one of you thanasioi but i never thought id be recruited this way if you expect me to be happy about it i fear youre in for disappointment youre honest at any rate olyvria said syagrios snorted hes but a babe same as you lass he dont believe nothin bad can happen to him not in his guts not in his balls youre young you say what you want and dont give a fart for what happens next on account of you think youre gonna live forever anyways that was the most words phostis had heard from syagrios at any one time try as he would he couldnt keep his face straight his laughter had a high hysterical edge to it but it was laughter whats so funny syagrios growled you laugh at me youll go to the ice ive sent better and tougher men there than you by the good god when phostis tried to stop laughing he found it wasnt easy he had to take a deep breath hold it and let it out slowly before the fit would pass at last carefully he said i will apologize syagrios its just thatthati never expected you to talk likelikemy father he held his breath again to stave off another wild attack of laughter huh syagrios smile revealed several broken teeth and a couple of gaps yeah maybe that is funny i guess if youve been around awhile you start thinkin one kind o way before phostis could answer that or even think about it very much the skinny man came up to him with a fresh length of rope put your hands behind you he said i wont tie em as tight as they was before i phostis made his move the romances hed read insisted a man whose cause was just could overcome several villains the writers of those romances had never run into the skinny fellow phostis eyes must have given him away for the thin man kicked him square in the crotch almost before he managed to raise an arm he fell in a moaning heap and threw up most of the food hed eaten he knew he ought not to writhe and clutch at himself but he could not help it hed never known such pain you were right olyvria told the skinny man her voice curiously neutral he needs to be tied tonight skinny nodded he waited for phostis thrashings to cease then said get up you dont be stupid about it either or ill give you another dose swiping at his mouth with the sleeve of his homespun tunic phostis struggled to his feet he had needed to get used to digenis addressing him as lad rather than young majesty now he hurt too much to bridle at being roughly called you at the thin mans gesture he put his hands behind his back and let himself be tied maybe the rope wasnt as tight as it had been before it was none too loose either his kidnappers brought out a blanket that smelled of horse and draped it over him once hed lain down the two men went inside the farmhouse leaving olyvria behind for the first watch she had both a hunting bow and a knife that would have made a decent shortsword you keep an eye on him syagrios called from the doorway if he tries to get loose hurt him and holler for us we cant let him get away i know olyvria said he shant by the way she handled the bow phostis could see she knew what to do with it he had no doubt shed shoot him to keep him from escaping with the dull sickening ache still in his stones he wasnt going anywhere anyhow not for a while he said as much to olyvria you were stupid to try to break away there she answered again in that odd dispassionate tone so i found out the inside of phostis mouth tasted like something that had just been scraped out of a sewer why did you do it she asked i dont know because i thought i might succeed i suppose phostis thought a little then added syagrios would probably say because im young and stupid what he thought about both syagrios and his opinions he would not repeat to a woman not even one whod shown him her nakedness whod drugged him and stolen him he could at the moment think of olyvrias nakedness with absolute detachment he knew he wasnt ruined for life but he certainly was ruined for the evening he wriggled around a little on the hardpacked ground trying to find some position less uncomfortable than most of the others im sorry olyvria said as contritely as if they were friends did you want to rest what i want to do and what i can do arent the same he answered im afraid i cant help that she said sharply now if youd not been so foolish i might have managed something but since you were she shook her head syagrios and our other friend are rightwe have to get you safe to livanios i know hell be delighted to see you to have me in his hands you mean phostis retorted and what puts you so high in livanios council how can you know what he will or wont be its not hard olyvria answered hes my father zaidas looked worn hed ridden hard to catch up with the army still in the saddle he bowed his head to krispos i regret your majesty that i have had no success in locating your son by sorcerous means i shall accept without complaint any penalty you see fit to exact for my failure very well then krispos said zaidas stiffened awaiting the avtokrators judgment krispos delivered it in his most imperial voice i order you henceforth to be forcibly prevented from mouthing such nonsense he started talking normally again dont you think i know youre doing everything you know how to do youre generous your majesty the wizard said not hiding his relief he took the reins in his left hand for a moment so he could pound his right fist down onto his thigh you cant imagine how this eats at me im used to success by the lord with the great and good mind knowing a mage out there can thwart me makes me furious i want to find out who he is and where he is so i can thrash him with my bare hands his obvious anger made krispos smile a man who believes he cant be beaten is most often proved right but his grin soon slipped unless of course hes up against something rather more than a man if you were wrong back in the city and we do in fact face harvas that thought crossed my mind zaidas said being beaten by one of that sort would surely salve my selfrespect for who among mortal men could stand alone against him before i rejoined you i ran the same sorcerous tests id used at the sorcerers collegium and others besides whoever he may be my foe is not harvas good krispos said that means phostis does not lie under harvas handsa fate id wish on no one friend or foe there we agree zaidas answered we will all be better off if harvas blackrobe is never again seen among living men but knowing he is not the agency of your sons disappearance hardly puts us closer to learning who is responsible responsible who but the thanasioi that much i assume what puzzles meand you as well obviouslyis how theyre able to hide him krispos paused plucked at his beard and listened over again in his mind to what zaidas had just said after a moments thought he slowly went on knowing harvas isnt responsible for stealing phostis lifts a weight from my heart have you any way to learn by sorcery who is to blame the mage bared his teeth in a frustrated grimace that had nothing to do with a smile save in the twist of his lips majesty my sorcery cant even find your son let alone whos to blame for absconding with him i understand that krispos said not quite what i meant sometimes in ruling i find problems where if i tried to solve them all at once with one big sweeping law a lot of people would rise up in revolt but they still need solving so i go about it a little at a time with a small change here another one there still another two years later anyone who thinks he can solve a complicated mess in one fell swoop is a fool if you ask me problems that grow up over years dont go away in a day true enough your majesty and wise too ha krispos said if youre a farmer its something youd better know as may be zaidas answered i wasnt going to go on with flattery believe me i was just going to say i didnt see how your principle though admirable applies in this case someones magic is keeping you from learning where phostis isam i right krispos didnt wait for zaidas nod he knew he was right he continued instead of looking for the lad for the moment can you use your magic to learn what sort of sorcery shields him from you if you can find out whos helping to conceal phostis that will tell us something we hadnt known and may help our physical search well can it be done zaidas hesitated thoughtfully at last he said the art of magecraft lost a great one when you were born without the talent your majesty your mind if you will forgive a crude comparison is as twisty as a couple of mating eels thats what comes of sitting on the imperial throne krispos answered either it twists you or it breaks you does the idea have merit then it may zaidas said it certainly is a procedure i had not considered i would not promise results not before trial and not out here away from the resources of the sorcerers collegium if it works it will require sorcery of the most delicate sort for i would not want to alert my quarry to his being scrutinized in this fashion no that wouldnt do krispos reached out and set a hand on zaidas arm for a moment if you think this worth pursuing eminent and sorcerous sir then do what you can i have faith in your ability more than i do right now zaidas said but krispos neither believed him nor thought he believed himself the avtokrator said if the idea turns out not to work were no worse off am i right i think so your majesty the wizard answered let me explore what i have here and the techniques i might use im sorry i cant give you a quick answer as to the practicability of your scheme but it really does require more contemplation and research i promise ill inform you as soon as i either see a way to attempt it or discover i have not the skill knowledge or tools to undertake it i couldnt ask for more halfway through the sentence krispos found himself talking to zaidas back the mage had swung his horse away when he got hold of an idea he worried it between his teethand ceased to worry about protocol or even politeness in krispos mind his long record of success would have justified far worse lapses of behavior than that the avtokrator soon forced magical schemes and even worry about phostis to the back of his mind early that afternoon the imperial army rode into harasos which let him see firsthand the devastation the thanasioi had worked on the supply dumps there in spite of himself he was impressed theyd done a job that would have warmed the heart of the most exacting military professional of course the local quartermasters had made matters easier for them too probably because the warehouses inside the shabby little towns shabby little wall were inadequate sacks of grain and stacks of cut firewood had been stored outside burned black smears on the ground and a lingering smell of smoke showed where theyd rested next to the black smears was an enormous purple one the broken crockery still in the middle of it said it had been the armys wine ration now the men would be reduced to drinking water before long which would increase both grumbling and diarrhea krispos clicked his tongue between his teeth sorrowing at the waste the country hereabouts was not rich collecting this surplus had taken years of patient effort it might have seen the district through a famine or as here kept the army going without its having to forage on the countryside sarkis rode up and looked over the damage with krispos the cavalry general pointed to what had been a corral see they had beeves waiting for us too so they did krispos sighed now the thanasioi will eat their share of them i thought they had scruples against feasting on meat sarkis said thats right so they do well theyve slaughtered some the avtokrator wrinkled his nose at the stench from the bloated carcasses inside the ruined fence and driven off the rest well have no use from them thats certain aye too bad by his tone sarkis worried more about filling his own ample belly than the effect of the raid on the army as a whole well be able to bring in a certain amount of food by sea at nakoleia krispos said by the good god though thatll be a long supply line for us to maintain will your men be able to protect the wagons as they make their way toward us some will get through your majesty odds are most will get through if they hit us though well lose some sarkis answered and well lose men guarding those wagons too theyll be gone from your fighting force as sure as if the rebels shot em all in the throat yes thats true too rude of you to remind me of it though krispos knew how big a force he could bring to bear against the thanasioi hed campaigned enough to make a good estimate of how many men sarkis would have to pull from that force to protect the supply line against raiders less certain was how many warriors the rebels could array in line of battle when hed set out from videssos the city hed thought he had enough men to win a quick victory that looked a lot less likely now sarkis said a pity the wars cant be easy all the time eh your majesty maybe its just as well krispos answered sarkis raised a bushy grayflecked eyebrow krispos explained if they were easy id be tempted to fight more often who needs that aye something to what you say krispos raised his eyes from the ruined supply dump to the sky he gauged the weather with skill honed by years on a farm when the difference between getting through a winter and facing hunger often rode on deciding just when to start bringing in the crops he didnt like what his senses told him now the wind had shifted so it was coming out of the northwest clouds began piling up thick and black along the horizon there he pointed to them we dont have long to do what needs doing my guess is the fall rains start early this year he scowled they would nothings ever as simple as we wish eh your majesty sarkis said well just have to push on as hard as we can smash them once and the big worry goes even if they keep on being a nuisance for years i suppose so but sarkis solution however practical left krispos dissatisfied i dont want to have to keep fighting and fighting a war that will cause nothing but grief for me and for phostis he would not say out loud that his kidnapped eldest might not succeed him give a religious quarrel half a chance and itll fester forever thats true enough as who should know better than one of the princes sarkis said if you imperials would just leave our theology in peace the makuraners would come in and try to convert you by force to the cult of the four prophets krispos interrupted theyve done that a few times down through the years and theyve had no better luck than videssos we of vaspurakan are stubborn folk sarkis said with a grin that made krispos remember the lithe young officer hed once been he remained solid and capable but hed never be lithe again well krispos wasnt young any more either and if hed put on less weight than his cavalry commander his bones still ached after a day in the saddle he said if i had to rush back to videssos the city from the borders of kubrat now i think id die before i got there sarkis had been on that ride too we managed it in our puppy days though didnt we he looked down at his own expanding frontage me id be more likely to kill horses than myself im as fat as old mammianos was and i havent as many years to give me an excuse time does go on krispos looked northwest again yes the clouds were gathering his face twisted that thought had too ominous a ring to suit him its moving on the army same as it is on each of us if we dont want to get bogged down in the mud we have to move fast youre right about that he wondered again whether he should have waited till spring to start campaigning against the thanasioi losing a battle to the heretics would be bad enough but not nearly so dangerous as having to withdraw in mud and humiliation with deliberate force of will he made his mind turn aside from that path too late now to concern himself with what he might have done had he made a different choice he had to live with the consequences of what he had chosen and do his best to carve those consequences into the shape he desired he turned to sarkis with the supply dump as ruined as it is i see no point to encamping here spending a night by the wreckage wouldnt be good for the soldiers spirit either lets push ahead on the route weve planned aye your majesty we ought to get to rogmor day after tomorrow maybe even tomorrow evening if we drive hard the cavalry commander hesitated of course rogmors burned out too if you remember i know but from all ive heard aptos isnt if we move fast we ought to be able to lay hold of the supplies there before we start running out of what we brought from nakoleia that would be good sarkis agreed if we dont were liable to face the lovely choice between going hungry and pillaging the countryside if we start pillaging our own land one day we put ten thousand men into the camp of the thanasioi by the next sunrise krispos said grimacing id sooner retreat then id just seem cautious not a villain as you say your majesty sarkis dipped his head lets hope we have a swift triumphant advance so we neednt worry about any of these unpleasant choices that hope is all very well krispos said but we also have to plan ahead so misfortune if it comes doesnt catch us by surprise and strike us in a heap because we were napping instead of thinking sensible sarkis chuckled seems to me ive told you that a good many times over the yearsbut then you generally are sensible am i ive heard what was meant to be greater flattery that i liked less krispos tasted the word he was sensible id sooner see that than most of the lies stonecutters are apt to put on a memorial stele sarkis made a twofingered gesture to turn aside even the implied mention of death may you outlast another generation of stonecutters your majesty and stump around videssos as a spry eightyyearold you mean it could happen i suppose though the lord with the great and good mind knows most men arent so lucky krispos looked around to make sure neither evripos nor katakolon was in earshot then lowered his voice all the same if that does prove to be my fate i doubt it will delight my sons youd find a way to handle them sarkis said confidently youve handled everything the good god has set in your path thus far which is no promise the prize will be mine next time out krispos answered as long as i remember that im all right i think enough jabbering for now the sooner we get to aptos the happier ill be after serving under krispos for his whole reign sarkis had learned the trick of understanding when the emperor meant more than he said he set spurs to his horsedespite advancing years and belly he still had a fine seat and enjoyed a spirited mountand hurried away at a bounding canter a moment later the horns of the military musicians brayed out a new command the whole army picked up the pace as if fleeing the storm clouds piling up behind harasos lay at the inland edge of the coastal plain from it the road toward rogmor climbed onto the central plateau that took up the majority of the westlands drier hillier poorer country than the lowlands along riverbanks and in places that drew more rain than most farmers brought in one crop a year as they did in the country where krispos had grown up elsewhere on the plateau grass and scrub grew better than grain and herds of sheep and cattle ambled over the ground krispos eyed the plateau country ahead with suspicion not because it was poor but because it was hilly he much preferred a horizon that stretched out for miles on every side attackers had to work to set an ambush in country like that here sites for ambuscades came up twice in every mile he ordered the vanguard strengthened lest the thanasioi delay the army on its push to rogmor when the whole strungout force ascended to the plateau he breathed a heartfelt sigh of relief and a prayer of thanks to phos had he commanded the heretics he would have hit the imperial army as early and as hard as he could delaying it on its march now would be worth as much as a great battle later thinking thus he made sure his own saber slid smoothly from its scabbard though no great champion he fought well enough when combat came his way the leader of the thanasioi thought with him strategically but not in terms of tactics not long after the army from videssos the city reached the plateau some sort of disturbance broke out at the rear krispos force stretched for more than a mile he needed awhile to find out what was happening as if the army were a long thin rather stupid dragon messages from the tail took too long to get up to the head when at last he was sure the disturbance really meant fighting he ordered the musicians to halt his whole force no sooner had their peremptory notes rung out than he wondered if hed made a mistake but what else could he do leaving the rear to fend for itself while the van kept moving forward was an invitation to getting destroyed he turned to katakolon who sat his horse a few yards away get back there at the gallop find out whats truly going on and let me know at the gallop now aye father eyes snapping with excitement katakolon dug spurs into the horses side it squealed an indignant protest at such treatment but bounded off with such celerity that katakolon almost went over its tail the avtokrators youngest son returned faster than krispos would have thought possible his anger faded when he saw katakolon had in tow a messenger he recognized as one of noetos men well he barked the messenger saluted may it please your majesty we were attacked by a band of perhaps forty they came close enough to shoot arrows at us when we rode out to drive them off most fled but a few stayed behind and fought with the saber to help the others escape casualties krispos asked we lost one killed and four wounded your majesty the messenger answered we killed five of theirs and several more were reeling in the saddle as they rode away did we capture any of them krispos demanded we were still in pursuit when i left to bring this word to you i know of no prisoners but my knowledge as i say is incomplete ill ride back and find out for myself krispos turned to katakolon tell the musicians to order the advance as his son hurried off to obey he told the messenger take me to noetos ill hear his report of the action directly krispos fumed as he rode toward the rear of the army forty men had held him up for a solid hour a few more such pinpricks and the army would go hungry before it got to aptos better cavalry screens he told himself raiders had to be beaten back before they reached the main body screening parties could fight and keep moving or fall back on their comrades if hardpressed he hoped the rear guard had managed to lay hold of some thanasioi one interrogation was worth a thousand guesses especially when he knew so little about the enemy he knew the methods his men would use to wring truth out of any captives they did not please him but any man taken in arms against the avtokrator of the videssians was on the face of it a traitor and rebel not to be coddled if that meant danger to the empire one of the wounded imperials lay on a wagon a bluerobed healerpriest bent over him the soldier thrashed feebly an arrow protruded from his neck krispos reined in to watch the healerpriest at work he wondered why the bluerobe hadnt drawn the arrow then decided it was all that kept the wounded man from bleeding to death in moments this would be anything but an easy healing the priest repeated the creed again and again we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor as he used the prayers to sink down toward the healing trance he set one hand on the troopers neck the other on the arrow that bobbed back and forth as the fellow fought to breathe all at once the bluerobe jerked the arrow free the trooper let out a bubbling shriek bright blood spurted splashing against the priests face so far as breaking his concentration went it might have been water or nothing at all as abruptly as if the bluerobe had turned a spigot the spurting stopped awe prickled through krispos as it always did when he watched a healerpriest at work he thought the air above the injured trooper should have shimmered as if from the heat of a fire so strong was the force of healing that passed between priest and soldier but the eye unlike other less easily nameable senses perceived nothing the healerpriest released his hold on the injured man and sat up the bluerobes face was white and drained a token of what the healing had cost him a moment later the soldier sat too a pale scar marred the skin of his neck by its seeming he might have worn it for years wonder filled his face as he picked up the bloodstained arrow the priest had pulled from his neck thank you holy sir he said his voice as unhurt as the rest of him i thought i was dead as i think i am now the healer croaked water i pray you or wine the trooper pulled free the flask that still dangled from his belt handing it to the man who had saved him the bluerobes larynx worked as he threw back his head and gulped down great drafts krispos urged his horse forward glad the soldier was hale healerpriests were better suited to dealing with the consequences of skirmishes than battles for they quickly exhausted their powersand themselves in large conflicts they helped only the most desperately hurt leaving the rest to those who fought wounds with sutures and bandages rather than magic noetos rode toward krispos saluting he said we drove the bastards off with no trouble your majesty sorry we had to slow you down to do it not half so sorry as i am krispos answered well the good god willing that wont happen again he explained his plan to extend the cavalry screen around the army noetos nodded with sober approval krispos went on did your men capture any of the rebels aye we got one in the pursuit after i sent barisbakourios to you noetos said shall we squeeze the thanasiot cheese till the whey runs out of him a couple of his lieutenants were close by they chuckled grimly at the rearguard commanders truth in jests clothing presently at need krispos said lets see what magic can do with him first bring him here i want to see him noetos called orders some of his troopers frogmarched a young man in peasant homespun into the avtokrators presence the captive must have taken a fall from his horse his tunic was out at both elbows and over one knee he was bloody in all three of those places and a couple of others as well serum oozed down into one eye from a scrape on his forehead but he remained defiant when one of the guards growled down on your belly before his majesty wretch he bent his head sure enough but only to spit between his feet as if in rejection of skotos all the soldiers snarled then and roughly forced him into a proskynesis in spite of his struggles haul him to his feet krispos said thinking the cavalrymen were likely to have done worse to their prisoner had they not been under his eye when the ragged battered youthhe might have been evripos age more likely katakolonsi krispos asked him what have i done to you that you treat me like the dark god the prisoner worked his jaw perhaps preparing to spit once more you dont want to do that sonny one of the troopers said the young man spat anyhow krispos let his captors shake him a little but then raised a hand hold on i want this question answered as freely as may be given whats happened here what have i done to be hated so weve been at peace most of the years since he was born taxes are lower now than then what does he have against me what do you have against me sirrah you may as well speak your mind the headsmans shadow already falls across your fate you think i fear death the prisoner said by the good god i laugh at deathit takes me out of this trap of skotos the world and sends me on to phos eternal light do your worst to me thats but for a moment then i shake free of the dung we call a body like a butterfly bursting from its cocoon his eyes blazed though he kept blinking the one beneath the scrape the last set of eyes krispos had seen burning with such fanaticism had belonged to the priest pyrrhos first his benefactor then his ecumenical patriarch and at last such a ferocious and inflexible champion of orthodoxy that hed had to be deposed krispos said very well young fellow he realized he was speaking as if to one of his sons whod been foolish you despise the world why do you despise my place in it because youre rich and wallow in your gold like a hog in mud the young thanasiot answered because you choose the material over the spiritual and give over your soul to skotos in the process here you speak to his majesty with respect or itll go the harder for you one of the cavalrymen growled the prisoner spat on the ground again his captor backhanded him across the face blood started from the corner of his mouth enough of that krispos said hell be one of many who feel that way hes eaten up bad doctrine and sickened on it liar the young man shouted careless of his own fate youre the one with false teachings poisoning your mind abandon the world and the things of the world for the true and lasting life the one yet to come he could not raise his arms but lifted his eyes to the heavens we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind hearing the heretic pray to the good god with the identical words he himself used krispos wondered for a moment if the fellow could be right pyrrhos in his day might have come close to saying yes but not even the rigorously ascetic pyrrhos could have countenanced destroying all the things of this world for the sake of the afterlife how were men and women to live and raise families if they wrecked their farms or shops abandoned parents or children he put the question to the prisoner if you thanasioi had your way wouldnt you soonest let mankind die out in a single generations time so no one would be left alive to commit any sins aye thats so the youth answered it wont be so simple we know thatmost folk are too cowardly too much in love with materialism by which it sounds as if you mean a full belly and a roof over ones head krispos broke in anything that ties you to the world is evil is from skotos the prisoner insisted the purest among us stop taking food and let themselves starve the better to join phos as soon as they may krispos believed him that streak of fanatic asceticism ran deep in many videssians whether orthodox or heretic the thanasioi though seemed to have found a way to channel that religious energy to their own ends perhaps more effectively than the comfortable clergy who came from videssos the city me i aim to live in this world as long and as well as i can the avtokrator said the thanasiot laughed scornfully krispos did not care having known privation in his youth he saw no point to embracing it when he did not have to he turned to the men who had hold of the youngster tie him onto a horse dont let him escape or harm himself when we encamp tonight ill have zaidas the wizard question him and if magic doesnt get me what i need to know the guards nodded the young heretic just glared krispos wondered how long that defiance would last if confronted with fire and barbed iron he hoped he wouldnt have to find out late in the afternoon the thanasioi again tried to raid the imperial army a courier carried a dripping head back to krispos his stomach lurched the hacking was as crude as that of any farmer who slaughtered a pig while the iron smell of fresh blood also brought back memories of butchering if the courier had any such memories they didnt bother him grinning he said we drove the whoresons off your majestyspreading us wider was a fine plan junior here he didnt run fast enough good krispos said trying not to meet juniors sightless eyes he dug in the pouch at his belt and tossed the courier a goldpiece this is for the good news phos bless you majesty the fellow exclaimed shall we put this lad on a pike and carry him ahead of us for a standard no krispos said with a shudder an army that seemed bent on wanton killing would be just what the countryside needed to throw it into the rebels camp controlling his features as best he could the avtokrator went on bury it or toss it in a ditch or do whatever you please as long as you dont display it we want the people to know weve come to root out the heretics not to glory in gore however youd have it your majesty the courier said cheerfully he rode off happy enough with his reward even though the emperor had turned down the suggestion hed made krispos knew some avtokratorsnot the worst of rulers videssos had ever had eitherwould have taken him up on it or had the idea for themselves but he did not have the stomach for it after the army made camp he went over to zaidas pavilion he found the thanasiot prisoner tied to a folding chair and the mage looking frustrated zaidas gestured to the apparatus hed set up you are familiar with the twomirror spell for determining truth your majesty ive seen it used yes krispos answered why are you having trouble with it that would be putting it mildly it yields me nothing nothing do you hear normally among the gentlest of men zaidas looked ready to tear the answer to his failure out of the prisoner with redhot pincers can it be shielded against krispos asked obviously it can zaidas gave the thanasiot another glare before continuing this i knew before but i never thought to find such shielding on a fleabitten trooper like this if all the rebels are warded in like fashion interrogation will become less certain and more bloody the good gods truth armors me the young captive declared he sounded proud as if he failed to realize his immunity would only cause him to be given over to torment any chance hes telling the truth krispos asked zaidas made a scornful noise then suddenly turned thoughtful maybe his fanaticism does afford some protection the mage said one of the reasons sorcery so often fails in battle is that men at a high pitch of excitement are less vulnerable to its effects fervent belief in the righteousness of his cause may raise this fellow to a similar less vulnerable plane can you learn whether this is so it would take some time zaidas pursed his lips and seemed on the point of retreating into one of his brown studies krispos forestalled him whenever magic touched the thanasioi something went wrong zaidas hadnt been able to learn where the heretics had taken phostiswhose absence unexpectedly was an ache that only the endless work of the campaign held at bayhe hadnt been able to learn why he couldnt learn that and now he couldnt even squeeze truth from an ordinary prisoner to him that made the young thanasiot an intriguing challenge to krispos it made the rebel an obstacle to be crushed since he would not yield to gentler methods harshly the avtokrator said let the men in red leather have him interrogators who used no magic wore red to hide the stains of their trade in his youth krispos would have been slower to give that order he knew his years on the throneand his desire to remain there for more yearshad hardened him even corrupted might not have been too strong a word but he was also introspective enough to recognize that hardening and resist it save in times of dire need this he judged was one of those times the thanasiots shrieks kept him awake long into the night he was a ruler who did what he thought he had to do he was no monster some time past midnight he downed a beaker of wine and let the grape put a blurry curtain between him and the screaming at last he slept v after a lifetime spent within hearing of the sea phostis found the hill country he traveled through strange in more ways than he could count the moaning wind sounded wrong it even smelled wrong carrying the odors of dirt and smoke and livestock but not the salt tang hed never noticed till he met it no more instead of being able to look out from a tall window and see far across blue water he now found his horizon limited to a few hundred yards of gray rock graybrown dirt and graygreen brush the wagon in which he rode bumped along over winding trails so narrow he wouldnt have thought a horse able to use them let alone a vehicle with wheels and of course no one had ever used him as syagrios and olyvria did now all through his life people had jumped to obey even to anticipate his every whim die only exceptions hed known were his father his mother when she was alive and his brothersand being the eldest he was pretty good at getting his way with evripos and katakolon that a rebel officers daughter and a ruffian could not only disobey him but give orders themselves had never crossed his mind even in nightmare that they could do anything else had never crossed their minds as the road took another of its innumerable twists syagrios said down flat you anybody who sees you is likely to be one of us but aint nobody gets old on likely phostis scrambled down into the wagon bed the first time syagrios told him to do that hed balkedwhereupon syagrios clouted him he couldnt jump out of the wagon and run a stout rope bound his ankle to a post he could stand up and yell for help but as syagrios had said most of the people hereabouts were themselves thanasioi syagrios had said something else too when he tried to disobey listen boy you may think you can pop up like a spring toy and get us killed you may even be right but you better think about this too i promise you wont be around to see our heads go up on the milestone was he bluffing phostis didnt think so a couple of times other wagons or horsemen had trotted past but hed lain quiet most of the times he was ordered into the wagon bed as now no one came round the blind corner after a minute or two syagrios said all right kid you can come back up phostis returned to his place between the burly driver and olyvria he said where are you taking me anyhow hed asked that question ever since he was kidnapped as usual olyvria answered what you dont know you cant tell if youre lucky enough to get away she brushed back a curl that had slipped out to tickle her cheek if you decide you want to try to get away that is i might be less inclined to if youd trust me more he said in his theology he was not far from the thanasioi but he had a hard time loving people whod drugged kidnapped beaten and imprisoned him he considered that from a theological point of view should he not approve of them for removing him from the obscenely comfortable world in which hed dwelt no maybe he was imperfectly religious but he still thought of those who tormented him as his enemies olyvria said im not the one who can decide whether youre to be trusted my father will do that when you come before him when will that be phostis asked for at least the dozenth time syagrios answered before olyvria could whenever it is you ask too bloody many questions you know that phostis maintained what he hoped was a dignified silence he feared hope outran reality dignity came easily when backed up with embroidered robes unquestioned authority and a fancy palace with scores of servants it was harder to bring off for someone in a threadbare tunic with a rope round his ankle and harder still when a few days before hed fouled himself while in the power of the people he was trying to impress the wagon rattled around another bend which meant phostis spent more time hidingor was the proper expression being hidden even his grammar tutor would have had trouble deciding thatin the back of the wagon this time though syagrios grunted in satisfaction when the corner was safely turned olyvria softly clapped her hands together come on up you syagrios said were just about there although he couldnt smell the sea phostis still thought there would be the port of pityos hed never seen pityos but imagined it to be something on the order of nakoleia though likely even smaller and dingier the town ahead was smaller and dingier that nakoleia but there its resemblance to phostis imaginings ceased it was no port at all just a huddle of houses and shops in a valley a little wider than most a stout fortress with walls of forbidding gray limestone dominated the skyline as thoroughly as did the high temple in videssos the city what is this place phostis asked he regretted his tone at once hed plainly implied the town was unfit for human habitation as a matter of fact that was his opinionhow could anyone want to live out his life trapped in a single valley and how could anyone trapped in a single valley have a life worth living but letting his captors know what he thought seemed less that clever syagrios and olyvria looked at each other across him when she spoke it was to her comrade hell find out anyhow only when syagrois reluctantly nodded did she answer phostis the name of this town is etchmiadzin for a moment he thought shed sneezed then he said it sounds like a vaspurakaner name it is olyvria said were hard by the border here and a fair number of princes still call this town home more to the point though etchmiadzin is where the pious and holy thanasios first preached and the chief center of those who follow his way if etchmiadzin was the chief center of the thanasioi phostis was glad his kidnappers hadnt taken him to some outlying hamlet back at videssos the city he would have blurted out that thought had it occurred to him his friends and hangersonsometimes it was hard to tell the one group from the otherwould have bawled laughter probably drunken laughter too in his present circumstances silence again seemed the smarter course the people of etchmiadzin went stolidly about their business taking no notice of the incognito arrival in their midst of a junior avtokrator as olyvria had said a good many of them seemed to be of vaspurakaner blood broadershouldered and thickerchested than their videssian neighbors an old vaspurakaner priest his robe of different cut and a darker blue than those orthodox clerics wore stumped down an unpaved street leaning on a stick the men on guard outside the fortress were about as far removed from the halogai in the gilded mail shirts as was possible while still retaining the name of soldier not one fighters kit matched his comrades the guards leaned and slouched at every angle save the perpendicular but phostis had seen the measuring stare in these wolves eyes on the faces of the northern men in the capital as they sized up some new arrival at the palaces as soon as the guards recognized syagrios and olyvria though they came to excited life whooping cheering and pounding one another on the back by the good god you did nab the little bugger one of them yelled pointing toward phostis as a form of address that hit a new low inform my father that hes here if you would friends olyvria said from her lips as from digenis the greeting of the thanasioi came fresh and sincere the rough men hurried to do her bidding syagrios reined in and alighted from the wagon give me your foot he told phostis you aint gonna run away from here as if reading his captives mind he added if you try to kick me in the face boy i wont just beat you ill stomp you so hard you wont breathe without hurting for the next year you believe me phostis did as fully as he believed in the lord with the great and good mind not least because syagrios looked achingly eager to do as hed threatened so the heir to the imperial throne sat quietly while the driver cut through the rope perhaps he and syagrios shared the thanasiot theology that would never make them friends phostis had made orthodox enemies when orthodox himself he saw no reason why one thanasiot should not despise another as a man even if they held to the same dogmas the guards came straggling back one a few paces behind the other the fellow who got back to his post first waved to usher olyvria syagrios and even phostis into the fortress syagrios shoved phostis forward none too gently get moving you he got moving more soldiersno warriors was probably a better word for them as they had ferocity but seemed without disciplinetraded strokes or shot at propped up bales of hay or simply sat around and chattered in the inner ward they waved to syagrios nodded respectfully to olyvria and paid phostis no attention whatever in his plain cheap tunic he did not look as if he deserved attention the ironfronted door to the keep was open propelled by another shove from syagrios phostis plunged into gloom he stumbled not sure where he was going and even less sure of his footing olyvria murmured turn left at the first opening he obeyed gratefully only when he was inside the chamber did he think to wonder if syagrios was really as harsh and olyvria as kindly as they appeared to be snapping him back and forth between them like a ball thrown in a bath house struck him as a good way to weaken whatever resolve he had left come in young majesty come in exclaimed the slim little man sitting in a highbacked chair at the far end of the chamber so this was livanios then he sounded as cordial as if he and phostis were old friends not captor and captive the smile on his face was warm and invitingwas in fact olyvrias smile set in a face framed by a neat graying beard and marred from a couple of sword cuts it made phostis want to trust himand made him want to distrust himself on account of that the chamber itself had been set up to imitate as closely as was possible in the keep of a fortress in the middle of the back of beyond the grand courtroom in the palace compound back at videssos the city to someone who had never seen the real grand courtroom it might have been impressive phostis whod grown up there found it ludicrous where was the marble double colonnade that led the eye to the distant throne where were the elegant and richly clad courtiers who took their place along the way to the emperor the handful of rudely staring soldiers made a poor substitute nor were the ragged priest and the nondescript fellow in a striped caftan adequate replacements for the ecumenical patriarch and the lofty sevastos who stood before the avtokrators high seat phostis knew a weird mental shift as he reminded himself hed come to despise the pomp and ostentation that surrounded his father he also wondered why the leader of the radically egalitarian thanasioi wanted to mimic that pomp he had however bigger worries livanios brought them into sudden sharp focus saying so how much will your father give to have you back i dont mean gold we of the gleaming path despise gold but surely he will yield land and influence to restore you to his side will he i wonder phostis bitterness was not altogether feigned weve always quarreled my father and i for all i know hes glad to have me gone why not he has two other sons both of them more to his liking you undervalue yourself in his eyes livanios said hes turned the countryside around the imperial army upside down searching for you he searches sorcerously as well and with the same determination the man in the caftan said his videssian held a vanishing trace of accent phostis shrugged maybe what he heard was true maybe not either way it mattered little he said besides what makes you think i want to go back to my father by all ive heard of you thanasioi id sooner live out my days with you than smother myself in things back at the palace he didnt know whether he was telling the truth telling part of the truth or flatout lying the doctrines of the thanasioi drew him powerfully of so much he was sure but would men who observed all those finesounding principles stoop to something so sordid as kidnapping maybe they would if their faith let them pretend to be orthodox to preserve themselves if so they were the best actors hed ever run across they even fooled him livanios said ive heard somewhat of this from my daughter and the holy digenis both the possibilities are interesting youd truly rather live out your days in the want that is our lot than in the luxury youve always known i fear more for my soul than for my body phostis said my body is but a garment that will wear out all too soon when its tossed on the midden what difference if it once was stained with fancy dyes my soul thoughmy soul goes on forever he sketched phos sunsign above his breast livanios the priest olyvria even syagrios also traced quick circles the man in the caftan did not phostis wondered about that an imperfectly pious thanasiot struck him as a contradiction in terms or perhaps notthat label fit him pretty well was he claiming more belief than he really felt to get livanios to treat him mildly he had trouble reading his own heart what shall we do with you livanios said musingly by his tone phostis would have bet the heretics leader was wondering about the same questions that had gone through his own mind livanios went on are you one of us or do we treat you merely as a piece in the board game to be placed in the square of greatest advantage to us at the proper time phostis nodded at the analogy whatever else could be said about him livanios knew how to compare ideas pieces taken off the board in the videssian game of stylized combat were not gone for good but could be returned to action on the side of the player who had captured them that made the board game harder to master but also made it a better model for the involuted intricacies of videssian politics and civil strife father may i speak olyvria said livanios laughed when have i ever been able to tell you no aye say whats in your mind there is a middle way in this then she said no one of spirit whether he followed the gleaming path or not could be happy with us after we stole him away and brought him here against his will but once here how could one of good will not see how we truly live our lives in conformity to phos holy law many might fail to see that livanios said dryly among them i can name krispos his soldiers and the priests he has in his retinue but i see youre not yet finished say on by all means what i was going to suggest was not clapping phostis straightaway into a cell if and when we do return him to the board we dont want him turning back against us the instant he finds the chance cant just let him run loose neither syagrios put in he tried to get away once likely thought about it a lot moren that youre just askin to have him run back home to his papa if he gets on a horse without nobody around him phostis kicked himself for a fool for trying to make a break at the farm house the skinny fellow had kicked him too a lot harder olyvria said i wasnt going to suggest we let him run loose youre right syagrios thats dangerous but if we take him around etchmiadzin and to other places where the gleaming path is strong we can show him the life he was on the edge of embracing for himself before we lay hold of him once he sees it as i said once he accepts it he may become fully one of us regardless of how he got here that might have some hope of working livanios said and phostis heart leaped the heresiarch however was very videssian in his ability to spot betrayal before it sprouted it might also give him an excuse for hypocrisy and let him pick his own time and place to flee us aye thats so by the good god syagrios growled steepling his fingers livanios turned to phostis how say you young majesty in his mouth the title was if not mocking at least imperfectly respectful this affects you after all so it does phostis tried to match dry with dry if hed thought fulsome promises would have kept him out of a small dark dank chamber he would have used them but he guessed livanios would assume fulsome promises to be but fulsome lies he shrugged and answered the choice is yours if you dont trust me you wont believe what i say in any case youre clever enough arent you sitting in his highbacked chair livanios reminded phostis of a smug cat whod appointed himself judge of mice phostis had never been a mouse before he didnt care for the sensation livanios went on well we can see how it goes all right young majesty no manacles for you not now photis heard between the words well let you see uswith suitable keepers of courseand well see you later on well decide whats to be done with you in the end the priest who stood in front of livanios smiled as widely as his pinched features would permit and made the sunsign once more the man in the caftan who stood at livanios right half turned and said are you sure this is wise no livanios answered frankly he did not seem annoyed to have his decision questioned but i think the reward we may reap repays the risk they would never take such a chance back in livanios held up a hand never mind what they would do there you are here and i hope you will remember it he might listen to his advisers opinion but kept a grip on authority the man in the caftan put both hands in front of him and bowed almost double acknowledging that authority if he is to be enlarged even in part where shall we house him olyvria asked her father take him up to a chamber on the highest floor here livanios answered with a guard in the corridor hell not escape from there unless he grows wings syagrios when he is out and about youll be his principal keeper i charge you not to let him flee oh he wont syagrios looked at phostis as if he hoped the younger man would try to get away phostis had never seen anyone who actually looked forward to hurting him before his testicles crawled up into his belly he said i dont want to go anywhere right now except maybe to sleep spoken like a soldier livanios said with a laugh syagrios shook his head denying phostis deserved the name phostis didnt know if he did or not he might have found out had the thanasioi not kidnapped him but could he have fought against them he didnt know that either he contented himself with ostentatiously ignoring syagrios that made livanios laugh harder if he wants to sleep he may as well olyvria said by your leave father ill take him up to one of the rooms you suggested livanios waved an airy hand as if he were the avtokrator granting a boon having watched krispos all his life phostis had seen the gesture better done olyvria led him toward the spiral stairway syagrios pulled an unpleasantly long unpleas antly sharp knife from his belt and followed the two of them the ruffian phostis thought was not subtle in his messages doing his best to keep on pretending syagrios did not exist phostis turned to olyvria and said thank you for keeping me out of the dungeon at any rate he wondered why shed taken his side from a young man raised in the palaces calculation of advantage came naturally as breathing its simple enough i think that given the chance you will take your place on the gleaming path olyvria answered once you forgive us for the unkind way we had to grab you youll seeim sure youll seehow we live in accord with phos teachings far more so than those who pride themselves on how fat their bellies are or how many horses or mistresses they own how could anyone doubt surfeit is wrong phostis said and olyvria beamed but phostis wondered if sufficiency was wrong too the glutton deserved the scorn he got but was having a belly not growling with hunger every hour of the day also something to condemn he knew what his fathers answer would have been then again he also remained sure his father did not have all the answers in normal circumstances he might have enjoyed arguing the theology of it especially with an attractive young woman the knife syagrios held a couple of feet from his kidneys reminded him how abnormal these circumstances were theological disputation would have to wait the way he wobbled by the time he got to the head of the stairs also reminded him he was not all he could have been his own belly grumbled and cried out for more nourishment than hed had lately the chamber to which olyvria led him was severely simple it held a straw pallet covered with linen ticking a blanket that looked as if it had seen better years a couple of threelegged stools and a chamber pot with some torn rags beside it the restfloors wall ceilingwas blocks of bare gray stone livanios did not have to fret about his growing wings either even if he did sprout feathers he couldnt have slipped through the slit window that gave the little room what light it had the door had no bar on the outside but it had none on the inside either syagrios said someone will be in the hall watching you most of the time boy youll never know when even if you do get lucky someone will catch you in the stairs or in the hall or in the ward you cant run get used to it olyvria added our hope is that you wont want to run phostis that youll find youve gained by coming here no matter how little you care for the way you traveled when you see etchmiadzin when you see the gleaming path as it leads toward phos and his eternal life we hope youll become one of us she sounded very earnest phostis had trouble believing she was actingbut shed fooled him before he wondered if her father truly wanted him to take his place on the gleaming path as things stood livanios led the thanasioi at least in battle but an avtokrators son had a claim on leadership merely because of who he was maybe livanios thought phostis would be a pliant puppet phostis had his own opinion of that well leave you to your rest now olyvria said come tomorrow youll begin to see how the followers of the pious and holy thanasios shape their lives she and syagrios walked out she closed the door after them it wasnt much of a barrier but it would have to do phostis looked around at his cellthat struck him as a better name for the place than room and in truth no monk would have complained its furnishings were too luxurious it was however not a dungeon he did indeed have that for which to be grateful to olyvria he lay down on the pallet dry straw rustled under his weight it smelled musty straws poked through the thin linen covering and in a couple of places through his tunic as well he wiggled till he was no longer being stabbed then drew the blanket up to his neck when he did that his feet stuck out he wiggled some more and managed to get all of himself covered competing fears and worries roared in his head so loudly he could clearly hear none of them he fell asleep almost at once rain blew into krispos face he cast an unhappy countenance up to the heavensand got an eyeful of raindrops for his presumption well he said in a hollow voice at least we wont be hungry sarkis rode at his left hand thats true your majesty we got the flying column into aptos just in time to drive off the thanasiot raiders it was a victory why dont i feel victorious krispos said rain trickled between his hat and cloak and slithered down the back of his neck he wondered how well the gilding and grease on his coat of mail repelled rust he had the feeling hed find out to his right evripos and katakolon looked glum they looked worse than glum in factthey looked like a couple of drowned cats katakolon tried to make the best of it he caught krispos eye and said i usually like my baths warm father if you go out in the field you have to take that up with phos not with me krispos said but youre his viceregent on earth dont you have his ear aye viceregent on earthso they say but nowhere son will you find that an avtokrator has jurisdiction over what the heavens decide to do oh i can tell the clouds not to drop rain on me but will they listen they havent yet not to me or any of the men who came before me evripos muttered something sullen under his breath krispos looked at him he shook his head muttered again and rode a little farther away so he wouldnt have to say anything out loud to his father krispos thought about pressing him decided it wouldnt be worth the argument and kept his own mouth shut sarkis said if you could command the weather your majesty youd have started doing it your first fall on the throne when petronas raised his revolt against you the rains came early that year too thats true they did i wish you hadnt reminded me krispos said the rains then had kept him from following up a victory and let petronas regroup and continue the fight the next year he hoped hed manage a genuine victory against the thanasioi before the downpour made warfare impossible katakolon said id expected the heretics to come out and really fight against us by now he sounded disappointed that they hadnt he was only seventeen with no true notion of what combat was about krispos had got his own first taste at about the same age and sickened on it he wondered if katakolon would do the same but his son had raised a legitimate point krispos said id thought they would come out and fight too but this livanios of theirs is a canny one curse him to the ice he knows he gains if i dont destroy him this campaigning season he doesnt gain if we take back pityos sarkis said krispos horse put a foot in a hole concealed by water and almost stumbled when hed saved his seat and brought the gelding back under control he said im starting to think well need a break in the rain even to get to pityos even if the thanasioi attack us itll be a poor excuse for a battle sarkis said by the time a mans shot his bow twice the stringll be too wet to use again not much chance for tactics after thatjust out saber and slash a soldiers battle eh krispos said aye thats what they call it sarkis said the ones who live to call it anything that is yes krispos said what it really means is some stupid generals fallen asleep on the job soldiers battles were part of the videssian military tradition but not a highly esteemed part videssos honored cleverness in warfare as in everything else the point was not simply to win but to win with minimum damage to oneself that could make unnecessary what would have been the next battle sarkis said in this campaign a soldiers battle would favor us but for the band of turncoats who went over with livanios most of the thanasioi are odds and sods who oughtnt to have the discipline they need to stand up in a long fight from your mouth to the good gods ear krispos said cowardly scum the lot of them evripos growled hed been listening after all by his tone he hated the thanasioi less for their doctrinal errors than for making him get cold and wet they wont be cowards young majesty thats not what i meant at all sarkis said earnestly theyll have fire and dash aplenty unless i miss my guess what i doubt is their sticking power if they dont break us at the first onset they should be ours evripos grunted once more wordlessly this time krispos peered through the rain at the territory ahead he didnt like it too many hills to pass between on the way to pityos maybe he would have done better to stick to the coastal plain he hadnt expected the rains so soon but he was too far in to withdraw the best course now was to forge ahead strongly and hope things would come out right in the end that was however also the least subtle course against the odds and sods sarkis had mentioned hed have been confident of success but livanios had shown himself to be rather better at the game of war than that krispos wondered what he had in mind to counter it and how well the ploy would work one more thing ill have to find out the hard way he murmured sarkis katakolon and even evripos looked curiously at him he didnt explain his sons wouldnt have understood not fully while the cavalry commander probably followed him only too well camp that night was soaked and miserable the cooks had trouble starting their fires which meant the army was reduced to bread cheese and onions evripos scowled in distaste at the hard dark little loaf a fellow handed him out of a greased leather sack after one bite he threw it down in the mud no more for you this evening krispos ordered maybe hungerll give you a better appetite for breakfast evripos started worse than the rain that beat down on him long used to ignoring importunate men pleading their cases at the top of their lungs krispos ignored him the avtokrator saw nothing particularly wrong with the army bread phos had granted him good teeth so he had no trouble eating it he didnt like it as well as the white bread he ate in the palaces but he wasnt in the palaces now in the field you made the best of what you had evripos hadnt figured that out yet whether from his own good sense or more likely fear of igniting his father katakolon ate up his ration without complaint young face unwontedly thoughtful he said i wonder what phostis is eating tonight i wonder if hes eating anything tonight krispos said with the evenings orders given with the morrows line of march planned he had nothing to keep him from brooding over the fate of his eldest he couldnt stand that sort of helplessnes trying to hold it at bay he went over to zaidas tent to see what the mage had learned when he stuck his head into the tent he found zaidas scraping mud off his boots chuckling to catch his friend at such untrammeled mundanity he asked couldnt you do that by magic instead oh hello your majesty aye belike i could the wizard answered likely it would take three times as long and leave me drained for two days afterward but i could one of the things you have to learn if you go into magic is when to leave well enough alone thats a hard lesson for any man to learn let alone a mage krispos said zaidas got up and unfolded a canvas chair for him he sank into it perhaps ive not learned it myself in fullness if i had i might not come here to tax you on what youve found out about phostis no one could think ill of you for that your majesty zaidas spread his hands i only wish i had more newsor indeed any newsto give you your eldest son remains hidden from me krispos wondered whether that showed phostis was in fact a cuckoos egg in his nest but no the magic zaidas worked sought phostis for himself not on account of his relationif anyto the avtokrator krispos said have you progressed toward learning what sort of sorcery conceals his whereabouts zaidas bit his lip not even a friend casually tells his avtokrator he has failed to accomplish something the wizard said your majesty i must confess i have continued to devote most of my efforts toward locating phostis rather than on analyzing why i cannot locate him and what sort of luck have you had in those efforts the question was rhetorical had zaidas had any luck other than bad he would have proclaimed it with trumpet and drum krispos went on eminent and sorcerous sir i strongly urge you to give over your direct efforts exactly because theyve not succeeded learn what you can about the mage who opposes you if you have any better fortune there you can go back to seeking out phostis it shall of course be as your majesty suggests zaidas said understanding that an imperial recommendation was tantamount to a command the wizard hesitated then continued you must be aware i would still have no guarantee of success especially here in the field for this delicate work the tomes and substances accumulated within the sorcerers collegium are priceless assets so youve said krispos answered do your best i can ask no more of any man i shall zaidas promised and reached for a codex as if about to start incanting on the spot before he could demonstrate such diligence krispos left the tent and headed back to his own pavilion he was disappointed in his chief mage but not enough to say anything more to zaidas than hed already said zaidas had been doing the best he could by his own judgment an emperor who castigated the men hed chosen for their expert judgment would not long retain such experts around him rain drummed on the oiled silk mud squelched underfoot the tent was a joyless place krispos felt the weight of every one of his years even with the luxuries his rank afforded himenough room to stand and walk around a cot rather than just a bed rollcampaigning was hard on a man as old as him the only trouble was not campaigning would in the long run prove harder still so he told himself at any rate as he blew out the lamps lay down and tried to sleep so men always told themselves when they went off to war so no doubt livanios was telling himself somewhere not far enough away only by looking backward through the years could anyone judge who had been right who wrong outside the entrance to the tent the haloga guards chatted back and forth in their own slow sonorous speech krispos wondered if they ever had doubts when they lay down at night they were less simple than many videssians made them out to be but they did actively like to fight where krispos avoided battle when he could he was still wishing life could be less complicated when at last he surrendered to exhaustion when he woke up the next morning his mind bit down on that as if hed never slept he dressed and went out to share a breakfast as dank and miserable as the supper the night before getting the army moving helped kick him out of his own gloom or at least left him too busy to dwell on it by now the soldiers were more efficient than they had been when they set out from nakoleia knocking down tents then loading them onto horses and mules and into wagons took only about half as long as it had earlier but as if to make sure no blessing went unmixed the rain made travel slower and tougher than krispos had counted on hed planned to reach pityos six or seven days after he set out from aptos that would stretch now the army rode through a village but for a couple of dogs splashing through the mud between houses the place was deserted the peasants and herders who called it home had fled into the hills that was what peasants and herders did when a hostile army approached krispos bit his lip in frustrated anger and sorrow that his subjects should reckon forces he led hostile theyre most of them thanasioi is my guess evripos answered when he said that aloud they know what they have to look forward to when we stamp out this heresy of theirs what would you do with them after we win krispos asked interested to learn how the youth would handle a problem whose solution he did not clearly see himself evripos was confident if nothing else once we beat the rebel army in the field we peel this land like a man stripping the rind off an orange we find out who the worst of the traitors are and give them fates that will make the rest remember for always what opposing the empire costs he shook his fist at the empty houses as if he blamed them for putting him here on horseback in the cold rain it may come to that krispos said nodding slowly evripos answer was one a straightforward soldier might givewas in fact not very different from what sarkis had proposed the lad could have done worse krispos thought confident in his youth that hed hit on not just an answer but the answer evripos spoke out in challenge how could you do anything but that father if we can lure folk back to the true faith by persuasion rather than fear we cut the risk of having to fight the war over again in a generations time krispos anwered evripos only snorted he thought in terms of weeks and months not generations then krispos had to stop thinking about generations or even weeks a scout from the vanguard came splattering back calling the bastards aim to try and hold the pass up ahead against us open fighting at last krispos thoughtphos be praised already at sarkis bawled orders the musicians were ordering the imperial army to deploy while it traveled as a strungout snake it could not fight that way it began to stretch out into line of battle but as krispos saw when he rode forward to examine the ground for himself the line of battle could not stretch wide the thanasioi had cunningly chosen the place for their stand the sides of the pass were too steep for cavalry especially in the rain while at the narrowest point the enemy had erected a rough barricade of logs and rocks it would not stop the attackers but it would slow them down and here and there behind the barrier clothcovered awnings sprouted like drab toadstools krispos pointed to those as sarkis came up beside him theyll have archers under there or i miss my guess the barricade to hold us in place the bowmen to hurt us while were held likely youre right your majesty the cavalry commander agreed glumly livanios curse him is a professional well send some infantry around the barricade to either side to see if we cant push them back then krispos decided it was the only maneuver he could think of but not one in which he had great confidence the foot soldiers were the poorest troops in his force both in fighting quality and literally they were the men who could not afford to outfit themselves or be outfitted by their villages with horse and cavalry accouterments being a horseman himself sarkis shared and more than shared the avtokrators distrust of infantry but he nodded not having any better plan to offer a courier hurried off to the musicians at their call the infantry went forward to outflank the thanasioi who waved spears and yelled threats from behind their barricade well send the horse forward at the same time your majesty if thats all right with you sarkis said and krispos nodded in turn keeping as many of the enemy as possible busy would go a long way toward winning the fight shouting phos with us and krispos the imperials advanced as the emperor and sarkis had thought they would bowmen under cover from the rain shot at soldiers who had trouble answering back here and there along the line a man crumpled or a wounded horse screamed and broke away from its riders control then the enemys awnings shook as if in a high breeze but there was no breeze several of them fell over draping thanasiot archers in yards of soaked clinging cloth the stream of arrows slackened krispos men raised a cheer and advanced the avtokrator looked round for zaidas he did not see the sorcerer but had no doubt hed caused the collapse battle magic might have trouble touching men but things were another matter yet the thanasioi even with their strategem spoiled were far from beaten their men swarmed forward to fight the foot soldiers who sought to slide around their barrier the heretics war cry was new to krispos the path the gleaming path their ferocity was new too they fought as if they cared nothing whether they lived or died so long as they hurt their foes their impetuous onslaught halted krispos infantry in its tracks some of his men kept fighting but others scrambled out of harms way skidding and falling in the muck as they ran krispos cursed the ice take them he shouted the good god knows i didnt expect much from them but this fury choked him maybe the rebels will make a mistake sarkis said seeking such solace as he could find if they come out to chase our poor sorry lads the cavalryll nip in behind em and cut em off at the knees but the thanasioi seemed content to hold off the imperial army again krispos saw the hand of a welltrained soldier in their restraint raw recruits elated at success might well have swarmed forward to take advantage of it and left themselves open to a counterblow like the one sarkis had proposed not here though not today the imperial cavalry tried to force its way through the barrier the rebels had thrown up on a clear day they could have plied their poorly armored foes with arrows and made them give ground with the sky weeping overhead that didnt work they fought hand to hand slashing with sabers and using light spears against similarly armed opponents who while not mounted used the barricade as if it were their coat of mail theyve got more stick in them than i looked for sarkis said with a grimace either they put the real soldiers who defected in the middle or he let that hang krispos finished it mentally or else were in more trouble than we thought unlike the infantry the imperial horsemen stayed and fought but they had no better luck at dislodging the stubborn heretics curses rose above the clash of iron on iron and the steady drumming of the rain wounded men and wounded horses shrieked healerpriests labored to succor those sorest hurt until they themselves dropped exhausted into the mud time seemed stuck the gray mat of clouds overhead was so thick krispos had no better way to gauge the hour than by his stomachs growls if his belly did not lie afternoon was well advanced then not far away shouts rang out first in the squadron of haloga guards and then from the thanasioi through the confused uproar of battle came a new cry to me for the empire by the good god krispos exclaimed thats evripos at the head of a couple of dozen horsemen the avtokrators second son forced a breach in the heretics barrier in amongst them he lay about him with his saber making up in fury what he lacked in skill half the halogai poured into that gap as much to protect him as to take advantage of it in any proper military sense the result was satisfactory enough at last driven back from their barricade the heretics became more vulnerable to the onslaught of the betterdisciplined imperial troops their confident yells turned suddenly frantic push them hard krispos shouted if we break them here we have an easy road on to pityos with its major city taken he thought how could the revolt go on but the thanasioi kept fighting hard even in obvious defeat krispos thought about the prisoner hed ordered tortured about the contempt the youth had shown for the material world that he saw had not been so much cant rear guards sold themselves more dearly than he would have imagined fighting to the death to help their comrades retreat some men who had safety assured even abandoned it to hurl themselves at the imperials and their weapons using those to remove themselves forever from a worldly existence they judged only a trap of skotos because of that fanatical resistance the imperial army gained ground more slowly than krispos wanted not even more daredevil charges from evripos could break the heretics line sarkis pointed ahead look your majestytheyre filing over that bridge there i see krispos answered ten months out of the year the stream spanned by that ramshackle wooden bridge would hardly have wet a mans shins as he forded it but with the fall rains it not only filled its banks but threatened to overflow them if krispos men could not seize the bridge theyd have to break off pursuit they took a long chance here provoking battle with their backs to the river sarkis said lets make them pay for it more and more of the thanasioi gained the safety of the far bank yet another valiant stand by a few kept the imperial soldiers away from the bridge just when they were about to gain it in spite of everything the heretics could do to stop them the wooden structure exploded into flame in spite of the downpour magic krispos said staring in dismay at the heavy black smoke that poured from the bridge it could be your majesty sarkis answered judiciously more likely though they painted it with liquid fire and just now touched it off that stuff doesnt care about water when it gets to burning aye youre right worse luck krispos said made from naphtha sulfur the foulsmelling oil that seeped up between rocks here and there in the empire and other ingredients several of them secretliquid fire was the most potent incendiary videssos arsenal boasted a floating skin of it would even burn on top of water no wonder it took no notice of the rain the last handful of thanasioi still on the eastern side of the stream went down come on evripos shouted to the impromptu force he led to the ice with this fire well go across anyhow not all the men followed him and not only men but also horses failed him his own mount squealed and reared in fright when he forced it near the soddenly crackling flames he fought the animal back under control but did not try again to make it cross that proved as well for the bridge collapsed on itself a couple of minutes later charred timbers splashed into the river and some still burning were swept away downstream the thanasioi jeered from the far bank then began vanishing behind the curtain of rain krispos sat glumly on his horse listening to the splash and tinkle of the storm and through it the cries of wounded men he squared his shoulders and did his best to rally turning to sarkis he said send companies out at once to seize any nearby routes east that remain open aye your majesty ill see to it at once after a moment sarkis said we have a victory here your majesty so we do krispos voice was hollow as a matter of fact sarkis voice was hollow too each seemed to be doing his best to convince the other everything was really all right but neither appeared to believe it krispos put worry into words if we dont find another route soon well have a hard time going forward thats true sarkis seemed to deflate like a pigs bladder poked with a pin a victory that gets us nothing is scarcely worth the having my thought exactly krispos said better we should have stayed in videssos the city and started this campaign in the spring than be forced to cut it off in the middle like this he forced himself away from recrimination lets make camp do what we can for our hurt and decide what we try next a lot of that will depend on what the scouting parties turn up sarkis said i know krispos did his best to stay optimistic maybe the thanasioi wont have knocked down every bridge for miles around maybe sarkis sounded dubious krispos was dubious too against a revolt made up simply of rebellious peasants he would have had more hope but livanios had already proved himself a thoroughgoing professional you couldnt count on him to miss an obvious maneuver krispos put the future out of his mind he couldnt even plan until the scouts came back and gave him the information he needed he rode slowly through the army praising his men for fighting well and congratulating them on the victory they were not stupid they could see for themselves that they hadnt accomplished as much as they might have but he put the best face he could on the fight weve driven the bastards back showed them they cant stand against us they wont come yapping round our heels again like little scavenger dogs any time soon a cheer for his majesty one of the captians called the cheer rang out it was not one to make the hillsides echo but it was not dispirited or sardonic either all things considered it satisfied krispos he rode up close to the bridge some of its smoldering support timbers still stood evripos looked across the river toward the nowvanished thanasioi he turned his head to see who approached then nodded one soldier to another im sorry father i did my best to get over but my stupid horse wouldnt obey maybe its for the best krispos answered you would have been trapped on the far side when the bridge went down i cant afford to lose sons so prodigally he hesitated then reached out to whack evripos on his mailed back you fought very wellbetter than id looked for you to do it wasdifferent from what i expected a grin lightened evripos face and i wasnt afraid the way i thought id be thats good i was my first time in battle i puked up my guts afterward as a matter of fact and im not ashamed to admit it krispos studied his son in some bemusement have i gone and spawned a new stavrakios ive always expected good things from you but not that youd prove a fearsome warrior fearsome evripos grin got wider all at once in spite of his beard and the mud that streaked his face he reminded krispos of the little boy hed been fearsome you say by the good god i like it dont like it too well krispos said a taste for blood is more expensive than even an emperor can afford he realized he laid that on too thick and tried to take some of it off but i was glad to see you at the fore and if you go through the encampments tonight youll find out i wasnt the only one who noticed really krispos could see evripos wasnt used to the idea of being a hero by the way the young man straightened up though the notion sat well maybe ill do that try not to let them get you too drunk krispos warned youre an officer you need to keep your head clear when youre in the field evripos nodded remembering himself at the same age krispos doubted his son would pay the admonition too much heed but hed planted it in evripos mind which was as much as he could do he went off to see how katakolon had fared in his first big fight his youngest son had already disappeared among the tents of the camp followers so krispos silently shelved the lecture on the virtues of moderation he did seek out a couple of officers who had seen katakolon in action by their accounts hed fought well enough though without his brothers flair reassured by that krispos decided not to rout him from his pleasures hed earned them krispos had urged evripos to go through the camp to soak up adulation he made his own second tour for a more pragmatic reason to gauge the feel of the men after the indecisive fight he knew a certain amount of relief that none of the regiments had tried to go over to the foe a fellow who had his back turned and so did not know the avtokrator was close by said to his mates i tell you boys at this rate its gonna take us about three days lessn forever to make it to pityos if the mud dont hold us back mixing it with the cursed heretics will his friends nodded in agreement krispos walked away from them less happy than he might have been he breathed a silent prayer up to phos that the scouting parties could discover an undefended river crossing if his men didnt think they could do what he wanted from them they were all too likely to prove themselves right even though hed not fought himself the battle left him worn he fell asleep as soon as he lay down on his cot and did not wake until the gray dawn of another wet day when he came out of the tent he wished hed stayed in bed for sarkis greeted him with unwelcome news latest count is weve lost ah thirtyseven men your majesty what do you mean lost krispos wits were not yet at full speed the cavalry commander spelled it out in terms he could not misunderstand thats how many slipped out of camp in the night most likely to throw in with the thanasioi the numberll only grow too as all the officers finish morning roll for their companies no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a soldier came up to say something to him he nodded and sent the man away then turned back to kripos sorry your majesty make that fortyone missing krispos scowled if we have to use half the army to guard the other half itll be only days before we cant fight with any of it aye thats so sarkis said and how will you be able to tell beforehand which half to use to do the guarding you have a delightful way of looking at things this morning dont you sarkis krispos peered up at the sky from under the broad brim of his hat youre as cheery as the weather as may be i thought you wanted the men around you to tell you what was so not what sounded sweet and i tell you this if we dont find a good road forward todaywell maybe tomorrow but today would be betterthis campaign is as dead and stinking as last weeks fish stew i think youre right krispos said unhappily weve sent out the scouts thats all we can do for now but if they dont have any luck he left the sentence unfinished not wanting to give rise to any evil omen he sent out more scouting parties after breakfast they splashed forth vanishing into rain and swirling mist along with krispos the rest of the soldiers passed a miserable day staying under canvas as much as they could doing their best to keep weapons and armor greased against the ravages of rust and themselves as warm and dry as they couldwhich is to say not very warm and not very dry the first scouting parties returned to camp late in the afternoon one look at their faces gave krispos the bad news the captains filled in unpleasant details streams running high ground getting boggier by the hour and thanasioi out in force at any possible crossing points if it could have been done your majesty wed have done it one of the officers said truth is it cant be done not here not now krispos grunted as if kicked in the belly agreeing with sarkis that he wanted to hear from his subjects what was so was one thing listening to an unpalatable truth one that flew in the face of all he wanted was something else again but he had not lasted two decades and more on the throne by substituting his desires for reality another lesson learned from poor wild dead anthimos we cant go forward he said and the scout commanders chorused agreement the lord with the great and good mind knows we cant stay here this time if anything the agreement was louder though the bitter words choked him krispos said what had to be said then weve no choice but to go back to videssos the city the officers agreed once more that did nothing to salve his feelings the thanasioi tramping into the keep of etchmiadzin did not look like an army returning in triumph phostis had watchedhad taken part intriumphal processions down middle street in videssos the city testimonials to the might of his fathers soldiers and to the guile of his fathers generals looking down from his bare little cell in the citadel he saw none of the gleam and sparkle none of the arrogance that had marked the processions with which he was familiar the fighting men below looked dirty and draggled and tired unto death several had bandages clean or not so clean on arms or legs or heads and in fact theyd not won a battle in the end krispos army had forced them back from the position they tried to hold but even defeat hadnt mattered instead of pressing forward the imperial force was on its way back to the capital phostis was still trying to grasp what that meant he and krispos had clashed almost every time they spoke to each other but phostis however much he fought with his father however much he disagreed with much of what he thought his father stood for could not ignore krispos long record of success somewhere down deep hed thought krispos would deal with the thanasioi as he had with so many other enemies but no the door behind him swung open he turned away from the window syagrios grin always unpleasant seemed especially so now come on down you the ruffian said livanios wants a word with you he does phostis did not particularly want a word with the thanasiot leader but syagrios hadnt offered him a choice his watchdog stepped aside to let him go first not out of deference but to keep phostis from doing anything behind his back being thought dangerous felt good phostis would have been even happier had reality supported that thought the spiral stair had no banister to grab if he tripped hed roll till he hit bottom syagrios he was sure would laugh the louder for every bone he broke he planted his feet with special care resolved to give syagrios nothing with which to amuse himself as he did every time he came safe to the bottom of the stairs he breathed a prayer of thanks to phos as he also did every time he made certain no one but he knew it through the years krispos had gained some important successes simply by not letting on that anything was wrong even if the tactic was his fathers phostis had seen that it worked livanios was still out in the inner ward haranguing his troops about the fine showing theyd made phostis could wait on his pleasure unused to waiting on anyones pleasure save his ownand krisposphostis quietly steamed then olyvria came out of one of the side halls whose twists phostis was still learning she smiled and said to him you see the good god himself has blessed the gleaming path with victory isnt it exciting by being with us as we sweep away the old you have the chance to fully become the man you were meant to be im not the man i would have been true photsis said temporizing had he still been back with the army half his heart maybe more than half would have swayed toward the thanasioi now that he was among them he was surprised to find so much of his heart leaning back the other way he put it down to the way in which hed come to etchmiadzin now that our brave soldiers have returned youll be able to get out more and see the gleaming path as it truly is olyvria went on if shed noticed his lukewarm reply she ignored it syagrios worse luck seemed to notice everything grinning his snagtoothed grin he put in youll have a tougher time running off too the weathers not suited to running phostis answered as mildly as he could anyhow olyvria is right i do want to watch life along the gleaming path shes right about more than that syagrios said your cursed father cant hurt us the way he thought he could come spring all these landsll be flowing smooth as a river under livanios you bet they will a river that didnt flow smooth had won more for the thanasioi than their soldiers might or so phostis had heard he kept that thought to himself too olyvria said it shouldnt be a matter of running in any case we wont speak of that again for we want you to remain and be contented among us id also like to be contented among you phostis answered i hope it proves possible oh so do i olyvrias face glowed for about the first time since shed helped kidnap him phostis longingly remembered how shed looked naked in the lamplight in the secret chamber under videssos the city if hed gone forward instead of back outside in the inner ward livanios finished his speech the thanasiot soldiers cheered syagrios set a strong hand on phostis arm come on now hell have time to deal with the likes of you phostis wanted to jerk away not just from the contempt in his keepers voice but also from being handled as if he were only a slab of meat back at the palaces anyone who touched him like that would be gone inside the hour and with stripes on his back to reward his insolence but phostis wasnt back at the palaces every day reminded him of that in a new way olyvria trailed along as syagrios led him out to livanios the thanasioi who still filled the courtyard made room for the ruffian and for livanios daughter to pass phostis they eyed with curiosity some perhaps wondering who he was and others who knew that much wondering what he was doing here he wondered what he was doing here himself livanios smile instantly changed him from stern soldier to trusted leader he turned its full warmth on phostis and heres the young majesty he exclaimed as if phostis were sovereign rather than prisoner how fare you young majesty well enough eminent sir phostis answered hed seen courtiers who could match livanios as chameleons but few who could top him the thanasiot leader said save your fancy titles for the corrupt old court im but another man making his way along the gleaming path that leads to phos yes sir phostis said he noticed livanios did not reject that title of respect father i do think hell choose to join you on the gleaming path olyvria said i hope he does livanios said and then to phostis i hope you do our brave and bright warriors surely kept your father from making life difficult for us this year we have a whole season now in which to build and grow well use it well i assure you i dont doubt that phostis said your little realm here already reminds me of the way the empire is run does it livanios sounded pleased maybe you can help keep it running as it should as a matter of fact knowing your father hes doubtless made sure you have some of the same skills he uses though now youd turn them to the cause of righteousness well yes some phostis said not caring to admit hed disliked and scanted administering imperial affairs he wanted livanios to think of him as someone useful not as foe or a potential rival to be disposed of good good livanios beamed well yet scour greed and miserliness and false doctrine from the face of the earth and usher in such a reign of virtue that phos triumph over skotos will be soon and certain olyvria clapped her hands in delight at the vision her father put forward it excited phostis too this was the way digenis had spoken before livanios had seemed more an officer out for his own advantage than someone truly committed to thanasios preaching if he meant to put it into effect phostis would have more reason to think hard about fully binding himself to the movement syagrios said well hit the imperials some more licks too i want to be in on that by the good god therell be slaughter aplenty for you never fear livanios told him phostis newly fired zeal chilled as suddenly as it had heated how he wondered could you get rid of greed and at the same time maintain a red zest for slaughter and how could the gleaming path simultaneously contain both righteousness and syagrios one thing was clear hed have time to find out now that his fathers push had failed hed stay among the thanasioi indefinitely had he really wanted that as much as hed thought before he got it hed find that out too vi krispos paced the palace corridors like a caged animal the fall rains were done now sleet and snow came down from the cold gray heavens the occasional clear days or even once or twice clear weeks were salt in his wounds if they but lasted he could fare forth once more against the thanasioi one long stretch of good weather sorely tempted him but he restrained himself he knew too well it would not hold but each successive bright morning gave a fresh twist of the knife that once he welcomed the blizzard that blew in though it trapped him it let him feel sagacious now midwinters day the day of the winter solstice drew near krispos ticked off the passing days on the calendar one by one but somehow they raced too swiftly even so he faced the coming solstice with more resignation than joy midwinters day was the greatest festival of the religious year but he found himself in no mood to celebrate not even previewing the mime troupes that would perform in the amphitheater restored his good humor among other things midwinters day gave folk more license than any other festival and a good many of the skits poked fun at him for failing to put down the thanasioi more than one teased him for losing phostis too not only would he have to watch this foolishness from the imperial box on the spine of the amphitheater hed have to be seen to laugh an avtokrator who couldnt take what the mimes dished out quickly forfeited the city mobs fickle favor he took advantage of the imperial dignity to complain loud and often at last mystakon the eunuch chamberlain who had most often served phostis said may it please your majesty i am of the opinion that the young majesty were he able would gladly assume the duty you find onerous krispos felt his cheeks flame yes no doubt youre right he mumbled after that he bottled his forebodings up inside himself perhaps in one of barsymes efforts to cheer him the serving maid drina showed up in his bed again after a particularly trying day this time he actively wanted her or at least his mind did his body however failed to rise to the occasion despite her ingenuity when it became clear nothing was going to happen she said now dont you fret your majesty it happens to everyone now and again she spoke so matteroffactly he got the idea she was talking from experience she added ill tell you something else too you foolish men make more of a much about it than women ever do its just one of those things just one of those things krispos echoed between clenched teeth drina wrapped a robe around her and slipped out of the imperial bedchamber leaving him alone in the darkness just one of those things he repeated staring up at the ceiling just one more thing that doesnt work maybe drina knew better than to gossip or maybeand more likely given the way news of any sort raced through the palacesthe servitors knew better than to show the avtokrator they knew anything back in his own days as vestiarios hed chattered about anthimos though never where anthimos could listen at any rate he heard no sniggers which relieved him in a way altogether different from the one hed sought with drina compared to failing in bed the ordeal of facing public mockery on midwinters day suddenly seemed much more bearable when the day finally dawned cold and clear he let barsymes pour him into his finest ceremonial robe as if it were chain mail to armor him against the taunts he expected the procession from the palaces to the amphitheater took him past bonfires blazing in the plaza of palamas people dressed in their holiday bestwomen with lace at their throat and ankles perhaps with a couple of bodice buttons undone or skirts slit to show off a pretty calf men in robes with fur collars and cuffsleapt over the fires shouting burn illluck go on your majesty if you care to barsymes urged it will make you feel better but krispos shook his head ive seen too much to believe illlucks so easy to get rid of worse luck for me preceded by the dozen parasol bearers protocol required flanked by bodyguards the avtokrator crossed the racetrack that circled the floor of the amphitheater and took his place on the seat at the center of the spine looking up to the top of the great oval was like looking up from the bottom of a soup tureen save that the amphitheater was filled with people not soup to the folk in the top rows krispos could have been only a scarlet dot to anyone shortsighted up there he was surely invisible but everyone in the amphitheater could hear him he thought of that as magic of a sort though in fact it was nothing moreor lessthan cleverly crafted acoustics when he spoke from the emperors seat it was as if he spoke straight into the ear of all the tens of thousands of men women and children who packed the arena people of videssos he said and then again after his first words won quiet people of videssos after today the sun the symbol of the lord with the great and good mind turns to the north once more try as skotos will he has not the power to pull it from the sky may the solstice and the days that follow it give everyone a lesson even when darkness seems deepest longer brighter days lie ahead and when darkness seems deepest we celebrate to show we know it cannot rule us now let the midwinters day festivities begin he knew the cheer that rose had more to do with his opening the festival than with what hed said nonetheless the noise avalanched down on him from all sides until his head rang with it just as from the emperors seat his voice flew throughout the amphitheater so every sound within the stone bowl was focused and magnified there though hed known in advance his speech would be largely ignored he spoke as always from the center of what most concerned him at the moment the people would forget his words the moment they were gone he tried to take them to heart when things seemed blackest carrying on was never easy but if you didnt carry on how could you make your way to better times squeals of glee greeted the first mime troupe to appear the crowds laughter dinned around krispos as the performers some dressed as soldiers others as horses pretended to be stuck in the mud even if they did lampoon his illfated campaign in the westlands he found himself amused at first their act was highly polished as were most that appeared in the amphitheater rotten fruit and sometimes stones greeted troupes that did not live up to what the city folk thought their due the next group of mimes put on a skit whose theme puzzled krispos one of their number wore a costume that turned him into a skeleton the other three seemed to be servants they brought him ever more elaborate meals finally wheeling out a prop feast that looked sumptuous enough to feed half the people in the amphitheater but the fellow in the skeleton suit refused everything with comic vehemence and finally lay stiff and still in the dirt of the racetrack his underlings picked him up and hauled him away the audience didnt quite know what to make of that show j either most of them sat on their hands a few roared laughter a couple of shouts of blasphemy rang out krispos got up and walked over to oxeites the patriarch who sat a few yards down the spine from his own place blasphemy he asked where is the blasphemyfor that matter where is the pointin refusing food most holy sir or does the blasphemy lie in mocking that refusal your majesty i do not know the patriarch sounded worried to admit it well he might if he could not untie a theological knot who in videssos the city could all the performers in the professional mime troupes were male it wasnt that way in peasant villages like the one where krispos had grown up he smiled to remember the village women and girls doing wicked impressions of their husbands and brothers but the fellow who played a woman in the next troupe seemed so feminine and so voluptuous that the avtokrator who knew perfectly well what he was found lubricious thoughts prancing through his mind all the same the performer turned hisor herwiles on another member of the troupe one dressed in a robe of priestly blue the cleric proved slaveringly eager to oblige the crowd howled laughter no one yelled blasphemy krispos turned to oxeites again he contented himself with raising a questioning eyebrow if he spoke from the emperors seat the whole amphitheater would hear him oxeites coughed in embarrassment there was your majesty an ah unfortunate incident concerning celibacy while you were ah on campaign krispos walked over to the patriarchs chair so he could talk without being overheard i saw no written reports on this most holy sir did you think it would escape my notice if so do not make such a mistake again when a priest drags the reputation of the temples through the bathhouses i will find out about it have i made myself clear enough yyes your majesty the patriarch was as pale as the pearls that ran riot over his regalia keeping unsavory secrets secret was part of the game of videssian bureaucracy secular and ecclesiastical alike getting found out meant youd lost a round in that game the avtokrator began to hope the mimes poke fun at him as they might would largely forget phostis kidnapping that hope lasted until the next troupe came on and lampooned him for misplacing his eldest son by the way the actor in fancy robes portrayed krispos his heir might have been a gold coin that had fallen through a hole in his belt pouch the fellow kept looking behind prop bushes and under stones as if certain hed turn up the vanished heir in a moment the audience thought it all very funny krispos looked over to see how his other two sons were taking the mimes hed seldom seen such rage on katakolons face his youngest son seemed ready to grab a bow and do his best to slaughter the whole troupe the pretty girl next to katakolon had her face carefully blank as if she wanted to laugh but didnt dare a few seats away evripos was laughing as hard as some tinker up near the top row of the amphitheater he happened to catch krispos eye he choked and grew sober as abruptly as if hed been caught in some unnatural act krispos nodded grimly as if to say evripos had better keep himself quiet he knew his second son hungered for the throne in evripos shoes he would have hungered for it too but displaying exultation because his brother had disappeared would not do by the time the last troupe made its bows and left the amphitheater the years shortest day was almost done by then several troupes had satirized phostis kidnapping krispos endured it as best he could evripos sat so still he might have been carved from stone to end the show krispos spoke to the crowd tomorrow the sun will come sooner and leave the sky later once again skotos he spat in rejection of the evil god has failed to steal the light may phos bless you all and may your days also be long and filled with light the crowd cheered almost universally forgetting theyd giggled at the avtokrators expense bare minutes before that was the way of crowds krispos knew hed started learning how to manipulate the videssian mob while still a groom in petronas service to help push out anthimos thenvestiarios so he could take the eunuchs place the decades that had passed since had done little to increase his respect for the people in a collective body he got up from the emperors seat and took a few steps away from the acoustical focus only then could he privately talk aloud even to himself well its over he said hed got through it his family had got through it and he didnt think any of the skits had done him permanent harm given the way the preceding few months had gone he could hardly have hoped for better twilight deepened quickly as in the company of parasol bearers and haloga bodyguards he made his way out of the amphitheater he of course had his own special exit had he wanted to he could have gone straight back to the palaces under a covered way but walking through the plaza of palamas as he had on the way to the mime show in the amphitheater gave him a chance to finger the pulse of the city ceremonial separated him from his subjects too much as things were when he got a chance like this he took it and so he headed back toward the imperial residence through the square more bonfires burned there now than had when he went into the amphitheater people coming out of the mime show queued up to jump over them and burn away the years accumulated misfortune a few turned their heads as the emperor and his retinue went by one or two even called out joy on the day your majesty and to you and yours he called back on impulse he added may i beg to steal a place in line men and women scrambled out of the way to give him what hed asked for some of the halogai stayed close by him others knowing videssian ways hurried to the far side of the fire krispos took a running start the scarlet imperial boots were less than perfect footgear for running but he managed leaping with all his strength he yelled burn illluck as he soared over and through the flames maybe as hed said earlier in the day it would do no good but how could it do harm he landed heavily staggering one of the guardsmen grabbed his arm and steadied him thanks he said his heart pounded his breath came quick a run and a jumpwas that exerting himself when he first took the throne hed have laughed at the idea now it seemed less funny he shrugged the only alternative to getting older was not getting any older this wasnt perfect but it was better a couple of bonfires over a young man stooped to ignite a torch he waved it over his head sparks flew through the night the young man weaved among slowermoving people in the square still waving his torch he shouted the gleaming path phos bless the gleaming path for a moment the cry did not register with krispos then he stopped in midstride stared and pointed toward the young man that is a thanasiot arrest him thinking back afterward he realized he could have handled things better some of his guards dashed after the thanasiot so did some people in the crowd others mistaking krispos target chased the wrong manseveral wrong menand got in the way of those pursuing the right one shouts and fistfights erupted the young heretic kept right on running and kept right on chanting the thanasiot war cry to krispos horror he cast his torch into one of the woodandcanvas market stalls that were closed for the midwinters day celebration flames clung and began to grow all at once krispos a lump of ice in his belly wished the holiday had seen a blizzard or better yet a driving rainstorm rain in the westlands when i didn t want it he thought wildly but none now when i can really use it the weather was not playing fair neither were the thanasioi that first arsonist no longer obvious for what he was as soon as hed thrown his torch vanished into the crowd but others of his kind dashed here and there waving torches and yelling acclaim for the gleaming path in fewer than half a dozen minutes more than half a dozen fires began to burn the people in the plaza of palamas surged like the sea in storm some toward the blazes but many more away from them fire in videssos the cityfire in any townwas a great terror for the means of fighting it were so pitifully few great fires with winds whipping walls of flame ahead of them had slain thousands and burned out whole quarters of the city most of thoseall of them as far as krispos knewsprang from lightning or accident to use fire in a cityin the cityas a weapon krispos shivered the thanasioi were not playing fair either he tried to pull himself together bucket and siphon men he yelled to one of the chamberlain fetch them on the double aye your majesty the eunuch pelted into the palace compound a company of firemen was stationed there attached to the imperial guards several other companies had bases in other parts of the city they were brave they were skilled they were even useful if they could get to a fire before it went wild but if the thanasioi were throwing torches around in the forum of the ox as well as the plaza of palamas and in the coppersmiths district and over by the high temple some of those blazes would surely get loose krispos shouted twenty goldpieces for every arsonist slain fifty for every one taken alive with luck the price differential would keep cutthroats from murdering innocent bystanders and then claiming a reward will you retire to the palaces your majesty barsymes asked no krispos saw hed surprised the vestiarios he explained i want to be seen fighting this madness ill do it from the plaza here as you say your majesty barsymes answered in the peculiarly toneless voice he used when he thought krispos was making a mistake before long krispos too wondered if he hadnt made a mistake messengers who ran to the palaces didnt find him there because of that he learned later than he should have that not only arson but also fullscale rioting had broken out in some of the poorer districts of the city the two went hand in hand in every avtokrators nightmares arson might leave him without a capital to rule while riots could keep him from ruling at all but setting up his headquarters out where the people could see him had advantages too not only did he shout for men to form a bucket brigade from the nearest fountain he pitched in and passed buckets himself this is my city as well as yours he told anyone who would listen we all have to work together to save it if we can for a while that looked anything but certain a bucket brigade was hopelessly inadequate to put out a fire once it got going even if some excited citizens didnt know that much krispos did at his direction the fellows at the far end of the brigade concentrated on wetting down the buildings and market stalls around the growing blaze to try to keep it from spreading he was beginning to think even that would be beyond their power when someone yelled heres the fire company oh phos be praised krispos panted already his shoulders ached from unaccustomed exertion tomorrow he suspected he would be stiff and sore all over well hed worry about that tomorrow tonight fighting the fire counted for more he silently thanked the good god that while hed put on weight since he came to the throne he hadnt got so fat as to kill himself if he had to do physical labor instead of a hand bucket the fire crew carried a great wooden tub on poles like those of a sedan chair they filled it at the fountain thenwith shouts of gangwaydashed to the fire instead of dumping the big bucket on the blaze two of the men worked a hand pump mounted in the bucket while a third directed the stream of water that issued from the nozzle of an oiled canvas hose the bucket brigade shifted its efforts to keeping the tub full even so it emptied faster than they could pour water into it the firemen snatched it up by its cradle filled it at the fountain again then lugged it back with much swearing and grunting the pumpers worked like men possessed the fellow at the hose a grayhaired veteran named thokyodes played his stream right at the heart of the blaze that second tubful began to give the fire company the upper hand the blaze had eaten two or three stalls and damaged a couple of others but it would not turn into a conflagration thokyodes came over to krispos and greeted him with a crisp military salute clenched fist over heart you called us in good time your majesty weve managed to save this lot not the first service youve done the cityor me krispos answered thokyodes had served on the fire crews for longer than krispos had been emperor i wish i could tell you to stand easy the rest of the night but i fear well have more fires set ah well midwinters day is always a nervous time for us thokyodes stopped staring at the avtokrator set did you say this wasnt just one of the bonfires blowing embers that caught i wish it had been krispos said but no no such luck the thanasioi are raising riot and when they riot they seem to like to burn too the less anyone has the better theyre pleased thokyodes made a horrible face theyre fornicating crazy begging your pardon your majesty those bastards ever see anybody whos burned to death they ever smelled a burned corpse they ever try rebuilding whats been burned down i dont think they care about any of that all they want is to get out of the material world as fast as they can send em on to me then thokyodes growled he carried a hatchet at his belt to break down a wall so he could use his siphon or break through a door if he needed to effect a rescue now he grabbed the oak handle as if he had something else in mind for the tool aye ill send em on to the ice real soon i will by the good god start their own fires will they like any fireman he had a fierce roaring hatred for arsonists of any sort religious or secular a messenger came up to krispos blood ran down his face from a scalp wound when krispos exclaimed over it the man shook off his concern ill live your majesty the rock glanced off and my father always told me i had a hard head glad the old man was right but im here to tell you its getting worse than just riots in the poor part of town south of middle street its regular wartheyre fighting with everything they have not just rocks like what got me but bows and shortswords and i dont know what all else do you know where the barracks are in the palace compound and can you get there without falling over krispos asked when he got nods to both questions he went on rout out noetos regiment of regulars if the thanasioi want to pretend theyre soldiers lets see how well they do facing soldiers instead of the city watch aye your majesty the messenger said you ought to send some priests out too for the heretics have one at their head leatherlunged bluerobe name ofi thinkdigenis krispos frowned while he knew hed heard the name before he needed a little while to place it when he did he snarled something that made the messengers eyes widen thats the bluerobe phostis fell in love with before he got kidnapped he ground out if hes a thanasiot he stopped if digenis was a thanasiot did that mean phostis had joined the heresy too thinking so appalled krispos but he also realized that just about everything he did appalled phostis if for no other reason than because he did it and if his eldest had become a thanasiot had he really been kidnapped at all or had he run off to join the rebels of his own free will one way or another krispos had to have answers he said pass the worda hundred goldpieces for this digenis alive and may the lord with the great and good mind have mercy on anyone who slays him for ill have none ill make your wishesyour commandsknown your majesty the messenger took off at a dead run krispos had no time to brood on the fellows news two men dashed into the plaza of palamas from different directions each screaming fire at the top of his lungs thokyodes krispos yelled the veteran asked both panicky men a few sharp questions decided whose plight was more urgent and went off with that fellow the other man stamped his feet and looked about ready to burst krispos hoped he wouldnt lose all that he owned by the time the fire company got back a bitterly cold wind began to blow out of the northwest the direction from which the winter storms came krispos would have welcomed one of those storms but bright stars glittered in a blueblack sky no storm tonight maybe he thought tasting the wind no storm tomorrow either of course not he needed one some of the palace servitors scurried about the plaza of palamas setting up awnings to protect him from whatever weather might come since hed decided to make his headquarters here the servants would see that he had such comforts as they could provide barsymes eyed him daring him to make something of it he kept quiet along with the servitors people of every sort swarmed through the plazasoldiers messengers firemen and revelers determined to celebrate midwinters day as they pleased no matter what was going on around them the skinny fellow in the dark tunic didnt look the least out of place as he worked his way up to krispos when he got to within a couple of paces of the avtokrator he pulled out a dagger and screamed phos bless the gleaming path he stabbed overhand which was less than wise krispos threw up a hand and caught the fellows wrist before the knife struck home the wouldbe assassin twisted and tried to break free screaming all the while about the gleaming path but krispos had learned to wrestle from an army veteran about the time his beard began to sprout and he had gained his first fame in videssos the city by outgrappling a kubrati champion shouting and twisting were not nearly enough to break away from him he bore the knifeman to the cobbles squeezing hard on the tendons inside his wrist involuntarily the thanasiots hand opened when the knife fell out the fellow tried to roll and grab for it krispos brought up a knee hard between his legs it was unsporting but extremely effective the fellow stopped screaming about the gleaming path and started screaming in good earnest a halogas axe came down with a meaty thunk the screams rose to a brief high note then stopped krispos scrambled to his feet to keep his robes from soaking up the quickly spreading pool of blood id like to have asked him some questions he said mildly honh the bodyguard answered a northern exclamation full of contempt he attacked you your majesty he did not deserve to live even for a moment all right trygve krispos said if he criticized the northerner too harshly trygve was liable to decide the knifeman had managed to come so close to the emperor because of his own failing and slay himself to make up for it the halogai were wonderful guards but they had to be handled very differently from videssians krispos had spent twenty years groping toward an understanding of their gloomy pride given another twenty he thought he might come close thokyodes and his fire company returned to the plaza of palamas the fellow whose earlier plea theyd rejected fell on them like a starving bear without so much as a chance to draw breath they hurried away in his wake krispos wondered if theyd find anything left to save from out of the palace complex their armor clashing about them marched the troops who had served as krispos rear guard in the illfated western campaign they looked angry first at being confined to barracks on midwinters day and then at getting called out not to celebrate but to fight as they grimly tramped through the plaza of palamas krispos reflected that he wouldnt have cared to get in their way this evening a few minutes later the noise floating into the square from the rest of the city suddenly redoubled it did not sound like happy noise happy was the grunt that came from trygves throat your soldiers they go breaking heads to him the prospect seemed blissful krispos watched the stars wheel slowly across the sky he caught himself yawning though he was far more likely than most videssians to stay up well into the nightwho after all could better afford candles than the avtokratorhe still went to bed early by choice well tonight he had no choice a trooper came back to report on the fighting south of middle street he didnt seem to notice his iron pot of a helmet had been knocked sideways on his head saluting he confirmed the headgears mute testimony your majesty them whoresons is putting up a regular battle they is theys been ready for it awhile too or i miss my guess dont tell me theyre beating the regiment krispos exclaimed youd better not tell me that he thought or some of my officers wont be officers by this hour of the night tomorrow but the trooper shook his head oh nothing like that they has spunk aye and more stay to em than id have looked for from a mob but they aint got armor and they aint got many shields we can hurt them a lot more than they can hurt us tell noetos to do what he has to do to put them down krispos said remind him also to make every effort to seize the priest digenis who ive heard is leading the rioters aye theres a bluerobe flouncing about shouting all sorts of daft nonsense i figures wed just knock him over the head krispos winced somehow rumor seemed to spread every word but the one he wanted spread but if you want him took alive well try and manage that theres a reward krispos said which made the messenger hurry back toward the brawl waiting was hard krispos would much rather have been with a fire company or the regiment of soldiers they were actually doing something but if he did it with them hed lose track of how all his forces in the city were doing save only the one he was with sometimes standing back to look at the whole mosaic was better than walking right up to it and peering closely at one tile better maybe but not easier without his noticing the servitors had fetched cots from the imperial residenceor perhaps from a barracksand set them under the awning theyd erected evripos dozed on one katakolon on another the girl whod come to the amphitheater with him was gone krispos knew his son would sooner have been in her bed than the one he occupied but he felt a certain amount of amused relief that katakolon hadnt dared leave the boy knew better than that by the good god glancing over at evripos krispos was surprised at how badly he wanted to wake him and put him to work the ladno evripos had shown himself the fair beginnings of a mancould have given him another pair of eyes another pair of hands but krispos let him sleep even though the fires in the plaza of palamas were long since extinguished krispos smelled smoke from time to time wafted from blazes elsewhere in the city the wind fortunately had died down with luck it would not spread flames and embers in one of those running fires that left whole quarters bare behind them rebuilding after one like that took years krispos sat down on his cot just for a few minutes he told himself he dimly remembered leaning over sideways but didnt know hed fallen asleep until someone yelled your majesty wake up your majesty wuzzat i am awake krispos said indignantly but the gluey taste in his mouth and the glue that kept trying to stick his eyelids together gave him the lie well im awake now he amended whats toward weve nailed digenis your majesty the messenger told him had a couple of lads hurt in the doing but hes in our hands theres welcome news at last by the lord with the great and good mind krispos breathed with it he really did come all the way awake he must have been out for two hours or so the buildings to the southeast were silhouetted against the first gray glow of morning twilight when he got to his feet twinges in the small of his back and one shoulder announced how awkwardly hed rested that wouldnt have happened in his younger days but it happened now were bringing the bastardbegging your pardon for speaking so of a priest your majesty but hes a right bastard if ever there was oneanyhow were bringing him back here to the plaza the messenger said where will you want him after that in the freezingest icepit of skotos hell krispos said which jerked a startled laugh from the soldier whod carried him the news the avtokrator thought fast he shouldnt come here anywaytoo much chance of his getting loose head up middle streethell be coming that way yesand tell the men to haul him to the government office building there and secure him in one of the underground gaol cells ill be there directly myself pausing only long enough to return the messengers salute krispos shook katakolon awake and ordered him to fetch zaidas to the government office building what why asked katakolon whod slept through the messengers arrival his eyes went wide when his father explained haloga officers booted their men back to consciousness to guard krispos on the way down middle street with his usual quiet efficiency barsymeswho probably had not slept at allstarted spreading word of where the avtokrator would be so any sudden urgent word could quickly reach him the government office building was a granite pile of no particular loveliness it housed bureaucrats of station insufficiently exalted to labor in the palaces records of antiquity great enough that they were not constantly consulted and belowground prisoners who rated more than a fine but less than the headsman it looked like a fortress in seditions past it had served as one todays riot though did not lap around it some of the halogai deployed at the doorway in case trouble should approach others accompanied krispos into the entry hall which was quiet and but for their torches dark krispos took the stairway down noise and light and strong odors of torch smoke stale food and unwashed humanity greeted him on the first basement floor the prison guards hailed him with salutes and welcoming shoutshis coming was enough out of the ordinary to make their labor seem worthwhile again a senior guard said the one youre after your majesty theyre holding him in cell number twelve down that hallway there the wine on his breath added a new note to the symphony of smells it being the morning after midwinters day krispos gave no sign he noticed but made a mental note to check whether the fellow drank on duty other days as well instead of the usual iron grillwork cell number twelve had a stout door with a locked bar on the outside the gaoler inserted a big brass key twisted and swung the bar out of the avtokrators way flanked by a pair of halogai krispos went in a couple of soldiers from noetos regiment already stood guard over digenis who wrists tied behind him and ankles bound lay on a straw pallet that had seen better years haul him to his feet krispos said roughly the guard obeyed blood ran down digenis face from a small scalp wound those always bled badly and being a priest digenis had no hair to shield his pate from a blow he glared defiance at krispos krispos glared back wheres phostis wretch phos willing he walks the gleaming path digenis answered and i think phos may well be willing your son knows truth when he hears it more than i can say for you if you follow the thanasiot lies krispos snapped now where is he i dont know digenis said and if i did id not tell you thats certain whats certain is that your head will go up on the milestone as belonging to a proved traitor krispos said caught in open revolt dont think youll escape because you wear the blue robe wealth is worth revolting against and i dont fear the headsman because i know the gleaming path will lead me straight to the lord with the great and good mind digenis said but i could be as innocent as any man the temples revere as holy and still die of your malice for the patriarch far from being the true leader of the ecclesiastical hierarchy is but your puppet mouthing your impious words stripped of the venom with which he spoke them digenis words held a certain amount of truth if oxeites turned against krispos he would soon find himself out of the ecumenical patriarchs blue boots but none of that mattered not here not now youre captured for no ecclesiastical offense sirrah but for the purely secular crimes of rebellion and treason youll answer for them as any other rebel would ill sing hymns to phos thanking you for freeing me from the stenchfilled world that strives unceasingly to seduce and corrupt my soul digenis said but if you do not travel the gleaming path yourself no hymns of mine will save you youll go to the ice and suffer for all eternity lured to destruction by skotos honied wiles given a choice between sharing heaven with you and hell with skotos i believe id take skotos krispos said he at least does not pretend to virtues he lacks digenis hissed like a viper and spat at krispos whether to ward off the dark gods name or from simple hatred the avtokrator could not have said just then zaidas came into the cell hello he said whats all this he set down the carpetbag in his left hand this krispos said is the miserable excuse for a priest who sucked my son into the slimy arms of the thanasioi wring what you can from the cesspit he calls a mind i shall of course make every effort your majesty but zaidas voice trailed away he looked doubtful an expression krispos was unused to seeing on his face i fear ive not had the best of luck probing for the heretics secrets you goldlovers are the heretics digenis said casting aside true piety for the sake of profit emperor and wizard both ignored him do your best krispos said he hoped zaidas would have better fortune with digenis than he had with other thanasiot prisoners or with learning what sort of magic screened him away from finding phostis despite the rare sorcerous tools and rarer scrolls and codices in the sorcerers collegium the chief wizard had been unable to learn why he was unable to seek phostis out by sorcery zaidas started pulling sorcerous gear from the bag ill try the twomirror test your majesty he said krispos wanted to hear confidence in his voice wanted to hear him say he would have the truth out of digenis no matter what the renegade priest did what he heard with ears honed by listening behind the words of thousands of petitioners officers and officials was doubt doubt from zaidas fed his own doubt because magic drew so strongly from the power of belief if zaidas didnt truly believe he could make digenis speak hed likely fail hed already failed on a thanasiot with the twomirror test what other strings do you have to your bow the emperor asked how else can we hope to pull answers from him he could hear his own delicacy of phrase he wanted zaidas to think about alternatives but didnt want to demoralize the mage or suggest hed lost faith in him even if he had zaidas said should the twomirror test fail our strongest hope of learning truth goes with it oh a decoction of henbane and other herbs such as the healers use might loosen this rascals tongue but with it hed spew as much gibberish as fact one way or another hell spew by the good god krispos said grimly if not to you then to the chap in the red leathers torment my flesh as you will digenis said it is but the excrement of my being the sooner it slides down the sewer the sooner my soul soars past the sun to be with the lord with the great and good mind go on krispos told zaidas worry on his face the wizard set up his mirrors one in front of digenis the other behind him he got a brazier going clouds of fumigants rose in front of the mirrors some sweet some harsh but when the questioning began not only did digenis stand mute so did his image in the mirror behind him had the spell been working as it should have that second image would have given out truth in spite of his efforts to lie or remain silent zaidas bit his lip in angry mortified frustration krispos sucked in a long furious breath hed had the bad feeling digenis would remain impervious to interrogation of any sort the vast majority of men broke under torture maybe the priest would or maybe hed spill his guts under the influence of one of zaidas potions but krispos wasnt willing to bet on either as if to rub in his determination digenis said i shall praise phos holy name for every pang you inflict on me he began to sing a hymn at the top of his lungs oh shut up krispos said digenis kept on singing someone scratched at the door to the cell axe ready to strike a haloga pulled it open a priest started to walk in then drew back in alarm at the upraised axe blade come on come on krispos told him dont stand there ditheringjust tell me what you want may it please your majesty the priest began nervously and krispos braced for trouble the bluerobe tried again mmay it please your majesty i am soudas an attendant at the high temple the most holy ecumenical patriarch oxeites who was commemorating the day by celebrating a special liturgy there directed me to come to you on hearing that the holy priest digenis had been captured so to speak in arms and bade me remind your majesty that ecclesiastics are under all circumstances immune from suffering bodily torment oh he did oh they are krispos glared at the priest who looked as if he wished he could sink through the floor though that would only have put him in a deeper level of the jail doesnt the most holy ecumenical patriarch recall that i took the head of one of his predecessors for treason no worse than this digenis has committed if you mentioned the fate of the formerly most holy gnatiosmay phos grant his soul mercyi was instructed to point out that while capital punishment remains your province it is a matter altogether distinct from torture oh it is krispos made his glare fiercer still it all but shriveled soudas but the priest managed a shaky nod krispos dropped his scowl to his red boots could he have scowled at his own face he would have done it the part of him that weighed choices like a grocer weighing out lentils swung into action could he afford a row with the regular temple hierarchy while at the same time fighting the thanasiot heretics reluctantly he decided he could not growling like a dog that has reached the end of its chain and so cannot sink its teeth into a man it wants to bite he said very well no torture you may tell the patriarch as much generous of him to let me use my own executioners as i see fit soudas bobbed his head in what might have been a nod then wheeled about and fled digenis hadnt missed a note of his hymn krispos tried to console himself by doubting whether the renegade would have broken under torment but he craved the chance to find out the avtokrator swung toward zaidas the wizard had listened to his talk with the priest zaidas was anything but a fool he could figure out for himself that the burden on him had just grown heavier if he couldnt pry secrets from digenis those secrets would stay unknown for good the wizard licked his lips no he was not long on confidence digenis ended his hymn i care not if you go against the patriarch he said his doctrine is false in any case and i do not fear your torments krispos knew a strong temptation to break digenis on the rack to tear at his flesh with redhot pincers not so much in the hope that he would tell where phostis wasif in fact he knewbut to see if he so loudly despised torment after suffering a good deal of it krispos had enough control over himself to recognize the temptation as base and put it aside but he felt it all the same digenis not only remained defiant but actually seemed to seek out martyrdom your refusal to liberate me from my polluting and polluted envelope of flesh is but another proof of your own foul materialism your rejection of the spiritual for the sensual the soul for the penis the when you go to the ice i hope you bore skotos with your stupid maunderings krispos said a sally that succeeded in making digenis splutter in outrage and then better still shut up the emperor added ive wasted enough time on you he turned to zaidas try anything and everything you think might work bring in whatever colleagues you need to give you aid one way or another i will have answers from this one before the dark god takes him forever aye your majesty zaidas voice was low and troubled the good god willing others from the sorcerers collegium will have more success than i at smashing through his protective shell of fanaticism accompanied by his bodyguards krispos left the cell and the subterranean jail about halfway up the stairs to the entrance hall one of the halogai said forgive me majesty but may i ask if i heard the bluerobe aright did he not blame you there for failing to flay him aye thats just what he did frovin krispos answered the northerners blue eyes mirrored his confusion majesty i do not understand i do not fear hurt and gore that were unmanly but neither do i run forth and embrace them like man clasping maid nor do i krispos said a streak of martyrdom runs through some of the pious in videssos though me id sooner live for the good god than die for him spoken like a man of sense frovin said the other bodyguards rumbled approval down deep in their chests when he went outside the gray light of winter dawn was building the air smelled of smoke but with stoves fireplaces and braziers by the tens of thousands the air of videssos the city always had a smoky tang to it no great curtains of black billowed up into the lightening sky if the thanasioi had thought to burn down the city thus far theyd failed back in the plaza of palamas evripos still slept to krispos surprise he found katakolon in earnest conversation with thokyodes the fire captain if youre sure everythings out in that district why dont you get some rest his youngest son was saying you wont do us or the city any good if youre too worn to answer the next summons aye thats good advice young majesty thokyodes answered saluting well kip right out here if that suitsand if you can find us some blankets barsymes katakolon called krispos nodded approvinglykatakolon might not know where things were but he knew who would his son spotted him hello father just holding things together as best i could barsymes told me you were busy with that madman of a priest so i was i thank you for the help do we have the upper hand we seem to katakolon said more caution in his voice than krispos was used to hearing there good enough krispos said now lets see if we can keep it toward midmorning riot flared again in the quarter south of middle street the soldiers krispos had sent in the night before stayed loyal much to his relief better still the wind stayed calm which gave thokyodes crew a fighting chance against the blazes set by the heretics and riotersnot identical groups some of the brawlers arrested were out for what they reckoned piety others just for loot when messengers reported that spasm spent krispos raised cups of wine with both katakolon and evripos convinced the worst was past then another messenger arrived this one a jailer from under the government office building what now krispos asked it concerns the matter of the prisoner digenis the priest the fellow answered well what about him krispos said wishing the goaler wouldnt talk like what he was now that hed come away from the cells and into the sun your majesty he has refused alimentation the man declared krispos upraised eyebrow warned him hed better talk straighter than that he did try your majesty he wont eat his victuals he declares his intention to starve himself to death for the first time since he grew old enough to jump over a bonfire instead of falling into one phostis did no leaping on midwinters day whatever illluck hed accumulated over the past year remained unburned he wasnt mewed up in his monklike cell in the keep of etchmiadzin hed been allowed out and about for some weeks but no fires blazed on street corners anywhere in the town dark streets on midwinters day struck him as unnatural even while he accompanied olyvria andinevitably syagrios to one of etchmiadzins temples the service was timed for sunset which came early not only became this was the shortest day of the year but also because the sun instead of descending to a smooth horizon disappeared behind the mountains to the west night came down like an avalanche inside the temple whose strong blocky architecture spoke of vaspurakaner builders darkness seemed absolute the thanasio unlike the orthodox did not celebrate the light on midwinters day but rather confronted their fear of the dark not a torch not a candle burned inside the temple standing there in the midst of blackness phostis peered about trying to see something anything for all the good his eyes did he might as well have been blindfolded again his shiver had nothing to do with the cold that filled the temple along with night never had the menace of skotos seemed so real so close seeking assurance where sight gave none he reached out and clasped olyvrias hand in his own she squeezed back hard he wondered if this eerie silent ritual was as hard on her on all the thanasioi as it was on him someone will start screaming soon he whispered not least to keep himself from becoming that someone his breathless voice seemed to echo through the temple though he knew even olyvria could hardly hear him yes she whispered back it happens sometimes i remember when he didnt find out what she remembered her words were lost in a great exhalation of relief from the whole congregation a priest carrying a single candle strode up the aisle toward the altar every eye swung toward that glowing point as if drawn by a lodestone we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind the priest intoned and everyone in the temple joined in the creed with greater fervor than phostis had ever known by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor the congregations amens came echoing back from the conical dome that surmounted the altar often to phostis phos creed had become mere words to be quickly gabbled through without thinking on what they meant not now in the cold and frightening dark they like the tiny flame from the candle the priest held on high took on new meaning new importance if they were not if light was notwhat then only black only ice phostis shivered again the priest moved the candle to and fro and said here is the soul adrift in a creation not its own the sole light floating on an ocean of darkness it moves here it moves there always surrounded bythings coming out of the gloom that prevailed even at the altar the word had a frightening power but the soul is not athing the priest went on the soul is a spark from the infinite torch of phos trapped in a world made by the foe of sparks and the greater foe of greater sparks the things that surround us distract us from the pursuit of goodness holiness and piety which are all that truly matter for our souls endure forever and will be judged forever shall we then turn toward that which does not endure food turns to dung fire to ash fine raiment to rags our bodies to stench and bones and then to dust what boots it then whether we gorge on sweetmeats toast our homes till we sweat in the midst of winter drape ourselves with silks and furs or twitch to the brief deluded passionsmiscalled pleasuresthat spring from the organs we better use to void ourselves of dross contemplating infinite judgment contemplating infinite punishment for the sins he like any mortal had surely committed made phostis want to tear his grip free from olyvrias anything involving base matter in any way was surely evil surely sufficient to cast him down to the ice forevermore but olyvria clung to him harder than she had before maybe he told himself she needed comfort and reassurance granting her that spiritual boon might outweigh his guilt for noticing how warm and smooth her skin was he did not let go of her hand the priest said each year the lord with the great and good mind warns us we cannot presume his mercy will endure forever each year all through fall phos sun sinks lower in the sky each year our prayers call it back to rise higher once more to grant warmth and light even to the wicked figments of reality that spring from the dark heart of skotos but beware no mercy not even the good gods endures forever phos may yet sicken on our great glut of sins one yearmaybe one year not far from now given the wretched state of mankind maybe even next year maybe even this yearone year i say the sun may not turn back toward the north the day after midwinters day but rather go on sinking ever southward sinking until only a little crimson twilight remains on the horizon and thennothing no light no hope no blessings forever no someone wailed in an instant the whole congregation took up the cry among the rest was olyvria her voice clear and strong among them after a moment was phostis himself the priest had a gift for instilling fright among them even was syagrios phostis hadnt thought the ruffian respected phos or feared skotos through all the outcry olyvrias fingers remained laced with his he didnt really think about that he just accepted it gratefully instead of feeling alone in the cold blackness that could have come straight from skotos he was reminded others fought the dark with him he needed that reminder never in all his years of worshiping at the high temple had he known such fear of the dark god the priest said with fasting and lamentation we may yet show phos that despite our failings despite the corruption that springs from the bodies in which we dwell we remain worthy of the sign of his light for yet another year that we may advance farther down the gleaming path praised by the holy thanasios pray now and let the lord with the great and good mind know what is in your hearts if before the temple had echoed to the shouts of the congregation now even louder it was filled with the worshipers prayers phostis went up with the rest in the riches and light of the high temple it was easy to believe along with the ecumenical patriarch and his plump contented votaries that phos would surely vanquish skotos at the end of days such sublime confidence was harder to maintain in the dark of a chilly temple with a priest preaching of light draining out of the world like water from a tub at first all phostis heard was the din of people at noisy prayer then little by little he noticed individual voices in the din some repeated phos creed over and over videssos universal prayer prevailed among thanasioi and their foes alike others sent up simple requests give us light bless my wife with a son this year o phos make me more pious and less lustful heal my mothers sores which no salve has aided prayers like those would not have seemed out of place back in the high temple others though had a different ring to them destroy everything that stands in our way to the ice with those who will not walk the gleaming path o phos grant me the courage to cast aside the body that befouls my soul wreck them all wreck them all wreck them all he did not care for those they might have come from the throats of baying wolves rather than men but before he could do more than notice them the priest at the altar raised a hand any motion within his candles tiny circle of light was astoundingly noticeable the congregation fell silent at once and with it phostis concerns the priest said prayer alone does not suffice we do not walk the gleaming path with our tongues the road that leads beyond the sun is paved with deeds not words go forth now and live as thanasios would have had you live seek phos blessings in hunger and want not the luxuries of this world that are but a single beat of a gnats wings against the judgment yet to come go forth this liturgy is ended no sooner had he spoken than acolytes bearing torches came into the worship area from the narthex to light the congregants way out phostis blinked his eyes filled with tears at what seemed the savage glare though a moment later he realized it was not so bright after all hed dropped olyvrias hand the instant the acolytes enteredor perhaps shed dropped his in more light than a single candle flame he dared not risk angering syagrios and even more to the point angering livanios then palace calculation surged forward unbidden in his mind would livanios throw his daughter at the heir apparent to the throne did he seek influence through the marriage bed phostis filed that away for future consideration but no matter what livanios intended the feel of olyvrias hand in his had been the only warmth hed known physical or spiritual through the thanasiot service hed thought the temples interior cold and so it had been but there at least some hundreds of people crowded together had given a measure albeit a small one of animal warmth out on the nightblack streets of etchmiadzin with the wind whipping knifelike down from the hills phostis rediscovered what true cold meant the heavy wool cloak he wore might have been made of lace for all the good it did to keep off the wind even syagrios hissed as the blast struck him by the good god he muttered id not mind jumping over a bonfire tonight or even into one just so as i could get warm youre right the words were out of phostis mouth before he remembered to be surprised at agreeing with syagrios about anything fires and displays are not the way of the gleaming path olyvria said i remember them too from the days before my father accepted thanasios way he says its better to make your soul safe than to worry about what happens to your body the priest in the temple had said the same from him it sank deep into phostis heart from livanios even through olyvria as intermediary the words did not mean as much the heresiarch mouthed thanasiot slogans but did he live by them as far as phostis could see he remained sleek well fed and worldly hypocrite the word tolled like a warning bell on a rocky coast hypocrisy was the crime of which phostis had in his mind convicted his father most of the capitals nobles the ecumenical patriarch and most of the clergy as well the quest for unvarnished truth was what had drawn him to the thanasioi in the first place finding livanios anything but unvarnished made him doubt the perfection of the gleaming path he said i wouldnt mind seeing the time of the sunturning as one of rejoicing as well as sorrow after all it does ensure life for another year but life in the world means life in things which are skotos olyvria said wheres to rejoice over that if it werent for material things life would come to an end and so would mankind phostis countered is that what you want to fade away and vanish not for myself olyvrias shiver like phostis back in the temple had little to do with the weather but there are those who do want exactly that youll see some of them soon i think theyre daft if you ask me syagrios said though his voice lacked its usual biting edge we live in this world along with the next one olyvria argued that if there was one thing videssians would do at any excuse or none it was argue theology phostis kept out of the argument not least because he inclined to syagrios side of it and did not want to offend olyvria by saying so out loud the memory of her hand remained printed in his mind it called up that other memory he had of her the one from the chamber off the passageway under digenis temple back in the city that latter memory was suited for midwinters day at least as hed known it before it was a time of festival even of license as the proverb put it anything can happen on midwinters day had this been a holiday of the sort with which he was familiar he mightsomewhere down deep in him in a place below words he knew he wouldhave tried to get her off by herself and he suspected she would have gone with him even if only for the one night but here in etchmiadzin seeking sensual pleasure on midwinters day did not bear thinking about rejection was the mildest return he could expect more likely was some sort of mortification of his flesh though he had increasing respect for the asceticism of the gleaming path his flesh had lately suffered enough mortification to suit him besides syagrios would make a eunuch of himand enjoy doing itif he got himself into trouble of that sort the ruffian broke off his disputation with olyvria saying however you care to have it my lady you know more about this business than me thats for sure all i know now is that this here poor old smashed nose of mine is going to freeze off if i dont get to somewheres with a fire there i cannot disagree with you olyvria said lets us head back to the keep then syagrios suggested itll be warmwell warmerin there sides i can dump his majestyhood here back in his room and get me a chance to relax a bit to the ice with you syagrios the thought stood pure and crystalline in the center of phostis mind he wanted to scream it only a healthy regard for his own continued survival kept him from screaming it he was then at most an imperfect thanasiot like olyvria he remained enamored of the fleshly envelope his soul wore no matter what the source of that flesh the narrow muddy lanes of etchmiadzin were almost preternaturally dark night travel in videssos the city was undertaken with torchbearers and guards if for any legitimate purpose only footpads there cherished the black of night but no one in etchmiadzin tonight carried a light or seemed concerned over becoming a robbers victim cries rose into the dark sky but they were only the lamentations the priest had commanded of his congregants the bulk of the fortress and the stars it obscured helped mark the path back from the temple even the torches above the gates were out livanios went that far in adhering to the tenets of the thanasioi syagrios grumbled under his breath dont like that he said just anybody could come wandering in and whod be the wiser till too late whos in the town save our own folk and a few vaspurakaners olyvria said they have their own rites and leave ours alone theyd better syagrios replied more of us than there is of them only inside the keep did light return livanios caftanwearing advisor sat at a table gnawing the leg of a roasted fowl and whistling a cheery tune phostis did not know if hed heard the order for fasting and lamentation he was doing a good job of ignoring it syagrios lit a candle from a torch set in a sootblackened sconce with it in one hand and his knife in the other he urged phostis up the spiral stairway back to your room now he said phostis barely had time to nod to olyvria before the twist of the stairs made her disappear the corridor that led to his little chamber was midnight black he turned to syagrios pointing at the candle may i light a lamp in my room from that not tonight syagrios said i got to watch you instead of roisterin so you get no more enjoyment than me once inside phostis drew off his cloak and put it over the blanket on his pallet he did not take off his tunic as he got under them both and huddled up in a ball to try to warm himself as fast as he could he looked back toward the door beyond which syagrios surely lurked roistering is it he whispered he might be a poor thanasiot himself but he knew a worse one vii the mans eyes twitched back and forth in their sockets it was like no motion phostis had ever seen before watching made him queasy voice calm but weak the man said i cant see you not really but thats all right it goes away in a few days im told by those who have come this way before me thats ggood phostis knew he sounded shaky it shamed him but he couldnt help it fear not the man said hed been introduced to phostis as strabon he smiled radiantly soon i know i shall join the lord with the great and good mind and cast aside this flesh that has too long weighed me down strabon had phostis thought already cast aside almost all of his flesh his face was a skull covered with skin his neck seemed hardly thicker than a torch withered branches might have done for his arms and claws for his hands not only had he no fat left on his bones he had no muscle either he was bone and tendon and skin nothing more no one more thing the joy that lit his blind eyes soon he repeated its been six weeks a few days over since last i polluted my soul with aliment only a man who was fat to begin with will last much above eight and never was i in the habit of glutting myself soon i shall fare beyond the sun and look on phos face to face soon doesdoes it hurt phostis asked beside him olyvria sat calmly shed seen these human skeletons before often enough so now she was easy with the husk of strabon syagrios had not come into the hut phostis heard him pacing around outside the door strabon said no boy no as i told you fear not oh my belly panged in the early days ill not deny as skotos part of me realized i had determined to cut my essential self free of it but no i feel no pain only longing to be free he smiled again save for the faintest tinge of pink his lips were invisible but to linger so phostis shook his head though he knew strabon could not see that then he blurted could you not also have refused water and so made a quicker end of it the corners of strabons gash of a mouth turned down some of those who are most holy do as you say sinner that i am i had not the fortitude for it phostis stared at him never in his comfortable life back at the palaces had he dreamed hed be talking with a man in the last stages of deliberately starving himself to death even if he had dreamed that could he have imagined the man would reproach himself for lack of fortitude no impossible the lids fell over strabons twitching eyes he seemed to doze is he not a miracle of piety olyvria whispered well yes that he is phostis scratched his head back in videssos the city hed despised the temple hierarchy for wearing bejeweled vestments and venerating phos in temples built by riches takenstolenfrom the peasantry better hed thought a simple but strong worship one that sprang from within and demanded nothing of anyone save the single pious individual now before him he saw personified and indeed taken to an extreme hed never imagined an example of such worship he had to respect the religious impulse that had led strabon to make himself into a collection of twigs and branches but he was less sure he considered it an ideal yet such selfdestruction was implicit in thanasiot doctrine for those who had the courage to follow where logic led if the world of the senses was but a creation of skotos what course more logical than to remove ones precious and eternal soul from that swamp of evil and corruption rather hesitantly he turned toward olyvria however holy he may be id not care to imitate him granted the world is not all it might be but leaving it this way strikes me asoh i dont knowas running away from the fight against wickedness rather than joining it ah but the body itself is evil boy strabon said he hadnt been asleep after all because of that any fight is foredoomed to failure his eyes closed again olyvria spoke in a low voice for the many there may be much truth in what you say phostis as i told you back on midwinters day id not have the bravery to do as strabon does but i thought you ought to see him to celebrate and admire what the soul can do if it so wills i see it phostis said it is indeed a marvel but something to celebrate of that im less certain olyvria looked at him severely had she been standing her hands would have gone onto her hips as it was she breathed out in exasperation even the dogma you grew up with has room for asceticism and mortifying the flesh thats true he said too much care for this world and you have fat contented priests who might as well not be priests at all but now seeing strabon here i think there may be too little care for the world as well his voice fell to a whisper so he would not disturb the fitfully sleeping relic of a man this time strabon did not respond phostis listened to himself with some surprise i sound like my father he thought how many times back at the palaces had he watched and listened to krispos steering a middle course between schemes that might have proved spectacular successes or even more spectacular disasters how many times had he sneered at his father for that moderation what he does affects no one but himself olyvria said and will surely earn him eternity in communion with phos thats true phostis repeated what he does by himself affects him alone but if one man and one woman in four say decided to walk the gleaming path in his exact footprints that would affect those who declined to do so very much indeed and strabons way if i rightly understand it is the one thanasiot doctrine favors for those whose spirits let them take it yes olyvria said phostis looked from strabon to her then back again he tried to envision her features ravaged by starvation her bright eyes writhing blindly in their sockets hed never been the most imaginative of young men more often than not he felt that to be a lack it seemed a blessing now strabon coughed himself awake he tried to say something but the coughs went on and on deep wet ones that wracked the sack of bones he had become chest fever phostis whispered to olyvria she shrugged if it was he thought the thanasiot zealot might be dead by evening for how could he have any strength in his body to fight off illness olyvria stood to go phostis was far from sorry to get up with her when he no longer saw the wasted figure lying on the bed he felt more alive himself maybe that was illusion sprung from the animal part of him and from skotos he could not say but he knew he would have trouble overcoming that animal part was his soul a prisoner of his body as the thanasioi proclaimed or a partner with it he would have to think long and hard on that outside strabons hut syagrios paced up and down the muddy street whistling a tune and spitting through his uneven teeth phostis watched him grin and swagger when he tried to visualize the ruffian starving himself his thoughts ran headlong into a blank wall he simply could not see it happening syagrios was an ugly specimen but a vivid one for all that so what did you think of the boneyard he asked phostis spitting again olyvria rounded on him tight black curls flying in fury show proper respect for the pious and holy strabon she blazed why soon enough hell be dead and then itll be up to phos not to the likes of me to figure out what he deserves olyvria opened her mouth then closed it again phostis made a mental note that syagrios while indubitably uncouth was far from stupid too bad he thought aloud he said if a few people choose to make their end that way i dont see that it much matters to the world around themand as olyvria says they are pious and holy but if many decide to end their lives the empire will shake and why shouldnt the empire shake pray olyvria asked now phostis had to pause and consider an unshaken empire of videssos was almost as much of an article of faith for him as phos creed and why not for seven centuries and more videssos had given folk in a great swathe of the world reasonable peace and reasonable security true there had been disasters as when steppe nomads took advantage of videssian civil war to invade the north and east and form their own khaganates in the ruins of imperial provinces true every generation or two fought another in the long string of debilitating wars with makuran but on the whole he remained convinced life within the empire was likelier to be happy than anywhere outside it but when he said as much olyvria answered so what if life in this world is but part of skotos trap what matter if youre happy as the jaws close better then that we should be unhappy that we should recognize everything material as part of the lure that draws us down to the ice but phostis felt himself floundering suppose hmmsuppose everyone in the westlands or most people starved themselves to death like strabon what would happen after that the makuraners would march in unopposed and rule the land forever well what if they did olyvria said the pious men and women whod abandoned the world would be safe in phos heaven and the invaders would surely go to the ice when their days were done yes and the worship of phos would go out of the world for the makuraners reverence their four prophets not the good god phostis said no one who worshiped phos would be left and skotos would have the victory in this world the realm beyond the sun would gain no new recruits but the dark god would have to carve new caverns into the ice he spat in ritual rejection of skotos olyvria frowned the very tip of her tongue poked out of her mouth for a moment her voice was troubled as she said this argument has more weight than i would have looked for no it dont syagrios said with a raucous laugh the two of yous quarreling over whether youd like your cows eggs better poached or fried truth is a cow aint about to lay no eggsand whole flocks of people aint about to starve themselves to death neither come to that is either one o you ready to stop eatin yet no olyvria said quietly phostis shook his head well then syagrios said and laughed even louder but if youre not ready to leave the world behind how can you be a proper thanasiot phostis asked with the relentless logic of the young thats a bloody good question syagrios whacked phostis on the back almost hard enough to knock him sprawling into the muck that passed for a street you aint as dumb as you look kid the day was gloomy the sky an inverted bowl full of thick gray clouds the gold ring in syagrios ear glinted nonetheless in etchmiadzin he did not wear it to deceive those not of his faith for the thanasioi ruled the town but he did not take it out either syagrios to say one can be a good thanasiot only through starvation contradicts the faith as the holy thanasios set it forth which you know perfectly well olyvria sounded as if she were holding onto patience with both hands syagrios caught the warning in her voice suddenly he reverted to being a guardsman rather than an equal as you say my lady he answered had phostis told him the same thing the ruffian would have torn into him in argument and likely j with fists and booted feet as well but phostis though prisoner in etchmiadzin was not olyvrias servitor moreover he actively enjoyed theological disputation turning to olyvria he said but if you choose to live in skotos world surely you compromise with evil and compromise with evil takes you to the ice not so but not everyone is or can be suited to leaving the world of his own will olyvria said the holy thanasios teaches that those who feel they must remain in skotos realm may yet gain merit along two byroads of the gleaming path in one they may lessen the temptations of the material for themselves and for those around them those who follow that byroad would be the men your father leads phostis said olyvria nodded them among others but it is also virtuous to content yourself with simple things black bread instead of white coarse cloth rather than fine the more you do without the less you subject yourself to skotos yes i see the point phostis said slowly the more you burn and destroy also he thought but kept that to himself instead of mentioning it he asked what is the second byroad you spoke of why ministering to those who have chosen the path of greater abnegation olyvria answered by helping them as they advance along the gleaming path those who stay behind bask in their reflected piety so to speak hmm phostis said at first hearing that sounded good but after a moment he said how does that make their dealings with those of greater holiness different from any peasants dealings with a noble olyvria gave him an exasperated glare its different because the usual run of noble wallows in corruption thinking mostly of his purse and his ah member and so a peasant who serves such a man is but drawn deeper into the sensual mire but our pious heroes reject all the lures of the world and inspire others to do likewise to the degree that is in their power hmm phostis said again something to that i suppose he wondered how much a good noble of the nonthanasiot sort helped the peasants on his land get through hard times defended them against raiders if he lived near a frontier and didnt go around seducing their women phostis knew a good many nobles and knew of a good many more he wondered how maintaining ones dependents rated against the individual pursuit of piety the good god knew for certain but phostis doubted whether anyone merely human did before he could say as much a familiar figure from livanios miniature court at the keep came stamping up the street the fellow who seemed to be the heresiarchs chief wizard despite all his time in etchmiadzin phostis still had not learned the mans name now he wore a thick wool caftan with bright vertical stripes and on his head a fur cap with earflaps that might have come straight off the plains of pardraya he touched his forehead lips and chest in greeting to olyvria gave phostis a measuring stare and ignored syagrios hes going into strabons house phostis said what does he want with someone who likely wont be here two weeks from now and may riot be here tomorrow he visits everyone he can who chooses to leave the world of evil things olyvria answered i dont know why if hes as curious as most mages perhaps he seeks to learn as much as he can about the world to come while still remaining in this one maybe phostis supposed one did not cease to be a mage or a tanner or a tailor on becoming a thanasiot what is he called anyhow olyvria paused visibly before she answered syagrios stepped into the breach he doesnt like people knowin his name for fear theyll work magic with it thats silly he must not be much of a wizard then phostis said my fathers chief mage is named zaidas and he doesnt care who knows it he says if you cant protect yourself from name magic you have no business taking up sorcery in the first place not all wizards have the same ways olyvria said since that was too obviously true to require comment phostis let it go the fellow in the caftan came out of strabons house a couple of minutes later he did not look happy and was muttering under his breath not all the muttering sounded like videssian phostis wondered if he was from nearby vaspurakan of what was in the imperial language phostis caught only one phrase old bastards not ripe yet the wizard stalked away not ripe yet phostis said after hed rounded a corner not ripe for what i dont know syagrios said me i dont mess with mages or their business and i dont want them messin with me that was a sensible attitude for anyone and especially phostis thought for somebody like syagrios who was likely to be messed with by mages when said mages were on the track of objects mysteriously vanished phostis smiled at his automatic contempt for the bruiser whod become his keeper syagrios saw the smile and gave him a hard suspicious stare he did his best to look innocent which was rendered more difficult because he was guilty syagrios changed the subject hows about we go find some food standin on my pins all mornin me i could hack steaks off a donkey and eat em raw get out of here you beast out of my sight olyvria snarled her voice breaking with fury out away how dare youhow could you be so dense so blockheadedas to talk about food after weve just seen the pious strabon dedicating himself to escaping the world and advancing along the gleaming path get out no syagrios said your father told me to keep an eye on this one he pointed at phostis and that theres just what i aim to do up till then that stolid remark had been proof against anything olyvria would throw at it indeed olyvria had not tried to contest it now though she said where will he go do you think hell kidnap me i dont know and i dont care syagrios answered i just know what i got told to do well i tell you to go away i cant abide the sight or sound of you after what you just said olyvria said when he shook his head she added if you dont ill tell my father what you said just now do you want to undergo the penance youd receive for mocking the holy faith i didnt syagrios said but he seemed suddenly doubtful whether he had or he hadnt livanios was apt to believe olyvria rather than him it was most unfair all at once phostis understood why he himself had not had many friends as a boy if he ran to tell his father about a quarrel his father was the avtokrator if the avtokratoror livanios nowruled against you to whom could you appeal bitterness gusted through phostis the avtokrator in those lost boyhood days was only too likely to rule against him not for his father had never truly warmed to him from time to time he wondered what hed done wrong to make krispos find fault with everything about him he doubted hed ever find out olyvria said to syagrios go on i tell you ill be responsible for seeing phostis doesnt run out of etchmiadzin and i tell you this too if you say me nay once more youll be sorry for it all right then my lady the ruffian turned what should have been a title of respect into one of reproach on you the blame and almost i hope you end up wearing it syagrios strode off with the straight proud back of a man whos had the last word watching him go phostis felt a burden lift from his spirit as if the sun had come out to brighten a gloomy day he also had to stifle a burst of laughter in spite of having just come out of starving strabons house he was hungry since unlike strabon he was not about to waste away and die of hunger he kept that to himself he didnt want olyvria rounding on him as she had on syagrios if anything was more likely to bring back the watchdog he couldnt imagine what it might be olyvria was looking at him with a quizzical expression he realized she was left as much at a loss by syagrios departure as was he what shall we do now she asked perhaps hoping he could think of something unfortunately he couldnt i dont know he answered i really havent seen enough of etchmiadzin to know what you can do around here not much before the thanasioi took over the town and less now he guessed lets just amble about then and see where our feet take us she said thats all right with me short of a trip to the torturer anything olyvria suggested would have been all right with phostis he looked for grass to sprout in the streets flowers to burst into bloom and birds to start singing in winter all because shed managed to outbluff syagrios their feet led them to a street of dyers that the men there followed the gleaming path didnt keep their shops from smelling of stale piss just like the establishments of perfectly orthodox dyers back in videssos the city in the same way thanasiot carpenters had hands crisscrossed with scars and thanasiot bakers faces permanently reddened from peering into hot ovens it all seems soordinary phostis said after a while dull was the other word that came to mind but he suppressed it for most folk its as if being a thanasiot doesnt change much in their lives that bothered him to his way of thinking heresy and orthodoxywhichever was which in this disputeshould have been easy to tell apart at a glance but on further reflection he wondered why unless they chose strabons path out of the world the thanasioi had to make their way in it and only so many ways of doing that were possible the dyeshops probably stank of urine in mashiz too carpenters would sometimes gouge themselves with chisels and bakers would need to make sure their loaves didnt burn olyvria said the difference is the gleaming path its standing aside from the world as well as one can not thinking riches the only end in life seeking to satisfy the spirit rather than the baser impulses of the body i suppose so phostis said they walked a little farther while he ruminated on that then he said may i ask you something for all the ribbons on my cage i know im pretty much a prisoner here so i dont mean to make you angry but there is something id like to learn if giving the answer doesnt offend you olyvria turned toward him her eyes were wide with curiosity her mouth slightly open she looked very young and very lovely ask she said at once youre here to learn about the gleaming path after all how will you learn if you dont ask all right i will phostis thought for a little while the question he had in mind needed to be framed carefully at last he said in the room in the tunnel under digenis temple what you said there aha olyvria stuck out her tongue at him i thought it would be something about that just from the way you went all around it like a man feeling for a goldpiece in the middle of a nettle patch phostis felt his face heat by the way olyvria giggled his embarrassment was also plain to the eye even so he stubbornly plowed ahead in some waysthough he would have hotly denied ithe was very much like krispos what you said under there when you tried to lure me to you about the pleasure of love being sweet and no sin what about it olyvria lost somethough not allof her mischievous air as she saw how serious he was what he really wanted to ask was how she knewor even more to the point what she would have done had he lain down on the bed beside her and taken her in his arms but he did not think he was in a position where he could safely put either of those questions so instead he said if you hold to thanasios gleaming path as strongly as you say how could you make such a claim doesnt it go straight against everything you profess to believe i could answer that any number of ways olyvria said i could tell you for instance that it was none of your business so you could and i would beg your pardon he said i said from the start that i didnt want to offend you olyvria went on as if he had not spoken or i could say i was doing as digenis and my father bade me do and trusted them to judge the rights and wrongs of it her eyes twinkled again he knew she was toying with him but what could he do about it or she went on maddeningly disingenuous i could say thanasios countenanced dissimulation when it serves spreading the truth and that you have no idea what my true feelings on the subject are i know i dont thats what i was trying to find out your true feelings on the subject phostis felt like an old spavined plowhorse trying to trap a dragonfly without benefit of net he tramped on straight ahead while olyvria flitted evaded and occasionally flew so close to the end of his nose that his eyes crossed when he tried to see her clearly those are just some examples of what i might say she noted ticking them off on her fingertips if youd like others i might also say as if the old plowhorse suddenly snorted and startled the beautiful glittering insect he broke in what would you say thats so by the good god id say but then olyvria shook her head and looked away from him no i wouldnt say anything at all phostis better if i dont he wanted to shake truth from her but she was not a salt cellar why he howled months of frustration boiled into a single despairing word justbetter if i dont olyvria still held her head averted in a small voice she added i think we ought to go back to the fortress now phostis didnt think that nor anything like it but walked with her all the same in the inner ward stood syagrios talking with someone almost as disreputablelooking as he was the ruffian left hispartner in crimeambled over and attached himself to phostis like a shadow returning from a brief holiday in an unsettling sort of way phostis was almost glad to have him back hed certainly made a hash of his first little while in etchmiadzin on his own digenis robe had fallen open displaying ribs like ladder rungs his thighs were thinner than his knees even his ears seemed to be wasting away but his eyes still blazed defiance to the ice with you your false majesty he growled when krispos came into his cell your way would have sent me beyond the sun quicker but i gain i gain to krispos the firebrand priest looked more as if he lost lean to begin with now he looked like a peasant in a village after three years of blighted crops but for those eerily compelling eyes he might have been a skeleton that refused to turn back into a man by the good god krispos muttered when that thought struck him now i understand the mime troupe which one your majesty asked zaidas who still labored fruitlessly to extract truth from the dwindling digenis the one with the fellow in the suit of bones krispos answered he was supposed to be a thanasiot starving himself to death thats what he was now were the mimes heretics too or just mocking their beliefs something else occurred to him and isnt it a fine note when mimes know more about whats going on with the faith than my own ecumenical patriarch digenis mocking laugh flayed his ears of oxeites ignorance no possible doubt can exist oh shut up krispos said though down deep he knew tractability was one of the qualities that had gained oxeites the blue boots if only hed been more tractable about letting me do what i wanted with this wretch here the avtokrator thought but oxeites like any good bureaucrat protected his own krispos sat down on a threelegged stool to see if zaidas would have any better luck today his chief wizard swore his presence inhibited nothing zaidas at least had courage to be willing to labor on in the presence of his avtokrator what he did not have unfortunately was success he was trying something new today krispos saw or maybe something so old he hoped its time had come round again at any rate the implements he took from his carpetbag were unfamiliar but before the emperor saw them in action a panting messenger from the palaces poked his head into digenis cell whats happened krispos asked suspiciously his orders were that he be left undisturbed in his visits here save for only the most important news and the most important news was all too often bad may it please your majesty the messenger began and then paused to pant some more while he caught his breath krispos worried that opening lately had given him good cause to worry but the fellow surprised him saying may it please your majesty the eminent iakovitzes has returned to videssos the city from his embassy to makuran and awaits your pleasure at the imperial residence well by the good god theres word that truly does please me krispos exclaimed he turned to zaidas carry on here without me and may phos grant you good fortune if you glean anything from this bag of bones report it to me at once certainly your majesty zaidas said digenis laughed again the catamite goes off to pleasure his defiler that is a lie one of so many you spew krispos said coldly the halogai fell in around him as he went up the stairs that led to the doorway of the government office building he found himself laughing hed have to tell that one to iakovitzes his longtime associate would laugh too not least because hed wish the lie were true iakovitzes never made any secret of his fondness for stalwart youths and had tried again and again to seduce krispos when krispos newly arrived in videssos the city was in his service barsymes greeted him when he returned to the imperial residence good day your majesty ive taken the liberty of installing the eminent iakovitzes in the small dining chamber in the south hallway he requested hot mulled wine which was fetched to him ill have the same krispos said i cant think of a better way to fight the winter chill iakovitzes rose from his chair as krispos came into the room where he sat he started to prostrate himself krispos waved for him not to bother with a smug nod iakovitzes returned to his seat he was a wellpreserved seventy plump his hair and beard dyed dark to make him seem younger with a complexion on the florid side and eyes that warnedtrulyhe had a temper good to see you by phos krispos exclaimed ive wished you were here a great many times the past few months on the table in front of iakovitzes lay a scribes threepaneled writing tablet he opened it used a stylus to scribble rapid words on the wax then passed krispos the tablet ive wished i were back a great many times myself im bloody sick of mutton sup with me this evening then krispos said what do they say when in videssos the city eat fish ill feast you till you grow fins iakovitzes made a strange gobbling noise that served him for laughter make it tentacles if youd be so kind he wrote squid octopus lobster come to think of it has no tentacles but then lobster is lobster in itself a sufficient justification by the good god it makes me wish i could lick my lips i wish you could too old friend and taste in fullness as well krispos said iakovitzes had only the stump of his tongue twenty years before harvas blackrobe had torn it from his mouth when he was on an embassy to the evil sorcerer the woundand the spell placed on it to defeat healing had almost been the death of him but hed rallied even thrived krispos knew a great part of his own persona would have been lost had he suffered iakovitzes mutilation he wrote well enough but never had been fluent with a pen in his hand iakovitzes though wielded pen or stylus with such vim that reading his words krispos still sometimes heard the living voice that had been two decades silent iakovitzes took back the tablet wrote and returned it to krispos its not so bad your majesty not nearly so bad as sitting down to table with a bad cold in your head for instance half your taste or maybe more ive found is in your nose not in your mouth besides staying in mashiz turned into a bore the only folk who read videssian seemed as old and wrinkled as i am you have no notion how hard it is to seduce a pretty boy when he cant understand you gold speaks a lot of languages krispos observed sometimes youre too pragmatic for your own good iakovitzes wrote rolling his eyes at his sovereigns obtuseness theres no challenge to merely buying it the pursuit is part of the game why do you think i chased you so long and hard when i knew your appetite ran only to women so thats it eh krispos said at the time i thought you were just being beastly iakovitzes clapped a hand over his heart and pantomimed a death scene well enough to earn him a place on a professional mime troupe then miraculously recovered he bent over his tablet and wrote rapidly i think i shall make my way back to mashiz after all there being a representative of the enemy i am treated with the respect i deserve my alleged friends prefer slander he rolled his eyes krispos laughed out loud iakovitzes peculiar combination of touchiness and viperish wit never failed to amuseexcept when it infuriated sometimes it managed both at once the avtokrator quickly sobered he asked on your way back from makuran did you have any trouble with the thanasioi iakovitzes shook his head then amplified on the tablet i returned by the southern route and saw no trace they seem to be a perversion centered in the northwest though i gather youve had your bouts with them here in the city too bouts indeed krispos said heavily a good windstorm and they might have burned down half this place not only that interrogation by sorcery doesnt have any luck with them and theyre so drunk in their beliefs that many take torture more as an honor than a torment and they have your son iakovitzes wrote he spread his hands to show sympathy for krispos they have him aye krispos said certainly in body and perhaps in spirit as well iakovitzes raised a questioning eyebrow his gestures though wordless had grown so expressive in the years since hed lost his tongue as to have almost the quality of speech krispos explained he was talking with a priest who turned out to be a thanasiot for all i know hes taken the wretchs doctrines as his own not good iakovitzes wrote no and now this digenisthe priestis starving himself in my jail he thinks hell end up with phos when he quits the world my guess is that skotos will punish him forevermore the emperor spat between his feet in despisal of the dark god iakovitzes wrote if you ask me asceticism is its own punishment but id not heard of its being a capital offense till now that observation made krispos nod it also filled all three leaves of the tablet iakovitzes reversed his stylus smoothed out the wax with the blunt end wrote again these days i can tell very easily when im talking too muchas soon as i have to start erasing i know ive been running on would that those who still flap their gums enjoyed such a visible sign of prolixity ah but if they did theyd spend their increased silent time thinking up new ways to commit mischief krispos said youre likely right iakovitzes answered he studied krispos for a few seconds then reclaimed the tablet youre more cynical than you used to be is that all good i do admit its natural enough for from the throne youve likely heard more drivel these last twenty years than any other man alive but is it good krispos thought about that for some little while before he answered in different forms the question had arisen several times lately as when he gave that first thanasiot prisoner over to torture after zaidas magic failed to extract answers from him hed not have done that so readily when he was younger was he just another emperor now holding to power by whatever means came to hand were none of us what we were awhile ago he said but that was not an answer and he knew it by the way iakovitzes raised an eyebrow cocked his head and waited for krispos to go on he knew it was no answer too floundering krispos tried to give one the temples will never venerate me as holy i daresay but i hope the chroniclers will be able to report i governed videssos well i work hard at it at any rate if im harsh when i have to be i also think im mild when i can be my sons are turning into men and not i can say the worst of men is it enough he heard pleading in his voice a note hed not found there in some years the avtokrator heard pleas he did not make them iakovitzes bent over the writing tablet when the stylus was done racing back and forth he passed the tablet to krispos who received it with some anxiety he knew iakovitzes well enough to be sure his old companion would be blunt with him he had no trouble reading it at any rate constant poring over documents had kept his sight from lengthening with age as much as most mens that you can ask the question after so long on the throne speaks well for you iakovitzes wrote too many avtokrators forget it exists within days of their anointing as for the reply you gave well videssos has had the occasional holy man on the throne and most turned out bad for the world is not a holy place so long as you remember now and again what an innocentand attractiveboy you once were youll not turn out too badly krispos nodded slowly ill take that youd better iakovitzes replied after more scribbling i flatter only when i hope to entice someone under the sheets with me and after all our years of acquaintance im at last beginning to doubt ill ever have much luck with you youre incorrigible krispos said now that you mention it yes iakovitzes wrote he beamed taking it for a compliment then he covered his mouth with a hand while he yawned the empty cavern within was an unpleasant sight and he made a point of not displaying it he wrote some more by your leave your majesty ill take my own leave now to rest at home after my travels do you still take supper just past sunset i have enough years on me now to have become a creature of habit krispos answered nodding and with which of your handsome grooms do you intend to rest until suppertime iakovitzes assumed a comically innocent look then bowed his way out of the little dining chamber krispos guessed his barb had struck homeor at least given iakovitzes an idea krispos finished his mulled wine then set the silver goblet down beside iakovitzes the wine hadnt stayed warm but the ginger and cinnamon stirred into it nipped his tongue pleasantly barsymes came in with a tray on which to carry away the goblets krispos said iakovitzes will join me for supper this evening please let the cooks know hell like seafood in as many courses as possiblehe says hes tired of makuraner mutton i shall convey the eminent sirs request barsymes agreed gravely his presence will allow the kitchen staff to display their full range of talents hrmp krispos said in mock indignation i cant help being raised on a poor farm while he enjoyed fancy dishes well enough he more often preferred the simple fare hed grown up with more than one cook had complained of having his wings clipped dusk was settling over the city when iakovitzes returned resplendent and glittering in a robe shot through with silver thread barsymes escorted him and krispos to the small dining room where theyd taken wine earlier in the day a fresh jar awaited them cooling in a silver bucket of snow the vestiarios poured a cup for each man iakovitzes wrote ah its pale perhaps someone listened to me perhaps someone did eminent sir barsymes said and now if you will excuse me he glided away to return with a bowl a salad of lettuce and endives dressed with vinegar flavored by rue dates pepper honey and crushed cumina garnish said to promote good healthand topped with anchovies and rings of squid iakovitzes rose from his chair and gave barsymes a formal military salute then kissed him on each beardless cheek the vestiarios retreated in order less good than was his wont krispos hid a smile and attacked the salad which proved tasty iakovitzes cut his portion into very small bits he had to wash each one down with wine and put his head back to swallow his smile was blissful he wrote ah squid were you to offer one of these tentacled lovelies to rubyab king of kings your majesty without doubt he would flee faster than from an invading videssian army the makuraners when it comes to food live most insularor perhaps i should say inlandsular lives the more fools they krispos ate slowly so as not to get ahead of iakovitzes barsymes cleared away the plates krispos said tell me eminent sir did you ever find out what was making rubyabs mustaches quiver with secret glee do you know i didnt not to be sure of it iakovitzes answered he looked thoughtful terrible isnt it when a makuraner outdoes me in deceit i must be getting old but i tell you this your majesty one way or another it concerns us i was sure it would krispos said nothing would make rubyab happier than buggering videssos he caught iakovitzes eye in the metaphorical sense of course iakovitzes gobbled laughter oh of course your majesty he wrote barsymes returned with a fresh course here we have leeks boiled in water and olive oil he declared and then stewed in more oil and mullet broth to accompany them oysters in a sauce of oil honey wine egg yolks pepper and lovage iakovitzes tasted the oysters then wrote in big letters i want to marry the cook he is a man eminent sir barsymes said all the better iakovitzes wrote which sent the vestiarios into rapid retreat he presently returned with another new platter along with a fresh jar of wine this dish held peppered mullet liver paste baked in a fishshaped mold and then sprinkled with virgin olive oil as well as squashes baked with mint coriander and cumin and stuffed with pine nuts ground with honey and wine i shant eat for a week krispos declared happily but your majesty the main courses approach barsymes said in anxious tones krispos corrected himself two weeks bring em on the tip of his nose was getting numb how much wine had he drunk anyhow the rich flavor of the fish livers nicely complemented the squashes sweet stuffing barsymes bore away the empty mold from which the liver paste had come and the bowl that had held the squashes under the table krispos felt something on his leg just above the knee it turned out to be iakovitzes hand by the good god the avtokrator exclaimed you never give up do you im still breathing iakovitzes wrote if i havent stopped the one why should i stop the other something to that krispos admitted he hadnt had much luck with the other lately and hed surely be too gorged after this banquet was done to try to improve that tonight just then barsymes came back again this time with a tureen and two bowls thinking about what the tureen might hold took krispos mind off other matters a sure sign of advancing years the vestiarios announced here we have mullets stewed in wine with leeks broth and vinegar seasoned with oregano coriander and crushed pepper for your added pleasure the stew also includes scallops and baby prawns after the first taste iakovitzes wrote the only thing that could further add to my pleasure would be an infinitely distensible stomach and you may tell the cooks as much i shall eminent sir barsymes promised they will take pleasure in knowing they have pleased you the next course was lobster meat and spawn chopped fine mixed with eggs pepper and mullet broth wrapped in grape leaves and then fried after that came cuttlefish boiled in wine honey celery and caraway seeds and stuffed with boiled calves brains and crumbled hardcooked eggs only the expectant look on barsymes face kept krispos from falling asleep then and there one entree yet to come the vestiarios said i assure you it shall be worth the wait my weights already gone up considerably krispos said patting his midsection he could have used an infinitely distensible stomach himself about then but barsymes as usual proved right when he set down the last tray and its serving bowl he said i am bidden by the cooks to describe this dish in detail any lapses in the description spring from my lapses of memory not theirs of talent i begin to soaked pine nuts and sea urchins they added in a casserole layers of mallows beets leeks celery cabbage and other vegetables i now forget also included are stewed chickens pigs brains blood sausage chicken gizzards fried tunny in bits sea nettles stewed oysters in pieces and fresh cheeses it is spiced with celery seed lovage pepper and asafetida over the top was poured milk with beaten egg it was then stiffened in a hotwater bath garnished with fresh mussels and peppered once more i am only too certain ive left out something or another i beg you not to report my failing to the cooks phos have mercy krispos exclaimed eyeing the big casserole dish with something far beyond mere respect should we eat of it or worship it after barsymes served iakovitzes and him he had his answer both he said with his mouth full the feast had stretched far into the night every so often barsymes fed charcoal to a brazier that kept the dining chamber tolerably warm iakovitzes held up his tablet i hope you have a wheelbarrow in which to roll me home for im certain i cant walk something shall be arranged i am certain the vestiarios said dessert will be coming shortly i trust you will do it justice iakovitzes and krispos both groaned the avtokrator said well deal with it or burst trying id say its about even money which hed taken an army into battle many times with better odds than those but the sweet scent of the steam gently rising from the pan barsymes brought in revived his interest here we have grated apricots cooked in milk until tender then covered in honey and lightly dusted with ground cinnamon the vestiarios bowed to iakovitzes eminent sir the cooks apologize for their failure to include seafood in this one dish tell them i forgive their lapse iakovitzes wrote ive not yet decided whether to sprout fins or tentacles from tonights fete the apricots tasted as good as they smelled krispos nonetheless ate them very slowly being full far past repletion he was only halfway through his portion when barsymes hurried into the dining chamber the emperor raised an eyebrow such a lapse was unlike the eunuch barsymes said forgive me your majesty but the mage zaidas would have speech with you it is i gather a matter of some urgency maybe hes here to tell me digenis dropped dead at last krispos said hopefully fetch him in esteemed sir if hed come sooner he could have helped the two of us commit gluttony here not that we havent managed well enough on our own when zaidas came to the doorway he started to prostrate himself krispos waved for him not to bother nodding his thanks the wizard greeted iakovitzes whom he knew well good to have you back with us eminent sir youve been away too long it certainly seemed too bloody long iakovitzes wrote barsymes carried in a chair for the mage help yourself to apricots krispos said but first tell me what brings you here so late it must be getting close to the sixth hour of the night has digenis finally gone to the ice to his surprise zaidas answered no your majesty or not that i know of it has rather to do with your son phostis you found a way to make digenis talk krispos demanded eagerly not that either your majesty the mage said as you know till now ive had no success even learning the possible source of the magic that conceals the young majesty from my search this has not been from want of effort or diligence i assure you till now i would have described the trouble as want of skill till now krispos prompted as you know your majesty my wife aulissa is a very determined lady zaidas gave a small selfdeprecating chuckle she has in fact determination to spare for herself and me both iakovitzes reached for the stylus but forbore krispos admired aulissas beauty and her strength of purpose while remaining content she was his mages wife not his own the two of them had been happy together for many years though now krispos just said go on pray yes your majesty in any case aulissa seeing my discontent at failing to penetrate the shield the thanasiot sorcerers have thrown up to disguise phostis whereabouts suggested i test that screen at odd times and in odd ways in the hope of ascertaining its nature while it might be weakest having no more likely profitable notions of my own i fell in with her plan and this evening i saw it crowned with success theres good news indeed krispos said im in your debt and in aulissas tell her when you go home that ill show im grateful with more than words but for now by the good god tell me what you know before i get up and tear it from you iakovitzes let out his gobbling laugh its an idle threat sorcerous sir he wrote neither krispos nor i could rise for anything right now in any sense of the word zaidas smile was nervous you must understand your majesty ive not broken the screen merely peeked behind one lifted corner of it if i may use ordinary words to describe sorcerous operations but this i can tell you with some confidence the magic behind the screen is of the school inspired by the prophets four is it krispos said iakovitzes eyebrows were eloquent of surprise the avtokrator added so the wind blows from that quarter does it its not what i expected ill say that knowing how the screen was made can you now pierce it that remains to be seen zaidas said but i can essay such piercing with more hope than previously was mine good for you krispos lifted the latest wine jar from its bed of snow it was distressingly light barsymes he called id intended to make an end of things here but i find we need more wine after all fetch us another and a cup for zaidas and one for yourself tonight the news is good i shall attend to it directly your majesty barsymes said and he did occasional sleet rode the wind outside the little stone house with the thatched roof inside a small fire burned on the hearth but the chill remained phostis chafed his hands one against the other to keep feeling in them the priest who had presided over the midwinters day liturgy at the main temple in etchmiadzin bowed to the middleage couple who sat side by side at the table where theyd no doubt eaten together for many years on the table rested a small loaf of black bread and two cups of wine we are met here today with laonikos and siderina to celebrate their last meal their last partaking of the gross substance of the world and their commencement of a new journey on phos gleaming path the priest proclaimed along with phostis olyvria and syagrios the little house was crowded with friends and relatives the couples son and daughter and two of laonikos brothers were easy to pick out by looks everyone including laonikos and siderina seemed happy and proud of what was about to happen phostis looked happy himself but hed learned in the palaces how to assume an expression at will in fact he didnt know what to think the man and woman at that table were obviously of sound mind and as obviously eager to begin with what they thought of as the last step of their earthly existence and their first steps toward heaven how should i feel about that phostis wondered when its not a choice id ever make for myself let us pray the priest said phostis bent his head sketched the suncircle over his heart everyone recited phos creed as he had at etchmiadzins temple phostis found the creed more moving more sincere here than he ever had in the high temple these people meant their prayers they put fervor into a round of thanasiot hymns too phostis did not know those as well as the rest of the folk gathered here he kept stumbling over the words and then coming in again a line and a half later the hymns had different tunessome borrowed from the orthodox liturgybut the same message that loving the good god was allimportant that the next world meant more than this one and that every earthly pleasure was from skotos and to be shunned the priest turned to laonikos and siderina and asked are you now prepared to abandon the wickedness in this world the dark gods vessel and to seek the light in the realm beyond the sun they looked at each other then touched hands it was a loving gesture but in no way a sensual one with it they affirmed that what they did they did together without hesitation they said we are phostis could not have told which of them spoke first its so beautiful olyvria whispered and phostis had to nod dropping her voice still further so only he heard she added and so frightening he nodded again take up the knife the priest said divide the bread and eat it take the wine and drink never again shall the stuff of skotos pass your lips soon the bodies that are themselves sinful shall be no more and pass away soon your souls shall know the true joy of union with the lord with the great and good mind laonikos was a sturdy man with a proud hooked nose and distinctive eyebrows tufted and bushy siderina might have been pretty as a girl her face was still sweet and strong soon phostis thought theyll both look like strabon the idea horrified him it didnt seem to bother laonikos and siderina at all laonikos cut the little loaf in half and gave one piece to his wife the other he kept himself he ate it in three or four bites then tilted back the wine cup until the last drop was gone his smile lit up the house its done he said proudly phos be praised phos be praised everyone echoed may the gleaming path lead you to him siderina finished her final meal a few seconds after laonikos she dabbed at her lips with a linen napkin her eyes sparkled now i shant have to fret about what to cook for supper any more she said her voice was gay and eager she looked forward to the world to come her family laughed with her even phostis found himself smiling for her manifest happiness communicated itself to him no matter how much trouble he had sharing it the couples son took the plate knife and wine cups the good god willing these will inspire us to join you soon he said i hope they do laonikos said he got up from the table and hugged the young man in a moment the whole family was embracing we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind the priest began everyone joined him in prayer once more phostis thought the bluerobe had intruded himself on the familys celebration he thought his own presence an intrusion too turning to olyvria he whispered we really ought to go yes i suppose youre right she murmured back phos bless you friends and may we see you along his gleaming path laonikos called to them as they made their way out the door phostis put up his hood and pulled his cloak tight around him to shield against the storm well olyvria said when theyd gone a few yards down the street what did you think of that very much what you did phostis answered terrifying and beautiful at the same time huh syagrios said wheres the beauty in turning into a bag of bones it was the same thought phostis had worried at before if more pungently put olyvria let out an indignant sniff before she could speak phostis said seeing faith so fully realized is beautiful even for someone like me my own faith i fear is not so deep i cling to life on earth which is why seeing someone choose to leave it frightens me well all leave it sooner or later so why choose to hurry syagrios said for a proper thanasiot olyvria said emphasizing proper the world is corrupt from its creation and to be shunned and abandoned as soon as possible syagrios remained unmoved somebody has to take care of all the bloody sods leavin the world or else theyll leave it fastern they have in mind thanks to his old mans soldiers he jerked a thumb at phostis so im not a sheep im a sheepdog you dont have sheepdogs my lady wolves get fat the argument was ugly but potent olyvria bit her lip and looked to phostis he felt he was called to save her from some dreadful fate even though she and syagrios were in truth on the same side he flung the best rhetorical brickbat he could find saving others from sin doesnt excuse sins of your own boy you can talk about sin when you find out what it is syagrios said scornfully youre as milkfed now as when you came out from between your mothers legs and how do you think you got in there to come out eh if thered been no heavy breathing awhile before phostis had thought about that as uneasily as most people when making similar contemplations he started to shoot back that his parents had been honestly married when he was conceived but he wasnt even sure of that and rumor in the palace quarter saidwhispered when he was suspected of being in earshotkrispos and dara had been lovers while the previous avtokratorand daras previous husbandanthimos still held the throne glaring at syagrios wasnt the response phostis would have liked to make but seemed the best one available as wet will not stick to a ducks oiled feather so glares slid off syagrios he threw back his head and laughed raucously at phostis discomfiture then he spun on his heel and swaggered away through the slush as if to say phostis wouldnt know what to do with a chance to sin if one fell into his lap cursed ruffian phostis growledbut softly so syagrios would not hear by the good god he knows enough of sin to spend eternity in the ice the gleaming path should be ashamed to call him its own hes not a thanasiot not really though hell quarrel over the workings of the faith like any videssian olyvrias voice was troubled as if she did not care for the admission she was about to make hes much more a creature of my fathers why does that not surprise me phostis freighted the words with as much irony as they would bear only after they had passed his lips did he wish hed held them in railing at livanios would not help him with olyvria she sounded defensive as she answered surely krispos also has men to do his bidding no matter what it may be oh he does phostis said but he doesnt wrap himself in piety while hes about it in some surprise he listened to himself defending his father this wasnt the first time hed had good things to say about krispos since hed ended up in etchmiadzin he hadnt had many when he was back in the imperial capital under krispos eyeand his thumb olyvria said my father seeks to liberate videssos so the gleaming path may become a reality for everyone do you deny its a worthy goal he seeks power like any other ambitious man phostis thought before he could say it aloud he started to laugh olyvrias eyes raked him i wasnt laughing at you he assured her quickly its just that we sound like a couple of little squabbling children my father can do this well my father can do that oh she smiled back her good humor restored so we do what would you rather talk about than what our fathers can do the challenging way she threw the question at him reminded him of the first time hed seen her in the tunnel under videssos the city if he was to become a proper thanasiot as olyvria had put it in her argument with syagrios he ought to have forgotten that or at most remembered it as a test hed passed but hed discovered before he ever heard of thanasios that he did not have a temper approaching the monastic he did not remember just the test he remembered her and so he did not answer in words instead he reached out and slipped an arm around her waist if shed pulled back he was ready to apologize profusely he was even ready to produce a convincing stammer but she didnt pull back instead she let him draw her to him in videssos the city they would have been nothing out of the ordinary a young man and a young woman happy with each other and not paying much attention to anything else even in etchmiadzin a few people on the street smiled as they walked by others though glowered in pious indignation at such a public display of affection crabs he thought after a few steps though olyvria pulled away he thought shed seen the disapproving faces too but she said strolling with you like this is very pleasant but i cant feel happy about pleasure if you know what i mean just after weve come away from the celebration of the last meal oh that as it has a way of doing the wider world intruded itself on phostis thoughts he remembered the joy laonikos and siderina had shown when they swallowed the last wine and bread they would taste on earth its still hard to imagine that impinging on me like syagrios if in lesser measure i fear im a creature of this world in lesser measure olyvria agreed well so am i if the truth be told maybe when im older the world will repel me enough to make me want to leave it but for now even if everything thanasios says about it is true i cant force my flesh to turn altogether away from it nor i phostis said the fleshly world intruded again in a different way this time he stepped up to olyvria and kissed her her lips were for a moment still and startled under his he was a little startled himself because he hadnt planned to do it but then her arms enfolded him as his did her her tongue touched his just for a couple of heartbeats at that they broke apart from each other so fast phostis couldnt tell which of them drew back first why did you do that olyvria asked in a voice that was all breath why because phostis stopped he didnt know why not in the way he knew how mulberries tasted or where in videssos the city the high temple stood he tried again because another stumble once more because of all the folk in etchmiadzin youre the only one whos shown me any true kindness that was indeed part of the truth the rest phostis did not care to examine quite so closely it was as filled with carnality as the upper part of his mind was with the notion that carnality and sinfulness were one and the same olyvria considered what hed said slowly she nodded kindness is a virtue that moves you forward on the gleaming path a reaching out from one soul to another she said but her eyes slipped away from his as she spoke he watched her lips they seemed slightly softer slightly fuller than they had before his touched them he wondered if she too was having trouble reconciling what she believed with what she felt they walked on aimlessly for a while not touching both of them thoughtful then over a low rooftop phostis saw the bulk of the fortress wed better get back he said olyvria nodded as if relieved to have a definite goal for her feet as if he were a conjured demon syagrios popped out of a wineshop not far outside the fortress walls he might have started shirking his watchdog duties but he didnt want livanios finding out about that the ruffian glanced mockingly at the two of them well have you settled all the doings of the lord with the great and good mind thats for phos to do with us not we with him phostis said syagrios liked that his laugh blew grapey fumes into phostis face he pointed toward the gates back to your cage now and you can see how phos settles you there phostis kept walking toward the fortress hed learned that giving any sign syagrios jabs hurt guaranteed hed keep getting them as he went through the gates he also noticed how much like home the fortress was becoming in his mind just because its familiar doesnt mean they can make you belong here he told himself but were they making him he still hadnt settled that question in his own mind if he followed thanasios gleaming path oughtnt he be here of his own free will in the inner yard livanios was watching some of his recruits throw javelins the light spears thumped into bales of hay propped against the far wall some missed and bounced back ever alert livanios turned his head to see who the newcomers were ah the young majesty he said phostis didnt care for the way he used the title it was devoid even of scornful courtesy the heresiarch sounded as if he wondered whether phostis instead of proving useful might be turning into a liability that made phostis nervous if he wasnt useful to livanios how long would he last take him up to his chamber syagrios livanios said he might have been speaking of a dog or of a sack of flour as the door to his little cell closed behind him phostis realized that if he didnt care to abandon his fleshly form as the thanasioi advocated for their most pious folk he might have to take some most unthanasiot actions as soon as that thought crossed his mind he remembered olyvrias lips sweet against his the thanasioi would not have approved of that not even a little he also remembered whose daughter olyvria was if he tried to escape would she betray him or might she help he stamped on the cold floor he just did not know viii krispos was wading through changes in a law that dealt with tariffs on tallow imported from the northeastern land of thatagush when barsymes tapped at the open door of his study with one knuckle he looked up the vestiarios said may it please your majesty a messenger from the mage zaidas at the government office building maybe it will please me by the good god krispos said send him in the messenger quickly prostrated himself then said your majesty zaidas bids me tell you that he has at last succeeded in commencing a sorcerous interrogation of the rebel priest digenis has he well to the ice with tallow your majesty never mind the less the messenger knew about the dickering with thatagush the happier hed be krispos got up and accompanied him out of the study and out of the imperial residence haloga guards fell in with him as he went down the broad steps outside he felt a childish delight in having caught his parasol bearers napping as if hed put one over on barsymes he hadnt gone to listen to digenis since the day of iakovitzes return hed seen no point to it hed already heard all the thanasiot platitudes he could stomach and digenis refused to yield the truths he wanted to learn he was shocked at how the priest had wasted away in his peasant days hed seen men and women lean with hunger after a bad harvest but digenis was long past leanness everything between his skeleton and his skin seemed to have disappeared his eyes shifted when krispos came into his cell but did not catch fire as they had before he is very weak your majesty his will at last begins to fail zaidas said quietly otherwise i doubt even now i could have found a way to coax answers from him what have you done krispos asked i see no apparatus for the twomirror test no by his expression zaidas would have been glad never to try the twomirror test again this is half magic half healing art i laced the water he drinks with a decoction of henbane having first used sorcery to remove the taste so he would notice nothing out of the ordinary well done after a moment krispos added i do hope the technique for that is not so simple as to be available to any poisoner who happens to take a dislike to his neighboror to me no your majesty zaidas said smiling in any case the spell because it goes against nature is easy to detect by sorcery digenis of course was not in a position to do so and a good thing too krispos said all right lets see if hell give forth the truth now what questions have you put to him thus far none of major import as soon as i saw he was at last receptive i sent for you at once i suggest you keep your questions as simple as you can the henbane frees his mind but also clouds itboth far more strongly than wine as you say sorcerous sir krispos raised his voice digenis do you hear me digenis aye i hear you digenis voice was not only weak from weeks of selfimposed starvation but also dreamy and far away wheres phostismy son the son of the avtokrator krispos krispos added in case the priest did not realize who was talking to him digenis answered he walks the golden path to true piety striding ever farther from the perverse materialistic heresy that afflicts too many soulblind folk throughout the empire the priest held his convictions all the way down to his heart not merely on the surface of his mind krispos had already been sure of that he tried again where is phostis physically the physical is unimportant digenis declared krispos glanced over at zaidas who bared his teeth in an agony of frustration but digenis went on if all went as was planned phostis is now with livanios krispos had thought as much but hearing the plan had been kidnap rather than murder lifted fear from his heart phostis could easily have been dumped in some rocky ravine with his throat cut only the wolves and ravens would have been likely to discover him the avtokrator said what does livanios hope to do with him use him as a weapon against me phostis has a hope of assuming true piety digenis said krispos wondered if hed confused him by asking two questions at once after a few heartbeats the priest resumed for a youth phostis resists carnality well to my surprise he declined the body of livanios daughter which she offered to see if he could be tempted from the gleaming path he could not he may yet prove suitable for an imminent union with the good god rather than revolting and corruptible flesh an imminent union all faiths used words in special ways krispos wanted to be sure he understood what digenis was talking about whats an imminent union that which i am approaching now digenis answered the voluntary abandonment of the flesh to free the spirit to fly to phos you mean starving yourself to death krispos said somehow digenis used his emaciated neck for a nod slow horror trickled through krispos as he imagined phostis wasting away like the thanasiot priest no matter that he and the young man quarreled no matter even that phostis might not be his by blood he would not have wished such a fate on him digenis began to whisper a thanasiot hymn seeking to rock him out of the holy smugness he maintained even in the face of approaching death krispos said did you know livanios uses magic of the school of the prophets four to hide phostis whereabouts he is cursed with ambition digenis answered i knew the spoor i recognized the stench he prates of the golden path but skotos has filled his heart with greed for power you worked with him knowing he was evil by your reckoning that surprised krispos hed expected the renegade priest to have sterner standards for himself and you still claim you walk thanasios gleaming path are you not a hypocrite no for livanios ambition furthers the advance of the holy thanasios doctrines whereas yours leads only to the further aggrandizement of skotos digenis declared thus evil is transmuted into good and the dark god confounded thus sincerity turns to expedience krispos said hed already gained the impression that livanios cared more for livanios than for the gleaming path in a way that made the heresiarch more dangerous for he was liable to be more flexible than an outandout fanatic but in another way it weakened livanios fanatics by the strength of their beliefs could sometimes make their followers transcend difficulties from which an ordinary thoughtful man would flinch krispos thought for a while but could not come up with any more questions about phostis or the rebels in the field turning to zaidas he said squeeze all you can from him about the riots and the city and those involved and then he paused yes what then your majesty the mage asked shall we let him continue his decline until he stops breathing one day before long id sooner strike off his head and put it up on the milestone krispos said grimly but if i did that now with him looking as he does all the thanasioi in the city would have themselves a new martyr id just as soon do without that if i could better to let him die in quiet and disappear the good god willing folk will just forget about him you are wise and cruel digenis said skotos speaks through your lips if i thought that were so id step down from the throne and cast off my crown this instant krispos said my task is to rule the empire as well as i can devise and pass it on to my heir so he may do likewise having videssos torn apart in religious strife doesnt seem to me to be part of that bargain yield to the truth and there will be no strife digenis began whispering hymns again in his dusty voice this talk has no point krispos said id sooner build than destroy and you thanasioi feel the opposite i dont want the land burned over nor do i want it vacant of videssians who slew themselves for pietys sake other folk would simply steal what weve spent centuries building i will not have that not while i live digenis said the lord with the great and good mind willing phostis will prove a man of better sense and truer piety krispos thought about that suppose he got his son back but as a fullfledged fanatical thanasiot what then if thats so he told himself its as well i had three boys not one if phostis came back a thanasiot hed live out his days in a monastery whether he went there of his own free will of not krispos promised himself that he wouldnt turn the empire over to someone more interesting in wrecking than maintaining it time enough to worry about that if he ever saw phostis again though he turned to zaidas youve done well sorcerous sir knowing what youve learned now you should have a better chance of pinpointing phostis whereabouts ill bend every effort toward that end the mage promised nodding krispos stepped out of digenis cell the head gaoler came up to him and said a question your majesty krispos raised an eyebrow and waited the gaoler said that priest in there hes getting on toward the end what happens if he decides he doesnt care to starve himself to death and wants to start eating again i dont think thats likely to happen if nothing else krispos respected digenis sense of purpose if it does though by all means let him eat this refusal to take food is his affair not mine but notify me immediately youll want to ask him more questions your majesty the gaoler said no no you misunderstand that priest is a condemned traitor if he wants to carry out the sentence of death on himself in his own way i am willing to permit it but if his will falters hell meet the headsman on a full stomach ah the gaoler said the wind sits so eh very well your majesty it shall be as you say in his younger days krispos would have come back with something harsh like it had better be more secure in his power now he headed upstairs without a backward glance as long as the gaoler felt no other result than the one he desired was possible that result was what krispos would get the halogai who had waited outside the government office building took their places around krispos and those who had gone down with him into the gaol is the word good majesty one of the northerners asked good enough anyhow the avtokrator answered i know now phostis was snatched not killed and i have a good notion of where hes been taken as for getting him backtime will tell about that and about what sort of person hell be when i do get him back he added to himself the guardsmen cheered their deepvoiced shouts making passersbys heads turn to find out what news was so gladsome some people exclaimed to see krispos out and about without his retinue of parasol bearers others exclaimed at the halogai the men from the northtall fair gloomy and slowspoken never failed to fascinate the videssians whose opposites they were in almost every way struck by sudden curiosity krispos turned to one of the northerners and said tell me trygve what do you make of the folk of videssos the city trygve pursed his lips and gave the matter some serious thought at last in his deliberate videssian he answered majesty the wine here is very fine the women looser than they are in halogaland but everyone i tink here talks too much several other guardsmen nodded in solemn agreement since krispos had the same opinion of the city folk he nodded too back at the imperial residence he gave the news from digenis to barsymes the vestiarios smile unusually broad filled his face full of fine wrinkles he said phos be praised that the young majesty is thought to be alive the other palace chamberlains i know will be as delighted as i am down a side corridor krispos came upon evripos and katakolon arguing about something or other he didnt ask what when the mood struck them they could argue over the way a lamp flame flickered hed had no brothers himself only two sisters younger than he both many years dead now he supposed he should have been glad his sons kept their fights to words and occasional fists rather than hiring knifemen or poisoners or wizards both youths glanced warily in his direction as he approached neither one looked conspicuously guilty so each of them felt the righteousness of his own causethough evripos these days was developing the beginning of a pretty good stone face krispos said digenis has cracked at last thank the good god by what he said phostis is held in some thanasiot stronghold but is alive and likely to stay that way now he studied evripos and katakolon rather than the other way round katakolon said thats good news by the time were done smashing the thanasioi next summer we should have him back again his expression was open and happy krispos didnt think he was acting he was sure he couldnt have done so well at katakolons age but then he hadnt been raised at court either evripos features revealed nothing whatever his eyes were watchful and hooded krispos prodded to see what lay behind the mask arent you glad to be sure your elder brother lives for bloods sake aye but should i rejoice to see my ambition thwarted evripos said would you in my boots the question cut to the root ambition for a better life had driven krispos from his farm to videssos while he was one of iakovitzes grooms ambition had led him to wrestle a kubrati champion and gained him the notice of the thenemperor anthimos uncle petronas who administered videssos in his nephews name ambition led him to let petronas use him to supplant anthimos previous vestiarios and then as vestiarios himself to take ever more power into his own hands supplanting first petronas and then anthimos he said son i know you want the red boots well so does phostis and i have but the one set to give what would you have me do give them to me by phos evripos answered id wear them better than he would i have no way to be sure of thatnor do you krispos said for that matter a day may come when katakolon here begins to think past the end of his prick he might prove a better ruler than either of you two who can say him evripos shook his head no father forgive me but i dont see it me katakolon seemed as bemused as his brother ive never thought much of wearing the crown i always figured the only way it would come to me was if phostis and evripos were dead i dont want it badly enough to wish for that and since im not likely to be avtokrator why shouldnt i enjoy myself as avtokrator and voluptuary both anthimos had been anything but good for the empire but as emperors brother katakolon would be relatively harmless if he devoted himself to pleasure if he did lack ambition he might even be safer as a voluptuary the chronicles had shown krispos that rulers had a way of turning suspicious of their closest kin who else was likelier both to accumulate power and to use it against them maybe its because i grew up on a farm krispos began and both evripos and katakolon rolled their eyes nonetheless the avtokrator persisted maybe thats why i think waste is a sin phos wont forgive we never had much if wed wasted anything we would have starved the lord with the great and good mind knows im glad it isnt so with you boys being hungry is no fun but even though you have so much you should still work to make the most you can of your lives pleasure is all very well in its place but you can do other things when youre not in bed katakolon grinned aye belike you can get drunk another sermon wasted father evripos said acidly how does that fit into your scheme of worths without answering krispos pushed past his two younger sons and down the corridor phostis was unenthusiastic about ruling evripos embittered and katakolon had other things on his mind what would videssos come to when the common fate of mankind took his own hand from the steering oar men had been asking that question on one scale or another for as long as there were men if the head of a family died and his relatives were less able then he the family might fall on hard times but the rest of the world went on when an able emperor passed from the scene families past counting might suffer because of it what am i supposed to do krispos asked the statues and paintings and relics that lined that hallway no answer came back to him all he could think of was to go on himself as well as he could for as long as he could and after that after that it would be in his sons hands and in the good gods he remained confident phos would continue to watch over videssos of his sons he was less certain rain poured down in sheets ran in wide watery fishtails off the edges of roofs and turned the inner ward of the fortress of etchmiadzin into a thin soup of mud phostis closed the wooden shutter to the little slit window in his cell with it open things were about as wet inside as they were out in the storm but with it closed the bare square room was dark as night fitfully flickering lamps did little to cut the gloom phostis slept as much as he could inside the cell in near darkness he had little else to do after a few days of the steady rain he felt as full of sleep as a new wineskin is of wine he went into the corridor in search of something other than food syagrios was dozing on a chair down the hall perhaps hed had himself magically attuned to phostis door for he came alert as soon as it opened though phostis had been quiet with it the ruffian yawned stretched and said i was beginning to think youd died in there boy in a little while i was going to check for a stink you might have found one phostis thought because the thanasioi reckoned the body skotos creation they neither lavished baths on it nor disguised its odors with sweet scents sometimes phostis didnt notice the resulting stench as he was part of it sometimes it oppressed him dreadfully he said im going downstairs ive grown too bored even to nap anymore you wont stay bored forever syagrios answered after the rain comes the clear and when the clear comes we go out to fight he closed a fist and slammed it down on his leg syagrios was bored too phostis realized he hadnt had the chance to go out and hurt anything lately a couple of torches had gone out along the corridor leaving it hardly brighter than phostis cell he lit a taper from the burning torch nearest the stairway and headed down the steep stone spiral syagrios followed him as always he was sweating by the time he reached the bottom a misstep on the stairs and he would have got there much faster than he wanted to livanios soldiers crowded the ground floor of the citadel some of them slept rolled in blankets their worldly goods either under their heads in leather sacks that served for pillows or somewhere else close by however much the thanasioi professed to despise the things of the world their fighters could still be tempted to take hold of things of the world that were not things of theirs some of the men who were awake threw dice there coins and other things of the world changed hands in more generally accepted fashion phostis had been bemused the first time he saw thanasiot soldiers gambling hed watched the dice many times since and concluded the men were soldiers first and followers of the gleaming path afterward off in a corner a small knot of men gathered around a game board whereon two of their fellows dueled phostis made his way over to them if nobodys up for the next game i challenge the winner he said the players looked up from their pieces hullo friend one of them said a thanasiot greeting phostis was still getting used to aye ill take you on after i take care of grypas here ha grypas returned to the board the prelate hed captured from his opponent guard your emperor astragalos phostis here will play me next grypas proved right after some further skirmishing astragalos emperor beset on all sides found no square where he could move without threat of capture muttering into his beard the soldier gave up phostis sat in his place he and grypas returned the pieces to their proper squares on the first three rows on each mans side of the ninebynine board grypas glanced over at phostis ive played you before friend im going to take winners privilege and keep first move however you like phostis answered grypas advanced the foot soldier diagonally ahead of his prelate freeing up the wideranging piece for action phostis pushed one of his own foot soldiers forward in reply grypas played like the soldier he was he hurled men into the fight without much worry about where they would be three moves later phostis had learned in a subtler school he lost a little time fortifying his emperor behind an array of goldpieces and silvers but then started taking advantage of that safety before long grypas was gnawing his mustache in consternation he tried to fight back by returning to the fray pieces hed taken from phostis but phostis had not left himself as vulnerable as astragalos had before he beat the soldier without much trouble as the dejected man got up from the board syagrios sat down across it from phostis he leered at the junior avtokrator all right youngster lets see how tough you are ill keep first move against you by the good god phostis said around them bets crackled back and forth over the long winter theyd shown they were the two best players in the fortress which of them was better than the other swung from day to day phostis stared over the grid at his unkempt opponent who would have guessed that a man with the looks of a bandit and habits to match made such a cool precise player but the pieces on the board cared nothing for how a man looked or even how he acted when he wasnt at the game and syagrios had already showed he had more wit behind that battered face than anyone who judged by it alone would guess the ruffian had a special knack for returning captured pieces to the board with telling effect if he set down a horseman you could be sure it threatened two pieces at once both of them worth more than it if a siege engine went into action your emperor would be in trouble soon his manner at the game betrayed his origins whenever phostis made a move he didnt like hed growl oh you son of a whore it had been unnerving at first by now phostis took no more notice of it than of the twitches and tics of some of his opponents back in videssos the city he took far fewer chances against syagrios than he had against grypas in fact he took no chances at all that he could see give syagrios an opening and hed charge right through syagrios treated him with similar caution the game as a result was slow and positional finally with returned foot soldiers paving the way syagrios broke up phostis fortress and sent his emperor scurrying for safety when he was trapped in a corner with no hope of escape phostis took him off the board and said i surrender you made me sweat there by the good god syagrios thumped his chest with a big fist then boomed out who else wants a go at me astragalos said let phostis take you on again thatll make a more even match than the rest of us are apt to give you phostis had stood up he looked around to see if anybody else wanted to play syagrios when no one made a move he sat back down again syagrios leered at him i aint gonna give you first move either boy i didnt expect you would phostis answered altogether without ironic intent any man who didnt look out for himself wasnt likely to find anyone to do it for him after a game as hardfought as the first one he got his revenge syagrios leaned over the board and punched him on the meaty part of his arm youre a sneaky little bastard you know that to the ice with whose son you are that aint horse manure between your ears you know whatever you say compliments from syagrios made phostis even more nervous than the abuse that usually filled the ruffians mouth phostis stood up again and said you can take on the next challenger whys that syagrios demanded quitting while you were winning was bad form if i dont leave about now youll have to wipe up the floor under me phostis answered which made syagrios and several of the other men around the game board laugh with the fortress of etchmiadzin packed full of fighters the humor there was decidedly coarse in better weather phostis would have wandered out into the inner ward to make water against the wall there was however an oversufficiency of water in the inner ward already he headed off to the garderobe instead the chamber connected as it was to a cesspit under the keep was so noisome that he avoided it when he could at the moment however he had little choice wooden stalls separated one hole in the long stone bench from another an unusual concession to delicacy but one phostis appreciated three of the four were occupied when he went in he stepped into the fourth which was farthest from the doorway as he was easing himself he heard a couple of people come in behind him one of them let out an unhappy grunt all full he said by the slight accent he gave his words phostis recognized him as livanios pet wizard the other was livanios dont worry artapan he said easily you wont burst in the next couple of minutes and neither shall i dont use my name the wizard grumbled livanios laughed at him by the good god if we have spies in the latrine were doomed before we start here this fellows coming out you go ahead ill wait phostis had already set his clothes to rights but he waited too waited until he heard livanios go into a stall and shut the door then he all but jumped out of the one hed been in and hurried away from the garderobe he didnt want either livanios or artapan to know hed heard now that he knew the wizards name he also recognized the accent that had tantalized him for so long artapan was from makuran phostis wondered what a mage from videssos perennial enemy was doing in livanios camp why couldnt livanios find a proper thanasiot mage after a few seconds he stopped wondering to one raised in the palaces to one who had however unwillingly soaked up a good deal of history the answer fairly shouted at him artapan was there serving the interests of rubyab king of kings and how could rubyabs interest be better served than by keeping videssos at war with itself two other questions immediately sprang from that one the first was whether livanios knew he was being used maybe he didnt maybe he was makurans willing catspaw or maybe he was out to exploit rubyabs help at the same time rubyab used him phostis had a tough time seeing livanios as a witless dupe choosing between the other two alternatives was harder phostis set them aside to him the second question carried greater weight if the thanasioi were flourishing thanks to aid from makuran what did that say about the truth of their teachings that one was hard enough to break teeth when you bit into it would thanasios interpretation of the faith have grown and spread without the foreignno no mincing words without the enemyhelp was it at bottom a religious movement at all or rather a political one if it was just political why did it have such a strong appeal to so many videssians without even bothering to get a taper phostis went upstairs and into his room all at once he didnt care how gloomy it was in there in fact he hardly noticed he sat down on the battered old stool he had a lot to think about somewhere among the gears and levers behind the wall of the grand courtroom a servitor stood in frustrated uselessness much to the fellows dismay krispos had ordered him not to raise the throne on high when the ambassador from khatrish prostrated himself but its the custom the man had wailed but the reason behind the custom is to overawe foreign envoys krispos had answered it doesnt overawe triboit just makes him laugh but its the custom the servitor had repeated to him reasons were irrelevant raising the throne was what hed always done so raising the throne was what he had to do forever even now as tribo approached the throne and cast himself down on his belly krispos wondered if the throne would rise beneath him in spite of orders custom died hard in the empire when it died at all to his relief he remained at his usual elevation as the ambassador from khatrish got to his feet he asked mechanism in the throne break down i cant win krispos thought khatrishers seemed to specialize in complicating the lives of their videssian neighbors krispos did not reply he stoodor rather saton the imperial dignity though he had the feeling that would do him about as much good as the climbing throne had before sure enough tribo let out a knowing sniff when he saw he wouldnt get an answer he said may it please your majesty the thanasioi are still troubling us theyre still troubling us too in case you hadnt noticed krispos said dryly well yes but its different for you videssians you see your majesty you grew the murrain your very own selves so of course its still spreading through your flocks we dont take kindly to having our cows infected too though if you take my meaning a videssian would have used a comparison from agriculture rather than herding but krispos had no trouble following tribo what would you have me do he asked shut the border between our states and ban shipping too the khatrisher envoy flinched as krispos had known he would khatrish needed trade with videssos much more than videssos with khatrish lets not be hasty your majesty all i want is to hear you say again that you and your ministers dont have anything to do with spreading the cursed heresy so i can take the word to my khagan barsymes and iakovitzes stood in front of the imperial throne krispos could see only their backs and the sides of their faces he often made a game of trying to figure out from that limited view what they were thinking he guessed iakovitzes was amusedhe admired effronteryand barsymes outragedthe normally selfcontrolled eunuch was fairly quivering in his place krispos needed a moment to realize why barsymes reckoned it an insult for him to have to deny anything more than once his own notion of what was insulting was more flexible even after twenty years and more on the throne if the envoy wanted another guarantee he could have it krispos said you can tell nobad son of gumush that we arent exporting this heresy to khatrish on purpose we wish it would go away here and were trying to get rid of it but we arent in the habit of stirring up sectarian strife even if it might profit us i shall send exactly that word to the puissant khagan your majesty and i thank you for the reassurance tribo said he glanced toward the throne under his shaggy beard a frown twisted his mouth your majesty did you hear me your majesty krispos still didnt answer he was listening to what hed just said not to the ambassador from khatrish videssos might fight shy of turning its neighbors topsyturvy with religious war but would makuran didnt the thanasiot mage who hid phostis use spells that smelled of mashiz no wonder rubyabs mustaches had twitched iakovitzes spun where he stood so he faced krispos the assembled courtiers murmured at the breach of etiquette iakovitzes had a fine nose for intrigue his upraised hand and urgent expression said hed just smelled some krispos would have bet a counterfeit copper against a years tax receipts it was the same odor that had just filled his own nostrils he realized he had to say something to tribo after a few more seconds he managed yes im glad youll reassure your sovereign we are doing everything we can to fight the thanasiot doctrine not to spread it this audience now is ended but your majesty tribo began indignantly then with a glare he bowed to inflexible videssian custom when the avtokrator spoke those words an envoy had no choice but to prostrate himself once more back away from the throne until he had gone far enough that he could turn around and then depart the grand courtroom he left in a manifest snit evidently hed had a good deal more on his mind than he got the chance to say ill have to make it up to him krispos thought keeping khatrish friendly was going to be all the more important in the months ahead but for now even the urgency of that paled as soon as tribo left the grand courtroom krispos also made his way out at a pace that set the tongues of the assembled nobles and prelates and ministers wagging politics was a religion of its own in videssos before long many of those officials would figure out what was going on something obviously was or the avtokrator would not have left so unceremoniously for the moment though they were at a loss as to what iakovitzes half trotted along in krispos wake he knew what was going through the emperors mind barsymes plainly didnt but he would sooner have gone before the torturers in their red leather than question krispos where anyone else could hear him what hed have to say in private about cutting short the khatrishers audience was liable to be pointed krispos swept across the rainslicked flags of the path that led through the cherry orchard and to the imperial residence the cherry trees were still barebranched but before too long theyd grow leaves and then the pink and white blossoms that would make the orchard fragrant and lovely for a few brief weeks in spring as soon as he was inside krispos burst out that bastard that sneaky underhanded son of a snake may he shiver in the ice for all eternity to come surely tribo did not so offend you with his remark concerning the throne barsymes asked no he didnt know why krispos had left on the run im not talking about tribo im talking about rubyab the fornicating king of kings krispos said unless ive lost all of my mind hes using the thanasioi for his stalking horse how can videssos hope to deal with makuran if we tie ourselves up in knots barsymes had been in the palaces longer than krispos he was anything but a stranger to devious machinations as soon as this one was pointed out to him he nodded emphatically i have no doubt but that youre right your majesty who would have looked for such elaborate deceit from makuran iakovitzes held up a hand to gain a pause while he wrote something in his tablet he passed it to krispos we videssians pride ourselves as the sneakiest folk on earth but down deep somewhere we ought to remember the makuraners can match us theyre not barbarians we can outmaneuver in our sleep theyve proved it to our sorrow too many times in the past thats true krispos said as he handed the tablet to barsymes the vestiarios quickly read it then nodded his agreement krispos thought back over the histories and chronicles hed read he said this seems to me to be something new aye the king of kings and his folk have fooled us many times but mainly thats meant fooling us about what makuran intends to do here though rubyabs seen deep into our soul seen how to make ourselves our own worst foes thats more dangerous than any threat makuran has posed in a long time iakovitzes wrote there was a time oh about a hundred fifty years ago when the men from mashiz came closer to sacking videssos the city than any videssian likes to think about of course wed been meddling in their affairs before then so i suppose they were out for revenge yes ive seen those tales too krispos said nodding the question though is what we do about it now he eyed iakovitzes suppose i send you back to mashiz with a formal note of protest to rubyab king of kings suppose you dont your majesty iakovitzes wrote and underlined the words one thing we ought to do is get this tale told as widely as possible barsymes said if every official and every priest in every town lets the people know makuran is behind the thanasioi theyll be less inclined to go over to the heretics some of them will anyhow krispos said others will have heard too many pronouncements from the pulpit and from the city square to take special notice of one more no dont look downhearted esteemed sir its a good plan and well use it i just dont want anyone here expecting miracles no matter what the priests and the officials say what we must have is victory iakovitzes wrote if we can make the thanasioi stop hurting us people will see us as the stronger side and pretend they never had a heretical notion in all their born days but if we lose the rebels power will grow regardless of whos behind them not so long till spring either krispos said may the good god grant us the victory you rightly say we need he turned to barsymes summon the most holy patriarch oxeites to the palaces if you please what words can do they shall do as you say your majesty the vestiarios turned to go wait krispos stopped him in midstride before you draft the note why dont you fetch all three of us a jar of something sweet and strong today by the good god weve earned a taste of celebration so we have your majesty barsymes said with the hint of a smile that was as much as he allowed himself ill attend to that directly the jar of wine became two and then three krispos knew he would pay for it in the morning hed been a young man when he discovered he couldnt come close to roistering with anthimos older now he had less capacity than in those days and less practice at carousing too but every so often once or twice a year he still enjoyed letting himself go barsymes abstemious in pleasure as in most things bowed his way out halfway down the second jar presumably to write the letter ordering oxeites to appear at the palace iakovitzes stayed and drank he was always game for a debauch and held his wine better than krispos the only sign he gave of its effects was that the words he wrote grew large and sprawling syntax and venom remained unchanged why dont you write like youre drunk krispos asked some time after dinner by then hed forgotten what hed eaten iakovitzes replied you drink with your mouth and then try to talk through it no wonder youve started mumbling my hand hasnt touched a drop as the night hours advanced one of the chamberlains sent to iakovitzes house a couple of his muscular grooms came to the imperial residence to escort their master home he patted them both and went off humming a dirty song the hallway swayed around krispos as he walked back from his farewells to iakovitzes at the entrance he felt like a beamy ship trying to cope with quickly shifting winds in such a storm the imperial bedchamber seemed a safe harbor after he closed the door behind him he needed a few seconds to notice drina smiling at him from the bed the night was chilly she had the covers drawn up to her neck barsymes is up to his old tricks again krispos said slowly and he thinks im up to mine why not your majesty the serving maid said you never know till you try she threw off the bedclothes the smile was all she was wearing even through the haze of wine memory stabbed at krispos dara had always been in the habit of sleeping without clothes drina was larger softer simplerhis wife the empress had always been prickly as a hedgehog as he seldom did these days he let himself remember how much he missed her watching drina flip away the covers like that took him back almost a quarter of a century to the night he and dara had joined on this very bed even after so long a remembered thrill of fear ran through himhad anthimos caught them he would not be here now or certain vital parts of him would not and with the fear came the memory of how excited hed been the memory of past excitementand drina there waiting for himwere enough to summon up at least the beginning of excitement now he pulled off his robe and tugged at the red boots well see what happens he said i make no promises ive drunk a lot of wine whatever happens is all right your majesty drina said laughing havent i told you before that you men worry too much about these things women have probably been saying that since the start of time he said as he lay down beside her my guess is that the next man who believes it will be the first but oddly knowing she had no great expectations helped him perform better than hed expected himself he didnt think she was pretending when she gasped and quivered under him he could feel her secret place clench around him again and again spurred by that he too gasped and quivered a few seconds later thereyou see your majesty drina said triumphantly i see krispos said this was already a good day youve made it better still im glad drina let out a squeak id better get up or else ill leave stains on the sheet for the washerwomen to giggle at do they do that krispos asked he fell asleep in the middle of her answer by the time spring drew near in etchmiadzin phostis knew every little winding street in town he knew where the stonecutters had their shops and the harnessmakers and the bakers he knew the street on which laonikos and siderina were busy dyingknew it and kept away from it he got more and more chances to wander where he would without syagrios etchmiadzins wall was too high to jump from without breaking his neck its single gate too well guarded for him to think of bolting through it and away and as the weather got better syagrios was more and more closeted with livanios planning the upcoming summers campaign phostis did his best to stay out of livanios way the less he reminded the heresiarch of his presence the less likely livanios was to think of him think of the danger he might represent and put him out of the way just wandering however was beginning to pall when hed had syagrios at his elbow every hour of the day and night he was sure just getting away from the ruffian for a little while would bring peace to his soul and so it had for a little while but the taste of freedom however small served only to whet his appetite for more he was no longer a glad explorer of etchmiadzins back alleys he paced them more like a wildcat searching for an opening in its cage he hadnt found one yet maybe around the next corner he told himself for the hundredth time he went round the next cornerand almost walked into olyvria who was coming around it the other way they both sidestepped in the same direction which meant they almost bumped into each other again olyvria started to laugh get out of my way you she said miming a push at his chest he made as if to stumble backward from it then bowed extravagantly i humbly crave your pardon my lady i had no intention of disturbing your glorious progress he cried i pray that you find it in your heart to forgive me well see about that she said darkly by then they were both laughing phostis came back up to her and slipped an arm around her waist she snuggled against him her chin fit nicely on the top of his shoulder he wanted to kiss her but held backshe was still nervous about it from her perspective he supposed she had reason to be what are you doing here they both asked in the same breath that made them laugh again nothing much phostis answered keeping away from mischief as best i can what about you olyvria was carrying a canvas bag she pulled a shoe out of it and held it up so close to phostis face that his eyes crossed i broke off the heel see she said theres a little old vaspurakaner cobbler down this street who does wonderful work why not hes been doing it longer than both of us put together have been alive anyway i was taking it to him may i accompany you on your journey he asked grandly i hoped you would she answered and dropped the wounded shoe back into the bag arm in arm they walked down the little lane oh this place phostis said when they reached the cobblers shop yes i went by here over the door hung a boot carved from wood to one side of it the wall bore the word shoon in videssian to the other what was presumably the same message in the square blocky characters the princes of vaspurakan used to write their language phostis peered through one of the narrow windows set into the front wall olyvria into the other i dont see anyone in there she said frowning lets find out phostis reached for the latch and pulled the door open a bell rang the rich smell of leather filled his nose he motioned for olyvria to precede him into the cobblers shop the door swung shut behind them hes not here olyvria said disappointedly all the candles and lamps were out even with them burning phostis would have found the shop too dim awls and punches little hammers and trimming knives hung in neat rows on pegs behind the cobblers bench no one came out from the back room to answer the bell maybe he was taken ill phostis said something else ran through his mind or maybe hed rather starve himself to death than work any more but no probably not shed said he was a vaspurakaner not a thanasiot heres a scrap of parchment olyvria pounced on it see if you can find pen and ink ill leave him the shoe and a note she clicked her tongue between her teeth i hope he reads videssian im not sure someone could easily have painted that word on the wall for him here phostis discovered a little clay jar of ink and a reed pen below the tools he reads something anyhow or i dont think hed have these thats true thanks olyvria scribbled a couple of lines put her broken shoe on the bench and secured the parchment to it with a long rawhide lace there that should be all right if he cant read videssian he ought to know someone who can i hope hes well a donkey went by outside its hooves made little wet sucking noises as it lifted them from the mud one after another it let out a braying squeal of discontent at being ridden in such dreadful conditions ahh quit your bellyaching growled the man on its back who was plainly used to its complaints the donkey brayed again as it squelched past the cobblers shop but for the donkey everything was still save far off in the distance where a dog barked olyvria took a small step toward the door i suppose i should get back she said wait phostis said she raised a questioning eyebrow he put his arms around her and bent his face down to hers before their lips touched she pulled back a little and whispered are you sure in the murky light the pupils of her eyes were enormous he wondered how she meant that but it could have only one answer yes im sure well then now she moved forward to kiss him she hesitated once more just for a heartbeat when his hand closed on the firm softness of her breast but then she molded herself against him they sank down to the rammedearth floor of the cobblers shop together fumbling at each others garments it was the usual clumsy first time made more frantic than usual by fear that someonemost likely the cobblerwould walk through the door at the most inopportune moment possible hurry olyvria gasped phostis did his best to oblige afterward because hed rushed so he wasnt sure hed fully satisfied her at the time he didnt worry about it his mouth slid from hers to her breasts and down the rounded slope of her belly her hand was urgent on him she lay on her rumpled dress a fold of it got distractingly between them when he scrambled above her he leaned on one elbow to yank it out of the way he kissed her again as he slid inside when he was through he sat back on his haunches enormously pleased with the entire world olyvria hissed get dressed you lackwit which brought him back to himself in a hurry they both dressed quickly then spent another minute or so dusting off each others clothes olyvria stirred the dirt of the floor around with her foot to cover up the marks theyd left she looked phostis over your elbows dirty she licked a fingertip with a catlike dab of her tongue and rubbed it clean he held the door for her they both almost bounded out of the cobblers shop once out on the street again phostis said now what i just dont know olyvria answered after a small pause i have to think her voice was quiet almost toneless as if shed left behind all her exuberance all her mischief with the broken shoe i didntquiteexpect to do that phostis hadnt seen her at a loss before he didnt know what to make of it i didnt expect to either he knew his grin was foolish but he couldnt help it im glad we did though she glared at him of course you are men always are then she softened a little and let her hand rest on his arm for a moment im not angry not really we have to see what happens later thats all phostis knew what he would like to have happen later but also had a good notion that mentioning it straight out would make it less likely instead he spoke obliquely the flesh is hard to ignore isnt it olyvria glanced back at the cobblers shop if we well if we do that again well have to find a better place for it my heart was in my mouth every second yes i know mine too but theyd joined anyhow like olyvria phostis saw he was going to have to do some hard thinking about that by every thanasiot standard theyd just committed a goodsized sin he didnt feel sinful though he felt relaxed and happy and ready to tackle anything the world threw at him olyvria might have plucked that thought right out of his brain she said you dont have to worry if youre with child till the moon spins through its phases that sobered him he didnt have to worry about conceiving not directly but if olyvrias belly started to swell what would livanios do he might force a marriage on them if that fit into his own schemes but if it didnt he might act like any outraged father and beat phostis within an inch of his life or even kill him or he might give him over to the clergy the priests of the thanasioi took a very dim view of carnal pleasures their punishments might make him wish livanios had personally attended to the matterand to add humiliation to anguish would have the vociferous approval of most of the townsfolk whatever happens ill take care of you he said at last how do you propose to manage that she asked with a womans bitter practicality you cant even take care of yourself phostis flinched he knew she spoke the truth but having his nose rubbed in it stung as the avtokrators son hed never really had to worry about taking care of himself he was taken care of simply by virtueor faultof his birth here in etchmiadzin he was also taken care of as a prisoner the amount of freedom hed lost was smaller than it seemed at first glance at krispos insistence hed studied logic he saw only one possible conclusion ill have to get out if you like ill take you with me as soon as the words left his mouth he knew he should have kept them in there having her laugh at him would be bad enough having her tell her father would be a thousand times worse she didnt laugh she said dont try to run youd just be caught and then youd never get another chance but how can i stay here he demanded even under the best of circumstances im he hesitated but finished the thought as hed intended im not a thanasiot nor likely to become one i know that now i know what you mean olyvria answered unhappily phostis noted she had not said she agreed with him she shook her head id better go she hurried away he started to call after her but in the end did not he kicked at the gluey ground underfoot in the romances all your problems were supposed to be over when you made love to the beautiful girl olyvria was pretty enough no doubt about that but as far as phostis could see making love to her had only complicated his life further he wondered why the romances were so popular if they were also so far removed from actuality that notion disturbed him he thought the popular should match the real then he realized that simple paintings in bright colors might be easier to appreciate than more highly detailed onesand honey was sweeter than the usual mix of flavors life presented none of which helped him in his present complexities here at last hed found a woman who he believed wanted him only for himself not because of the rank he held or the advantage she might gain from sleeping with himand who was she not just the woman who had kidnapped him and who was the daughter of the rebel who held him prisoner that would have been muddle enough by itself but there was more for all her fencing with him about it he knew she took thanasiot principles seriouslya lot more seriously than livanios if phostis was any judge and thanasios to put it mildly had not thought well of the flesh phostis still distrusted his own flesh too but he was coming to the sometimes reluctant conclusion that it was part of what made him himself not just an unfortunate adjunct to his spirit that ought to be discarded as quickly as possible almost as vividly as if he were in her arms again he remembered the feel of olyvrias warm sweet body pressed against him sometimes he was not so reluctant about that conclusion too he knew he wanted her again when and as he got the chance digenis would not have approved he knew that too now though he hadnt talked with the fiery priest or come under the spell of his words for several months and hed seen far more of the way the thanasioi ran their lives than he had when hed listened to digenis back in videssos the city much of it he still found admirablemuch of it but a long way from all reality had a way of intruding on digenis bright wordpictures no less than on those of the romancers if olyvria was heading back toward the fortress of etchmiadzin phostis decided he ought to stay away awhile longer so as not to make anyone there draw a connection between them it was a nice calculation if he just followed her back he might arouse suspicion if he stayed away too long syagrios would track him like hound after hare he didnt want syagrios to have to do that it would anger the ruffian and phostis cherished the limited freedom hed so slowly regained he had a few coins in his belt pouch winnings at the battle game he spent a silver piece on a leg of roasted fowl and a hard roll then carefully put the coppers from his change back into the pouch hed learned about haggling it was what you did when you were short of money hed got good at it despite krispos firm hand hed never been short of money before he ended up in etchmiadzin he was chewing on the roll when artapan strode by the wizard full of his own affairs didnt notice him phostis decided to try to find out where he was going in such a hurry ever since hed realized artapan was from makuran hed wondered just how the mage fit into livanios plans or perhaps how livanios fit into artapans plans maybe now he could learn hed followed the wizard for half a furlong before he realized he was liable to get in trouble if artapan did discover him dogging his tracks he tried to be sneakier keeping people and once a donkey cart between the mage and him dodging from doorway to doorway after another couple of minutes he concluded he could do just about anything short of walking up tapping artapan on the shoulder and asking him for the time of day artapan plainly had something on his mind he looked neither to the left nor to the right and marched down the muddy streets of etchmiadzin as if they were cobblestoned boulevards the wizard rapped on the door of a house separated from its neighbors by dank narrow alleys after a moment he went inside phostis ducked into one of the alleys he promptly regretted it someone was in the habit of dumping slops there the stink almost made him cough he jammed a sleeve into his mouth and breathed hard through his nose till the spasm passed but he did not leave a little slit window let him hear what was going on inside he wouldnt have put a window there but maybe it had been made before anyone started emptying chamber pots in the alley artapan was saying how fare you today supremely holy tzepeas the answer came in a dragging whisper soon i shall be free skotos and his entrapping world cling hard to me already most who abandon what is falsely called nourishment for as long as i have are on the journey behind the sun but still i remain wrapped in the flesh that disfigures the soul what do you want with one who has starved himself to the point of death phostis almost shouted it at the makuraner wizard if hes chosen to do it let him alone with his choice you want then to leave this world artapans accented voice held wonder phostis wondered about that the four prophets had their holy ascetics too what will you find do you think light just for a word tzepeas voice came strong and clear as if he were a wellfed man rather than a shivering bag of bones as he continued it faded again i shall be part of phos eternal light too long have i lingered in this sinfilled place would you seek help in leaving it artapan had moved while tzepeas was talking now he sounded as if he was right beside the starving thanasiot i dont know tzepeas said is it permitted of course the wizard answered smoothly but a moment and you shall meet your good god face to face my good god tzepeas said indignantly he is the good god the lord with the great and good mind he the zealots voice which had risen again suddenly broke off phostis heard a couple of very faint thumps as if a man with no muscles left was trying to struggle against someone far stronger than he the thumps soon ceased artapan began a soft chant partly in the makuraner tonguewhich phostis did not understand and partly in videssian phostis knew he was missing some of what the mage said but what he heard was quite enough unless hed gone completely mad he could only conclude artapan was using tzepeas death energy to further his own sorceries phostis stomach lurched harder than it ever had while sailing on the videssian sea he sickly wondered how many starving thanasioi hadnt finished the course they set out to travel but were instead shoved from it by the makuraner wizard for his own purposes the one was bad enough the other struck phostis as altogether abominable and who would ever know artapan came out of the house phostis flattened himself against the wall the wizard walked on by he wasnt quite rubbing his hands with glee but he gave that impression again he had no time to look around for details as small as phostis phostis waited until he was sure artapan was gone then cautiously emerged from the alley what do i do now he said out loud his first thought was to run to livanios with the story as fast as his legs would carry him a version of the tale hed tell formed in his mind after id had your daughter i found out your pet wizard was going around killing devout thanasioi before they could die on their own he shook his head like a lot of first thoughts that one needed some work all right suppose he managed not to mention olyvria and also managed to convince livanios he was telling the truth about artapan what then how much good would that do him if livanios didnt know what the mage was up to maybe quite a lot but what if he did in that case the only thing phostis saw in his own future was a lot more troublesomething hed not imagined possible when he woke up after olyvria drugged him and he could not tell whether livanios knew or not it came down to the question hed been asking himself ever since he learned artapans name was livanios the wizards puppet or the other way round he didnt know the answer to that either or how to find out from olyvria he thought but even she might well not know for certain shed know what her father thought but that might not be what was so videssian history was littered with men whod thought themselves in chargeuntil the worlds theyd made crashed down around them anthimos had been sure he held a firm grip on the empireuntil krispos took it away from him and so when phostis got back to the fortress he did not go looking for livanios instead he headed over to the corner where as usual several men gathered around a couple of players hunched over the game board the soldiers moved away from him wrinkling their noses one of them said you may have been born a toff friend but you smell like youve been wading in shit phostis remembered the stinking alleyway where hed stood he should have done a better job of cleaning his shoes after he came out then he thought of what artapan had done in the house by the alleyway how was he supposed to clean that from his memory he looked at the soldier maybe i have he said ix wall roofs streets new leavesall glistened with rain under the bright sun it made them seem to krispos brighter and more vivid than they really were as if the showeror perhaps the seasonhad washed the whole world clean the clouds that had dropped the rain on videssos the city were now just small gray fluffy lumps diminishing toward the east the rest of the sky was the glorious blue the enamel makers kept tryingand failingto match with glass paste with the wary eye of one who has had to watch the weather for the sake of his crops krispos looked not east at the receding rain clouds but west whence new weather would come he tasted the breeze between his tongue and the roof of his mouth that it came straight off the sea gave it a salt tang hed not had to worry about in his peasant days but hed learned to allow for that he sucked in another breath tasting that one too when at last he spat it out hed made up his mind spring is really here he declared your majesty has in the past been remarkably accurate with such predictions barsymes said as close as he ever came to alluding to krispos decidedly unimperial birth it matters more this year than most krispos said for as soon as i can be sureor at least can expectthe roads will stay dry i have to move against the thanasioi the less chance they have of getting loose and raiding the better off the westlands and the whole empire will be the city has stayed quiet since midwinters day for which phos be praised aye whenever krispos prayed he made a point of reminding the good god how grateful he was for that he still did not completely trust the calm that had prevailed through winter and now up to the borderland of spring he kept wondering whether he was walking on a thin crust of ice over freezing waterthe images from skotos hell seemed particularly fitting if the crust ever broke he might be dragged down to doom but so far it had held i believe your majesty handled the matter of the priest digenis with as much discretion as was practicable the vestiarios said just letting him go out like a guttering taper you mean all he wanted to do was raise a ruction smothering his end in silence is the best revenge on him if phos is kind the chroniclers will forget his name as the people haveso far forgotten to rally to the cause he preached barsymes looked at him out of the corners of his eyes that had seen so much and when you fare forth on campaign your majesty will you then leave videssos the city ungarrisoned oh of course krispos answered and laughed to make sure his vestiarios knew he was not in earnest wouldnt that be lovely beating the thanasioi in the field and coming back to find my capital closed against me it wont happen not if i can find any way around it whom shall you name to command the city garrison barsymes asked do you know esteemed sir i was thinking of giving the job to evripos krispos spoke in a deliberately neutral tone if barsymes had anything to say against the appointment of his middle son he didnt want to intimidate the eunuch into keeping his mouth shut barsymes tasted the appointment with the same sort of thoughtful attention krispos had given to the weather after a similar pause for that consideration the vestiarios answered that may serve very nicely your majesty by all accounts the young majesty acquitted himself well in the westlands he did krispos agreed not only that soldiers followed where he led which is a magic that cant be taught ill also leave behind some steady officer who can try to keep him from doing anything too rash if the need arises thats sensible barsymes replied saying by not saying that he would have reckoned krispos daft for doing anything else it will be valuable experience for the young majesty especially ifif other matters do not eventuate as we would desire phostis still lives krispos said suddenly zaidas sorcery continues to confirm that and hes fairly sure phostis is in etchmiadzin where the rebels seem to have their headquarters hes made real headway in penetrating the masking sorcery since we realized it springs from makuran his briefly kindled enthusiasm faded fast of course he has no way of telling what phostis believes these days there lay the nut of it as was krispos way in one sentence the avtokrator shook his head phostis was so young who could say what latest enthusiasm hed seized on at that same age krispos knew hed had a good core of solid sense but at just past twenty hed been a peasant still and he could imagine no stronger dose of reality than that phostis had grown up in the palaces where flights of fancy were far more easily sustained and phostis had always taken pleasure in going dead against whatever krispos had in mind what of katakolon barsymes asked ill take him with meill need one spatharios at any rate krispos said he did tolerably well in the westlands himself and rather better than that during the midwinters day riots one thing these past few months have taught me all my sons need such training in command as i can give them counting on phos mercy instead of providing for the times to come is foolish and wasteful few have accused your majesty of harboring those traits none truthfully for which believe me you have my thanks krispos said find evripos for me would you ive not yet told him what i have in mind of course your majesty barsymes went back inside the imperial residence krispos stood and enjoyed the sunshine the cherry trees around the residence were putting on leaves soon for a few glorious weeks theyd be a riot of sweet pink and white blossoms krispos thoughts drifted away from them and back toward raising troops moving troops supplying troops he sighed being avtokrator meant having to worry about things youd rather ignore he wondered if the rebels hed put down ever realized how much work the job of ruling the empire really was he certainly hadnt back when he took it away from anthimos if i thought livanios wouldnt botch things i ought to give him the crown and let him see how he likes it he thought angrily but he knew that would never happen the only way livanios would take the crown from him was by prying it out of his dead fingers what is it father evripos asked coming up in barsymes wake the wariness in his voice was different from what krispos was used to hearing from phostis phostis and he simply disagreed every chance they got evripos resented being born second it made his opinions not worth serious disagreement or it had made them so now krispos explained what he had in mind for his son this is serious business he emphasized if real trouble does come i wont want you throwing out orders at random thats why ill leave a steady captain with you i expect you to heed his advice on matters military evripos had puffed out his chest with pride at the trust krispos placed in him now he said but what if i think hes wrong father obey him anyhow krispos started to say but the words did not pass his lips he remembered when petronas had maneuvered him into the position of vestiarios for anthimos the thenavtokrators uncle had made it very clear that he expected nothing but obedience to him from krispos he remembered asking petronas a question very similar to the one hed just heard from evripos you have command he said slowly if you think your advisor is wrong youd better do what you reckon right but you have to remember son that with command comes responsibility if you choose to go against the officer i give you and your course goes wrong you will answer to me do you understand aye father i do youre telling me id better be sureand even if i am sure id better be right is that the meat of it thats it exactly krispos agreed im not putting you in this place as part of a game evripos the post is not only real but also important a mistake would be important too in how much damage it could do so if you go off on your own against the advice of a man older and wiser than you are what you do had better not turn out badly for your sake and the empires both with the prickliness of youth evripos bristled like a hedgehog how do you know this officer youll appoint for me will be smarter than i am i didnt say that youre as smart as youll ever be son and i have no reason to doubt thats very smart indeed but youre not as wise as youre going to be say twenty years from now wisdom comes from using the wits you have to think on whats happened to you during your life and you havent lived long enough yet to have stored up much of it evripos looked eloquently unconvinced krispos didnt blame him at evripos age he hadnt believed experience mattered either now that he had a good deal of it he was sure hed been wrong beforebut the only way for evripos to come to the same conclusion was with the slow passage of the years he couldnt afford to wait for that his middle son said suppose this officer you name suggests a course i think is wrong but i go along with it for fear of what youve just said and suppose it does turn out to be the wrong course what then father maybe you should be pleading your case in the courts not commanding men in the field krispos said but the question was too much to the point to be answered with a sour joke slowly the avtokrator went on if i put you in the post you will be the commander when the time comes making the judgment will be up to you thats the hardest burden anyone can lay on a man if you dont care to bear it speak up now oh ill bear it father i just wanted to be sure i understood what you were asking of me evripos said good krispos said ill give you one piece of advice and one onlyi know how you wont much care to listen its just this if you have to decide do it firmly no matter how much doubt no matter how much fear and trembling you feel dont let it show half the business of leading people is just keeping up a solid front that may be worth remembering evripos said as big a concession as krispos knew he was likely to get his son asked what will katakolon be doing while im here in the city hell go the westlands as my spatharios another campaign will do him good i think ah if evripos wanted to take issue with that he didnt find any way to manage it after a pause a tiny bit longer than a more experienced man would have given he nodded brusquely and changed the subject i hope ill serve as youd have me do father i hope you will too i dont see any reason why you shouldnt if the lord with the great and good mind hears my prayers youll have a quiet time of it i dont really want you to see action here youd better understand that the less fighting there is the happier ill be then why take the army out evripos asked krispos sighed because sometimes its needful as you know very well if i dont go to the fighting this summer it will come to me given that choice id sooner do it on my own terms or as nearly as i can aye that makes sense evripos said after a moments thought sometimes the world wont let you have things all as youd like them he was probably speaking from bitterness at not being first in line for the throne nonetheless krispos was moved to reach out and set a hand on his shoulder thats an important truth son youd do well to remember it it was he thought a truth phostis hadnt fully graspedbut then phostis as firstborn hadnt had the need each son was so different from the other two wheres katakolon do you know evripos pointed one of the rooms down that hallway second or third on the left i think thanks later krispos realized he hadnt asked what his youngest son was doing if evripos knew he kept his mouth shut a useful ploy he might well have picked up from his father krispos walked down the hallway the second chamber on the left a sewing room for the serving women was empty the door to the third room on the left was closed krispos worked the latch he saw a tangle of bare arms and legs heard a couple of horrified squawks and shut the door again in a hurry he stood chuckling in the hall until katakolon his robe rumpled and his face red came out a couple of minutes later he let katakolon steer him down the corridor and was anything but surprised to hear the door open and close behind him he didnt look back but started to laugh katakolon gave him a dirty look whats so funny you are krispos answered i do apologize for interrupting katakolons glare got blacker but he seemed confused as well as annoyed is that all youre going to say yes i think so after all its nothing i havent seen before remember i was anthimos vestiarios he decided not to go into detail about anthimos orgies katakolon was too likely to try imitating them looking at his youngest sons face krispos had all he could do to keep from laughing again katakolon was obviously having heavy going imagining his rather paunchy graybearded father reveling with an avtokrator who even after a generation remained a byword for debauchery of all sorts krispos patted his son on the back you have to bear in mind lad that once upon a time i wasnt a creaking elder i had the same yen for good wine and bad women as any other young man yes father katakolon said but not as if he believed it sighing krispos said if you have too much trouble picturing me with a zest for life try to imagine iakovitzes say as a young man the exercise will do your wits good he gave katakolon credit the youth visibly did try after a few seconds he whistled hed have been something wouldnt he oh he was krispos said hes still something come to that all at once he wondered if iakovitzes had ever tried his blandishments on katakolon he didnt think the old lecher would have got anywhere like his other two sons his youngest seemed interested only in women if iakovitzes had ever tried to seduce katakolon or one of the other boys theyd never brought krispos the tale now let me tell you why i interrupted you at a tender moment krispos explained what he had in mind for the most junior avtokrator of course father ill come with you and help as i can katakolon said when he was done of the three boys he was the most tractable even the stubborn streak he shared with his brothers and krispos was in him goodnatured i dont expect ill be busy every moment and some of the provincial lasses last summer were tastier than id have expected away from the capital when do we start out as soon as the roads are dry dry himself krispos added you wont be devastating the local girls by leaving quite yet all right katakolon said in that case if youll excuse me he started down the hall more purpose in his stride than on any mission for his father krispos wondered if hed burned that hot at seventeen he probably had but he had almost as much trouble believing it as katakolon did in placing him at one of anthimos revels livanios addressed his assembled fighters soon we fare forth both to fight and to advance along the gleaming path we shall not go alone by the lord with the great and good mind i swear our trouble will not be raising men but rather making sure we are not overwhelmed by those who would join us we shall spread across the countryside like a fire through grassland no one and nothing can hold us back the men cheered by their look a good many of them were herders from the westlands central plateau lean weatherbeaten sunbaked men intimately acquainted with grass fires now they carried javelins in their hands not staves they were not the bestdisciplined troops in the world but fanaticism went a long way toward making up for sloppy formations phostis cheered when everyone else did standing there silent and glum would have got him noticed and not in a way he wanted he was trying to cultivate invisibility the way a farmer cultivated radishes he wished livanios would forget he existed the heresiarch was in full spate the leeches who live in videssos the city think they can suck our lifes blood forever well show them theyre wrong by the good god and if the gleaming path leads through the smoking ruins of the palaces built from poor mens blood why then it does more cheers phostis didnt feel quite such a hypocrite in joining these the ostentatious wealth the capital held was what had made him flirt with the doctrines of the thanasioi in the first place but livanios speech was a harangue and nothing more if any avtokrator of recent generations was sensitive to the peasants plight it was krispos phostis was sick of hearing how his father had been taxed off his land but he knew the experience made krispos want not to visit it on anyone else well hang up the fat ecclesiastics by their thumbs too livanios shouted whatever gold the emperors dont get the clerics do has phos the need for fancy houses no the men roared back and phostis with them in spite of everything he still had some sympathy for what thanasios had preached he wondered if livanios could truly say the same and he wondered still more just how much hold artapan had on the rebel leader he was no closer to knowing that for certain than he had been on the day when he and olyvria first became lovers whenever she crossed his mind his blood ran hotter digenis would have scolded him or more likely given up on him as an incorrigible sinner and sensualist he didnt care he wanted her more with every passing dayand he knew she also wanted him theyd managed to join twice more since that first time once late at night up in his little cell while the guard snored down the hall and once in a quiet corridor carved into the stone beneath the keep both couplings were almost as hurried and frantic as the first had been neither was what phostis had in mind when he thought of making love but they inflamed him and olyvria for more was what he felt the love of which the romancers sang he knew little firsthand of love around the palaces seduction and hedonism were more often on display his own father and mother seemed to have got on well but hed still been a boy when dara died zaidas and aulissa were called a love match but the wizardaside from being krispos crony which of itself made him suspecthad to be close to forty could an old man really be in love phostis couldnt tell if he was in love himself all he knew was that he missed olyvria desperately that when they were apart every moment dragged as if it were an hour that every stolen hour together somehow flashed by like a moment lost in his own thoughts he missed livanios last few sentences they brought loud cheers from the assembled soldiers phostis cheered too as he had all through the heresiarchs speech then one of the fighters who knew who he was turned round and slapped him on the back so youre going to fight with us for the gleaming path are you friend the fellow boomed his grin had almost as many gaps as syagrios im going to what phostis said foolishly it wasnt that he didnt believe his ears more that he didnt want to surelike livanios said just now the soldier wrinkled his brow trying to recall his chiefs exact words take up the blade against maternalismsomething like that anyways materialism phostis corrected before he wondered why he bothered yeah thats it the soldier said happily thank you friend by the good god im right glad the emperors sons taken up with righteousness moving as if in a daze phostis made his way toward the citadel fighters who recognized him kept coming up and congratulating him on taking up arms for the thanasiot cause by the time he got inside he was sore and bruised while his wits had taken a worse pummeling than his back livanios was using his name to raise the spirits of the thanasiot warriors so much was clear but life in the palace while it left phostis ignorant of love made him look beneath the surface of machinations with as little effort as he used to breathe not only would his name spur on the followers of the gleaming path it would also dismay those who clove to his father and if he fought alongside the thanasioi he might never be reconciled with krispos further livanios might arrange a heros death for him that would embarrass the avtokrator as much as having him alive and fighting and would hurt krispos a good deal more and it would serve livanios ends very well indeed syagrios found phostis phostis might have guessed the ruffian would come looking for him from the nasty grin on syagrios face hed known about livanios scheme before the heresiarch announced it to his men in fact phostis thought with the taut nerves of a man who genuinely has been persecuted syagrios might well have come up with it himself so youre going to be a man before your mother are you stripling he said making cutandthrust motions right in front of phostis face go out there and make the gleaming path proud of you boy ill do what i can phostis was aware of the ambiguity but let it lay he did not want to hear syagrios speak of his mother he wanted to smash the ruffian for presuming to speak of her only a wellfounded apprehension that syagrios would smash him instead kept him from trying it that was yet another thing the romances didnt talk about their heroes always beat the villains just because they were heroes no writer of romances phostis was certain had ever met syagrios for that matter both sides here thought they were heroes and their foes villains i swear by the good god ill never read another romance again as long as i live phostis thought syagrios said i dont know what you know about weapons but whatever it is you better practice it whoever you fight aint gonna care that youre the avtokrators brat i suppose not phostis said in a hollow voice that set syagrios laughing anew hed actually had some training his father had thought hed find it useful he didnt mention it the more hopeless a dub everyone took him for the less attention people would pay him he went up the black spiral stairway to his little chamber when he opened the door his mouth fell open in astonishment olyvria waited inside he was not too surprised however to shut the door behind him as fast as he could what are you doing here he demanded do you want to get us both caught she grinned at him what could be safer she whispered back everyone in the keep was down in the courtyard listening to my father phostis wanted to rush to her and take her in his arms but that brought him up short yes and do you know what your father said he whispered and went on to explain exactly what livanios had announced oh no olyvria said still in a tiny voice he wants you dead then i prayed he wouldnt thats what i think too phostis agreed bitterly but what can i do about it i dont know olyvria reached out to him he hurried over to her her touch made him if not forget everything else then at least reckon it unimportant for as long as he held her but he remembered how careful they had to be even while her thighs clasped his flanks what should have been sighs of delight came from both of them as tiny hisses as theyd grown used to doing they set their clothes to rights as fast as they could when they were through not for them the pleasure of lying lazily by each other afterward how will we get you out of here phostis whispered before olyvria could say anything he found the answer for himself ill go downstairs whoevers out thereprobably syagrios will follow me once were gone you can come down too olyvria nodded yes thats very good it should work few of the rooms in this hallway have people in them so im not likely to be seen till im safely down she looked at him with some of her old calculation he liked the soft looks he usually got from her these days better but she said you wouldnt have found a plan so fast when we first brought you here maybe not he admitted ive had to take care of a good many things i wasnt in the habit of doing for myself he touched the very tip of her breast through her tunic just for a moment some of them i like better than others you dont mean im your first that thought almost startled her into raising her voice he made an alarmed gesture but she was already shaking her head no i couldnt have been no of course not he said youre the first who matters though she leaned forward and brushed her lips against his thats a sweet thing to say it must not have been easy for you growing up as you did he shrugged he supposed the problem was that he just thought too much evripos and especially katakolon seemed to have had no trouble enjoying themselves immensely but all that was by the way he got to his feet ill leave you now listen to make sure everythings quiet before you come out he took a step toward the door stopped then turned back to olyvria i love you her arched eyebrows lifted you hadnt said that before i love youbut then you know i must or i wouldnt be here in spite of my father yes phostis thought he knew that but hed been raised to see plots so sometimes he found them even when they werent there here though he had toand wanted totake the chance he stepped into the hallway sure enough there sat syagrios the ruffian leered at him so you found out you cant hide in there did you now what are you going to do head down and celebrate that you got turned into a soldier as a matter of fact yes phostis answered he had the somber satisfaction of seeing syagrios jaw sag after lighting a taper to keep from killing himself on the dark stairway he headed down toward the ground floor of the keep syagrios muttered under his breath but followed phostis had all he could do to keep from whistling on the stairs letting syagrios know hed put one over on him wouldnt do outside the southern end of the great double wall that warded the landward side of videssos the city lay a broad stretch of meadow on which the empires cavalry practiced their maneuvers fresh new grass poked through the mud and the dead grayish remains of last years growth as krispos came out to watch his soldiers exercise dont be too hard on them too soon your majesty sarkis urged theyre still ragged from being cooped up through the winter i know thatwe have done this business a few times before krispos answered amiably enough but well go on campaign as soon as weather and supplies allow and if theyre still ragged then it will cost lives and maybe battles they wont be sarkis put grim promise into his voice krispos smiled hed hoped to hear that note a company rode hard toward upright bales of hay that simulated an enemy they drew up eighty or ninety yards away plied the targets with arrows as rapidly as they could draw bow and then at an officers command yanked out their swords and charged the imaginary foe with fierce and sanguinary roars the iron blades glittering in the bright sun made a fine martial spectacle nonetheless krispos turned to sarkis and remarked this whole business of war would be a lot easier if the thanasioi didnt fight back any harder than those bales sarkis doughy face twitched in a grin isnt it the truth your majesty every general wants every campaign to be a walkover but you can make yourself a reputation that will live forever if you get one of those in a lifetime the trouble is you see the chap on the other side wants his walkover too and doesnt much care to cooperate in yours rude and inconsiderate of him if you ask me at the very least krispos agreed after the company of archers reassembled well beyond the hay bales another unit approached and pelted the targets with javelins farther away a regiment split in two to get in some more realistic mounted swordwork they tried not to hurt one another in practices like that but krispos knew the healers would have some extra work tonight their spirits seem as high as you could hope for sarkis said judiciously no hesitation about going out for another crack at the heretics anyhow he used the word with no irony whatever though his own beliefs were anything but orthodox krispos didnt twit him about it not today after some thought hed figured out the difference between the vaspurakaners heterodoxy and that of the thanasioi the princes might not want any part of that version of the faith that emanated from videssos the city but they also werent interested in imposing their version on videssos the city krispos could live with that he said where do you suppose the thanasioi will pop up this season wherever they can make the worst nuisances of themselves sarkis answered at once livanios proved how dangerous he is last year he wont hurt us in a small way if he has the chance to hurt us in a big one since that accorded all too well with krispos view of the situation he only grunted by way of reply not far away a youngster in gilded chain mail rode up to the haybale targets and flung light spears at them katakolons aim wasnt bad but could have been better krispos cupped his hands to his mouth and yelled everybody knows you can use your lance son but youve got to get the javelin down too katakolons head whipped around he spotted his father and stuck out his tongue at him ribald howls rose from the horsemen who heard sarkis chuckle held dry amusement youll give him a reputation that way i suppose its what you have in mind as a matter of fact yes if youre a lecher at my age youre a laughingstock but young men pride themselves on how hard they can goso to speak so to speak indeed sarkis chuckled again even more dryly than before then he sighed we ought to get some practice in ourselves battles take funny turns sometimes so we should krispos sighed too the good god knows ill be sore for a long time after i start working though i begin to see i wont be able to go out on a campaign forever you sarkis ran a hand along his own corpulent frame your majesty youre still svelte ive put almost another me inside my mail here krispos made an imperial decision ill start exercising tomorrow the trouble with being avtokrator was that none of the demands of the job went away when you concentrated on any one thing you had to plug leaks everywhere at once or some of them would get beyond the plugging stage while you werent watching he went back to the palaces to make sure he didnt fall too far behind on matters of trade and commerce he was examining customs reports from prista the imperial outpost on the northern shore of the videssian sea when someone tapped on the door to the study he glanced up expecting to see barsymes or another of the chamberlains but it was none of themit was drina his frown was almost a scowl she should have known better than to bother him while he was working yes he said curtly drina looked more than nervousshe looked frightened she dropped to her knees and then to her belly in a full proskynesis krispos took a couple of seconds to wonder about the propriety of having the woman who warmed his bed prostrate herself before him but by the time he decided she neednt bother she was already rising but she kept her eyes to the floor her voice was small and her stammer large as she began may it pplease your majesty with that start it probably wouldnt krispos almost said as much the only thing that held him back was a strong suspicion shed flee if he pressed her too hard since shed braved bearding him at his work whatever she had on her mind was important to her trying at least to sound neutral he asked whats troubling you drina your majesty im pregnant she blurted he opened his mouth to answer her but no words came out after a little while he realized she didnt need to keep looking at the back of his throat he needed two tries to close his mouth but managed in the end youre telling me its mine he got out at last drina nodded your majesty i didnti mean i havent so it must she spread her hands as if that would help her explain better than her tongue which seemed as fumbling as krispos well well he said and then again because it let him make noise without making sense well well another pause and he produced a coherent sentence then a second one i didnt expect that to happen if it was the night i think it was i didnt expect anything to happen people never do your majesty drina tried a wary smile but still looked ready to run away but it does happen or there wouldnt be any more people after a while the thanasioi would like that he thought he shook his head drina was too much a creature of her body and her urges ever to make a thanasiot just as he was himself an imperial bastard he said more to himself than to her is it your first your majesty she asked now fear and a peculiar sort of pride warred in her voice she held her chin a little higher the first time ive fathered a child since dara died you mean no krispos said it happened twice before as a matter of fact but once the mother miscarried and the other time the babe lived but a couple of days phos choice not mine if thats what youre wondering both were years ago i thought my seed had gone cold i hope your luck will be better hearing that she let her face open up like a flower suddenly touched by the sun oh thank you your majesty she breathed neither you nor the child will ever want krispos promised if you dont know i care for my own you dont know me for the past twenty years the whole empire had been his own maybe that was why he worried so much about every detail of its life everyone knows your majesty is kind and generous drinas smile got wider still everyone doesnt know any such thing he answered sharply so you dont misunderstand here are two things i wont do number one i wont marry you i wont let this babe disturb the succession if it turns out to be a boy trying to get me to break my word about that will be the fastest way you can think of to make me angry do you have that yes she whispered the smile flickered im sorry to speak so plain to you but i want to leave you in no doubt about these matters krispos said here is the second thing if you have a swarm of relatives who descend on me looking for jobs with no work for high pay theyll go home to wherever they came from with stripes on their backs i already told you i wont stint on what i give you and of course you may share that with whomever you like but the fisc is not a toy and it does have a bottom all right your majesty how can the likes of me argue with whatever you choose to do drina sounded frightened again the plain answer was that she couldnt krispos didnt say that it would just have alarmed her further what he did say was go and tell barsymes what youve just told me tell him i said youre to be treated with every consideration too i will your majesty thank you uh your majesty what now krispos asked when she showed no sign of saying anything more than uh will you still want me she said and then stood there as if she wished the mosaic floor would open and swallow her up like most videssians she was oliveskinned krispos thought he saw her blush anyhow he got up came around the desk and put an arm around her i expect so now and again he said but if you have some young man waiting under the amphitheater for the next race so to speak dont be shy about saying so i wouldnt have you do anything you dont care to hed watched anthimos take advantage of so many women that moderation came easy to him anything anthimos did was a good bet to have been wrong its not that drina said quickly i justworry that youll forget about me i already said i wouldnt i do keep my word thinking she needed more reassurance than words he patted her on the backside she sighed and snuggled against him he let her stay for a bit then said go on go see barsymes hell take care of you snuffling a little drina went krispos stood in the study listening to her footsteps fade as she walked down the hall when he couldnt hear them any more he returned to his seat and to the customs reports hed been reviewing but he soon found he had to shove aside the parchments he couldnt concentrate on what was in them an imperial bastard he said quietly my bastard well well what am i going to do about that he was a man who believed in making plans as implicitly as he believed in phos fathering a child at his age wasnt in any of those hed made so far no help for it he told himself ill have to come up with some new ones he knew he might not need them so many children never lived to grow up as in so many things though better to have and not need than to need and not have besides you always hoped your children lived unless you were a fanatical thanasiot who thought all life ought to vanish from the earth and be quick about it too if he had a daughter things would stay simple when she grew up hed do his best to make sure she married someone well disposed to him that was what marriages were for after all joining together families that could be useful to each other if he had a son now he clicked his tongue between his teeth that would complicate matters some avtokrators had their bastards made into eunuchs some had risen to high rank in the temples or at the palace it was certainly one way of guaranteeing the boy would never challenge his legitimate sons for the throne being physically imperfect eunuchs could not claim imperial rank in videssos or makuran or any other country he knew of krispos made that clicking noise again he wasnt sure he had the stomach for that no matter how expedient it might be he stared down at the delicately veined marble desktop wondering what to do he was so lost in his thoughts the tap on the door frame made him jump he looked up this time it was barsymes i am given to understand congratulations are in order your majesty the vestiarios said carefully thank you esteemed sir im given to understand the same thing myself krispos managed a rueful laugh life has a way of going off on its own path not the one youd choose for it very true as you have requested every care will be given to the mothertobe as part of that care i gather you will want to ensure so far as is feasible that she does not acquire an exaggerated notion either of her own station or that of her offspring youve hit in the center of the target barsymes can you imagine me say disinheriting the sons i have for the sake of a byblow not a cook could find a better recipe for civil war after im gone what you say is true your majesty and yet barsymes stepped out into the hallway looked right and left even after he was sure no one save krispos could hear him he lowered his voice and yet your majesty one of your sons may be lost to you and youve not expressed entire satisfaction with any of them but why should i expect the next one to be any better krispos said besides id have to wait twenty years to have any idea what sort of man he is and who says i have twenty years left i might aye but the odds arent the best so id sooner discommode the one young bastard than the three older legitimate boys i would not think of faulting the logic i merely wondered if your majesty had fully considered the situation i see you have well and good the vestiarios ran pale tongue across paler lips i also wondered if you were ah besotted with the mother of the childtobe so id do stupid things to keep her happy you mean krispos said barsymes nodded krispos started to laugh but restrained himselfthat would have been cruel no esteemed sir drinas very pleasant but ive not lost my head ah barsymes said again he seldom showed muchemotion and this moment was no exception to the rule nonetheless krispos thought he heard relief in that single syllable ive not lost my head that might have been the watchword for his reign and for his life if it had left him on the coldblooded side it had also given the empire of videssos more than two decades of steady sensible rule there were worse exchanges he remembered the thought hed had before esteemed sir may i ask a question that might perturb you please understand my aim is not to cause you pain but to learn ask your majesty barsymes replied at once you are the avtokrator you have the right very well then to make sure dynastic problems dont come up avtokrators have been known to make eunuchs of their bastard offspring you know your life as only one who lives it can what have you to say of it the vestiarios gave the question his usual grave consideration the pain of the gelding does not last forever of course i have never known desire so i do not particularly pine for it though that is not true of all my kind but being set aside forever from the general run of mankindthere is the true curse of the eunuch your majesty so far as any of us knows it has no balm thank you esteemed sir krispos put the thought in the place where bad ideas belong he felt an urgent need to change the subject by the good god he exclaimed as heartily as he could barsymes raised an interrogative eyebrow he explained no matter how smoothly things go ill never hear the end of teasing about this from my sons ive given them a hard time about their affairs but now im the one whos gone and put a loaf in a serving maids oven i pray your majesty to forgive me but youve forgotten something barsymes said now it was krispos turn to look puzzled the vestiarios went on think what the eminent iakovitzes will say krispos thought after a moment he pushed back his seat and hid under the desk hed seldom made barsymes laugh but he added one to the short list he laughed too as he reemerged but he still dreaded what would happen the next time he saw his special envoy phostis made sure the sword fit loose in its sheath it was not a fancy weapon with a goldchased hilt like the one hed carried before he was kidnapped just a curved blade a leatherwrapped grip and an iron hand guard it would slice flesh as well as any other sword though the horse they gave him wasnt fit to haul oats to the imperial stables it was a scrawny swaybacked gelding with scars on its knees and an evil glint in its eye by the monster of a bit that went with the rest of its tack it must have had a mouth made of wrought iron and a temper worthy of skotos but it was a horse and the thanasioi let him ride it that marked a change for the better it would have been better still had syagrios not joined the band to which phostis had been attached what you thought youd be rid of me he boomed when phostis could not quite hide his lack of enthusiasm not so easy as that boy phostis shrugged in control of himself again if nothing else we can spar at the board game he said syagrios laughed in his face i never bother with that dung when im out fighting its for slack times when theres no real blood to be spilled his narrow eyes lit up with anticipation the raiders rode out of etchmiadzin that afternoon a party of about twentyfive heading south and east toward territory the men of the gleaming path did not control excitement ran high everyone was eager to bring thanasios doctrines a step closer to reality by destroying the material goods of those who did not follow them the bands leader a toughlooking fellow named themistios seemed almost as unsavory as syagrios he put the theology in terms no one could fail to follow burn the farms burn the monasteries kill the animals kill the people they go straight to the ice any of us who fall we walk the gleaming path beyond the sun and stay with phos forever the gleaming path the raiders bawled phos bless the gleaming path phostis wondered how many such bands were sallying forth from etchmiadzin and other thanasiot strongholds how many men stormed into the empire with murder and martyrdom warring for the uppermost place in their minds he also wondered where the main body of livanios men would fare syagrios knew but syagrios however much he liked to brag and jeer knew how to keep his mouth shut about things that mattered soon phostis concerns became more immediate not least among them was seeing if he couldnt inconspicuously vanish from the raiding band he couldnt the horsemen kept him in their midst syagrios clung to him like a leech maybe when the fighting starts he thought for the first day and a half of riding they remained in territory under thanasiot rule peasants waved from the fields and shouted slogans at the horsemen as they trotted past the riders shouted back less often as time went by muscles unused since fall were claiming their price phostis hadnt been so saddle sore in years another day on horseback brought the raiders into country where instead of cheering the peasants fled at first sight of them that occasioned argument among phostis companions some wanted to scatter and destroy the peasants and their huts while others preferred to press ahead without delay in the end themistios came down in favor of the second group theres a monastery outside aptos i want to hit he declared and im not going to waste my time with this riffraff till its smashed we can nail peasants on the way home with a large juicy target thus set before them the raiders stopped arguing it would have taken a very bold man to quarrel with themistios anyhow they came to the monastery a little before sunset some of the monks were still in the fields howling like demons the thanasioi rode them down swords rose fell and rose again smeared with scarlet instead of prayers to phos screams rose into the reddening sky well burn the building themistios shouted even monks have too fornicating much he spurred his horse straight toward the monastery gate and got inside before the startled monks could slam it shut against him his sword forced back the first bluerobe who came running up and a moment later more of his wolves were in there with him several of the raiders carried smoldering sticks of punk oilsoaked torches caught quickly syagrios pressed one into phostis hand here he growled do some good with this or else his voice warned so did the way he cocked his sword phostis threw the torch at a wall hed hoped it would fall short and it did but it rolled up against the wood flames crackled caught and began to spread syagrios pounded him on the back as if hed just been initiated into the brotherhood of wreckers shuddering he realized he had a monk waving a cudgel rushed at him shouting something incoherent he wanted to tell the shavenheaded holy man it was all a dreadful mistake that he didnt want to be here and hadnt truly intended to harm the monastery but the monk didnt care about any of that all he wanted to do was smash the closet invaderwho happened to be phostis he parried the bluerobes first wild swipe and his second by the good god cut him syagrios shouted in disgust what do you thinkhes going to get tired and go away phostis didnt quite parry the third blow it glanced off his shin hard enough to make him bite his lip against the pain he realized with growing dismay that he couldnt just try to hold off the monk not when the fellow wanted nothing more than to kill him the monk drew back his club for yet another swing phostis slashed at him feeling the blade bite behind him syagrios roared with glee phostis would cheerfully have killed the ruffian for forcing him into a position where he either had to hurt the monk or get himself maimed or killed none of the other raiders had any such compunctions several had dismounted the better to torture the monks they overcame screams echoed down the halls that had resounded with hymns of praise to phos watching the thanasioi at their workor was it better called sportphostis felt his stomach lurch like a horse stepping into a snowcovered hole away away themistios shouted itll burn now and we have more to do before we head home what does he have in mind phostis thought about the only thing that fit in with what the raiders had done at the monastery was torching a home for penniless widows and orphans videssos the city had several such he wondered if aptos was a big enough town to boast any he never got the chance to find out for as he and the thanasioi rode away from the monastery a troop of imperial soldiers came storming after them from out of aptos faint in the distance but growing louder fast phostis heard a wary cry hed never imagined could sound so welcome krispos the avtokrator krispos krispos a good many of the thanasioi had bows as well as sabers they started shooting at the imperials the garrison troops like most imperial cavalry were archers too they shot back the advantage lay on their side because they wore mail shirts and helmets while almost all the thanasioi were unarmored phostis yanked his horses head around and booted the animal toward the imperials all he thought about was giving himself up and doing whatever penance the patriarch or some other ecclesiastic set him for his sins in the monastery among the things he forgot was the saber he clutched in his right fist to the onrushing cavalrymen he must have looked like a fanatical thanasiot challenging them singlehanded so he could go straight from death to the gleaming path beyond the sun an arrow whistled past his ear another one buried itself in the ground by the horses forefoot another one hit him in the shoulder at first he felt only the impact and thought a kickedup stone had grazed him then he looked down and saw the pale ash shaft sticking out of him his eyes focused on the gray goose feathers of the fletching how stupid he thought ive been shot by my own fathers men all at once the pain struck and with it weakness his own blood ran hot down his chest and began to stain his tunic he swayed in the saddle more arrows hissed past syagrios came up beside him at a gallop have you gone out of your head he yelled you cant fight them all by yourself his eyes went wide when he saw phostis was wounded see what im telling you we got to get out of here neither phostis wits nor his body was working very well syagrios saw that too he grabbed the reins away from the younger man and led phostis horse alongside his own the horse was nasty and tried to balk syagrios was nastier and wouldnt let it a couple of other thanasioi came back to cover their retreat the weight of armor on the imperial cavalrymen slowed them in a long chase the raiders managed to stay in front until darkness let them give the imperials the slip several were hurt by then and a couple of others lost when their horses went down phostis world focused on the burning in his shoulder everything else seemed far away unimportant he scarcely noticed when the thanasioi halted beside a little stream though not having to fight to stay in the saddle was a relief syagrios advanced on him with a knife well have to tend to that he said here lie flat no one dared light a fire syagrios held his head close to phostis to see what he was doing as he cut the tunic away from the arrow he examined the wound made an abstracted clucking noise and pulled something out of the pouch he wore on his belt whats that phostis asked arrowdrawing spoon syagrios answered cant just pull the fornicating thing out the pointll have barbs hold still and shut up digging in there will hurt but you wont be as torn up inside this way now in spite of syagrios injunction phostis groaned nor were his the only cries that rose to the uncaring sky as the raiders did what they could for their wounded comrades now darkness didnt much matter syagrios was working more by feel than by sight as he forced the narrow cupped end of the spoon down along the arrows shaft toward the head phostis felt the spoon grate on something syagrios grunted in satisfaction here we go now we can get it out wasnt too deepyoure lucky the taste of blood filled phostis mouth hed bitten his lip while the ruffian guddled for the arrow he could smell his own blood too he choked out if i were lucky it would have missed me ha syagrios said cant say youre wrong there hold on now here it comes here it comesyes he got the spoon out of the wound and the arrow with it he grunted again no blood spurtingjust a dribble id say youll make it in place of a canteen the ruffian carried a wineskin on his belt he poured a stream of wine onto phostis wound after the probing with the spoon and the drawing of the arrow the abused flesh felt as if it were being bathed with fire phostis thrashed and swore and clumsily tried to hit syagrios lefthanded easy there curse you syagrios said just hold still you wash out a wound with wine its less likely to rot you want pus and fever you may get em anyways mind but wouldnt you rather bump up your odds he wadded up a rag pressed it to phostis shoulder to soak up the blood that still oozed from the wound and tied it in place with another strip of cloth thank you phostis got out a little slower than he should have he still struggled with the irony of being treated by a man he despised any time syagrios set a hand on his good shoulder i never wouldve thought it but you really do want to walk the gleaming path dont you you laid out that monk fine as you please and then you were ready to take on all the imperials at the same time more brave than smart maybe but to the ice with smart sometimes you done bettern i wouldve dreamed to the ice with smart sometimes phostis repeated wearily at last hed found what it took to satisfy syagrios be too cowardly to refuse what he was ordered and then botch what hed intended as a desertion the moral there was too elusive for him he let out a long worn sigh yeah sleep while you can syagrios said well have some fancy riding to do tomorrow before were sure weve broken loose from the stinking imperials but ive got to get you back to etchmiadzin now that i know for sure youre with us well have all kinds of things we can use you for sleep phostis wouldnt have imagined it possible even though the worst of the agony had left his shoulder now that the arrow was out it still ached like a rotting tooth and throbbed in time to his pulse but as the wild excitement of the ride and the fight faded exhaustion rolled over him like a great black tide rough ground aching shoulderno matter he slept hard he woke from a dream where a wolf was alternately biting and kicking him to find syagrios shaking him back to consciousness the shoulder still hurt fiercely but he managed a nod when the ruffian asked if he could ride he did his best to forget as much as he could of the journey back to etchmiadzin however much he tried he couldnt forget the torment of more wine poured into his wound at every halt the shoulder got hot but only right around the hole in it so he supposed the treatment no matter how agonizing did some good he wished a healerpriest would look at the wound but had not seen any such among the thanasioi that made theological sense if the body like all things of this world sprang from skotos what point to making any special effort to preserve it such an attitude was easy enough to maintain as an abstract principle when it came down to phostis personal body and its pain abstract principles got trivial fast the rising foothills ahead seemed welcome not because etchmiadzin was the home the thanasioi had hoped it would become for him but because they meant the imperial soldiers would not catch him on the road and finish the job of killing him and he reminded himself olyvria would be back at the fortress the aching wound kept him from being as delighted about that as he would have been otherwise when the raiders drew near the valley that cupped etchmiadzin themistios rode up to syagrios and said my men and i will follow the gleaming path against the materialists now go as phos wills you we cannot follow any farther i can take him in from here easy enough syagrios answered nodding do what you need to do themistios and may the good god keep his eyes on you and your lads singing a hymn with thanasiot lyrics the zealots wheeled their horses and rode back out of the holy work of slaughter and destruction syagrios and phostis kept on toward the stronghold of etchmiadzin well get you patched up proper make sure that arms all right before we send you out again syagrios said as the gray stone mass of the fortress came in view might be just as well im here too in case we need to settle anything while livanios is in the field whatever you say all phostis wanted was a chance to get down from his horse and not have to mount again for say the next ten years etchmiadzin seemed strangely spacious as he and syagrios rode through the muddy streets toward the fortress wits dulled by pain and fatigue phostis needed longer than he should have to figure out why at last he realized that most of the soldiers who had swelled the town through the winter were off glorifying the lord with the great and good mind by laying waste to what they reckoned the creations of his evil foe only a couple of sentries stood guard at the fortress gate the inner ward felt empty without warriors at weapons practice or listening to one of livanios orations most of the heresiarchs chief aides seemed to have gone with him at least no one came out of the keep to take a report from syagrios as phostis soon discovered that was because the keep was almost empty too his footsteps and syagrios echoed down the halls that had been crammed with soldiers at least life did exist inside a trooper came out of the chamber where livanios had been wont to hold audiences as if he were avtokrator seeing phostis leaning on syagrios he asked the ruffian what happened to him what does it look like syagrios growled he just found out hes been chosen patriarch and he cant even walk for the joy of it the thanasiot gaped phostis fought not to giggle as he watched the fellow realize syagrios was being sarcastic syagrios pointed to the stained bandage on his shoulder he got shot in a scrape with the imperialshe did good all right but why bring him back here the soldier said he dont look like hes hurt too bad you likely cant tell under all the dirt and stuff but this is the emperors brat syagrios answered we need to take a little more care with him than with your regular fighter why like any videssian the thanasiot was ready to argue about his faith on any excuse or none were all alike on the gleaming path yeah but phostis here has special worth syagrios returned if we use him right he can help us put lots of new people on the gleaming path the soldier chewed on that literally for he gnawed at his lower lip while he thought at last grudgingly he nodded the doctrine may be sound syagrios turned his head to mutter into phostis ear the clincher is id have chopped him into ravens meat if he said me nay he gave his attention back to the trooper is anybody left alive in the kitchens were starved and not on purpose should be someone there the fellow answered though he frowned at syagrios levity phostis had not had much appetite since he was wounded now his belly rumbled hungrily at the thought of food maybe that meant he was getting better the smell of bean porridge and onions and bread in the kitchens made his insides growl all over again bowls were piled in great stacks there against a need that had for the moment gone only a handful of people sat at the long tables phostis heart gave a lurchone of them was olyvria she looked around to see who the newcomers were phostis must have been as grimy as syagrios had said for she recognized the ruffian first then her eyes traveled from phostis face to the stained bandage on his shoulder and back again he saw them widen what happened she exclaimed as she hurried over to the two men i got shot phostis answered keeping his tone as light as he could he went on ill probably live he couldnt say anything more but did his silent best to urge her not to give anything away having syagrios find outor even suspect they were lovers would be more likely fatal than the shaft the cavalryman had put into him they were lucky syagrios evidently didnt suspect and so wasnt alert for any small clues they might have given him he boomed aye he fought wellbettern i had any reason to think he would my lady he was riding toward the imperials when one of em got him i drew the arrow myself and cleaned the wound it seems to be healing well enough now olyvria looked at phostis as if she didnt know what to make of him she probably didnt he hadnt gone out intending to fight let alone well enough to draw praise from syagrios but selfpreservation had made him swing his sword against the monk with the club and the ruffian thought hed been attacking the imperials not trying to give himself up to them the world got very strange sometimes could i please have some food before i fall over he asked plaintively between them syagrios and olyvria all but dragged him to a table sat him down and brought back bread hard crumbly cheese and wine he reckoned fit only for washing out wounded shoulders he knocked back a hefty mug of it anyhow and felt it mount quickly to his head in between bites of bread and cheese he gave olyvria a carefully edited version of how hed ended up on the pointed end of an arrow i see she said when he was through he wasnt sure she did but then he wasnt exactly sure himself of the wherefores of everything that had happened she turned to syagrios speaking carefully herself and as if phostis were not sitting across from her she said when he was ordered to go out raiding i thought the plan might be to expend him to bring woe to his father that was in your fathers mind my lady syagrios agreed also ignoring him but he doubted the lads faith in the gleaming path since its real he becomes worth more to us alive than dead thats what i figured anyways lets hope youre right olyvria said with what phostis hoped was a good imitation of dispassion he kept munching on the loaf of bread the falser he was to what syagrios thought him to be the better off he did what was the lesson there that syagrios was so wicked being false to him turned good then how to explain the way the ruffian had cared for him brought him back to etchmiadzin and now poured more of that vile but potent wine into his mug he raised it lefthanded heres tousing my other arm soon everyone drank x scribbling on a map ruined it for future use so did poking pins into it krispos had prevailed upon zaidas to magic some redpainted pebbles so they behaved like lodestones and clung to their appointed places on the parchment even when it was rolled up now he wished hed chosen some other color when the map was unrolled it looked too much as if it were suffering from smallpox and every time he unrolled it he had to add more stones to show fresh outbreaks of thanasiot violence messengers brought in a constant stream of such reports most as had been true the summer before were in the northwest quadrant of the westlands but far from all he glanced at dispatches and put down two stones in the hill country in the southeastern part of the gnarled peninsula that held the empires heartland that the map lay on a folding table in the imperial pavilion rather than his study back at the palaces consoled him little the mere fact of being on campaign would have sufficed for some emperors giving them the impressionjustified or notthey were doing something about the religious zealots but krispos saw in his minds eye fires rising up from the map where every red pebble was placed heard screams of triumph and of despair even one of those stones should have been too many yet several dozen measled the map at his side katakolon also stared glumly at the scarlet stones theyre everywhere he said shaking his head in dismay they do seem that way dont they krispos said he liked the picture no better than his son did aye they do katakolon still eyed the stippled parchment which of these shows where livanios and his main band of fighters are lurking its a good question the avtokrator admitted the empire would be better off for a good answer i wish i could give you one trouble is the heresiarch is using all the little raids as cover to conceal that main band they could be almost anywhere put that way the thought was especially disquieting his own army was only a few days out of videssos the city if livanios fanatics fell on it before it was ready to fight krispos shook his head it wasnt as if he didnt have sentries posted anyone who tried surprising him would be roughly handled if he started jumping at shadows livanios was ahead of the game katakolon looked from the map to him so youre going to have yourself another brat are you father at your age ive already had three brats one more wont wreck videssos i expect not if the lot of you havent managed it and yes at my age as i told you back in the city the parts do still work you see well yes i suppose so but really katakolon seemed to think that was a complete sentence it probably meant something like just because they work doesnt mean you have any business going around using them krispos parried maybe youll learn something watching how i handle things the way you go on boy youre going to sire enough bastards to make up your own cavalry company katakolons whoresons they could call themselves and be ferocioussounding and truthful at the same time hed hoped to abash his youngest sonhed long since given up trying to shame him over venerybut the idea delighted katakolon he clapped his hands and exclaimed and if i sire a company father the lads can father themselves a couple of regiments and my greatgrandsons will end up being the whole videssian army every so often with iakovitzes krispos had to throw his hands in the air and own himself beaten now he found himself doing the same with katakolon youre incorrigible go tell sarkis i want to see him and try not to seduce anyone between this tent and that one haloga guards are not to my taste katakolon replied with dignity bordering on hauteur now if their daughters and sisters took service with videssos krispos made as if to throw a folding chair at him laughing the youth ducked out of the tent krispos remembered the exotically blond and pink haloga doxy at a revel of anthimos a generation before katakolon surely would have liked her very well krispos forced his wits away from lickerish memories and back toward the map as best he could tell the thanasioi were popping up everywhere at once that made it hard for him to figure out how to fight them one of the guards stuck his head into the tent krispos straightened expecting him to announce sarkis but instead he said your majesty the mage zaidas would have speech with you would he yes of course ill listen to what he has to say as usual zaidas started to prostrate himself as usual krispos waved for him not to bother both men smiled at the little ritual but the wizards lips quickly fell from their happy curve he said may it please your majesty these past few days my magic has enabled me to track the whereabouts of the young majesty phostis hes not stayed in the same place all the while krispos asked i thought he was still at etchmiadzin because zaidas hadnt detected any motion from phostis since hed managed to pierce the screen of makuraner magic krispos had dared hope his heir was prisoner rather than convert to the gleaming path no your majesty im afraid not here let me show you zaidas drew from his belt pouch a square of leather this is from the tanned hide of a deer the animal having been chosen because the melting tenderness of its gaze symbolically represents the affection you feel for your kidnapped son see these markshere here here krispos saw the marks they looked as if the deerskin had been burned here and there with the end of a hot awl i see them magical sir but i must say i dont grasp what they mean as you know ive at last been able to locate phostis through the law of contagion were he remaining in etchmiadzin the scorch marks you see would be virtually one on top of the other as it was their dispersal indicates he moved some considerable distance most probably to the south and east and then returned to the place whence he had departed i see krispos scowled down at the piece of deerskin and why do you think hes been making thesemovements your majesty i am sufficiently pleased to be able to infer that he has moved or rather moved and returned why he has done so is beyond the scope of my art zaidas spoke with quiet determination as if to say he did not want to know why phostis had gone out from the thanasiot stronghold and then back to it the mage was both courtier and friend no wonder he found discretion the easier path to take krispos said harshly magical sir isnt the likeliest explanation that he went out on a raid with the fanatics and then roderode home again that is certainly a possibility which must be considered zaidas admitted and yet many other explanations are possible possible yes but likely what i said fits the facts better than anything else i can think of half a lifetime of judging cases had convinced krispos that the simplest explanation was most often the right one what could be simpler than phostis joining the rebels and going out to fight for them krispos crumbled the deerskin in his fist and threw it to the ground i wish that cursed digenis were still alive so i could have the pleasure of executing him now i sympathize your majesty and believe me i fully appreciate the gravity of the problem this presents problem yes that was a nice bloodless way to put it what were you supposed to do when your son and heir turned against you however fond he was of making plans krispos hadnt made one for that set of circumstances now of necessity he began to how would evripos shape as heir hed be delighted certainly but would he make a good avtokrator krispos didnt know zaidas must have been thinking along with him the wizard said no need to deal with this on the instant your majesty perhaps the campaign will reveal the full circumstances of whats gone on it probably will krispos said gloomily the trouble is the full circumstances may be ones id sooner not have learned before zaidas could answer that katakolon led sarkis into the imperial pavilion the youth nodded easily to the mage zaidas having been around the palaces since before katakolon was born was familiar to him as the furniture sarkis sketched a salute which zaidas returned theyd both prospered handsomely under krispos if either was jealous of the other he hid it well whats toward your majesty sarkis said and then anything to eat in here im peckish krispos pointed to a bowl of salted olives the cavalry general picked up a handful of them and popped them into his mouth one after another spitting the seeds on the ground as soon as he finished his first helping he took another here krispos pointed to the map some things occurred to melate perhaps but better late than not at all the trouble with this campaign is that the thanasioi know just where we are if they dont want to meet us in the field they dont have to they can just divide themselves up and raid endlessly even if we smash some of their bands we havent done anything to break the back of the movement truth sarkis mumbled around an olive its the curse of fighting folk who are only one step up from hill bandits we move slow with horns playing and banners waving while they bounce over the landscape like fleas on a hot griddle belike they have spies in camp too to let them know right where we are at any hour of the day or night im sure they do krispos said heres what i have in mind then suppose we detach say fifteen hundred men from this force take em back to the coast and put em on board ship dont tell them where to land in advance let the drungarios in charge of the fleet pick a coastal towntavas nakoleia or pityosafter theyve set out the detachment would be big enough to do us some good when it landed maybe big enough to force livanios to concentrate quickly against it at which point the good god willing wed be close enough to hit him with the rest of the army well he knew he was an amateur strategist and wasnt in the habit of giving orders for major moves till hed talked them over with professionals sarkis absently popped another olive into his mouth it would keep the spies from knowing what was going on which i like but you ought to pick out the target town in advance and give it to the drungarios as a sealed order sealed magically too zaidas put in to prevent scrying as well as spying aye sealed magically by all means sarkis said no one would see the order save you and say one spatharios he glanced over at katakolon until the drungarios opened it that way you could make sure the main army was at the right place at the right time thank you eminent sir youve closed a loophole well do it as you suggest what i mostly want is to make the thanasioi react to us for once instead of the other way round let them counter our mischief for a change krispos looked from sarkis to zaidas to katakolon they all nodded his son asked which town will you choose for the landing sarkis turned away from katakolon so the youth would not see him smile krispos saw though gently he answered im not going to tell you because this tent just has cloth walls and i dont know whos walking by with his ear bent the less we blab the less there is for unfriendly people to learn from us oh katakolon still had trouble realizing this wasnt a large elaborate game then he said couldnt you have zaidas create a zone of silence around the pavilion i could krispos said but i wont because its far more trouble than its worth besides another mage would be apt to notice the zone of silence and wonder what we were brewing up behind it this way everything stays nice and ordinary and no one suspects we have anything sneaky in mindwhich is the best way to pull off something sneaky assuming you want to oh katakolon said again without warning syagrios came through the door into phostis little cubicle in the keep at etchmiadzin get your imperial backside out of bed he growled youve got work to do phostis first muzzy thought on waking was relief that olyvria wasnt lying on the pallet beside him his next as his head cleared a little was curiosity work he said what kind of work he crawled out from under the blanket stretched and tried to pull wrinkles out of his tunic hed slept on his beard wrong parts of it were sticking out from his face like spikes come down and get some wine and porridge in you and well talk syagrios said no point to telling you anything nowyou dont have any brains before breakfast since that was more or less true phostis answered it with as dignified a silence as he could muster the dignity would have been easier to maintain had he not made a hash of buckling one sandal syagrios laughed raucously on the way downstairs the ruffian asked hows the arm phostis raised it and bent it at odd angles till he caught his breath at a sharp stab of pain its still not perfect not by a long shot he answered but im getting to where i can use it well enough good syagrios said and then nothing more until he and phostis were down in the kitchens if hed hoped to pique phostis interest he succeeded the younger man would have gone through his morning porridge twice as fast had he not kept pestering syagrios with questions the ruffian who drank more breakfast than he ate was gleefully noncommunicative until olyvria came in and joined the two of them at table seeing her made phostis stop asking so many questions but didnt make him eat any faster have you told him olyvria asked syagrios no he hasnt told me phostis said indignantly were curiosity an itch he would have been scratching with both hands syagrios gave him an evil leer before he answered olyvria not a word i figured id let him stew in his own juice a while longer i think im done to a turn now phostis said what in the name of the lord with the great and good mind is going on what are you supposed to tell me syagrios he knew he was being too eager but couldnt help himself all right boy you want to know that bad you oughta know syagrios said but instead of telling phostis whatever it was he wasnt saying he got up and with slow deliberation poured himself another mug of wine phostis looked a mute appeal to olyvria but she didnt say anything either syagrios came swaggering back sat down again and noisily swigged from the mug only when he was through did he come to the point your father lad is getting cute phostis had heard his father described in many ways till that moment cute had never been one of them cautiously he asked whats he done thats just itwe dont quite know by syagrios scowl he thought he had every right to know everything krispos did he went on hes sent a force out of the videssian sea same as he did last fall when we snagged you this time though we dont know ahead of time which town hes gonna land at ah phostis hoped he sounded wise but he wasnt all that wise for he had to ask another question what has that to do with me suppose youre an imperial soldier syagrios said that makes you pretty fornicating dumb to start with right all right now suppose you land in a town and youre getting ready to do whatever they tell you to do and here comes the avtokrators son saying to the ice with your officers and come on and join the gleaming path what you gonna do then i see phostis said slowly and he did too had he been as enamored of the gleaming path as syagrios thought he was he could have done his father a lot of harm but he also saw a problem you said you didnt know where these troops are going to land naah we dont no doubt about it syagrios was indignant about that he continued but we thinkand its only a think worse lucklike i say we think hes gonna try and send em in at pityos its what livanios would do if he wore the red boots he likes to strike for the heart livanios does phostis nodded the ruffians reasoning made sense to him too he said so youll send me to pityos then will i go alone syagrios and olyvria both laughed at that she said no phostis while were sure enough you follow the gleaming path to send you out were not sure enough to send you alone we have to be sure you will say what youre supposed to so i shall accompany you to pityos and so will syagrios all right he answered mildly he had no idea how things would go once he got to pityos he wasnt even sure whether olyvria was on his side or her fathers hed find out in due course he supposed either way he intended to try to escape etchmiadzin was in the heart of thanasiot countryeven if he got out of town hed be hunted down before he could go far but pityos now pityos lay by the sea he was no great sailor but he could manage a small boat the good god willing he wouldnt have to if imperial soldiers were heading into the port all hed have to do was go over to them rather than persuade them to come over to the gleaming path it seemed too easy to be true when will we leave he asked careful now to sound casual ill need a little while to think about what im going to say i dont suppose ill be talking much to the officers not bloody likely syagrios agreed rumbling laughter youre after the odds and sods the poor buggers who make a livingand a bad onefrom soldiering with any luck theyll rise up and slaughter the proud bastards who give em orders most of those midwifes mistakes have it coming anyways while he might not have been a proper thanasiot as far as theology went syagrios had unbounded contempt for anyone in authority olyvria actually answered phostis question we want to leave tomorrow its several days ride down to the coast you can work on what youll say as we go however you like phostis laughed the lord with the great and good mind knows i havent much to pack nor should you if you follow the gleaming path olyvria said phostis had to work hard not to stare at her now she sounded the way she had when shed first fetched him to etchmiadzin what had become of the passion shed shown was she dissembling now because syagrios sat next to her or had she seduced phostis to win him to the gleaming path when more honest methods failed he simply could not tell in a certain sense it didnt matter when he got to pityos he was going to try to escape no matter what if she stood in his way then hed do it alone but he knew some trust would go out of him forever if the girl he loved turned out only to have been using him for her own purposes he hoped shed sneak up to his cubicle that night both because he wanted her and so he could ask her the questions he couldnt speak with syagrios listening but she kept to herself when morning came phostis packed a spare tunic hed come by belted on the sword hed left in the little room ever since he came back from the raid on aptos and went downstairs syagrios was already down in the kitchens eating he flipped phostis a widebrimmed hat of woven straw like the one that sat at a jaunty angle on his own head when olyvria came down she was wearing one like it too and mannish tunic and trousers suitable for riding good syagrios said nodding approval when he saw her well take enough food here to keep us going till we get to pityos then stuff it into our saddlebags and be on our way the breadll go stale but who cares phostis took several loaves some cheese some onions and a length of hard dry pork sausage flavored with fennel he paused before some round pastries dusted with powdered sugar whats in these he asked take a few theyre good olyvria said theyre made from chopped dates and nuts and honey we must have a new cook out of vaspurakan because thats where they come from true enough syagrios agreed you ever hear a videssian who wants them hell call em princes balls he guffawed phostis smiled olyvria did her best to pretend she hadnt heard phostis fed his foultempered horse one of the pastries in the hope of sweetening its disposition the beast tried to bite his hand he jerked it back just in time syagrios laughed again had phostis been in any other company he would have named his horse for the ruffian the ride into pityos was a pleasant five days the upland plateaus still wore their bright green coat of spring grass and shrubs another month or two would go by before the vicious summer sun began baking everything brown fritillaries and hairstreaks flitted from one clump of red or yellow restharrow to another and then on to whiteflowered fenugreek swallows and skylarks swooped after the insects about halfway through the first days ride syagrios dismounted to go off behind a bush some little distance from the road without turning her head toward phostis olyvria said quietly it will be all right will it he answered he wanted to believe her but hed grown chary of trusting anyone if she meant what shed said shed have the chance to prove it before she could reply back came syagrios buttoning the top button of his fly rebuckling his belt and whistling a marching song with more foul verses than clean ones he grunted as he swung himself up into the saddle off we go again he declared the last day and a half of the journey were through the coastal lowlands peasants labored in the fields plowing planting and pruning grape vines summer felt near in the lowlands for the weather there was already hot and sticky phostis shoulder twinged more than it had in the drier climate of the plateau as soon as pityos came into view the travelers all squinted and shaded their eyes to peer ahead phostis wondered how hed feel to see a forest of masts in the harbor but unless his eyes were tricking him though the town seemed to boast fishing boats aplenty none of them were the big imperial merchantmen that hauled troops and horses syagrios grunted suspiciously your old man is up to something sneaky he told phostis as if it were the latters fault maybe the ships are lying out to sea so they can come in at nightfall and take folk by surprise or maybe hes decided to have them make land at tavas or nakoleia after all livanios makuraner mage should have been able to divine where theyd put in phostis said naah syagrios made a slashing gesture of contempt with his hand livanios took him on because his sorcery fuddles videssian wizards but it works the other way round too worse lucksome days hes lucky to find his way out of bed that one is he paused to give phostis a meditative stare how did you know hes from makuran by his accent phostis answered as innocently as he could and when i recognized that i remembered id seen makuraner envoys at court who wore caftans like his oh all right syagrios relaxed phostis breathed easier too if hed let artapans name fall from his lips hed have thrown himself straight into the soup pot the sentries lounging in front of the gates of pityos were thanasioi longer on ferocity than discipline when syagrios greeted them in the name of the gleaming path grins creased their grim faces in unexpected directions they waved him and his companions into the city pityos was smaller than nakoleia as phostis had thought nakoleia little better than a village hed expected to feel cramped in pityos as well but after some months in etchmiadzin much of that time mewed up inside the fortress he found pityos spacious enough to suit him syagrios rented an upstairs room in a tavern near the harbor so he could keep lookout and spy imperial ships before they started spewing out their men olyvria stayed quiet all through the spirited haggle that got the room phostis couldnt tell whether the taverner thought her a beardless youth or knew she was a woman but didnt care the chamber got crowded when a potboy fetched in a third straw pallet but remained roomier than phostis cubicle had been with him there by himself he unslung his bedroll and with a sigh of relief let it fall to the mattress hed chosen syagrios leaned out the window to examine the harbor at close range he shook his head bugger me with a pinecone if i know where they are they ought to be here unless i miss my guess altogether by a slight swagger he managed to indicate how unlikely that was olyvria picked up the chamber pot which had been shoved into a corner when the new set of bedding arrived she looked down into it made a face then walked over to the window as if to throw its contents out onto the streetand any unwary passersby below instead when she came up behind syagrios she raised the chamber pot high and smashed it over his head the pot was of heavy earthenware no doubt shed hoped he would sag silently and easily into unconsciousness but syagrios was made of stern stuff he staggered and groaned out blood running down his face turned shakily on olyvria phostis felt his heart beatonce twicewhile he gaped dumbfounded on what shed done then he unfroze he grabbed syagrios by the shoulder and hit the ruffian in the face as hard as he could with his left fist syagrios lurched backward he tried to bring up his hands to protect himself or even to grapple with phostis but he moved as if in the slowness of a dream phostis hit him again and again his eyes rolled up in his head he collapsed to the floor olyvria seized the knife on his belt and held it above his neck phostis grabbed her wrist have you gone mad she cried no well take his weapons and well tie him up he answered but i owe him enough for this he touched his healing shoulder that i dont care to slit his throat she made a face but didnt argue instead turning the dagger on the linen mattress covers to cut strips of cloth for bonds syagrios grunted and stirred when phostis rolled him over to tie his hands behind his back phostis hit him again and also tied cloth strips over his mouth for a gag then he tied the ruffians ankles together as tightly as he could give me the dagger he said suddenly olyvria pressed it into his hand change your mind no phostis slit the money pouch syagrios wore on his belt half a dozen goldpieces and a handful of silver spilled out he scooped up the coins and stuffed them into his own belt pouch now lets get out of here all right olyvria said whatever you intend to do youd best be quick about it the good god only knows how long hell lie quiet there and he wont be pleased with us for what weve done that phostis was sure was an understatement come on he said they hurried out of the chamber when they came down into the allbutdeserted taproom the taverner raised an eyebrow but didnt say anything phostis walked over to him took out a goldpiece and set it on the bar you didnt see us come out you were in the back room youve never seen us the taverners hand covered the coin did somebody say something he asked looking past phostis this place is so empty im starting to hear phantoms i hope its enough phostis said as he and olyvria walked rapidly down to the harbor so do i olyvria said best if we dont have to find out i hope you have something along those lines in mind i do phostis took deep happy gulps of seaside air the salt tang and the aroma of stale fish reminded him at a level almost below consciousness of the way things smelled around the palaces for the first time in months he felt at home a fisherman leapt from the little boat hed just tied to a pier his catch was similarly minimal a couple of buckets of mackerel and other less interesting fare good day phostis called to him the fisherman was closer to sixty than fifty and looked deathly tired maybe you think so he said it is a day it is done it is enough phostis said i will give you two goldpieces for that boat and another to forget you ever sold it to me the boat could not have been worth more than a goldpiece and a half phostis didnt care he had the money and he needed to be out of pityos as fast as he could he pressed ahead does that make it a better day if not a good one he pulled out the three bright gold coins from his pouch and held them in the palm of his hand so they sparkled into the fishermans face the fellow stared as if he could not believe his eyes he set down one of his buckets of fish young man he said slowly if you mock me i shall thrash you grizzled though i am by the lord with the great and good mind i swear it i dont mock phostis answered have you hammocks aboard there and your lines and nets only one hammocki fish alone the fisherman answered but there are blankets so the other of you can bed down on deck and aye the rest of the tackle is there see for yourself before you buyi would not have you say i cheated you though you must know you are cheating yourself theres fresh water from yesterday in the tuns too you can sail a good ways without coming in to land if thats what you aim to do never mind what i aim to do the less phostis told the fisherman the better he walked along the dock and peered into the boat the nets lay neatly coiled at the bow lines with hooks on them were wrapped between pegs on one side of the tiny cabin behind the mast a pair of long sweeps lay on the deck he nodded to himself and gave the fisherman the goldpieces you keep it shipshape and if i dont wholl do it for me the man answered phostis handed olyvria down into the boat then got in himself and put the sweeps in the oarlocks would you cast off the line he called to the fisherman the fellow was still staring at the gold coins he started slightly before he obeyed grunting with effort phostis worked the sweeps the fishing boat slowly backed away from the pier its former owned seemed glad to have seen the last of it he picked up his buckets and walked into town without a backward glance when phostis had put enough distance between himself and the dock he let down the sail from its yard it was like most videssian sails a simple square rig not much good for sailing against the wind but fine with it the wind blew out of the west phostis wanted to sail east as long as the wind held hed have no problems he turned to olyvria do you know anything about fishing no not much not boats either she answered do you enough he said i can manage the boat as long as the weather doesnt get too rough and i can fish too even if the gear here isnt exactly what im used to i learned from my father it was he thought the first time hed ever simply acknowledged that krispos had taught him something worth knowing good for him and good for you olyvria watched the harbor of pityos recede off to the starboard side of the stern that means we wont starve right away i hope so phostis said though you never can tell with fish if we have to put in to shore to feed ourselves i still have some of syagrios money left he slapped the pouch that hung from his belt olyvria nodded that sounds fine to me what do you plan to do sail along the coast until you find where the imperial fleet really is as a matter of fact id intended to sail straight to videssos the city i can find out more about whats going on there than anywhere else and then head straight out to the main body of the army my father will be there and i ought to join him if i hadnt intended to do that what point to leaving the thanasioi none i suppose olyvria looked back at pityos again already it seemed a toy town the buildings shrunk to the size of those a woodcarver might shape for his children to play with quietly without looking back to him she asked and what do you intend to do about me why phostis shut his mouth with a snap the question was too pointed to answer before he considered it after a moment he went on i hadnt thought so far ahead yet the most that had occurred to me was that for the next few days wed finally be able to make love without worry about someone catching us while we were at it she smiled but her eyes were still on pityos yes well be able to do that if its what you want but what about afterwards what happens when you go to the palaces in videssos the city what then young majesty at etchmiadzin no one had called him that except in mockery or the false courtesy that was worse now olyvria reminded him of everything to which hed be returning the eunuchs the ceremonial the rank he also remembered as he had not lately that shed kidnapped and humiliated him she plainly had never forgotten the question shed asked him was pointed indeed where she looked back across the water toward everything she was leaving he looked out past the fishing boats bow at what lay ahead slowly he said you stole me out of the camp true but if it hadnt been for you just now i wouldnt have got free of pityos either as far as i can reckon us that puts us at quits therebut still leaves everything else between us which means olyvria still soundedapprehensive was the word phostis decided after a little thought and no wonder until the fishing boat headed out onto the videssian sea shed been the dominant one and set the terms of their dealings with each other shed kidnapped him at etchmiadzin shed had the power of her father and the thanasioi behind her but now shed committed herself to sailing into what literally was or would be his dominion if he wanted vengeance it was his for the taking if you like he said ill put in to shore at any deserted beach you like and let you off there i swear by the lord with the great and good mind ill do everything in my power to keep my father from ever coming after you or or what she fairly snapped at him yes she was nervous about how things had changed he took a deep breath or you can stay with me till we get to videssos the city and for as long as you care to after that for the rest of our lives i hope she studied him wondering no doubt if this was but one more trap to make eventual revenge sweeter you mean it she said at last and then of course i will and then but what will your father say hell probably have kittens phostis said cheerfully so what im of a mans years so he cant make me put you aside and besides people dont always remember these daysits been a long time after allbut my mother was anthimos empress before she was my fathers since i was born less than a year after my father took the throne you can see his ways there werent perfectly regular either phostis listened to that sentence again in his mind as a matter of fact hed been born quite a bit less than a year after krispos became avtokrator he hadnt really thought about how much less till just now he wondered if krispos had sired him or anthimos by his birthdate either was possible maybe he frowned for olyvria said whats wrong nothing he said and then again more firmly nothing anthimos wasnt around any more to claim him and even if krispos never had quite warmed to himall at once he wondered if he saw a new reason for thathed named him junior avtokrator before he was out of swaddling clothes krispos wouldnt dispossess him of the succession now especially when hed escaped from danger by his own effortsand those of olyvria she was looking off to starboard again land now was just a strip of green and occasional brown on the horizon there they were too far out to sea to make out any detail smiling she turned to phostis if nothings wrong you can prove it he started to say how am i supposed to do that before he got out more than a couple of words she took off her hat shook down her hair and then pulled her tunic up over her head sure enough he found a way to show her everything was all right your majesty that was zaidas calling from outside the imperial pavilion before the army got moving on a day full of muggy heat ive news your majesty inside the pavilion krispos was wearing a decidedly unimperial pair of linen drawers and nothing more to the ice with ceremony he thought and called well come in and tell it then he smiled at zaidas popeyed expression never mind the proskynesis sorcerous sir just brush aside the mosquito netting and let me know what youve learned zaidas inhaled portentously may it please your majesty my sorcery shows your son phostis has traveled from etchmiadzin down to pityos on the coast has he krispos growled as usual with news prefaced by that formula it pleased him not at all bloody good thing i ordered the fleet to tavas then the only reason i can find for him to go down to the port is to try and forestall us but livanios sent him to the wrong place by phos he smacked one fist into the other palm the thanasioi have spies among us sure enough but they didnt learn enough not this time no your majesty zaidas agreed he hesitated then went on your majesty i might add that phostis sorcerous trace if you will forgive an inexact expression has itself become inexact more interference from that accursed makuraner krispos made it statement not question but zaidas shook his head i think not your majesty its almost as if the trace is attenuated bywater perhaps im puzzled to come up with any other explanation yet the heretics would scarcely send phostis out by sea would they not a chance krispos said his voice flat livanios isnt such a fool i wish to phos he were keep searching the lord with the great and good mind willing youll come up with something that makes better sense believe me sorcerous sir i still have full confidence in you more than i have in myself sometimes zaidas shook his head ill do my best for you krispos started sweating hard as soon as he put on his gilded mail shirt he sighed summer felt as if it were here already he went out to stand in line with the soldiers for his morning bowl of porridge the cooks never knew which line hed pick the food in all of them was better for it this morning for instance the barley porridge was thick with onions and cloves of garlic and almost every spoonful had a bit of chopped ham with an intensely smoky flavor he emptied the bowl if id eaten this well on my farm id never have wanted to come to videssos the city he remarked several of the soldiers nodded life on a farm as krispos knew was seldom easy that was one of the big reasons men left the country if nothing else soldiers ate regularly but while farm work was harder day in and day out soldiers sometimes earned their keep harder than any man who lived off the land the armys discipline not bad when the men set out from the capital had improved steadily since everyone knew his place and went to it with a minimum of fuss the cooks kettles went back onto the supply wagons the troopers mounted their horses and the army pushed on through the lowlands toward tavas krispos rode at the head of the main body a few hundred yards behind the vanguard peasants looked up from the fields in wonder as he went by as if he were some kind of being altogether different from themselves had anthimos father rhaptes ever happened to parade past the village where krispos had grown to manhood he was sure he would have gaped the same way a little before noon a messenger on a lathered blowing horse caught up with the army from behind the animal gulped in great draughts of air as the fellow brought it down to a slow trot beside the avtokrators horse he pulled out a sealed tube of oiled leather and handed it to krispos from the city your majesty the seal was a sunburst stamped into the skyblue wax that was an imperial prerogative which meant the dispatch came from evripos krispos could think of only one reason why his son would send out an urgent message filled with foreboding he broke the seal his sons script still retained some of the copybook clarity that years of quickly scribbling will erode the words were as legible as they were unwelcome evripos to his father greetings riots flared here night before last and have grown worse rather than better since forces under my command are doing all they can to restore order i shall send more news as it becomes available phos guard you and this city both farewell do you know anything of this krispos asked the messenger waving the parchment in his direction no your majesty im sorry but i dont the man answered im but the latest of a string of relay riders i hear tell from the fellow who gave me the tube that theres some sort of trouble back at the city is that so aye thats so krispos answered grimly hed known the thanasioi might try that ploy to distract him and prepared for it as well as he could whether well as he could was well enough would come clear before long then he thought of something else something that chilled him was phostis on the sea to go to the capital and lead the rioters against loyal troops if he was he might throw the city into worse turmoil than even krispos had expected have to warn evripos about that the avtokrator thought is there a reply your majesty the messenger asked yes by the good god there is krispos said but before he could give it another dispatch rider rode up on an abused horse and waved a message tube in his face he didnt like the fearful look in the newcomers eyes rest easy there you ive never been in the habit of blaming the messenger for the word he brings aye your majesty the second rider said but he didnt sound convinced he thrust out the message tube as if it held poison krispos took it then asked you know whats in it the messenger nodded krispos said speak it to me plain then by the lord with the great and good mind i swear no harm nor blame shall fall on you because of it hed never seen a man who so obviously wanted to be somewhere anywhere else the dispatch rider licked his lips looked this way and that but found no escape he sucked in a deep breath then let it all out in five blurted words your majesty garsavra is fallen what krispos gaped at him more in disbelief than horror so did everyone close enough to hear lying where the eriza and arandos rivers came together garsavra was one of the two or three greatest towns in the westlands the army was already west of it theyd forded the northern reaches of the eriza day before yesterday krispos opened the message tube it confirmed what the dispatch rider had said and added details outriding news of their coming the thanasioi had swept down on the town at sunrise theyd burned and killed and maimed theyd thrown the local prelate headfirst off the roof of the temple by the central square then set fire to the building few survivors would have their souls burdened by a surplus of material goods for years to come krispos stared at the parchment in his left hand he wanted to tear it into a thousand pieces with a deliberate effort of will he checked himself some of the information it held might be valuable as steadily as he could he told the messenger you have my thanks for your courage in bringing this to me what is your rank im on the books as a file closer your majesty the man answered youre a file leader now krispos told him one of the scouts from the vanguard came riding back to the main body he waited to catch krispos eye then said may it please your majesty weve rounded up a thanasiot riding at us under shield of truce he says he bears a message for you from livanios too much was falling on krispos too fast he had the feeling of a tavern juggler who has reached out for one plate hes tossed away only to have all the others that were up in the air smash down on his head before he can snatch back his hand bring me this thanasiot he said heavily tell him ill honor his truce sign which is likely more courtesy than hed give to one of ours tell him just that way the scout saluted and rode ahead he came back a few minutes later with one of livanios irregulars the thanasiot carried a whitepainted round target on his left arm he smiled at krispos somber face and said id wager you have the news already am i right friend im no friend of yours krispos said give me your masters message the thanasiot handed him a tube no different from those hed had from his own couriers save in the seal the image of a leaping flame stamped into scarlet wax krispos broke it and angrily threw the little pieces of wax down onto the ground the parchment inside was sealed with the identical mark krispos cracked it unrolled the parchment and scanned the message it contained livanios who treads the gleaming path to the false avtokrator and servant of skotos krispos greetings know that i write this from the ruins of garsavra which city has been purified and cleansed of its sinful materialism by warriors true to the lord with the great and good mind know further that all cities of the westlands are liable to the same penalty which phos soldiers may deliver at any time which suits them and know further miscalled ruler destined for the ice your corrupt and goldbloated regime is henceforward and ever after banished from these westlands if you would preserve even a fragment of your illicit and tyrannical rule withdraw at once over the cattlecrossing yielding this land to those who shall hold it in triumph peace and piety repent of your wealth and other sins before phos final judgment descends upon you cast aside your greed and surrender yourself to the gleaming path i am yours in phos farewell krispos slowly and deliberately crumpled the parchment then turned to the thanasiot messenger and said my reply is one word no take it and be thankful your life goes with it i dont fear deathdeath liberates me from skotos the messenger retorted you call down doom on your own head he twitched the reins dug his heels into his horses sides and rode away singing a hymn what did the whoreson want of you sarkis asked when krispos told him his fleshy face darkened with anger by the good god a bragging fool ought to know better than to taunt a force thats bigger than his especially when we stand closer to etchmiadzin than he does maybe we stand closer to it krispos said bleakly youve said all along livanios is no fool surely hell have withdrawn after the rape of garsavra i dont want to chase him back to his stronghold i want to force him to battle outside of it how do you propose to do that sarkis said the cursed thanasioi move faster than we they arent even burdened by loot because they burn it instead of carrying it along with them i know krispos scowl was black as winter midnight i suppose you were right before though we have to try livanios cant be smart all the timei hope if we march smartly we may come to grips with him up on the plateau worth a try anyhow aye sarkis nodded vigorously our cavalry at tavas can hold its own against anything the thanasioi have around thereand now we know where their main force has been lurking so we do krispos said its a bloody big cloud for such a thin silver lining he leaned over spat down onto the ground as if in ritual rejection of skotos then began issuing the orders that would shift the armys line of march from the coast and up into the central highlands changing the troops destination was the easy part making sure they would have food and their animals fodder along the new track was much more involved what with everything that came after he forgot to send evripos a reply phostis guided the fishing boat up to the little quay from which his father would row out to see what he could catch he threw out a line scrambled up onto the dock and made the boat fast he was just helping olyvria up onto the planks when an indignant palace servitor opened the seawall gate and exclaimed here who do you think you are this docks not for just anyone its reserved for the avtokrator phos bless him so you can kindly take your smelly little boat somewhere else its all right soranos phostis answered i dont think father will mind he wasnt in the least put out that soranos hadnt recognized him he was grimy shaggy wearing a cheap ragged long tunic and sunburned in fact he was sunburned in some tender spots under the tunic too thanks to frolicking with olyvria in broad hot daylight she was also sunburned theyd shared misery and fish on the way back to the city the servitor put hands on hips oh your father wont mind eh and who pray is your father do you know yourself phostis had been wondering the same thing but didnt let on he said my father is krispos son of phostis avtokrator of the videssians i have you will notice if you look closely escaped from the thanasioi soranos started to give back another sharp answer but paused and took a long look at phostis he was too swarthy to turn pale but his jaw fell his eyes widened and his right hand seemingly of its own accord shaped the suncircle above his heart he prostrated himself gabbling young majesty it is yourselfi mean you are yourself a thousand pardons i pray i beg phos be praised that he has granted you safe voyage home and blessed you with liberty once again beside phostis olyvria snickered he shook his head reproachfully then told the servitor get up get up i forgive you now tell me at once whats going on why i saw so much smoke in the sky as i was sailing down the cattlecrossing the heretics have rioted again young majesty theyre trying to burn the city down around our heads soranos answered as he rose i feared thats what it was take me to my father at once then soranos face assumed the exaggerated mask of regret any sensible servant donned when saying no to a member of the imperial family young majesty i cannot he has left the city to campaign against the thanasioi yes of course he has phostis said annoyed at himself had the imperial army not been on the move he wouldnt have been sent to pityosor escaped who is in command here in the city then the young majesty evripos your brother oh phostis bit down on that like a man finding a pebble in his lentil stew from krispos point of view the appointment made sense especially with phostis himself absent but he could not imagine anyone who would be less delighted than evripos at his sudden arrival no help for it though youd best take me to him certainly young majesty but would you and your ah companion olyvria had her hair up under her hat and was in her baggy mannish outfit so soranos could not be sure if she was woman or youth not care first to refresh yourselves and change into ah more suitable garments no phostis made the single word as imperiousand imperialas he could not till it had passed his lips did he realize hed taken his tone from krispos whatever its source it worked wonders soranos said of course young majesty follow me if you would be so kind phostis followed no one came close to him olyvria and soranos as they walked through the palace compound people who saw them at a distance no doubt thought soranos was escorting a couple of day laborers to some job or other to phostis the palace compound was simply home he took no special notice of the lawns and gardens and buildings among which he strode to olyvria though they all seemed new and marvelous watching her try to look every which way at once seeing her awe at the grand courtroom the cherry orchard that screened the imperial residence and the hall of the nineteen couches made him view them with fresh eyes too evripos was not conducting his fight against the rioters from the palaces hed set up a headquarters in the plaza of palamas peoplesome soldiers some nothurried in and out with news orders whathaveyou a big haloga gave phostis a firstrate dubious stare what you want here he asked in accented videssian id like to see my brother herwig phostis answered herwig glowered at him wondering who his brother might beand who he was himself to presume to address an imperial guardsman by name then the glower faded to wonderment young majesty the haloga boomed loud enough to cause heads to turn in the makeshift pavilion among those heads was evripos well well he said when he saw it truly was phostis look what the dog dragged to the doorstep hello brother phostis said more cautiously than hed expected in the bit more than half a year since hed set eyes on his younger brother evripos had gone from youth to man his features were sharper than they had been his beard thicker and not so soft he wore a mans expression too under a coat of smoke and dirt tired harassed but determined to do what hed set out to do now he gave phostis a hostile stare it wasnt the stare phostis was used to the one that came because he was older it was because he might be an enemy evripos barked did the cursed thanasioi send you here to stir up more trouble if they had would i have tied up the fishing boat i sailed here over at fathers quay phostis said would i have come looking for you instead of digenis digenis is dead and we dont miss him a bit evripos said voice still harsh and who knows what youd do one of the things i know about the bloody heretics is that theyre bloody sneaky for all i know you could have that doxy there by you just to fool me into thinking youre not off the pleasures of the flesh unlike soranos evripos knew a girl when he saw one no matter what she wore phostis said brother i present to you olyvria the daughter of livanios who helped me escape from the thanasioi and rejects them as much as i do which is to say altogether that succeeded in startling evripos then olyvria startled phostis she prostrated herself before his brother murmuring your majesty she probably should have said young majesty but evripos had been left in command of the city so she wasnt really wrongand she was dead right to err on the side of flattery evripos grunted before he could say more than get up a messenger bleeding from a cut over one eye came up and gasped something phostis didnt follow evripos said its not hard unless you make it so push one troop down from middle street east of where those maniacs are holed up and another west of em then crush em between our men the messenger dashed away off to one side in the pavilion phostis saw noetos bent over a map but noetos was not running the show evripos was phostis had watched krispos exercise command too often to mistake it he said what can i do to help to take things away from me you mean evripos asked suspiciously no father gave it to you and you seem to be doing well by it i just got here remember i havent the faintest idea whats going on but if i can be of use tell me how evripos looked as if such cooperation were the last thing he wanted olyvria said if you like we could speak to the mob and tell them why we care for the gleaming path no more not the least reason being that makuran is behind the thanasioi and supports them with a wizard and the good god only knows what all else phostis added so you know about that do you we wondered father and i we were afraid you knew and didnt care afraid youd thrown your lot in with the heretics you hadnt seemed exactly eager when we went on campaign against them last year evripos sarcasm stung like a whiplash i wasnt eager then phostis admitted no point denying it for evripos knew better its different now fetch a mage for the twomirror test if you dont believe me evripos glowered at him the thanasioi have tricks to beat the twomirror test as youll recall from the delightful time zaidas had trying to use it last year and if zaidas couldnt make it work i doubt another mage would be able to either and so brother of mine ill keep you and the heresiarchs daughter off the platform i cant trust you you see cant trust us how phostis demanded how dyou think suppose i let you go talk to the mob and instead of saying the golden path is a midden full of dung you say hurrah for thanasios now go out and burn the high temple that would spill the chamber pot into the stew now wouldnt it noetos looked up from the map table and said surely the young majesty would commit no such outrage he evripos cut him off with a sharp wave of the hand no he sounded as imperialand as much like his fatheras phostis had with the same word i will not take the chance have we not seen enough chaos in the city these past few days to fight shy of provoking more i say again no he shifted his feet into a fighters stance as if defying noetos to make him change his mind the general tamely yielded it shall be as you say of course young majesty he murmured and went back to his map phostis found himself furious enough to want to hit his brother over the head with the nearest hard object he could find youre a fool he growled and youre a blockhead evripos retorted im not the one who let digenis seduce him hows this then phostis said suppose you summon oxeites the patriarch here to the plaza of palamas or anyplace else you think would be a good idea and he can marry me to olyvria as publicly as possible that ought to convince people im not a thanasiottheyd sooner starve than wive curse you evripos i mean it whats so bloody funny im sorry evripos said the first concession phostis had got from him i was just thinking its too bad fathers gone on campaign the two of you might don the crowns of marriage side by side do you remember the serving maid named drina of course shes a pretty little thing but phostis gaped at his grinning brother fathers gone all soft in the head over her i doubt that evripos said judiciously when has father ever gone soft in the head over anyone us included but she is pregnant by him well have ourselves a little half brother or half sister before midwinters day relax phostisyou dont need to go so white father truly doesnt plan on marrying her believe me im as happy at that as you are yes a new half brother or half sister eh well well phostis wondered if he was only half brother to evripos and katakolon as it was hed never know not for certain he said if youre done gossiping im dead serious about what i said if you think it will help end the riots ill wed in as open a ceremony as the chamberlains can dream up beside him olyvria nodded vigorously that might be the best way to discredit the gleaming path let those who think of following it see that their onetime leaders are abandoning it the plan is sensible young majesty noetos said mmmmaybe it is evripos frowned in intense concentration a messenger interrupted with a note evripos read it snapped orders and returned to study at last he said no i will not order it one of the drawbacks of our rank brother is that we arent always free to make the matches we would i see nothing wrong with this one but im slowly finding out his grin was rueful and disarming at the same time i dont know everything there is to know too much rides here for me to say aye or nay what then phostis demanded ill send you along the courier route to father tell him your tale if he believes you what can i possibly say and if he thinks this marriage of yours a good idea then married you shall beand at a quickstep if i know father bargain bargain phostis replied at once a couple of orders from evripos and he and olyvria might have disappeared for good if krispos ever found out evripos could claim they were fanatical thanasioi who would contradict him especially after he became the primary heir its decent of you meaning you expect me to throw you into some dungeon or other and then forget which one it was evripos asked wellyes phostis felt his face heat at being so obvious had he made that kind of mistake at etchmiadzin he never would have got out of the fortress if you think the notion didnt cross my mind youre daft phostis needed a moment to realize the strangled noise evripos made was intended as laughter his younger brother went on father always taught us to fear the ice and i guess i listened to him if youd gone over to the gleaming path nothing would have made me happier than hunting you down and taking your place always believe that phostis but stealing it after youve got loose of the thanasioi he made a wry face its tempting but i can resist it phostis thought of the chamber under digenis tunnel and of the naked and lovely temptation olyvria had represented hed passed her bythen now he lay in her arms whenever he could had he yielded to temptation would evripos with some future chance to seize the throne spring after it rather than turning his back as for the first question phostis told himself the situation had changed by the time he and olyvria became lovers she wasnt just so much flesh set out for him to enjoy shed become his closest friendalmost his only friendin etchmiadzin were circumstances different hed gladly have paid her formal court as for the second question the future would have to answer it phostis knew hed be a fool to ignore the possibility of evripos trying to usurp him in the future though hed have the power not his brotheras evripos did today and maybe today showed they had hope at least of working together evripos said come the day brother we may not make such a bad team even if you end up with the red boots on your feet give me something to do with soldiers and ill do well for videssos with them not in your service phostis noted he didnt quibble among the other things krispos had taught was that the empire came first that anyone who didnt put it ahead of everything else didnt deserve to have his fundament warm the throne in the grand courtroom the lesson made more sense to phostis than it ever had before you know what he said evripos raised a questioning eyebrow phostis continued itll be good to see father its been too long phostis paused again i dont suppose i could bring olyvria along no evripos said at once but then added wait maybe you should shell know a lot about the thanasioi she does phostis said at the same time as olyvria was saying i do well then evripos said as if that settled things if you dont bring her father will come down on me for making you leave her behind so he cant wring her dry with questions take her by all means i shall obey your commands young majesty phostis said with a salute evripos saluted in return ive obeyed yours a time or two young majesty he answered brothers olyvria said she might have been referring to some lower form of life phostis and evripos looked at each other grinning they both nodded xi krispos slammed his forehead with the heel of his hand hard enough to hurt by the good god im an idiot he exclaimed no doubt your majesty sarkis agreed cheerfully along with iakovitzes zaidas and barsymes he could say something like that without going up on charges of lese majesty in which particular matter are you being an idiot today with all the hoorah over garsavra i clean forgot to write to evripos and warn him to be alert for phostis krispos answered he thumped himself again in disgust characteristically he wasted no more time on reproaches instead he pulled a scrap of parchment and pen and ink from pouches on his belt scrawled a few nearly illegible linesthe motion of the horse didnt helpand then called katakolon after a moment he called again louder aye father how can i help you his youngest son brought his own horse trotting up alongside krispos mount krispos handed him the note seal this stick it in a message tube and get it off to videssos the city as fast as you can just as you say the piece of parchment was too small to roll or fold conveniently katakolon read it before he took it to do as krispos had commanded his eyes were troubled when he raised them to look at his father again surely it cant be as bad asthis i dont know whether it is or not krispos said but as to whether it can beby phos boy it could be ten times worse he might be landing in the city with a shipload of fanatics all hot to die for the gleaming path phostis katakolons voice rose he shook his head i cant believe it i can which is what matters krispos answered now get moving i didnt give you that note to argue over it just to have it start on its way to the city aye father katakolon said dolefully you dont suppose hell accidentally lose that do you sarkis said hed better not krispos answered the same thought had crossed his mind he remembered his talk with evripos back in the city if his sons thought strongly enough that they were right they would follow their own wills not his they were turning into menat the most inconvenient time possible had phostis done that when he chose to walk the gleaming path was he making his own judgments as best he knew how no matter how wrongheaded they seemed to krispos or had he merely found someone whose lead he preferred to his fathers krispos shook his head he wondered if phostis knew as he had so often over the years he forced personal worriesand worries about which he could do nothingto the back of his mind enough other business remained to occupy him the army was up on the plateau now with everyone a bit on the hungry side because supply arrangements hadnt kept up with the changed route of livanios force there was no sign that worried krispos if the thanasioi scattered before he could smite them what point to the campaign how was he supposed to beat them if they turned back into harmlesslooking herders and farmers and tanners and candlemakers and whathaveyou if he went back to videssos the city theyd be raiders again the moment his dust vanished over the horizon he was bitterly certain of that the army camped for the night by a stream that wouldnt have water in it too much longer now though it would serve the men saw to their horses before they cared for themselves krispos strolled through the encampment checking to make sure his orders on that score were obeyed hed served as groom first for iakovitzes and then for petronas after he came to the imperial city he knew what went into tending horses he was sound asleep on his folding cot in the imperial tent when a haloga called your majesty over and over until it woke him he groaned as he made himself sit his eyes felt as if someone had poured sand into their sockets the guardsman said your pardon majesty but out here waits a courier who must see you aye send him in krispos said in a voice that sounded nothing like his own he waved for the courier not to bother prostrating himself the sooner the fellow was gone he thought the sooner he could get back to sleep may it please your majesty the courier said and krispos braced himself for bad news the man delivered it i have to report that the thanasioi have fallen on and taken the city of kyzikos kyzikos still foggy krispos needed a moment to place the town on the map it lay down in the coastal plain east of garsavra whats livanios doing there as soon as he raised the question the answer became obvious the imperial mint aye your majesty its taken and burned the courier said the temple is burned as well and so is much of the central part of the citylike many towns in the western lowlands kyzikos has or rather had no wall to hold invaders at bay and the farmland round the city is ravaged as if locusts had been at it aye krispos said a heavy blow if livanios warriors could ravage kyzikos no place in the westlands was safe from them and if livanios had the gold from the mint in kyzikos he could work untold mischief with it too gold and the thanasioi did not normally mix but krispos did not think livanios was a typical thanasiot if he read the heresiarch aright livanios cared more about livanios than about the gleaming path but no matter how much damage they had donekrispos wits began working a little fastertheyd also made what might prove a bad mistake theyd given the imperial army the chance to interpose itself between them and their stronghold near the border with vaspurakan if you stick your neck out too far it gets chopped krispos said your majesty the courier asked never mind clad only in his linen drawers the avtokrator strode out into the night ignoring the grunts of surprise that rose from the haloga guards he started bawling for his generals if he couldnt sleep he wouldnt let them sleep either not with work to be done two days later sarkis said for about the dozenth time the trick your majesty will be to make sure they dont get by us yes krispos said also for the dozenth time the westlands central plateau was not flat like the lowlands it was rough broken country gullies running into ravines running into valleys if the imperial army didnt position itself correctly slipping between the thanasioi and etchmiadzin wouldnt matter because the raiders would get past without being noticed till too late that was probably the gamble livanios had made when he decided to strike kyzikos sarkis found a new question to ask how will you choose the right spot the best way i can figure is this krispos said ill station us near one of the central valleys and fan scouts out widely ahead of us and to either side its no guarantee of anything of course but its what well do unless you have a better idea i hope you will i was thinking something along the same lines sarkis said the trouble is its what livanios will think is in our minds too thats so krispos admitted but if we play the game of ifhethenwe and ifwethenhe were liable to get lost in the maze ill cut through it and just do what i think best under the circumstances against any other foe i would say you were wise your majesty but livanios livanios never seems to do what youd expect sarkis turned his head at the sound of galloping hoofbeats so did krispos sarkis said looks like another courier coming upno two of em together oh phos what now it was more a groan than a prayer every courier whod ridden up to krispos lately had brought bad news with him how much longer could that go on sure enough the riders made straight for the imperial standard that marked krispos place in the line of march theyre sending out babies he thought one of the couriers had no beard the other didnt seem much older krispos braced for the call of may it please your majesty and the displeasing message that would follow it the bearded rider spotted him under the sunburst standard then raised a hand to his mouth to make a shout carry farther but he didnt yell may it please your majesty instead he called father krispos first thought was that katakolon was playing some kind of trick on him and not a funny one then he recognized the voice he hadnt been sure hed ever hear that voice again or want to phostis he whispered his son approached and the other rider with him several halogai quickly moved to put themselves between phostis and krisposthey knew where phostis had been and did not know what hed become krispos wanted to thank them and punch them at the same time its all right fatherive escaped the gleaming path phostis said before krispos answered one of the halogai said what proof of this have you young majesty the big fair men from the north did not stand aside what proof could phostis possibly have krispos wondered but he produced some allow me to present olyvria the daughter of livanios by then krispos had figured out that phostis companion was a woman to remove any doubt she doffed her travelers hat with a flourish and let her piledup hair tumble out in a curly black waterfall your majesty she said bowing in the saddle to krispos shes not just accompanying phostis krispos realized shes with him phostis eyes did not want to leave her even to look at his father katakolon got that mooncalf gaze but never over the same girl for more than a couple of months krispos hadnt seen it on phostis before olyvria looked at phostis the same way acting krispos didnt think so he asked olyvria are you here of your own will girl or did he kidnap you as a matter of fact your majesty i kidnapped him olyvria answered boldly krispos stared that was not the reply hed expected olyvria added weve made other arrangements since so i gather krispos glanced over to phostis who was still grinning like a besotted schoolboy the avtokrator made his decision he told the haloga guards stand aside after a moments hesitation they obeyed he urged his horse up alongside phostis held out his arms the two men one young the other vividly remembering when he had been embraced phostis pulled away sorry father but hugging chain mail hurts i have so much to tell youdid you know for instance that makuran is aiding the thanasioi as things turn out i did krispos said im glad to hear you tell me as much all the sameit lets me know you are to be trusted indeed he wondered if he should have been so frank he watched phostis face freeze into the mask hed seen so often before the one that concealed whatever went on behind it minutes into their reunion would the two of them go back to misunderstanding each other but olyvria said i dont blame you for being wary of us your majesty truly though the gleaming path lures us no more to krispos relief phostis face cleared thats so he said ive seen more along those lines than i can stomach and fatheris zaidas with you aye he is krispos answered why i have much to tell himand little of it goodof artapan the makuraner mage who aids livanios schemes all that can wait till tonight when we camp krispos said for now its enough to see you again and to see you here as something besides a thanasiot fanatic he thought he kept that to himself though phostis would have to be a fool if he couldnt figure it out let the lad have his time in phos sun now though how did you escape the zealots clutches then phostis and olyvria took turns telling the tale which as it unfolded seemed only fair to krispos phostis didnt try to minimize what hed done as an unwilling thanasiot raider if anything he dwelt on it with pained guilt how are your arm and shoulder now krispos asked they still pain me now and again phostis said working the arm i can use them though anyhow father getting wounded helped convince syagrios i could be trusted and prompted him to let me go to pityos olyvria took over then with the story of how shed smashed the chamber pot on syagrios head fitting enough krispos agreed then phostis told of buying the fishing boat and sailing to videssos the city that made krispos laugh out loud thereyou see all that time you passed on the water with me wasnt wasted after all i suppose not phostis said he was if nothing else more patient around krispos than he had been before he was kidnapped krispos watched his mirth fade as he continued i found riots in the city when i got there yes i knew of them krispos said nodding i knew you were on the way to the city too zaidas magic told me as much i feared you were traveling as provocateur not escapee i meant to write evripos and tell him as much but it slipped my mind until yesterday in the midst of everything else thats been going on it didnt matter phostis answered he thought of it for himself good krispos said to see how phostis would react phostis didnt react much at all certainly not with the anger he would have shown a few months before he just nodded and went on with his story when he was finished krispos said so our troops have the upper hand they did when olyvria and i left to join you phostis said uh father yes what do you think of the suggestion i made to evripos that olyvria and i should marry at once to show the thanasioi weve renounced their sect imperial marriages have a way of being made for reasons of state but till now id never heard of one made for reasons of doctrine krispos answered were the emergency worse i might send the two of you back there to be wedded forthwith as it is i think you can wait till the campaign is over before you marryassuming you still want to by then their expressions said they could imagine no other possibility krispos had a deeper imagination if they still wanted to go through with it come fall he didnt think hed objector that phostis would listen if he tried the lad had needed to take care of himself lately and had discovered he could do it few discoveries were more important krispos said if you two like you can spend the night in my pavilion then he saw their faces and laughed at himself no youll want a tent for yourselves wont you i would have at your age well yes phostis said thank you father its all right krispos answered at that moment having phostis back not only in one piece but opposed to the gleaming path he could have refused him very little he did add before you repair to that tent i trust youll do me the honor of dining on army food and bad wine in the pavilion ill have zaidas there too you said you wanted to talk with him didnt you phostis ill see you around sunset even with olyvrias hand warm in his phostis approached krispos tent with considerable trepidation when he set sail for videssos the city shed feared he would remember he was junior avtokrator and forget he was her lover now as the bright silks of the imperial pavilion drew near he was afraid his father would turn him into a boy again simply by refusing to imagine he could be anything else the halogai outside the entrance to the tent saluted him in imperial style clenched right fists over their hearts he watched them discreetly look olyvria up and down as men of any nation will when they see a pretty girl one of them said something in his own language phostis understood it was about olyvria but not what it meant he had only a smattering of the haloga tongue he almost asked the guardsmen what it meant but at the last minute decided not to make an issue of ithaloga candor could be brutal inside the tent waited krispos katakolon zaidas sarkis and half a dozen helpings of bread and onions and sausage and salted olives olyvrias smile puzzled phostis till he remembered she was an officers daughter no doubt the fare looked familiar as they ate phostis and olyvria retold their story for zaidas sarkis and katakolon had heard most of it in the afternoon the mage as usual made a good audience he clapped his hands when olyvria again recounted knocking syagrios out with the chamber pot and when phostis told how theyd decamped immediately thereafter thats the way to do it he said approvingly when you need to get out in a hurry spend what you have to and leave whats the point to saving your gold but failing of your purpose which reminds me he abruptly went serious and intent his majesty the avtokrator oh just say your father and have done krispos broke in otherwise youll waste half the night in useless blathering as your majesty the avtokrator commands zaidas said krispos made as if to throw a crust of bread at him grinning zaidas turned back to phostis your father i should say tells me you learned something of importance about the techniques of livanios makuraner wizard thats true sorcerous sir phostis had to work to stay formal hed almost called the mage uncle zaidas one day this was after i learned artapan was from makurani followed him and he described how hed learned artapan fortified his power with the death energies of thanasioi who starved themselves to complete their renunciation of the world and if they werent quite dead when he needed them so he wasnt averse to holding a pillow over their heads either thats disgusting katakolon said sick horror in his voice zaidas by contrast sounded eager like a hunting dog just catching a scent tell me more he urged olyvria gave phostis a curious look you never spoke to me of this before she said i know i didnt i didnt even like to think about it and besides i didnt think saying anything would be safe in etchmiadzin too many ears around and even after they became lovers he hadnt trusted her not completely not until she set upon syagrios that though he kept to himself go on zaidas said all the ears here are friendly in as much detail as he could prompted by sharp questions from the mage phostis recounted following artapan down the street standing in the stinking alley listening to him talk with tzepeas and the thanasiots premature and assisted death that isnt the only time i saw him hovering over people who were on the point of starving either he said remember olyvria he kept hanging around strabons house while he was dying he did she said nodding with strabon and others i never thought much about itwizards have their ways thats all zaidas stirred in his seat but didnt say anything for a man of his age he was phostis thought reasonably normal save for his sorcerous talent but then he was the only wizard phostis knew well who could say what others were like did he pray as heendedthis heretics life zaidas asked either to phos or to the four prophets i mean he spoke some in makuraner but since i dont understand it i dont know what he said im sorry phostis answered cant be helped the mage said it probably doesnt matter in any case as youve noted for yourself the transition from life to death is a powerful source of magical energy we who follow phos are forbidden to exploit it lest we grow to esteem the power so much that we fall into injustice slaying for the sake of magic alone i was given to understand that prohibition also applied to followers of the prophets four but i may be wrong on the other hand artapanthat was the name not somay be as much a heretic by mashizs standards as the thanasioi are by ours krispos said this would all be very interesting if we were hashing it out as an exercise at the sorcerers collegium sorcerous sir but how does it affect us here in the wider world suppose artapan is using magic fueled by death does that make him more dangerous how do we counteract his magic if it does behind her hand olyvria whispered your father drives straight for the heart of a question that he does phostis scratched at the side of his jaw he gets frustrated when others dont follow as quickly as they often dont he wondered if that accounted for some of his fathers impatience with him but how could someone just coming into manhood be expected to stay with the schemes of a grown man with the full power of experience who was also one of the master schemers that videssos a nation of schemers had ever known zaidas missed the byplay and spoke straight to krispos your majesty a mage who uses death energy in his thaumaturgy gains strength aye but he also becomes more vulnerable to others magic that sort of compensation is nothing surprising wizardry no matter what the ignorant may think offers no free miracles what you gain in one area you lose in another thats not just wizardrythats life krispos said if youve chosen to take on a big flock of sheep you wont be able to plant as much barley sarkis chuckled how many years on the throne your majesty to have you still talking like a peasant a proper emperor now one from the romances would say you cant war in east and west at the same time or some such to the ice with the romances phostis broke in the next one that tells a coppers worth of truth will be the first he caught krispos watching him with eyebrow upraised in speculation unabashed the avtokrator gave him a sober nod youre learning lad i will speak for the romances olyvria said where but in them does the prisoner escape with the heresiarchs daughter whos fallen in love with him now sarkis laughed out loud by the good god shes caught father and son in the same net he swigged wine refilled his mug and swigged again when krispos turned his gaze on olyvria amusement sparked in his eyes he dipped his head as if shed made a clever move at the board game there is something to what you say lady no theres not phostis insisted in what romance isnt the woman a quivering wreck who requires some bold hero to rescue her and in which of them does she rescue the hero by clouting the villain with a thundermug it seemed the handiest thing in the room olyvria said amid general laughter besides you cant expect a romance to have all the details straight you have to watch this one brother katakolon said shes quick the only things katakolon looked for in his companions were looks and willingness no wonder he went through them like a drunkard through a wine cellar phostis thought but he didnt feel like quarreling with katakolon not tonight ill take my chances he said and let it go at that sarkis looked at the jar of wine in front of him yawned and shook his head he climbed to his feet im for bed your majesty he announced he turned to phostis good to have you back and your quick lady he walked out into the night zaidas also rose im for bed too would i had the power to store up sleep as a dormouse stores fat for its winter rest spurred not least by what youve said tonight young majesty i think i shall be engaged in serious sorcery soon at which time i will call on all my bodily reserves the good god grant that they suffice how cozyits a family gathering now krispos said when the mage left he was not being sardonic he beamed from katakolon to phostis and on to olyvria that took a weight of worry from phostis a young man will seldom turn aside from his beloved at his fathers urging but that is not an urging he ever cares to hear then katakolon also stood up he clapped phostis on the back careful to stay away from the wounded shoulder wonderful youre here and mostly intact he said he nodded to olyvria and krispos then followed sarkis and zaidas out of the pavilion he didnt say anything about bed krispos said half laughing half sighing hes probably out prowling for a friendly wench among the camp followers hell probably find one too now i know you believe our tale your majesty olyvria said hows that krispos asked phostis recognized his tone it was the one he always used when he was finding out what his sons had learned of their lessons if you didnt youd not be sitting here with the two of us closer to you than your guards are she answered were desperate characters after all and if we can turn a chamber pot into a weapon who knows what we might do with a spoon or an inkwell who indeed krispos said with a small chuckle he turned to phostis she is quickyoud better take good care of her he was quick himself he didnt miss the yawn olyvria tried to hide now youd better take her back to your tent riding the courier circuit is wearingi remember ill do that father phostis said but may i come back here for a few minutes afterward both olyvria and krispos looked at him in surprise something i want to ask you he said knowing it was not an explanation krispos had to know that too but he nodded whatever you like of course olyvria asked questions all the way to the tent that had been set up for them phostis didnt answer any of them he knew how much that irked her but held his course regardless the most he would say was its nothing to do with you he walked back to the imperial pavilion almost as warily as hed entered the tunnel that ran under videssos the city what he found here might be as dangerous as anything that had lurked there salutes from the halogai didnt make him any less nervous as he ducked his way into the pavilion krispos waited at the map table a wine cup in his hand and curiosity on his face despite that curiosity he waited quietly until phostis had also filled a cup and taken a long draft then wine ran sweet down his throat but gave him no extra courage too bad he thought well krispos said when phostis lowered the wine cup from his lips whats such a deep dark secret that you cant speak of it in front of your lady love had krispos sounded sarcastic phostis would have turned on his heel and strode out of the pavilion without answering but he just seemed inquisitiveand friendly too which phostis wasnt used to hed tried a dozen different ways of framing his question when it escaped his lips though it did so without any fancy frame whatever are you my father he watched krispos suddenly seem to freeze in place all except his eyes which grew very wide then as if to give himself time to think the avtokrator lifted his cup and drained it dry id wondered what you wanted he said at last i didnt expect you to ask me that are you phostis pressed as young men will of their fathersor those they believe their fathershed always thought of krispos as old but old in the sense of conservative and powerful rather than actually elderly now as the lines on krispos face deepened harshly phostis saw with eerie certainty what he would look like as an old man are you phostis said again krispos sighed his shoulders sagged he laughed for a moment quietly and to himself phostis almost hit him then krispos walked over to the wine jar poured himself another cup from it then peered into the dark ruby depths when he looked up toward phostis he spoke in what was almost a whisper not a weeks gone by i think since i took the crown that i havent asked myself the same question and i just dont know phostis had expected a yes or no something he could get his teeth into either way being left with more uncertainty was maddening how can you not know he cried if you thought to ask the question son the answer should be plain enough krispos said he drank some of the wine maybe he was looking for courage there too your mother was anthimos empress if it hadnt been for her anthimos would have slain me by magic the night i took the throne shed been his empress for some years before she was mine and never conceived none of the other women he hadand believe me he had a great flock of themever quickened either but what does that prove nothing for certain i think youre likely to be mine but thats the most i can say with any hope for truth phostis did some more quiet calculating if krispos had sired him hed likely done it before he took the throne from anthimos and before hed married dara hed done it adulterously in other wordsand so had phostis mother he shied away from that thought it was too uncomfortable to examine straight on instead he said you always say i look like mother oh you do ladthe eyes especially that tiny fold of skin on the inner corner comes straight from her so does the shape of your face and so does your nose shes the reason you dont have a great beak like mine krispos put thumb and forefinger on the tip of his nose unless you had nothing to do with the way my nose looks at all phostis said there is that chance krispos agreed but if you dont take after me you dont look like anthimos either you might be handsomer if you did nothing wrong with the way he looked you favor dara though you always have ever since you were a baby in his minds eye phostis had a sudden vivid picture of krispos studying the infant hed been trying to trace resemblances no wonder you sometimes treated me as if i were the cuckoos egg he said did i krispos peered down into his wine cup again he sighed deeply im sorry son i truly am ive always tried to be just with you to put aside whatever doubts i had just id say you were that phostis answered but you didnt often he broke off how was he supposed to explain to krispos that justice sufficed in the courts but families needed more the closest he could come was to say you always did seem easier with evripos and katakolon maybe i was maybe i am not your fault thoughthe troubles been mine if without great warmth krispos had the strength to meet troubles head on where do we go from here he asked what would you have of me can you take me for what i am instead of for whose son i might be phostis said in every way that matters im yours he told krispos how hed found himself imitating him while a prisoner and how so much of what krispos said made more sense afterward i know why that is krispos said phostis made a questioning noise krispos went on its because the only experience anyone can really learn from is his own i was probably just wasting breath beforehand when i preached at you you couldnt have had any idea what i was talking about and when my words did prove of some use to younothing could make me prouder he folded phostis into a bear hug for a moment resentment flared in the younger man where had embraces like this been when he was a boy and needed them most but hed already worked out the answer to that for himself he wasnt pleased with krispos for acting as he had over the years but now that too made more sense phostis said can we go on as we did before even with doubts i cant think of anyone id rather have for my father than youand that includes anthimos that cuts both waysson krispos said with me or in spite of me youve made yourself a man lets hope its not as it was lets hope its better so it may prove for much of the poison between us is out in the open now phos grant that it be sofather phostis said they embraced again when they separated phostis found himself yawning he said now im going back to my tent for the night krispos gave him a sly look will you tell your lady what passed here one of these days maybe phostis said after a little thought not just yet thats what id say in your sandals krispos agreed you think like one of mine all right good night son good night phostis said he yawned again then headed back to the tent where olyvria was waiting when he walked in he found that almost certainly against her best intentions shed fallen asleep he was careful not to wake her when he lay down himself all right sorcerous sir krispos said to zaidas having learned what you did from my son how do you propose to exploit it to our best advantage he felt a stab when he spoke thus of phostis but it was not the usual stab of suspicious fear merely one of curiosity he was beginning to see he had a man there to reckon with and if perchance phostis was not his by blood he certainly was by turn of mind what more could any rulerany fatherwant zaidas said i will show you what i can do your majesty not least by using the power he has gained from the transition of fanatical thanasioi out of life and into death this makuraner wizard this artapan has built his magic to a point where it is difficult to assail this much to my discomfiture you have seen yes krispos said many times hed resolved to treat phostis as if he were certain of his parentage as many times till now hed failed this time he thought he might succeed an arch has a keystone zaidas went on take it out and the whole thing crashes to the ground so with artapans magic take away this power he has wrongfully arrogated to himself and he will be weaker than if he never meddled where he should not have this is what i aim to do krispos recognized the didactic tone in the sorcerers voice it suited him though he had no sorcerous talent himself he was always interested in hearing how wizards did what they did today moreover it would influence how he conducted his campaign and so he asked how will you manage it sorcerous sir by opposing the power of death with the power of life zaidas answered the sorcery is prepared your majesty i shall essay it tomorrow at dawn when the rising of phos sun most powerful symbol of light and life and rebirth shall add its influence to that of my magic and your son too shall play a role as shall livanios daughter olyvria shall they krispos said will it endanger them id not care to have phostis restored to me only to lose him two days later in a war of sorcerers no no zaidas shook his head the good god willing and so i believe the case to bethe procedure i have in mind will take artapan altogether by surprise and even if he knows phostis has escaped and joined you here your son gives the strong impression the makuraner does not know his technique has been discovered until the dawn then krispos said he wanted immediate action but zaidas reason for delay struck him as good it also let the imperial army advance farther onto the westlands central plateauwith luck positioning the force to exploit whatever success against artapan that zaidas achieved krispos wondered how much faith to place in his chief mage zaidas hadnt had much luck against the thanasioi before though he hadnt known what he was opposing now he did if he couldnt do something useful with that advantage then he wont be any help at all krispos said aloud he breathed a silent prayer for zaidas up to the watching sky red as blood the sun crawled up over the eastern horizon zaidas greeted it by raising his hands to the heavens and intoning phos creed we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor phostis imitated the gesture and echoed the creed he fought to stifle a yawn yawning during the creed struck him as faintly blasphemous but getting up well before sunrise as spring grew toward summer was anything but easy beside him olyvria shifted from foot to foot she looked awake enough but nervous nonetheless she kept stealing glances at krispos being around the avtokrator had to add to her unease to phostis his fatherfor so he still supposed krispos to bewas family first and ruler second familiarity overcame awe it was just the other way round for olyvria get on with it krispos said harshly used to any other man it would have been a headswillroll tone zaidas merely nodded and said all in good time your majesty ah now we see the entire disk of the sun we may proceed a few hundred yards away sunrise made the imperial army begin to stir in camp almost all the haloga bodyguards stood between the camp and this little hillock to make sure no one blundered up while zaidas was at his magic the rest were between the sorcerer and krispos phostis didnt know what their axes could do against magic gone wrong he didnt think they knew either but they were ready to try zaidas lighted a sliver of wood from one of the torches that had illuminated the hillock before the day began he used the flame to light a stout candle of skyblue wax one fat and tall enough to have provided imperial sealing wax for the next fifty years as the flame slid down the wick and caught in the wax he spoke the creed again this time softly to himself candles in daylight were normally overwhelmed by the sun somehow this one was not though when seen directly its flame was no brighter than that of an ordinary candle yet its glow caught and held on zaidas face and krispos and olyvrias though he could not see himself phostis supposed the light lingered on him as well zaidas said this light symbolizes the long and great life of the empire of videssos and of the faith that it has sustained and that has sustained it across the centuries long may empire and faith flourish from under a silk cloth he took out another candle this one hardly better than a tiny taper a thin layer of bright red wax around a wick thats the same color as the sealing wax on that vaunting letter livanios sent me krispos said zaidas smiled your majesty lacks only the gift to be a firstrate wizard your instincts are perfectly sound he raised his voice to the halfchanting tone he used when incanting this small brief candle stands for the thanasioi whose foolish heresy will soon fail and be forgotten almost as soon as he spoke the last words the little red candle guttered out a thin spiral of smoke rose from it when the breeze blew that away nothing showed that the candle representing the thanasioi had ever existed the larger light the one symbolizing videssos as a whole burned on now what krispos demanded this should be the time to settle accounts with that makuraner mage yes your majesty zaidas was a patient man sometimes even the most patient of men finds it necessary to let his patience show he said i could proceed even more expeditiously if i did not have to pause and respond to inquiries and comments now krispos chuckled quite unabashed this time zaidas ignored him he took a large silk cloth big enough for a wall hanging and draped it over both phostis and olyvria the cloth was of the same sky blue as the candle that stood for the empire and the orthodox faith the silks fine weave let phostis see through it mistily as if through fog he watched zaidas take up yet another cloth this one striped in bright colors it reminded him of the caftans artapan had worn no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than zaidas declared now we shall sorcerously show the wicked wizard of makuran that he shall profit nothing from his courtship of death he dropped out of that impressive tone and into ordinary speech for a moment now young majesty comes your time to contribute to this magic take your intended in your arms kiss her and think on all you might be doing were the rest of us not standing around here making nuisances of ourselves phostis stared at him through the thin silk cloth are you sure thats what you want of us uncle zuh sorcerous sir do that alone and do it properly young majesty and no one could do more this day think of it if you must as duty rather than pleasure kissing olyvria was not a duty and phostis refused to consider it one her sweet lips and tongue the soft firmness of her body pressed against his argued that she too enjoyed the task zaidas had set them so tightly did phostis hold her against him that she could not have doubted what he wanted to do with her he heard her laugh softly back in her throat after a while he opened his eyes hed kissed olyvria a lot lately and while he thoroughly enjoyed it hed never been part of a major conjuration before he wanted to see what zaidas was up to the first thing he saw was that olyvrias eyes were already open that made him laugh zaidas was holding the piece of striped fabric above the flame of the blue candle he intoned as they celebrate life under their cloth so may that overturn the makuraner mage who would strengthen himself through death let his sorcery be consumed as videssos light consumes the cloth of his country he thrust the fabric into the fire phostis always regretted the silk cloth that hazed his vision it made him doubt his own eyes the striped square of fabric flared up brightly the moment the candle flame touched it for that instant it burned as if it had been soaked in oil phostis wondered if zaidas could drop it fast enough to save his fingers but then the burning cloth flickered and almost went out not only that the part that had been consumed seemed restored so that the cloth looked bigger than it had when it burned brightest zaidas stumbled and almost took it out of the candle flame he stood steady though and repeated the incantation hed used when he first put the cloth in the flame to it he added other muttered charms that phostis heard only indistinctly the striped cloth began to burn again hesitantly at first but then with greater vigor you have it sorcerous sir krispos breathed though he spoke softly he must have distracted zaidas for the flame on the cloth shrank and the cloth itself seemed to expand once more but zaidas rallied again more and more of the cloth burned away finally with a puff of smoke like the one from the expiring thanasiot candle it was gone zaidas stuck the thumb and forefinger of his right hand into his mouth they shouldnt have been scorched thoughthey should have been burned to the bone when he took the fingers out the wizard said in a worn voice what magic can do magic has done the good god willing i have struck artapan a heavy blow this day how shall you know whether the good god was willing krispos asked instead of answering directly zaidas swept the filmy silk cloth away from phostis and olyvria and said you two can detach yourselves from each other now they shook their heads at the same time and both started to laugh that was what made them break apart phostis said we liked what we were doing i noticed that yes zaidas said so dryly it might have been krispos talking krispos repeated how will you know whether you smote artapan your majesty i am about to find that out for which purpose i require your eldest son once more me phostis said what do i need to do now what i tell you before explaining what that was the mage turned to olyvria and bowed my lady i am grateful for your services against the makuraner your presence is not required for this next conjuration he made it sound as if her presence was not desired though that miffed phostis olyvria nodded and swept down the little hillock a couple of halogai trailed after her the northerners seemed to have accepted her as part of the imperial family why dont you want her to watch what were doing phostis asked zaidas because i am going to use you to help locate her father livanios zaidas answered you were in contact with him by the law of contagion you remain in contact so for that matter does she but no matter how she loves you i would not use her as the instrument of her fathers betrayal a nicety of sentiment the thanasioi wouldnt give back to us krispos said but youre right to use it carry on sorcerous sir i shall never fear zaidas answered i was just about to explain that artapans magic has up to this point shielded the thanasioi from such direct sorcerous scrutiny if however we have weakened him with the conjuration just completed this next spell should also succeed very neat krispos said approvingly you use the same magic to learn whether the previous one worked and where the heresiarchs main force is thats economical enough to have sprung from the brain of a treasury logothete i shall construe that as a compliment and hope it was meant so zaidas said which squeezed a chuckle out of krispos the conjuration the sorcerer had in mind seemed simple in the extreme he took some loose crumbly dirt from the top of the hillock and put it in a large low bowl then he called phostis over and had him press his hand down onto the dirt as soon as phostis drew back a pace zaidas began to chant his left hand moved in quick passes over the bowl a few seconds later hair prickled up on the back of phostis neck the dirt was stirring shifting humping itself up into a ridgeno not a ridge an arrow for one end showed an unmistakable point east and a little south zaidas said very very good krispos breathed as usual he was quietest when he felt most triumphant the mask is down thenwe can see the moves livanios makes have you any idea how far away his force lies not precisely no the mage answered by the speed with which the arrow formed i should say he is not close it gives but a rough measure though a rough measure is all we need for now you and phostis will work this magic every morning from now on to give us the foes bearing and your rough measure of how far away he is will artapan know his magic has failed him im afraid so your majesty zaidas said did you see how the cloth representing makuran tried a couple of times to reconstitute itself that was my opponent attempting to resist and undo my spell but he failed as i thought he would for the power of life is stronger than that of death krispos walked over to phostis and clapped him on the back hard enough to stagger him and all of it thanks to you son i owe you a great deal youve done me as much good by returning and aiding me as i feared youd do me harm had you stayed with the thanasioi and besides that im glad youre back im glad im back too father phostis said if krispos claimed the relationship despite his doubts phostis would not quarrel with it he went on and whats this i hear about your missing me so much that you decided to sire a bastardhe carefully did not say another bastardto take my place the year before he couldnt have bantered so with krispos the avtokrator looked startled then laughed which of your brothers told you that evripos back at videssos the city aye its true i hope he also said i didnt intend to let it compromise the rights you three enjoy even if it is a son he did phostis said nodding but really father at your age thats all of you whove said that now krispos broke in to the ice with your teasing as youll find out gray in your beard doesnt stop you from being a man it may slow you down but it doesnt stop you he looked defiant as if waiting for phostis to find that funny but phostis didnt feel like provoking him any further having just found his way onto good terms with krispos he wouldnt risk throwing that away for the sake of a few minutes amusement he probably wouldnt have made such a calculation the year before two or three years earlier he was sure he wouldnt have what does that signify he wondered is it what they mean by growing up but he already was grown up he had been for yearshadnt he scratching his head he walked back to the tent he shared with olyvria due east now your majesty zaidas reported theyre getting close too the arrow formed almost as soon as phostis took his hand from the ensorceled soil all right sorcerous sir and thank you krispos answered for the last week hed been maneuvering to place the imperial army square in the path of the withdrawing thanasioi if the lord with the great and good mind is kind to us well swoop down on them before they even know were in the neighborhood may it be so zaidas said due east you say krispos went on musingly theyd be somewhere not far from hmm aptos id say is that about right given where we are now the mage frowned in concentration then nodded somewhere not far from there yes uh father phostis began in a tentative voice he hadnt sounded tentative since hed escaped from the thanasioi krispos gave him a curious look wondering why he did now whats wrong he asked uh phostis said again by the hangdog look on his face he regretted having spoke up he needed a very visible rally before he continued when i had to go out on that thanasiot raiding party fatherremember i told you of that i remember krispos said he also remembered what a turn news of phostis movement had given him and how much hed feared the youth really had decided to follow the gleaming path when i was on that raid phostis resumed to my shame i had to join in attacking a monastery i know i wounded one of the holy monks if i hadnt hed have broken my bones with his cudgel and my torch was one that helped fire the place why are you telling me this krispos asked oxeites the patriarch is a better one to hear it if youre after the forgiveness of your sin i wasnt thinking of that so muchmore of making amends phostis said by your leave id like to set aside a third of my allowance for the next couple of years and devote it to the monastery you dont need my leave the gold i give you each month is yours to do with as you will krispos said but this i will say to you im proud of you for having the idea he thought for a moment so youd give them eighty goldpieces a year would you how would it be if i matched that he watched phostis face catch fire thank you father that would be wonderful ill leave my name off the money krispos said let them think it all comes from you uh phostis said for a third time i hadnt planned on putting my name on either really krispos said the most holy oxeites would tell you an anonymous gift finds twice as much favor with phos as the other kind for it must be given for its own sake rather than to gain acclaim i dont know about that but i admit it sounds reasonable i know im all the prouder of you though you know you tell me that now twice in the space of a couple of minutes but im not sure you ever said it to me before phostis said had he spoken with intent to wound he would have infuriated krispos but he had the air of a man just stating a fact and it was a fact krispos memory confirmed that too well he hung his head you shame me i didnt mean to i know krispos said that makes it worse sarkis rode up then rather to krispos relief after saluting the cavalry general asked now that the heretics are drawing near shall we send out scouts to learn exactly where they are instead of answering at once krispos turned to phostis your store of wisdom seems bigger than usual this morning what would you do urk phostis said krispos shook a finger at him you have to answer without the foolish noises when the red boots are on your feet these are the questions you must deal with you cant waste time either he studied the youth wondering how hed do as if to redeem that startled squawk phostis made his voice as deep and serious as he could were the command mine id say no were tracking the thanasioi well by magic so why let them blunder against our men before the last possible moment if zaidas magic has worked as well as he hopes artapan should be nearly blind to us the more surprise we have the better sarkis glanced toward krispos the avtokrator spoke six words as he said for his reasons phostis looked even more pleased at that indirect praise than he had when krispos said he was proud of him aye it does make sense sarkis chuckled your majesty you were a pretty fair strategist yourself before you really knew what you were doing it must run in the blood well maybe krispos and phostis said it in the same breath and in the same tone they looked at each other the avtokrator started to laugh a moment later so did phostis neither one seemed able to stop now sarkis studied them as if wondering whether theyd lost their wits i didnt think it was that funny he said plaintively maybe its not krispos said on the other hand maybe it is phostis said thinking back to the grueling and in the end uncertain talk theyd had a few nights before the avtokrator found himself nodding if they could laugh about it that probably boded well for the future i still say youve gone mad in the morning sarkis rumbled ill try one of you or the other this afternoon and see if you make any sense then he rode off beak of a nose in the air the tent was small and close the warm night made it seem even closer so did the stink of hot tallow from the candle stuck in the ground where its flame couldnt reach anything burnable as she had for the past several nights olyvria asked what did you go back to talk about with your father i dont want to tell you phostis said hed been saying that ever since hed come back from krispos pavilion it was not an answer calculated to stifle curiosity but he knew no better to give why dont you olyvria demanded if it had to do with me i have a right to know it had nothing to do with you phostis had repeated that a good many times too it was even true the only trouble was olyvria didnt believe him tonight she seemed to have decided to argue like a canon lawyer well if it has nothing to do with me then what possible harm could there be to my knowing it she grinned smugly pleased with herself shed put him in a logicians classic double bind but he refused to be bound if it were your business i wouldnt have wanted the talk to be private thats not right she glared angry now i think it is phostis didnt want anyone wondering who his father was he wished he didnt have to wonder himself one person could keep a secretkrispos had after all two people might keep a secret more than two people he supposed it was possible but it didnt seem likely why wont you tell me olyvria tried a new tack youve given me no reason if i tell you why i wont tell you that would be about the same as telling you phostis had to listen to that sentence again in his head before he was sure it had come out the way he wanted it he went on it has nothing to do with you and me what you talked about may not have but that you wont tell me certainly does olyvria needed a moments hesitation too what could you possibly want to keep to yourself that way its none of your concern phostis ground out the words one at a time olyvria glowered at him he glowered back these arguments got him angry too his hissed exhale was almost a snarl he said all right by the good god ill tell you what suppose you go over to the avtokrators pavilion and ask him if he doesnt mind telling you what we talked about i suppose its all right with me she had spirit hed known that from the day he first encountered her naked and lovely and tempting under videssos the city for a moment he thought shed do as hed dared and storm out of the tent he wondered what krispos would make of that how hed handle it but even olyvrias nerve could fray she said its not just that hes your fatherhes the avtokrator too i know phostis said dryly ive had to deal with that my whole life youd best get used to it too phos is the only true judge of course but my guess is that hell be avtokrator a good many years yet videssian history knew instances of imperial heirs who grew impatient waiting for their fathers to die and helped the process along it also knew rather more instances of impatient imperial heirs who tried to help the process along failed and never ever got a second chance phostis had no interest in raising a sedition against krispos for among others the most practical of good reasons he was convinced the avtokrator would smell out the plot and use him for it as a failed rebel deserved he counted himself lucky that krispos had forgiven him after his involuntary sojourn among the thanasioi probing still olyvria said is it something that discredits you or your father is that why you dont want to talk about it i wont answer questions like that either phostis said not answering was another trick hed learned from krispos if you started responding the questions around the edge of the one you didnt want to discuss before long the exact shape and size of the answer to that one came clear i think youre being hateful olyvria said phostis stared down his nose at her it wasnt quite as long and impressive as krispos but it served well enough im doing what i think i need to do youre livanios daughter but no one has tried to tear out of you any of his secrets that you didnt care to give seems to me i ought to be allowed a secret or two of my own it just strikes me as foolish thats all olyvria said how could telling whatever it is possibly hurt you maybe it couldnt phostis said though he wondered how much hay evripos might make out of knowing how uncertain his paternity was then he started to laugh whats funny olyvrias voice turned dangerous youre not laughing at me are you phostis drew the suncircle over his heart by the good god i swear im not his obvious sincerity mollified olyvria better still hed not taken a false oath when he thought of evripos making hay whose perspective was he borrowing but that of krispos the expeasant even if krispos hadnt sired him hed certainly shaped the way he thought at levels so deep phostis rarely noticed them olyvria remained mulish how can i trust you if you keep secrets from me if you dont think you can trust me you should have let me put you ashore at some deserted beach now phostis grew angry and if you still dont trust me i daresay my father will give you a safe conduct to leave camp and go back to etchmiadzin or wherever else youd like no i dont want that olyvria studied him curiously youre not the same as you were last summer under the temple or even last fall after youcame to etchmiadzin then you werent sure of what you wanted or how to go about getting it youre harder nowand dont make lewd jokes you trust your own judgment more than you did before do i phostis thought about it perhaps i do id better dont you think in the end its all i have i hadnt thought you could be so stubborn olyvria said now that i know ill have to deal with you a little differently she laughed in small embarrassment maybe i shouldnt have said that it sounds as if im giving away some special womanly secret no i dont think so phostis said he was happy to steer the conversation away from what he and krispos had talked about men also have to change the way they treat women as they come to know them betteror so im finding out anyway you dont mean men you mean you olyvria said with a catlike pounce phostis spread his hands conceding the point he didnt mind yielding on small things if that let him keep hold of the big ones he slowly noddedkrispos would have handled this the same way someone rode up to the nearby imperial pavilion in a tearing hurry a moment later krispos started yelling for sarkis not long after that the avtokrator and his general both yelled for messengers and not long after that the whole camp started stirring though it had to be well into the third hour of the night what do you suppose thats all about olyvria asked phostis had an idea of what it might be about but before he could answer someone called from outside the tent are you two decent in there olyvria looked offended phostis didnthe recognized the voice aye decent enough he called back come on in katakolon his younger brother pushed aside the entry flap if you are decent youve probably been listening to all the fuss outside katakolons eyes gleamed with excitement so we have phostis said what is it have scouts brought back word that theyve run into the thanasioi oh to the ice with you katakolon said indignantly i was hoping to bring a surprise and here youve gone and figured it out never mind that phostis said the fuss means we fight tomorrow aye katakolon answered we fight tomorrow xii katakolon pointed to the rising cloud of dust ahead soon now father he said aye very soon krispos agreed through the dust the early morning sun sparkled off the iron heads of arrows and javelins off chain mail shirts off the polished edges of sword blades the thanasioi were hurrying through the pass heading back toward etchmiadzin after a raid that had spanned most of the length of the westlands sarkis said now your majesty krispos tasted the moment aye now he said sarkis waved quietly without the trumpet calls that usually would have ordered them into action two regiments of cavalry rode up the pass from the imperial lines sarkis grin filled his fat face that should give them something new to think about if zaidas spoke truly they dont know were anywhere nearby let alone in front of them i hope he spoke truly krispos said i think he did by all the signs his magic could give their makuraner mage is altogether stifled the good god grant it be so sarkis said i have no love for makuraners every so often they take it into their heads that the princes of vaspurakan should be forced to reverence their prophets four rather than phos one day maybe videssos can do something about that krispos said the empire he thought ought to protect all those who followed the lord with the great and good mind but vaspurakan had lain under the rule of the kings of kings of makuran for a couple of hundred years begging your pardon your majesty but id sooner we were free altogether sarkis said likely your hierarchs would make spiritual masters no more pleasant than the men from mashiz your folk would be as harsh on us as heretics as the makuraners are on us as infidels seems to me youre both quarreling over the taste of a loaf you dont have katakolon said krispos laughed youre probably right sonno you are right thin in the distance shouts said that the thanasioi and the regiments krispos had sent out to delay them were knocking heads this time krispos waved now trumpets and drums and pipes rang loud the imperial force that had been aligned parallel to the direction of the pass swung in a great left wheel to block its mouth and keep the heretics from breaking through as the imperials raised their own dust and then as they came into view the shouts from the thanasioi got louder their red banners waved furiously they might have been taken by surprise but there was no quit in them on they came driving the lead regiments back on the main body of krispos force the avtokrator who now stood at his armys extreme right rather than to the fore admired the bravery of the thanasioi he would have admired it even more had it been aimed at the empires foreign enemies rather than against him phostis tapped him on the shoulder pointing to the center of the heretics line thats livanios father the fellow in the gilded shirt between those two flags there krispos eye followed phostis finger i see the man you mean his helm is gilded too isnt it for someone who leads a heresy where all men are condemned to the least they can stand he likes imperial trappings well doesnt he he does phostis agreed thats one of the reasons i decided i couldnt stomach the thanasioi too much hypocrisy there for me to stand i see krispos said slowly had livanios been a sincere fanatic rather than an opportunist then he might have used phostis selfrighteousness to draw him deep into the thanasiot movement but a sincerely destructive fanatic would not have gone after the imperial mint at kyzikos had krispos needed any further explication of livanios character that raid would have given it to him which was not to say he lacked courage he threw himself into the thick of the fighting flinging javelins and slashing with his saber when the battle came to close quarters it was to all appearances a fight devoid of tactical subtlety the thanasioi wanted to break through the imperial line krispos soldiers aimed to keep them bottled up inside the pass they plied the heretics with arrows from a line several men deep even when the first ranks had to struggle hand to hand those behind them kept shooting at the thanasioi who piled up ever tighter against the barrier the imperials had formed fewer thanasioi were archers in any case archery by itself would not sweep aside krispos men in spite of the galling wounds they received the heretics charged again and again seeking to hew a path through their foes the path they cried the gleaming path along with trying to break through in the center the thanasioi also sent wave after wave of fighters against krispos and his retinue with their shields mail shirts and heavy axes the halogai stood like a dam between the avtokrator and the fighters who sought to lay him low but the northerners could not hold all arrows away from him he had a shield of his own and needed it to protect his face his horse let out a frightened squeal and tried to rear krispos fought the animal back under control an arrow protruded from its rump poor beast he thoughtit knew nothing of the differences in worship because of which it had been wounded the thanasioi charged again this time some of them broke through his screen of bodyguards phostis traded saber strokes with one katakolon with another that left krispos facing two at once he slashed at the one on his right side used his shield to hold off the blows of the one to his left and hoped someone would come to his aid soon suddenly the horse of the thanasiot to his right screamed far louder and more terribly than his own mount had a few minutes before a haloga axe had bitten into its spine just behind its rider the horse foundered the haloga raised his axe again and slew the thanasiot that let krispos turn against his other foe he still remembered how to use a sword himself and slashed the fellow on the forearm another haloga guard his axe dripping gore bore down on the heretic the thanasiot ignored him bending every effort toward slaying the avtokrator he paid the price for his fanaticism the guardsman hacked him out of the saddle thanks krispos panted sweat ran down his forehead and stung his eyes im getting old for this business much as i hate to admit it no man is young enough to be happy fighting two the haloga said which made him feel a little better among them his sons and the northerners had put an end to the other thanasioi whod broken through katakolon had a cut that stretched halfway across one cheek but managed a bloodspattered smile for krispos iakovitzes wont like me so well anymore he shouted ah but all the girls will sigh over how brave you are krispos answered which made his youngest sons smile wider another thanasiot surge the halogai on foot and videssians on horseback contained it krispos gauged the fighting he had not asked a great deal of his men only that they hold their place against the onslaught of the thanasioi so much had they done the heretics were bunched against them still trying to force their way out of the valley send for zaidas krispos commanded a messenger rode off he soon returned with the wizard who had not been far away now your majesty zaidas asked the time will never be better krispos said zaidas set to work most of his preparations for this magic had been made ahead of time it was not properly speaking battle magic nor directed against the thanasioi battle magic had a way of failing the stress of fighting raised emotions to such a pitch that a spell which might otherwise have been fatal failed to bite at all let it come forth zaidas cried and stabbed a finger up toward the sky from his fingertip sprang a glowing green fireball that rose high above the heaving battle line growing and getting brighter as it climbed a few soldiers from both sides paused for an instant to call phos name or sketch the sunsign above their hearts most however were too busy fighting for their lives to exclaim over the fireball or to notice it at all zaidas turned to krispos what magic may do magic has done he said his voice was ragged and worn sorcery cost those who worked it dear little by little the green fireball faded before too long it was gone watching the indecisive fight to which he had committed his army krispos wondered if it had been sent skyward in vain men should have been watching for its flare but one of the lessons hed learned after close to half a lifetime on the throne was the chasm that sometimes yawned between should have been and were his head went rapidly back and forth from one side of the valley to the other where are they he demanded not of anyone in particular but of the world at large as if that had been a cue martial music rang out in the distance soldiers in the imperial army cheered like men possessed the thanasioi stared about in sudden confusion and alarm down into the valley from left and right rode fresh regiments of horsemen in line krispos they cried as they bent their bows taken in both flanks by the good god sarkis exclaimed your majesty my hats off to you he doffed the iron pot he wore on his head to show he meant his words literally you helped come up with the plan krispos said besides we both ought to thank zaidas for giving a signal the watchers from both concealed flanking parties could see and use better by far than trying to gauge when to come in by the sandglass or any other way i could think of very well sarkis took off his helmet for zaidas too the wizards grin took years off his age and reminded krispos of the eager almost painfully bright youngster hed been when he began his sorcerous service that had been in the last campaign against harvas till now the hardest one krispos had known but civil warand religious civil war at thatwas worse than any attack from a foreign foe where the avtokrator and the general had praised his sorcery zaidas thought about the fighting that remained ahead we still have to win the battle he said fail in that and the best plan in the world counts for nothing krispos studied the field had the thanasioi been professional soldiers they might have salvaged something by retreating as soon as they discovered themselves so disastrously outflanked but all they understood of the military art was going forward no matter what that only got them more thoroughly trapped for the first time since fighting began krispos turned loose a smile this is a battle we are going to win he said phostis was only a few feet from his father when krispos claimed victory he was no practiced strategist himself but he could see that a foe attacked on three sides at once was on the way to destruction he was glad olyvria had stayed back at the camp though shed given herself to him without reservation seeing all her fathers hopes go down in ruin could only bring her pain phostis knew pain too but of a purely physical sort his shoulder ached with the effort it took to hold up a shield against arrows and saber slashes in another couple of weeks it could have borne the burden without complaint but not yet screeching the gleaming path for all they were worth the thanasioi mounted yet another charge and from the midst of the fanatics ranks phostis heard another cry one not fanatical at all if we slay the avtokrator lads its all up for grabs fueled by desperation fervor and that coldly rational cry the heretics surged against the right wing of the imperial line as they had once before they shot and hacked their way through the halogai and videssians protecting krispos all at once being of high rank stopped mattering off to one side of phostis sarkis laid about him with a vigor that denied his bulk to the other krispos and katakolon were both engaged before phostis could spur his horse to their aid someone landed what felt like a hammer blow to his shield he twisted in the saddle his foe was yelling at the top of his lungs his was the voice that had urged the thanasioi against krispos syagrios phostis yelled the ruffians face screwed into a gaptoothed grimace of hate you eh he said id rather carve you than your old mani owe you plenty by the good god he sent a vicious cut at phostis head just staying alive through the next minute or so was as hard as anything phostis had ever done he didnt so much as think of attack defense was enough and more intellectually he knew that was a mistakeif all he did was try to block syagrios blows sooner or later one would get through but they came in such unrelenting torrents that he could do nothing else syagrios was twice his age and more but fought with the vigor of a tireless youth as he slashed he taunted phostis after im done with you ill settle accounts with that little whore who crowned me pity you wont be around to watch on account of itd be worth seeing first ill cut her a few times just so she hurts while im he went into deliberately obscene detail fury all but blinded phostis the only thing that kept him from attacking wildly foolishly was the calculating look in syagrios eyes as he went through his speech he was working to enrage to provoke refusing to give him what he wanted was the best thing phostis saw to do a haloga came up on syagrios left side the ruffian had no shield but managed to turn aside the guardsmans axe with the flat of his blade that wouldnt work every time and he knew it he spurred his horse away from the northernerand from phostis as he drew back phostis cut at him the stroke missed phostis laughed in the romances the hero always slashed the villain into steaks in real life you were lucky if you didnt get hacked to bits yourself since he was for the moment not beset phostis looked around to see how his comrades were faring he found krispos in the midst of a sea of shouting thanasioi the avtokrator badly beset slashed frantically this way and that phostis spurred toward him to the thanasioi he was nothingjust another soldier a nuisance not a vital target like krispos he wounded three heretics from behind in quick succession that sort of thing wasnt in the romances either they went on and on about glory and duels and fair fights real war phostis was discovering in a hurry didnt concern itself with such niceties if you stayed alive and the other fellow didnt that was a triumph of strategy the halogai also fought their way in krispos direction so did all the reserves who saw he was in danger quite suddenly no living thanasioi were near the avtokrator krispos helmet had been battered so that it sat at a crazy angle on his head he had a cut on his cheekalmost a match for katakolons and another on his sword arm his gilded mail shirt and shield were splashed with sticky red hello everyone he said rather to my surprise i find myself still in one piece several variations of glad you are rose into the air phostis among them he looked round for syagrios but did not see him real battle lacked the romances neat resolutions too krispos went in the blink of an eye from a horseman fighting wildly for his life to the commander of a great host drive them hard he shouted pointing toward the center of the line see them waver one good push and theyll break had zaidas not said krispos lacked all talent for magic phostis might have believed him a wizard then no sooner had he called attention to the sagging thanasiot line than crimson banners began falling or being wrested from the hands of the heretics who bore them the roar that went up from the imperials at that rang through the valley like a great horn call how could you tell phostis demanded what that krispos thought for a moment then looked sheepish part of it comes from seeing a lot of fights my eye knows the signs even if my mouth doesnt and part of it sometimes dont ask me how you can make your will reach over a whole battlefield maybe it is magic phostis didnt realize hed spoken out loud until krispos nodded soberly aye it is but not of the sort zaidas practices evripos has a touch of it ive seen that you havent yet had the chance to find out you can rule without it not doubt of that but it makes life easier if its there one more thing to worry about phostis thought then he shook his head he needed to worry about two things not one whether he had the magic of leadership and how vulnerable he would be if evripos had it and he didnt at any other time he might have occupied himself for hours maybe days with worries over those two now with the battle swinging the imperials way at lastcould it be past noon alreadyhe had no leisure for fretting forward came the cry all along the line phostis was glad to press the fighting it relieved him of having to think as hed found in olyvrias arms that could be a blessing of sorts the only trouble was worries didnt go away when the fighting or the loving was done they reared their heads again but not now shouting forward with the rest he rode against the crumbling resistance of the thanasioi krispos looked out at victory and found it as appalling as it usually is pierced and mangled men and horses were the building blocks of what the chroniclers would one day call a splendid triumph of arms at the moment it reminded krispos of nothing so much as an openair slaughterhouse down to the stink of entrails and the buzz of hungry flies healerpriests wandered through the carnage now and then stooping to aid some desperately wounded man their calling did not let them discriminate between krispos followers and the thanasioi once though krispos saw a bluerobe stand up and walk away from someone shaking his shaven head in bewilderment he wondered if a dying thanasiot had possessed the courage to tell the healer he would sooner walk the gleaming path most of the heretics though were glad enough to get any help the imperials gave them they held out gashed arms and legs for bandages and obeyed their captors commands with the alacrity of men who knew they might suffer for any transgression in short they behaved like other prisoners of war krispos had seen over the years katakolon rode up to the avtokrator father theyve run down the heretics baggage train in it they found some of the gold ah abstracted from the mint at kyzikos did they thats good news krispos said how much of the gold gold was recovered something less than half the amount reported taken katakolon answered more than i expected krispos said nevertheless he suspected the troopers whod captured the baggage train were richer now than when theyd started their pursuit that was part of the price the empire paid for civil war if he tried to squeeze the gold out of them hed get a name for niggardliness that might lead to another revolt a year or three down the line your majesty another messenger waved frantically your majesty we think we have livanios the gilded mail shirt that weighed on krispos shoulders all at once seemed lighter fetch him here the avtokrator ordered then he raised his voice phostis aye father his eldest looked worn but so did everyone else in the army did you hear that they think theyve caught livanios will you identify him for me youve see him often enough phostis thought for a moment then shook his head no he said firmly what krispos glared at him why not hes olyvrias father phostis said how am i to live with her if i point the finger at him for the headsman your mothers father plotted against me when you were a baby do you know that krispos said i exiled him to a monastery at prista the outpost on the northern shore of the videssian sea was as grim a place of exile as the empire had but did mother tell you of his plot phostis demanded and would you have taken his head if hed not been her father the questions krispos admitted to himself were to the point no and yes in that order he said even after exiling rhisoulphos hed been nervous about sleeping in the same bed with dara for a while there you see phostis said livanios was an officer of ours youll have others here who can name him for you krispos thought about ordering phostis to do as hed said but not for long he had learned better than to give orders that had no hope of being obeyedand in any case phostis was right let it be as you say son the avtokrator said he watched in some amusement as phostis obviously ready to argue more deflated thank you the younger man said his voice full of relief krispos nodded then called who among my soldiers knows the traitor and rebel livanios by sight the question ran rapidly through the army before long several men sat their horses close by krispos among them was gainas the officer whod sent back to videssos the city the dispatch warning of livanios defection to the gleaming path the prisoner himself took a while to arrive when he did krispos saw why he was afoot one of several captives with hands tied behind their backs so they could not even walk quickly phostis said the one on the left there father is the mage artapan very good krispos said quietly if artapan was in this group then livanios probably was too phostis had in fact all but said he was here though the all but was important krispos turned to the men hed assembled which of them is livanios without hesitation they all pointed to the fellow two men away from artapan the captive straightened and glared at krispos he was doing his best to keep up a brave front i am livanios do as you please with my body my soul will walk the gleaming path beyond the sun and dwell with phos forever if you were so set on walking the gleaming path why did you rob the mint at kyzikos and not just burn it phostis asked you didnt despise material things enough to keep from dirtying your hands with them i do not claim to be the purest among the followers of the holy thanasios livanios said nevertheless i follow the truth he preached the only place youll follow him i think is to the ice krispos said and since ive beaten you and taken you in arms against me i dont need to argue with you he turned to one of the halogai trygve youre still carrying your axe strike off his head and have done aye majesty the big blond northerner strode over to livanios and pushed him so he went to his knees trygve spoke with neither cruelty nor any great compassion merely a sense of what needed doing bend your neck you it will be over soonest then livanios started to obey but then his eyes found phostis with a quick glance toward krispos he asked may i put a last question krispos thought he knew what that question would be be quick about it yes your majesty livanios did not sound sarcasticbut then krispos did not have to give him an easy end and he knew it he turned to phostis dyou have my daughter syagrios said he thought you did but yes i have her phostis said livanios bowed his head i die content my blood goes on krispos did not want him having the last word my fatherinlaw died in exile up in prista a traitor he said my sons fatherinlaw will die before he even properly gains that title also a traitor temptation it seems rides emperors fathersinlaw hardtoo hard he gestured to trygve the axe came down it wasnt a broadbladed longhandled headsmans weapon but the big man who wielded it was strong enough that that didnt matter krispos turned his head away from the convulsions of livanios corpse phostis who had watched looked green executions were harder to stomach than deaths in combat unfortunately they were also sometimes necessary krispos turned to artapan if your hands were free sirrah i daresay youd be making magic from his death agony there i would try artapans mouth twisted you have a strong mage at your side videssian emperor with him opposing perhaps id not succeed did rubyab king of kings know you were a deathdrinker when he sent you forth to help our heretics krispos asked oh indeed the makuraner magicians mouth twisted again this time in a different waywry amusement i was under sentence of death from the mobedhammobedhthe high patriarch you would saywhen the king of kings plucked me from my cell and told me what he required i had nothing to lose by the arrangement nor did he true enough krispos said if artapan had failed in the mission rubyab set him he would diebut he was condemned to die anyhow and if he succeeded he would do more good for makuran than for himself rubyab had never been anything but a wily foe to videssos but this piece of doubledealing was as devious as any krispos had ever imagined he nodded again to trygve artapan jerked free of his captors and tried to run with his hands bound behind him with so many men chasing him he didnt get more than a couple of paces the meaty sound of the axe striking cut off his last scream foolishness trygve said from where he cleaned the blade on the wizards caftan better to die well since die he would livanios did it properly katakolon pointed to the other two captive thanasioi who stood in glum and shaky silence will you take their heads too father krispos started to ask if they would abandon their heresy then remembered the answer meant little the thanasioi felt no shame at lying to save their skins and might keep their beliefs in secret instead the avtokrator turned to phostis and asked how big are these fish weve caught medium size phostis answered theyre officers but they werent part of livanios inner circle take them away and put them with the rest of the prisoners then krispos said to the guards who stood behind the captives ill figure out what to do with them later ive never seenive never imaginedso many captives katakolon pointed toward long rows of thanasiot prisoners each bound to the man in front of him by a line that wrapped round his wrists and then his neck any effort to flee would only choke those near him katakolon went on what will you do with them all ill figure that out later too krispos said his memory went back across two decades to the fearsome massacres harvas blackrobe had worked among the captives hed taken seeing those pathetic corpses even so long ago had burned away forever any inclination toward slaughter krispos might have had he could imagine no surer road to the eternal ice you cant just send them back to their villages phostis said i did come to know them while i was in their hands theyll promise anything and then a year from now or two or three theyll find themselves a new leader and start raiding again i know that krispos said im glad to see you do too sarkis rode up in spite of bloody bandages the cavalry general seemed in high spirits we shattered em and scattered em your majesty he boomed aye so we did krispos sounded less gleeful hed learned to think in bigger terms than battles or even campaigns he wanted more from this victory than the two years respite phostis had suggested he scratched his nose which wasnt as impressive as sarkis but did exceed the videssian norm by the good god he said softly what is it katakolon asked my fatherafter whom youre named phostisalways said we had vaspurakaner blood in us even though we lived far from here up byand sometimes overwhat used to be the border with kubrat my guess is that our ancestors had been resettled there on account of some crime or other very likely sarkis said as if that were a matter for pride we could do the same with the thanasioi krispos said if we uproot the villages where the heresy flourishes most and transplant those people over near opsikion in the far east say and up near the istroswhat used to be kubrat still needs more folk to work the landthose thanasioi would be likely to lose their beliefs in a generation or two among so many orthodox folk just as a pinch of salt loses itself in a big jug of water it might work sarkis said videssos has done such things beforeelse as you say your majesty your own forebears would not have ended up where they did so ive read krispos said we can even run the transfer both ways sending in orthodox villagers to loosen the hold the thanasioi have on the region round etchmiadzin it will mean a great lot of work but if the good god is willing it will put an end to the thanasiot problem once and for all moving whole villagesthousands tens of thousands of peoplefrom one end of the empire to the other moving more thousands back the other way phostis said not the work alonethink of the hardships youll be making krispos exhaled in exasperation remember these men we just beat down have sacked and ravaged kyzikos and garsavra just lately pityos last year and the lord with the great and good mind only knows how many smaller places how much hardship did they make how much more would they have made if we hadnt beaten them put that in the balance against moving villagers around and tell me which side of the scale goes down they believe in the balance in khatrish and thatagush phostis said have you beaten one heresy father only to join another i wasnt talking about phos balance only the one any man with a dram of sense can form in his own mind krispos said irritably then he saw phostis was laughing at him you scamp i didnt think youd stoop to baiting me as was his way phostis quickly turned serious again im sorry ill build that balance and tell you what i think thats fair krispos said meanwhile no need to apologize i can stand being twitted if i couldnt sarkis here would have spent these last many years in a cell under the government office buildingsassuming hed fit into one the cavalry commander assumed an injured expression if youd jailed me many years ago your majesty i shouldnt have attained to my present size not on what you feed your miscreants i shouldnt hrmph krispos turned back to phostis what did your balance tell you if it must be done then it must phostis neither looked nor sounded happy krispos didnt mind that he wasnt happy himself he and his village had been resettled twice when he was a boy once forcibly by kubrati raiders and then again after the empire ransomed them from the nomads he knew the hardship relocating entailed phostis went on i wish it didnt have to be done so do i krispos said phostis blinked which made krispos snort son if you think i enjoy doing this youre daft but i see that it has to be done and i dont shrink from it liking all of what you do when you wear the red boots is altogether different from doing what needs doing whether you like it or not phostis thought about that it was a very visible process krispos gave him credit for it before hed been snatched he would have been more likely to dismiss out of hand anything krispos said at last biting his up phostis nodded krispos nodded back well pleased hed actually managed to get a lesson home to his hardheaded son come on move a soldier shouted with the air of a man whos already shouted the same thing twenty times and expects to shout it another twenty before the day is through the woman in faded gray wool her head covered by a white scarf sent the horseman a look of hatred back bent under the bundle she bore she trudged away from the thatchroofed hut that had housed her since she wed away from the village that had housed her family for untold generations tears carved tracks through the dust on her cheeks the good god curse you to the ice forever she snarled the imperial trooper said if i had a goldpiece for every time ive been cursed these past weeks id be rich enough to buy this whole province and heartless enough to rule it the peasant woman retorted to her obvious dismay the trooper thought that was funny having no choicethe soldier and his comrades confronted the villagers with sabers and drawn bows and implacable purposeshe kept walking three children trailing behind her and then her husband who carried an even bigger pack on his back and held lead ropes for a couple of scrawny goats phostis watched the family join the stream of unwilling peasants shambling east soon they were gone from sight as one drop of water loses itself in a river for a little while longer he could hear the goats bleating then their voices too were lost amid murmurs and complaints and lowing cattle and creaking axles from richer farmers carts and the endless shuffle of feet this had to be the dozenth village hed watched empty he wondered why he kept making himself witness the process over and over again the best answer he came up with was that he was partly responsible for what was happening to these people and so he had the obligation to understand it to the fullest no matter how pained and uncomfortable it made him that afternoon as the sun sank toward the not so distant mountains of vaspurakan he rode with another company that descended on another village as the peasants were forcibly assembled in the marketplace a woman screamed you have no right to treat us so were orthodox by the good god this for the gleaming path she spat in the dust is that so phostis worriedly asked the officer in charge of the company young majesty you just wait till theyre all gathered here and then youll see for yourself the captain answered the people kept coming until at last the village marketplace was full phostis frowned he told the officer i dont see anything that makes them look either orthodox or thanasiot you dont know what to look for then the man replied he waved at the glum crowd do you see more men or women young majesty phostis hadnt noticed one way or the other now he examined villagers with a new eye more women id say id say so too young majesty the captain said nodding and note the men how many of them are either graybeards or else striplings with the down just sprouting on their cheeks and chins not a lot of fellows in their prime are there why do you suppose that is phostis studied the shouting sweating crowd once more i see what youre saying why though the officer glanced upward for a moment perhaps in lieu of calling the heir to the imperial throne dense young majesty its on account of most of the men in their prime were in livanios army and we either killed em or caught em so you can believe that skirt is orthodox if you choose but me i have to doubt it orthodox or hereticand phostis found the company commanders logic compellingthe villagers carrying and leading what they could shuffled away on the first stage of their journey to new homes at the far end of the empire some of the company quartered themselves in abandoned houses phostis went back with the rest to the main imperial camp the place was becoming more like a semipermanent town than the encampment of an army on the march krispos men fanned out from it every day to resettle villagers who followedor might followthe gleaming path supply wagons rumbled in every daywith occasional lapses as unsubdued thanasioi raided themto keep the army fed tents were not pitched at random but in clumps with waysalmost streetsthrough them phostis had no trouble finding his way to the tent he shared with olyvria when he ducked through the flap she was lying on her bedroll her eyes were closed but came open as soon as he walked in so he did not think shed been asleep how are you she asked listlessly worn he answered saying youre going to resettle some peasants is one thing it sounds simple and practical enough but seeing what it entails he shook his head ruling is a hard cruel business i suppose so olyvria sounded indifferent phostis asked how are you shed wept through the night when she learned her fathers fate in the days since then shed been like thisvery quiet more than a little withdrawn from what happened around her he hadnt touched her except accidentally since hed held her while she cried herself out that night now she answered all right as she had whenever hed asked her since then the response was as flat and unemphatic as everything else shed said lately he wanted to shake her to force some life into her he did not think that was a good idea instead he unrolled his own blanket under a surcoat his mail shirt jingled as he sat down beside her he said how are you really all right she repeated as indifferently as before but now a small spark came into her eyes ill truly be all right in time im sure i will its just that my life has turned upside down these past weeks no even thats not right first it turned upside downi turned it upside downand then it flipped again when when she didnt go on not with words but she started to cry again as she had not done since krispos sparing phostis that duty brought her word of what hed ordered done to livanios phostis thought there might be healing in these tears he held his arms open hoping she would come to him after a few seconds she did when she was through she dried her eyes on the fabric of his surcoat better he asked patting her back as if she were a child who can say she answered i made the choice i have to live with it i love you phostis i do but i hadnt thought through everything that might happen after i got onto that fishing boat with you my father she started to cry again that would have happened anyhow i think he said you didnt have anything to do with it even when we were on the worst of termswhich seemed like much of the timei knew my father did what he did well i doubt the thanasioi would have won the civil war even with us and if they lost it early in his reign my father paid a price for showing his enemies more mercy than they deserved one of the things that set him apart from most people is that he learns from his mistakes he gives rebels no second chance these days but my father wasnt just a rebel she said he was my father to that phostis had no good answer luckily for him he didnt have to grope for a poor one from outside the tent a haloga guard called young majesty heres a man would have speech with you im coming phostis answered to olyvria he added in a low voice probably a messenger from my father who else would disturb me he climbed to his feet tired as he was the iron he wore felt doubly heavy he blinked against the bright afternoon sunshine as he stepped outside then stopped in surprise and horror you he gasped you syagrios roared the ruffian wore a longsleeved tunic to cover the knife hed strapped to his forearm he flipped it into his hand now and stabbed phostis in the belly with it before the haloga guard could spring between them as phostis remembered syagrios was strong as a bear he cried out when the tip of the knife bit him and grabbed syagrios right arm with both hands ill get you syagrios panted ill get you and then ill get that little whore youre swiving ill phostis never did find out what syagrios would do next the guardsmans frozen surprise did not last longer than a heartbeat syagrios screamed hoarsely as the halogas axe went into his back he broke free of phostis and whirled trying to come to grips with the northerner the haloga struck him again this time full in the face blood sprayed over phostis syagrios crumpled the guardsman methodically smote him again and again until he stopped twitching olyvria burst out of the tent a knife in her hand her eyes wild the guardsman however needed no help olyvria gulped at syagrios dreadful wounds though an officers daughter she wasnt altogether accustomed to fightings grim aftermath then the haloga turned to phostis are you yet hale young majesty i dont know phostis yanked up his mail shirt and surcoat together he had a bleeding scratch a couple of inches above his navel but nothing worse he let the mail shirt fall back down with a clink of iron rings aye here we are look young majesty the northerner poked the mail shirt with a forefinger you had luck with you the knife went into a ringsee the bright cuts here and here it went in but could go no farther had it slid between two rings more of your gore would have spilled yes phostis started to shake so much luck in lifea fingernails breadth to either side and hed be lying on the ground beside dead syagrios trying to hold his guts in maybe a healerpriest would have been able to save him but he was ever so glad he didnt have to make the test he told the guard my thanks for slaying him viggo the haloga guardsman looked disgusted with himself i should never have let him draw near enough to stab you i thank the gods you were not worse hurt he lifted syagrios corpse by the heels and dragged it away the ruffians blood soaked blackly into the thirsty soil by then curious and concerned faces pressed close the fight and the outcries had raised a crowd as if by magic phostis waved to show he was all right no harm done he called and the madman got what he deserved he pointed to the trail syagrios left behind as if he were a snail filled with blood rather than slime the soldiers cheered phostis waved again then ducked back into the tent olyvria followed phostis looked again at the little cut hed taken he didnt require much imagination to make it bigger in his minds eye if the knife had slipped between rings or if hed taken off the mail shirt the better to comfort olyvria he shuddered he didnt even want to think about that i fought with him during the battle he said i guessed hed flee but he must have been wild for revenge you never wanted to cross syagrios olyvria agreed soberly and she hesitated then went on and id known he wanted me for a long time oh phostis made a sour face at that but it made sense how doubly mortifying and infuriating to be struck down by someone you lusted after no wonder he didnt run then his laugh was shaky i wish he would havehe came too close to getting his vengeance and letting the air out of me in the process katakolon stuck his head into the tent ah good you still have your clothes on he said fathers right behind me and i dont suppose youd care to be caught as i was before phostis could do more than gape at that or ask any of the myriad questions that suggested themselves krispos came in im glad youre all right he said folding phostis into a bear hug when he let phostis go he stood back and eyed him quizzically someone didnt care for you there son no he didnt phostis agreed he helped kidnap me he watched krispos but the avtokrators eyes never moved toward olyvria discipline and style and he was my i guess youd say keeper in etchmiadzin he couldnt have been very happy when i escaped your keeper eh so that was syagrios krispos asked phostis nodded impressed at his memory for detail he said he was a bad man but not of the worst he played the board game well and he drew the arrow from my shoulder when i got shot while i was along with the thanasiot raiding party a slim enough eulogy but the best hell get and likely better than he deserves too krispos said if you think ill say im sorry hes gone you can think again good riddance say i i just praise the good god that you werent hurt he embraced phostis again im glad youre not ventilated too katakolon said its good having you back especially in one piece he ducked to get out of the tent krispos followed a moment later what was that your brother said about getting caught with his clothes off olyvria kept her voice low so no one but phostis would hear but she couldnt stop the giggle that welled up from deep inside i dont know phostis said as a matter of fact i dont think i want to know knowing katakolon it was probably something spectacular sometimes i think he takes after anthimos even if hed been about to say something like even if im the one anthimos might have fathered that was just what he didnt want to say to olyvria even if what she asked even if anthimos was four years dead before katakolon was born phostis finished more smoothly than he would have thought possible oh olyvria sounded disappointed which meant his answer had convinced her he nodded to himself krispos would have approved and hed lived through a completely unexpected attack he approved of that himself krispos studied the gloomy stone pile of etchmiadzin it had been built to hold off men at arms but the ones its designers had in mind came from makuran the stone however knew nothing of that it wouldand diddefy videssians as readily as any others the fanatics on those grim stone walls still screamed defiance at the imperial army below most of the territory the thanasioi had once held was back in krispos hands again dozens of villages were empty hed given the orders to send streams of orthodox peasants on the way to replace those uprooted from the area pityos and its hinterland had fallen to noetos cavalry advancing west along the coast from nakoleia but if etchmiadzin held until the advancing season made krispos withdraw much of what hed accomplished was likely to unravel the thanasioi would still have a base from which to grow once more hed already seen the consequences of their growth he didnt care for them storming the fortress though was easier to talk about than to do videssian engineers had labored mightily to make it as near impregnable as they could so far as krispos knew it had never fallen to the makuraners despite several sieges it didnt look likely to fall to his army either if they wont fall maybe i can trip them krispos muttered hows that your majesty krispos jumped there beside him stood sarkis im sorryi didnt notice youd come up i was trying to work out some way to inveigle the cursed thanasioi into coming out of etchmiadzin without storming the place good luck to you sarkis said skeptically hard enough to trick a foe in the confusion of the battlefield why should the heretics come out from their citadel for anything you do short of leaving even if they stand and fight and die they think they go up their gleaming path to heaven next to that any promise you can make is a small loaf aye theyre solidly against me stiffnecked as they are krispos voice was gloomybut only for a moment he turned to sarkis theyre solidly against mefor now but tell me eminent sir what do you have if you put three videssians together and tell them to talk about their faith for a day six heresies sarkis answered at once each ones view of his two comrades also a big brawl probably a knifing or two a couple of slit purses begging your pardon majesty but thats how it looks to a poor stolid prince from vaspurakan anyhow thats how it looks to me too krispos said smiling even if i have only a touch of princes blood in me i think like a videssian no matter whose blood i have and i know full well that if you give videssians a chance to argue about religion theyre sure to take it i dont hold your breeding against you your majesty sarkis said generously but how do you propose to get the thanasioi squabbling among themselves when to them youre the impious heretic theyve all joined together to fight its not even my idea krispos said phostis thought of it and gave it to evripos to evripos sarkis scratched his head but hes back in videssos the city how could anything there have to do with the thanasioi here did evripos write you a letter and the cavalry commander stopped his black black eyes sparkled just for a moment through the sheath of heavy flesh krispos saw the eager young scout with whom hed ridden like a madman back to the imperial capital in the days when his reign was new he said wait a minute youre not going to oh yes i am krispos said right out there where they can all watch from the walls if it wouldnt brew more scandal than it was worth id have them consummate it out there too not that it hasnt been consummated already youre a demon you arebut then you used to revel with anthimos now that i think of it sarkis let out a theatrical sigh too bad you couldnt get by with that shes a finelooking young woman i wouldnt mind watching that marriage consummated not one bit i wouldnt shameless old stallion krispos lowered his voice i wouldnt either they both laughed for a day the imperial army besieging etchmiadzin had sent no darts no arrows no stones against those frowning gray walls instead heralds bearing whitepainted shields of truce had approached the walls bidding the thanasioi also desist from battle so that you may join us in observing a celebration at noon the choice of words must have intrigued the heretics they had gone along with the heralds suggestion at least thus far phostis wondered how long they would remain calm when they observed what was about to happen not long he thought hed suggested to evripos that he marry olyvria to help calm the rampaging thanasioi of the city trust krispos to take his suggestion and turn it into a weapon of war against the belligerent heretics here at etchmiadzin noon was an approximation the only sundial in the imperial army was a little brass one that belonged to zaidas but men accustomed to gauging the apex of the suns path when they were working in the fields had no trouble doing the same while on campaign imperial soldiers gathered to protect the wooden platform that had been built safely out of bowshot of etchmiadzins walls on those walls the thanasioi also gathered a herald with a shield of truce strode from the imperial lines toward the rebelheld fortress in a huge bass voice he called to the thanasioi his imperial majesty the avtokrator krispos bids you welcome to the marriage of his son phostis to the lady olyvria daughter of the late livanios phostis wished the herald had omitted the late the words would hurt olyvria but at the same time he understood why krispos had told the man to include them they would remind etchmiadzins defenders of the defeats their cause had already suffered the thanasioi rained curses on the heralds head a couple of them shot at him too he lifted the shield of truce to protect his face he wore a helmet and a mail shirt that covered him down to the knee when the arrows stopped coming the man lowered the whitefaced shield and resumed the avtokrator bids you ponder the import of this wedding not only what it says about your fortune in battle but how it reminds you of the joy that life holds and the way it continuesand should continue from one generation to the next more cursesand more arrowsflew at him having delivered his message he needed to stand up under them no more but hastily drew back out of range the wedding party ascended to the makeshift stage it was not a large group certainly not the horde that would have been involved had the marriage taken place at the high temple in videssos the city ahead of phostis and olyvria came a healerpriest named glavas who would perform the ceremony behind them walked krispos katakolon and zaidas that was all even zaidas presence was not directly required by the ceremony though phostis was glad to have him close by but the wizard was there mainly because he owned a small magic that would let the voices of the people on the platform carry farther than they would have without it krispos wanted the thanasioi to listen to all that passed here the priest said let us praise the lord with the great and good mind he recited phos creed so did phostis and olyvria so as well did krispos katakolon and zaidas phostis also heard the watching soldiers echo the prayer they made several times every day of their lives we are come together in this unusual place to celebrate an unusual union glavas said after the boon of many healthful years the greatest gift the good god can grant his worshipers is continuance of their line a marriage is a time of rejoicing not least because it marks hope and expectation for that continuance when the marriage comes from the imperial family more hopes ride on it than those of the family alone continuance of the dynasty generation upon generation is our best guarantee against the disaster of civil war phostis noticed he did not mention that krispos was the first member of his family to hold the imperial throne or indeed anything more than a peasant plot the priest went on and with this marriage we also have the chance to heal a rift that has opened among the faithful of videssos to symbolize the return to their familiar faith by those who for a time thought differently in the union of the young majesty phostis to olyvria the daughter of livanios that phostis thought was as conciliatory toward the thanasioi as krispos could be without following the gleaming path himself he hadnt even had glavas call them heretics he wanted to make them forget their beliefs not stubbornly cling to them the priest went on for some time about the qualities bride and groom should bring to a marriage to ensure its success phostis mind wandered he was taken unawares when glavas asked are the two of you prepared to cleave to these virtues and to each other so long as you both may live from behind krispos nudged phostis he realized he had to speak first yes he said and was glad zaidas magic made his voice larger than it was yes for all my lifethis is the path i will walk olyvria responded firmly krispos and katakolon set on her head and phostis garlands of sweetsmelling herbsthe crown of marriage that completed the ceremony the priest stepped down from the platform as quickly as that it was over im married phostis said even to himself he sounded surprised the thanasioi on the wall screamed insults and catcalls for all they were worth ignoring them krispos slapped phostis on the back and said so you are sonand to a wise woman too he turned to olyvria and added that last touch was perfect phos willing theyll do a lot of stewing over it katakolon poked phostis in the ribs now youre supposed to grab her and carry her off to yourwell to your tent it would be here phostis had a wellfounded suspicion that olyvria would not permit any such thing he glanced over to her sure enough a steely glint in her eye warned him hed better not try it ive heard ideas that sounded more practical krispos said the amusement in his voice said hed seen that glint too but do go on back to your tent you would anyhowthats what the day is forbut you should do it now while youre still decked in the crowns of marriage that tickled phostis curiosity he extended his arm to olyvria she took it as they headed away from the hastily built platform some of the soldiers cheered and others called lewd advice phostis smiled foolishly at olyvria she smiled back lewd advice from the bystanders came with every wedding celebration a grinning haloga held the tent flap wide then let it fall behind the newly weds well not see you for a while i think he said will you look at that olyvria exclaimed phostis looked at the top corners of their unfolded blankets someonemaybe krispos himself maybe a man acting at his ordershad driven stout sticks into the ground to stimulate bedposts its good luck to hang the crowns on them phostis said he doffed his and carefully set it on top of one post olyvria did the same on the other side it starts to feel real she said it is real phostis lowered his voice so the guardsmen outside would not hearnot that they wouldnt know perfectly well what was going on in there but the forms had to be observed as long as its real and as long as were here by ourselves and no battles going on right this moment yes what then olyvria played the game with him she spoke quietly too her hands worked at the catch of the white linen dress krispos had given her for the wedding it came open what then she repeated softly between the two of them they figured out what then because phostis was still quite a young man they got to try again soon and again after that phostis had lost track of the hour by then though the sun still lit one side of the tent he yawned wiped his sweaty forehead with a sweaty forearm and dozed off beside him olyvria had already fallen asleep it was dark when a horrible racket woke him he sat up and looked around blinking olyvria lay beside him still sleepingsnoring just a littlea small smile on her face carefully so as not to disturb her he put on a robe and walked outside a new shift of halogai ringed his tent whats toward he asked one of them the northerner pointed toward etchmiadzin the ruddy light of campfires and torches gave him the look of a man made of bronze fighting in there he said by phos phostis murmured smacking a fist into the other palm he looked over toward the imperial pavilion not far away krispos was outside too watching phostis felt a surge of relief that hed not thrown in his lot with the thanasioi one way or another he was more sure now than ever krispos would have found a way to beat them no matter what they did inside etchmiadzin they sounded as if they were going at each other with everything they had they probably were phostis thought the men and women who followed the gleaming path were fanaticswhatever views they held they held with all their hearts and all their souls if krispos had managed to drive a wedge between two groups of them over the propriety of olyvrias marriage theyd fight each other as savagely asmaybe more savagely thantheyd opposed the imperial army the haloga pointed again ha look young majesty smoke with blazing brand they burn their burg sure enough a thick column of smoke rose from inside the walls orangetinted gray against the black of the night sky phostis tried to figure out where in the town the fire had flared his best guess was that it wasnt far from the vaspurakaner cobblers shop where he and olyvria had first made love another plume of smoke sprang up and a few minutes later yet another a tongue of yellow fire perhaps from a burning roof leapt into sight above the walls like a live thing then sullenly fell back before long more and more flames sprang into view and not all of them died down again fire was a terror in any city it could so easily race ahead of anything men were able to do to hold it back fire in a city at war with itself was a horror to rank with the ice in skotos hell how could you hope to fight it when your hand was turned against your neighbor your friendand his against you the answer was you couldnt the fires in etchmiadzin burned on and on the air of the imperial camp grew thick with the stink of smoke and now and again of burned flesh screams rent the air some of terror some of agony but most of hate in the burning streets the battle among the thanasioi went on after a while olyvria came out of the tent to stand beside phostis she slipped her hand into his without saying anything silently they watched etchmiadzin burn olyvria wiped at her eyes the smoke made phostis sting too for the sake of his own peace of mind he assumed that smoke was why she dabbed at hers he yawned and said im going back inside the tent maybe the air will be fresher in there olyvria followed him in still without speaking only when they were away from the guards did she say in a low voice there is the dowry i bring to you and your father etchmiadzin you knew that he answered you must have known it or youd not have answered the priest as you did i suppose i did know in a way but knowing in advance what a thing is and seeing what it looks like when it comes to pass are not the same tonight im finding out how different they can be she shook her head had krispos been in the tent phostis suspected he would have said that was one of the lessons of growing up phostis couldnt put a middleaged rasp in his voice to make that sound convincing he asked if youd known would you have done differently olyvria stayed quiet so long he wondered if shed heard at last she said no i suppose i would have left things as they were but id have thought about them more beforehand thats fair phostis agreed he yawned again shall we try to get some more sleep i dont think theyre going to sally against us theyre too busy warring with each other i suppose so olyvria lay down and closed her eyes phostis lay down beside her to his surprise he dropped off almost at once olyvria must have fallen asleep too for she jerked up at the same time as he when a great cheer roared through the encampment he needed a moment to realize what time it was sunshine against the east side of the tent meant dawn had broken as he had the night before he poked out his head and asked a haloga what was going on the northerner answered those in there they have yielded themselves the gates are thrown wide then the war is over phostis blurted when he realized what hed said he repeated it the war is over he wanted to say it again and again he couldnt imagine four more wonderful words xiii a line of men and women and children trudging wearily down a dirt track carrying such belongings as they could the cows and goats and donkeys with them as thin and worn as they were the only difference krispos could see between them and the uprooted thanasioi was the direction of their journey they were moving west not east no there was another theyd not rebelled to give him a reason to remove them from their old homes but the land from which war and policy had removed the thanasioi could not stay empty that was asking for trouble and so peasants who lived in a relatively crowdedand safely loyalstretch of territory between develtos and opsikion east of videssos the city were taking the place of the thanasioi whether they liked the idea or not phostis rode up alongside krispos and pointed to the villagers on the way to resettlement is that justice he asked i just put the same question to myself krispos answered i dont think the answer is clear or easy if you asked any one of them now no doubt theyd curse me to the skies but after two years who can say ive granted them tax exemptions for that long and put them on half rates for three years more im not moving them just to fill spacei want them to thrive it may work out well enough for them phostis persisted but is it justice probably not krispos answered sighing he fought back a smile hed managed to surprise phostis probably not he repeated but is it justice to empty a land so no crops to speak of are raised on it so it becomes a haven for brigands and outlaws so it tempts the makuraners to try to gobble it up makuran hasnt much troubled us lately but thats because rubyab king of kings sees me as strong it hasnt always been so how do you aim to pay rubyab back for sponsoring the thanasioi phostis asked krispos took the change of subject to mean that phostis thought he had a point he answered i dont know right now a big war like the one we fought with makuran a century and a half ago could leave both lands prostrate for years i dont want that but believe me that s not a debt to forget maybe itll be one i leave to you to repay phostis responded to that with a calculating look krispos had seldom seen on him before he was kidnapped fomenting the vaspurakaners against mashiz is likely to be worth trying aye maybe if the makuraners commit some outrage in the princes lands or theyre troubled with foes farther west krispos said but thats not as sure a bet as it looks because the makuraners are always on the watch for it the beauty of rubyabs ploy was that it used our own people against us videssos has known so much religious strife over the years that for a long time i didnt see the makuraner hand in the thanasiot glove the beauty of it phostis shook his head i dont see how you can use that word for something that caused so much trouble and death its like an unexpected clever move at the board game krispos said the board here though stretches all the way across the world and you can change the rules you play by and the pieces you take off the board are real people phostis said and you cant bring them back again and play them somewhere else cant i krispos said what do you think this resettlement is if not capturing a piece and playing it on a better square he watched phostis chew on that the young man said i suppose i should have learned to stop arguing with you no matter how well i start out most of the time you end up turning things your way experience by the way that sounded in his mouth it might as well have been a filthy word it was something he lacked at any rate which of itself made its possession suspect krispos pulled a silk handkerchief from a pocket of his surcoat and dabbed at his dripping forehead hed left some of the imperial army back in and around etchmiadzin both to watch the border with makuranerheld vaspurakan and to help uprooted arrivals settle in more troops were strung out along the line of travel between west and east with what remained he was drawing near videssos the city that meant of course that he and his men were passing through the coastal lowlands in late summer there were other places hed sooner have been at the moment he would have welcomed some of skotos ice so long as he did not have to meet its master it was so hot and sticky that sweat wouldnt dry it just clung to you and rolled greasily along your skin by the good god i wish i didnt have to wear the imperial regalia he said in this country id sooner be dressed like them he pointed to the peasants working in the fields to either side of the road some of them were in thin linen tunics that came down about half the distance from buttocks to knee others didnt even bother with that but were content to wrap a loincloth around their middles phostis shook his head if i dressed like that it would mean i lived here all year around i dont think i could stand that youd best be glad someone can krispos said the soil here is wonderful and they get plenty of rain the crops they bring in are bigger than anywhere else in the empire if it werent for the lowlands videssos the city wouldnt have enough to eat the peasants arent fleeing from us the way they did when we set out katakolon said stopping his horse by his father and brother a good thing too krispos answered one reason we have an army is to protect them if they think soldiers are something they need to be protected from we arent doing the job as we should he knew as well as anyone else that soldiers plundered peasants when they got the chance the trick was not giving them the chance and making the peasants know they wouldnt get it he wouldnt have to worry about that much longer on this campaignalmost home now he said that aloud katakolon leered at him you neednt be in such a swivet to get back to drina father remember shell be out to here by now he held a hand a couple of feet in front of his belly shes not giving birth to a foal by the good god krispos said if she were out to there i might think you meant an elephant he glared at his youngest but couldnt help snorting as he went on and ill thank you not to twit me any more about her having my byblow only fool luck im not paying for six or seven of yours phos knows its not your lack of effort hes just giving you twit for twat father phostis said helpfully beset from both sides krispos threw his hands in the air the two of you will be the death of me if evripos were here id be altogether surrounded i expect i shall be when we get back to the palaces thats the first decent argument ive heard for making this march take longer i thought it was an indecent argument katakolon said not willing to be outdone by phostis enough enough krispos groaned have mercy on your poor decrepit father ive got softening of the brain from too many years of staring at tax receipts and edicts you cant expect me to throw puns about the way you do just then the scouts up ahead started raising a racket one of them rode back to the van of the main body saluting krispos he said your majesty the sharpeyed among us have spied the sun glinting off the temple domes of videssos the city krispos peered ahead he wasnt particularly sharpsighted any longer things in the distance got blurry for him but whether he could see them or not knowing the temples and their domes were so close made him feel the journey was coming to its end almost home he said again he looked from phostis to katakolon daring them to make more wisecracks they both kept quiet he nodded pleased with himself the young bulls still respected the old bulls horns the folk of videssos the city packed the colonnaded sidewalks of middle street cheering as the triumphal procession made its way toward the plaza of palamas phostis rode near the head of the procession olyvria at his side he wore a gilded mail shirt and helmet to let the people know who he wasand to make sure no diehard thanasiot assassinated him for the greater glory of the gleaming path as he rode he waved which brought fresh applause from the crowd he turned to olyvria and said quietly i wonder how many of these same people were screaming for thanasios and trying to burn down the city not long ago a fair number id say she answered he nodded i think youre right rooting thanasioi out from videssos the city wasnt nearly so straightforward as uprooting and transplanting villages unless you caught someone setting fires or wrecking how could you know what was in his heart you couldnt that was the long and short of it thanasios followers surely lingered here if they stayed quiet they might go unnoticed for generationsthose who cared to raise new generations at any rate middle street showed few scars from the rioting countless fires burned in the city every day for cooking and heating and at smithies and other workplaces whitewashed buildings were usually gray with soot in a few months time the soot that came from the rioters blazes looked no different from any other after the fact the procession passed through the forum of the ox about a third of the way from the silver gate in the great land wall to the plaza of palamas the stalls in the forum of the ox sold cheap goods to people who could afford no better most of the folk who packed the square wore either ragged tunics or gaudy finery whose gold threads were apt to turn green in a matter of days phostis would have bet that plenty of them had bawled for the gleaming path now though they cried out krispos name as loudly as anyone elseand that despite some former market stalls that were now only charred ruins maybe theyll come back to orthodoxy now that theyve really seen what their heresy leads to phostis said he spoke more softly still thats more or less what i did after all maybe olyvria said her voice so neutral he couldnt tell whether she agreed with him or not well know twenty years from now he thought looking about as far ahead as hed already lived felt strange almost unnatural to him but he was beginning to do it he didnt know whether that was because hed started taking seriously the idea of ruling or simply because he was getting older off to the north of middle street between the forum of the ox and the plaza of palamas stood the huge mass of the high temple it was undamaged not from any lack of malevolence on the part of the thanasioi but because soldiers and ecclesiastics armed with stout staves had ringed it day and night until rioting subsided phostis still felt uncomfortable as he rode past the high temple he looked on it as an enormous sponge that had soaked up endless gold that might have been better spent elsewhere but he had returned to the faith that found deepest expression beneath that marvelous dome he shook his head not all puzzles had neat solutions this one too would have to wait for more years to do their work in defining his views the red granite facing of the government office building caught his eye and told him the plaza of palamas was drawing near somewhere under there in the jail levels below ground digenis the priest had starved himself to death digenis might have been right to be angry about how the rich have too much but i dont think making everyone poor is the right answer phostis said to olyvria still i cant hate him not when i met you through him she smiled at that but answered arent you putting your own affairs above those of the empire there he needed a moment to realize she was teasing as a matter of fact yes he said or at least one affair katakolons the fellow who keeps four of them in the air at the same time she made a face at him which let him think hed come out best in that little skirmish up ahead a great roar announced that krispos had entered the packed plaza of palamas with the avtokrator marched servitors armed not with weapons but with sacks of gold and silver many an emperor had kept the city mob happy with largess and krispos had shown over and over that he was able to profit from others examples letting people squabble over money flung among them might keep them from more serious uprisings like the one videssos the city had just seen skyblue ribbonsand haloga guardsmenkept the crowds from swamping the route the procession took to the western edge of the plaza krispos had ascended to a wooden platform whose pieces were stored in a palace outbuilding against time of need phostis wondered how many times krispos had mounted that platform to speak to the people of the city quite a few he thought he dismounted then reached out to help olyvria do the same grooms took their horses hand in hand the two of them went up onto the platform themselves its a sea of people out there phostis exclaimed looking out at the restless mass their noise rose and fell in almost regular waves like the surf for the first time phostis had a chance to see that part of the procession which had been behind him a parade was not a parade without soldiers a company of halogai marched around krispos phostis and olyvria for protection and show both behind them came several regiments of videssians some mounted others afoot they tramped along looking neither right nor left as if the people of the city were not worth their notice not only were they part of the spectacle they also served as a reminder that krispos had powerful forces ready at hand should rioting break out again the halogai formed up in front of the platform the rest of the troops headed past the plaza of palamas and into the palace quarter some had barracks there others would be dismissed back to the countryside after the celebration was over between one regiment and the next walked dejected thanasiot prisoners some of them still showed the marks of wounds none wore anything more than ragged drawers all had their hands tied behind their backs the crowd jeered them and pelted them with eggs and rotten fruit and the occasional stone olyvria said a lot of avtokrators would have capped this parade with a massacre i know phostis said but father has seen real massacresask him about harvas blackrobe some time having seen the beast he doesnt want to give birth to it the prisoners took the same route out of the plaza as had the soldiers their fate would not be much different theyd be sent off to live on the land with the rest of the uprooted thanasioi with luck in peace unlike the soldiers though they would get no choice about where they went another contingent of halogai entered the plaza of palamas the noise from the crowd grew quieter and took on a rougher edge behind the front of axebearing northerners rode evripos by the reaction not everyone in videssos the city was happy with the way he had put down the riots he rode as if blithely unaware of that waving to the people as krispos and phostis had before him the guardsmen who had surrounded him took their places with their countrymen while he climbed up to stand by phostis and olyvria without turning his head toward phostis he said theyre not pleased that i didnt give them all a kiss and send them to bed with a mug of milk and a spiced bun well i wasnt any too pleased that they did their best to bring the city down around my ears i can understand that phostis answered also looking straight ahead evripos lip curled and you brother you come through this everyones hero youve married the beautiful girl like someone out of a romance hardly seems fair somehow he did not try to hide his bitterness to the ice with the romances phostis said but that wasnt what was bothering evripos and he knew it the lowvoiced argument stopped then because someone else ascended to the platform iakovitzes gorgeous in robes just short in imperial splendor he would not make a speech of course not without a tongue but he had served in so many different roles during krispos reign that excluding him would have seemed unnatural he smiled at olyvria politely enough but without real interest as he walked past phostis and evripos toward krispos he managed to pat each of them on the behind olyvrias eyes went wide the two brothers looked at iakovitzes looked at each other and started to laugh hes been doing that for as long as weve been alive phostis said for a lot longer than that evripos said father always tells of how iakovitzes tried to seduce him when he was a boy and then later when he was a groom in iakovitzes service and even after he donned the red boots he knows we care nothing for men phostis said if we ever made as if we wanted to go along the shock might kill him hes anything but young even if he dyes his hairs and powders over his wrinkles to try to hide his years i dont think youre right phostis evripos said if he thought we wanted to go along hed have our robes up and our drawers down before we could say i was only joking phostis considered you may have something there on a matter like that he was willing to concede a point to his brother olyvria stared at both of them then at iakovitzes thats terrible she exclaimed why does your father keep him around she made the mistake of speaking as if iakovitzes couldnt hear her he strolled back toward her smiling now in a way that said he meant mischief alarmed phostis tried to head him off iakovitzes opened the tablet he always carried wrote rapidly on the wax and showed it to phostis does she read yes of course she does phostis said whereupon iakovitzes pushed past him toward olyvria scribbling as he walked he handed her the tablet she took it with some apprehension read aloud his majesty keeps me around as you say for two reasons first because i am slyer than any three men you can name including your father before and after he lost his head and second because he knows i would never try to seduce any wives of the imperial family iakovitzes smile got wider and therefore more unnerving he took back the tablet and started away wait olyvria said sharply iakovitzes turned back stylus poised like a sting phostis started to step between them again but olyvria said i wanted to apologize i was cruel without thinking iakovitzes chewed on that he scribbled again then proffered the tablet to her with a bow phostis looked over her shoulder iakovitzes had written so was i to speak of your father so in my book the honorsor rather dishonorsare even to phostis relief olyvria said let it be so generations of sharp wits had picked quarrels with iakovitzes generally to end up in disarray phostis was glad olyvria did not propose to make the attempt iakovitzes nodded and walked back to krispos side the avtokrator held up a hand waited for quiet it came slowly but did at length arrive into it krispos said let us have peace peace in videssos the city peace in the empire of videssos civil war is nothing the empire needs the lord with the great and good mind knows i undertook it unwillingly only when those who followed what they called the gleaming path rose in rebellion first in the westlands and then here in videssos the city did i take up arms against them does that mean you father would have let the thanasioi alone if theyd been quiet peaceful heretics olyvria asked i dont know maybe phostis said hes never persecuted the vaspurakaners thats certain phostis puzzled over that krispos always said religious unity was vital to holding the empire together but he didnt necessarily practice what he preached was that hypocrisy or just pragmatism phostis couldnt answer not without more thought hed missed a few sentences krispos was saying shall rebuild the city so that no one may know it has come to harm we shall rebuild the fabric of our lives in the same fashion it will not be quick not all of it but videssos is no child to need everything on the instant what we do we do for generations phostis still had trouble thinking in those terms next year felt a long way away to him worrying about what would happen when his grandchildren were old felt as strange as worrying about what was on the other side of the moon hed fallen behind again but so long as you live at peace with one another you need not fear spies will seek you out to do you harm krispos declared what about tax collectors a safely anonymous wit roared from the crowd krispos took no notice of him people of the city he said earnestly if you so choose you can be at one anothers throats for longer than you care to imagine if you start feuds now they may last for generations after you are gone i pray to phos this does not happen he let iron show in his voice i do not intend to let it happen if you try to fight among yourselves first you must overcome the soldiers of the empire i say this as warning not as threat my view is that we have had enough of strife may we be free of it for years to come he did not say forever phostis noted and wondered why he decided krispos didnt believe such things endured forever by everything the avtokrator had shown he worked to build a framework for what would come after him but did not necessarily expect that framework to become a solid wall he knew too well that history gave no assurance of success we shall rebuild as i said and we shall go on krispos said together we shall do as well as we can for as long as we can the good god knows we can do no more he stepped back on the platform his speech done applause filled the plaza of palamas more than polite less than ecstatic along with olyvria and evripos phostis joined it as well as we can for as long as we can he thought if krispos had picked a phrase to summarize himself he couldnt have found a better one though krispos waved for him not to bother barsymes performed a full proskynesis i welcome you back to the imperial residence your majesty he said from the pavement then still spry he rose as gracefully as he had prostrated himself and added the truth is life is on the boring side here when you take the field krispos snorted im glad to be back then if only to give you something interesting to do the cooks are also glad youve returned the vestiarios said theyre looking for a chance to spread themselves you mean krispos said too bad they can wait until the next time i dine with iakovitzes hell appreciate it properly as for me ive got used to eating like a soldier a bowl of stew a heel of bread and a mug of wine will suit me nicely barsymes shoulders moved slightly in what would have been a sigh in someone less exquisitely polite than the eunuch i shall inform the kitchens of your desires he said the cooks will be disappointed but perhaps not surprised you have a habit of acting thus whenever you return from campaign do i krispos said irked at being so predictable he was tempted to demand a fancy feast just to keep people guessing about him the only trouble was he really did want stew barsymes said perhaps your majesty will not take it too much amiss if the stew be of lobster and mullet though i know that diverges from what the army cooks ladled into your bowl perhaps i wont krispos admitted i did miss seafood barsymes nodded in satisfaction krispos might rule the empire but the vestiarios held sway here unlike some vestiarioi he had the sense not to flaunt his power or push it beyond its limitsor perhaps he had simply decided krispos would not let him get away with the liberties some vestiarioi had taken the hour remains young barsymes said after a glance at the shadows would your majesty care for an early supper thank you no krispos said i could plunge into the pile of parchments that no doubt reaches tall as the apex of the high temples dome i will do that tomorrow or perhaps the day after the pile wont be much taller by then for now though i am going to march to the imperial bedchamber and do the one thing i couldnt in the field relax he paused no im not your majesty barsymes said what then i am going to the bedchamber krispos said i may even rest presently but first please tell drina i want to see her ah barsymes said krispos read approval in the nondescript noise the vestiarios added it shall be just as you say of course in the privacy of the bedchamber krispos took off his own boots when his feet were free he happily wiggled his toes in the palaces his doing something for himself rather than summoning a servant was as much an act of rebellion as a thanasiots taking a torch to a rich mans house barsymes had needed quite a while before he accepted that the avtokrator was sometimes stubborn enough to insist on having his own way in such matters a tapping at the door sounded so tentative that krispos wondered if hed really heard it he walked over and opened the door anyhow drina stood in the hall looking nervous im not going to bite you krispos said it would spoil my appetite for the supper the esteemed barsymes wants to stuff down me she didnt laugh he concluded she didnt get the joke swallowing a sigh he waved her into the bedchamber she walked slowly she was still a couple of months from giving birth but her belly bulged quite noticeably even though she wore a loosefitting linen smock krispos leaned forward over that belly to give her a light kiss hoping to put her more at ease he succeeded if not quite the way he thought he would she smiled and said you didnt bump into my middle there you know how to kiss a woman whos big with child i should krispos said ive had practice even if it was years ago sit if you care to i know your feet wont be happy now how are you feeling well enough thank you your majesty drina answered sinking with a grateful sigh into a chair i only lost my breakfast once or twice and but for needing the chamber pot all the time im pretty well krispos paced back and forth wondering what to say next he hadnt been in this situation for a long time and had never expected to find himself in it again it wasnt as if he loved drina or even as if he knew her well he wished it were that way but it wasnt hed just found her convenient for relieving the lust he still sometimes felt now he was discovering that convenience for the moment could turn into something else over the long haul he used that principle every day in the way he ruled he realized he should have applied it to his own life too well he hadnt now he had to make the best of it after a couple of more back and forths he settled on is everyone treating you well oh yes your majesty drina nodded eagerly better than ive ever been treated before plenty of nice foodnot that i havent always eaten well but more and betterand i havent had to work too hard especially since i started getting big her hands cupped her belly she gave krispos a very serious look and you warned me about putting on airs so i havent ive been careful about that good i wish everyone paid as much attention to what i say krispos said drina nodded serious still even with thai intent expression even pregnant as she was she looked very young suddenly he asked how many years do you have drina she counted on her fingers before she answered twentytwo i think your majesty but i may be out one or two either way krispos started pacing again it wasnt that she didnt know her exact age he wasnt precisely sure of his own peasants such as he and his family had been didnt worry over such things you were as old as the work you could do but twentytwo more or less shed been born right around the time he took the throne what am i to do with you he asked aiming the question as much at himself or possibly at phos as at her your majesty her eyes got large and frightened you said id not lack for anything her voice trailed away as if reminding him of his own promise took all the courage she had and as if shed not be surprised if he broke it you wontby the good god i swear it he sketched the suncircle over his heart to reinforce his words but thats not what i meant what then drinas horizons like his when hed been a peasant reached no farther than plenty of food and not too much work all i want to do is take care of the baby youll do that and with as much help as you need he said he scratched his head do you read no your majesty do you want to learn how not especially your majesty drina said cant see that id ever have much call to use it krispos clucked disapprovingly a veteran resettled to his village had taught him his letters before his beard sprouted and his world was never the same again written words bound time and space together in a way mere talk could never match but if drina did not care to acquire the skill forcing it on her would not bring her pleasure he scratched his head again your majesty she asked he raised an eyebrow and waited for her to go on she did nervously your majesty after the babys born will youwill you want me again it was a good question krispos admitted to himself from drinas point of view it probably looked like the most important question in the world she wanted to know whether shed stay close to the source of power and influence in the empire the trouble was krispos had no idea what reply to give her he couldnt pretend to himself or to her that hed fallen wildly in love not when he was more than old enough to be her father and even if he had fallen wildly in love with her the result would only have been grotesque older men who fell in love with girls got laughed at behind their backs she waited for his answer well have to see he said at last he wished he could do better than that but he didnt want to lie to her either yes your majesty she said the pained resignation in her voice cut like a knife he wished he hadnt bedded her at all but he hadnt the nature or temperament to make a monk what was he supposed to do i should have remarried after dara died he thought but he hadnt wanted to do that then and a second wife might have created more problemsdynastic onesthan she solved so hed taken serving maids to bed every now and then and so he had his present problem i told you before that id settle a fine dowry on you when you find yourself someone who can give you all the love and caring you deserve he said i dont think youll find an emperors bastard any obstacle to that no i dont think so either she agreed she was ignorant but not stupid the trouble is i dont have anyone like that in mind right now not right now she was twentytwo not right now didnt look that different from forever to her nor in fairness could she look past her confinement her whole world would turn upside down once she held her baby in her arms shed need time to see how things had changed well see krispos said again all right she accepted that she had no choice krispos knew it wasnt fair for her most avtokrators would not have given that a first thought let alone a second but he knew about unfairness from having been on the receiving end if he hadnt been unjustly taxed off his farm he never would have come to videssos the city and started on the road that led to a crown but what was he to do say he loved her when he didnt that wouldnt be rightor faireither he was uneasily aware that providing for drina and her child wasnt enough but he didnt see what else he could do she wasnt a helpless maiden not by a long shot her eyes twinkled as she asked what do the young majesties think of all this evripos has known for a long time of course he just laughs whenever he sees me does he krispos didnt know whether to be miffed or to laugh himself if you must know phostis and katakolon seem to be of a mind that im a disgusting old lecher who should keep his drawers on when he goes to bed drina dismissed that with one word pooh krispos couldnt even glow with pride as another man might have hed spent too many years on the throne weighing everything he heard for flattery doing his best not to believe all the praise that poured over him like honey thick and sweet he thought some of the man he had been still remained behind the imperial facade hed built upbut how could you be sure he started pacing again sometimes you think too much he told himself he knew it was true but it was so ingrained in him that he couldnt change at last too late he told drina thank you i should thank you your majesty for not ignoring me or casting me out of the palaces or putting me in a sack and throwing me into the cattlecrossing because my belly made me a nuisance to you drina said you shame me krispos said he saw she didnt understand and felt bound to explain when im thanked for not being a monster it tells me ive not been all the man i might be who is she said and youre the avtokrator all the things you keep in your head your majestyid go mad if i tried it for a day i was just glad you saw fit to remember me at all and do what you can for me krispos pondered that an avtokrator could do what he chosehe needed to look no further than anthimos antics to be reminded of that the power made responsibility hard to remember seen from that viewpoint maybe he wasnt doing so badly after all thank you he said to drina again this time with no hesitation at all a boys choir sang hymns of thanksgiving the sweet almost unearthly notes came echoing back from the dome of the high temple filing the worship area below with joyous sound phostis however listened without joy he knew he was no thanasiot all the same the countless wealth lavished on the high temple still struck him as excessive and when oxeites lifted up his hands to beseech phos favor all phostis could think of was the ecumenical patriarchs clothofgold sleeves and the pearls and precious gems mounted on them only because of the peace hed made with krispos had he come here he recognized that celebrating his safe return to videssos the city at the most holy shrine of the empires faith was politically and theologically valuable so he endured it that did not mean he liked it beside him though awe turned olyvrias face almost into that of a stranger her eyes flew like butterflies landing now here now there marveling at the patriarchs regalia at the mossagate and marble columns at the altar at the rich woods of the pews and most of all inevitably at the mosaic image of phos stern in judgment that looked down on his worshipers from the dome its so marvelous she whispered to phostis for the third time since the service began every city in the provinces says its main temple is modeled after this one what none of them says is that all their models are toys phostis grunted softly back in his throat what she found wondrous was cloying to him then of themselves his eyes too went up to the dome no man could be easy meeting the gaze of that phos the image seemed to see inside his head to know and note every stain on his soul even thanasios would have quailed under that inspection for the sake of the image in the dome phostis forgave the rest of the temple the choirmaster brought down his hands the boys fell silent their blue silk robes shimmered in the lamplight as the echoes of their music slowly faded oxeites recited phos creed the notables who filled the temple joined him at prayer those echoes also reverberated from the dome the patriarch said not only do we seek thy blessing phos we also humbly send up to thee our thanks for returning to us phostis son of krispos heir to the throne of videssos and granting him thine aid through all the troubles he has so bravely endured hes never been humble in his life surely not since he donned the blue boots phostis murmured to olyvria hush she murmured back the temple had her in its spell oxeites went on surely lord with the great and good mind thou also viewest with favor the ending of the empires trial of heresy and the way in which its passing was symbolized by the recent union of the young majesty and his lovely bride a spattering of applause rose from the assembled worshipers vigorously led by krispos phostis was convinced oxeites would not know a symbol if it reached up and yanked him by the beard he suspected the avtokrator of putting words in his patriarchs mouth we thank thee phos for thy blessings of peace and prosperity and once more for the restoration of the young majesty to the bosom of his family and to videssos the city oxeites said in ringing tones the choir burst into song again when the hymn was finished the patriarch dismissed the congregation the thanksgiving service was not a full and formal liturgy phostis blinked against the late summer sun as he walked down the broad wide stairs outside the high temple katakolon poked him in the ribs and said the only bosom you care about in your family is olyvrias by the good god youre shameless phostis said he couldnt help laughing even so because katakolon had no malice in him he could get away with outrages that would have landed either of his brothers in trouble in the courtyard outside the high temple people of rank insufficient to get them into the thanksgiving service cheered as phostis came down from the steps and walked over to his horse he waved to them all the while wondering how many had shouted for the gleaming path not long before the haloga guard who held the horses head said you talk to your god only a little while today he sounded approving or at least relieved phostis handed olyvria up onto her mount then swung into the saddle himself the halogai formed up around the imperial party for the return to the palaces olyvria rode at phostis left to his right was evripos his older younger brother curled his lip and said youre back hurrah then he looked straight ahead and seemed to concentrate solely on his horsemanship wait a minute phostis said harshly im sick of cracks like that from you if you wanted me to be gone and stay gone you had your chance to do something about it i told you then i dont have that kind of butchery in me evripos answered well then quit talking to me as if you wish you did that made evripos look his way again though still without anything that could be called friendliness brother of mine just because i wont shed blood of my blood that doesnt mean i want to clasp you to my bosom if i can steal the patriarchs phrase thats not enough phostis said its all i care to make it evripos answered its not enough i tell you phostis said which succeeded in gaining evripos undivided attention phostis went on one of these days if i live im going to wear the red boots unless olyvria and i have a son of our own youll be next in line for them even if we do hed be small for a long time the day may come when you decide blood doesnt matter or maybe youll think you can just shave my head and pack me off to a monastery youd get the throne and salve your tender conscience at the same time evripos scowled i wouldnt do that as you said i had my chance you wouldnt do it now phostis returned what about ten years from now or twenty when you feel you cant stand being second in line for another heartbeat or what happens if i decide i cant trust you to stay in your proper place i might strike first little brother did you ever think of that evripos was good at using his face to mask his thoughts but phostis had watched him all his life and saw hed succeeded in surprising him the surprise faded quickly evripos studied phostis as closely as he was studied in turn slowly he said youve changed it sounded like an accusation have i now phostis tried to keep anything but the words themselves from his voice aye you have it was accusation before you got kidnapped you didnt have the slightest notion what you were for what you wanted you knew what you were against anything that had to do with father phostis interrupted just so evripos agreed with a thin smile but being against is easy finding knowing what you truly do want is harder you know what you want olyvria put in of course i do evripos said the red boots hung unspoken in the air but it looks like i cant have that and now that phostis knows what he wants too and what it means to him it makes him ever so much more dangerous to me than he was before so it does phostis said you can do one of two things about it as far as i can see you can try to take me out which you say you dont want to do or you can work with me we spoke of that before i got kidnapped maybe you remember you scoffed at me then do you sing a different tune now the second man in all the empire can find or make a great part for himself but its not the first part evripos said i know thats what you want phostis answered saying it for his brother if you look one way you see one person ahead of you but if you look in the other direction you see everyone else behind isnt that enough enough to make evripos thoughtful at any rate when he answered its not what i want the words lacked the hostility with which hed spoken before krispos rode ahead of the younger members of the imperial family as he clattered down the cobblestones in front of the government office building where digenis had been confined a man strolling along the sidewalk sang out phos bless you your majesty krispos sent him a wave and kept on riding thats what i want now evripos voice ached with envy whos going to cheer a general or a minister its the avtokrator who gets the glory by the good god he gets the blame too phostis pointed out if i could id give you all the glory evripos for all i care it can go straight to the ice but theres more to running the empire than having people cheer you in the streets i didnt take it seriously before i got snatched but my eyes have been opened since then he wondered if that would mean anything to his brother it seemed to for evripos said so have mine dont forget i was running videssos the city while father went on campaign even without the riots ill not deny that was a great bloody lot of work all jots and tittles and parchments that didnt mean anything till youd read them five times and sometimes not then phostis nodded he often wondered if he wanted to walk in krispos footsteps and pore over documents into the middle of the night that surely was why the empire of videssos had developed so large and thorough a bureaucracy over the centuries to keep the avtokrator from having to shoulder such burdens as if krispos had spoken aloud phostis heard his opinion of that aye and if you let the penpushers and sealstampers run affairs without checking up on them how do you know when theyre bungling things or cheating you the good god knows we need them and he also knows they need someone looking over them anthimos almost brought the empire to ruin because he wouldnt attend to his ruling i wouldnt be anthimos phostis protested just as if krispos had spoken out loud olyvria evripos and katakolon all gave him curious looks he felt his cheeks heat evripos said well i wouldnt either if i tried to live that life after father died i expect hed climb out of the tomb and wring my neck with bony fingers he dropped his voice and sent a nervous glance up ahead toward krispos phostis guessed he was only half joking me im just as glad im not likely to wear the red boots katakolon said i like a good carouse now and then it keeps you from going stale a good carouse now and then is one thing phostis said from all the tales though anthimos never stopped or even slowed down a short life but a merry one katakolon said grinning you let father hear that from you and your life may be short but it wont be merry phostis answered hes not what youd call fond of anthimos memory katakolon looked forward again he did not want to rouse krispos wrath phostis suddenly grasped another reason why krispos so despised the predecessor whose throne and wife hed taken no doubt hed wondered all the years since anthimos had left behind a cuckoos egg for him to raise as his own and yet of the three young men phostis was probably most like krispos in character if perhaps more inclined to reflection and less to action evripos was devious in a different way and his resentment that he hadnt been born first left him sour and katakolonkatakolon had a blithe disregard for consequences that set him apart from both his brothers without warning evripos said youll give me room to make something for myself make something of myself when the red boots go on your feet ive said so all along phostis answered would an oath make you happier nothing along those lines would truly make me happy evripos said but one of the things ive seen is that sometimes theres nothing to be done about the way things are or nothing that isnt worse anyhow let it be as you say brother of mine ill serve you and do my best to recall that everyone else serves me as well as you the two of them solemnly clasped hands olyvria exclaimed in delight even katakolon looked unwontedly sober evripos palm was warm in phostis by her expression olyvria thought all the troubles between them were over phostis wished he thought the same as far as he could see he and evripos would be watching each other for the rest of their lives no matter what promises they made each other that too came with being part of the imperial family had evripos said something like good to have that settled once and for all phostis would have suspected him more not less as it was his younger brother just flicked him a glance to see how seriously he took the gesture of reconciliation for a moment their eyes met they both smiled again for a moment only they might not trust each other but they understood each other along with the rest of the imperial party they rode through the plaza of palamas and into the palace quarter after the raucous bustle of the rest of the city quiet enfolded them there like a cloak phostis felt he was coming home that had special meaning to him after what hed gone through the past few months hed always used his bedchamber in the imperial residence as a refuge from krispos now that olyvria shared it with him he sometimes thought he never wanted to come out again it wasnt that they spent all their time making love delightful though that was but hed also found in her somebody he liked talking with more than anyone else hed ever known he let himself tip over backward onto the bed like a falling tree the thick goose down of the mattress absorbed his weight it was like falling into a warm dry snowbank with him sprawled across the middle of the bed olyvria sat at its foot she said all of this she waved to show she meant not just the room not just the palace but also the service and the procession through the streets of the city still feels unreal to me youll have the rest of your days to get used to it phostis answered a lot of it is foolish and boring to go through even father thinks so but ceremony is the glue that holds videssos together so he does go through with it and then grumbles when no one outside the palaces can hear him thats hypocrisy olyvria frowned like phostis she still had some thanasiot righteousness clinging to her ive told him as much phostis said he just shrugs and says things would go worse if he didnt give the people what they expected of him before hed been kidnapped he would have rolled his eyes at that now after a small pause for thought he admitted there may be something to it i dont know olyvrias frown deepened how can you live with yourself after doing things you dont believe in year after year after year i didnt say father doesnt believe in them he does for the sake of the empire i said he doesnt like them its not quite the same thing close enough for anyone whos not a theologian and used to splitting hairs but olyvria changed the subject which might have meant she yielded the point im glad you made peace with your brotheror he with you however you want to look at it so am i phostis said not wanting to deceive olyvria about his judgment of that peace he added now well see how long it lasts she took his meaning at once oh she said in a crestfallen voice id thought you put more faith in it than that hope yes faith he shrugged then repeated well see how long it lasts the good god willing itll hold forever if it doesnt if it doesnt youll do what you have to do olyvria said aye what i have to do phostis echoed hed come safe out of etchmiadzin by that rule but if you cared to you could use it to justify anything he sighed then said you know what the real trouble with thanasiot doctrine is what olyvria asked the ecumenical patriarch could come up with a hundred without thinking oxeites does quite a lot without thinking phostis said hes not good at it olyvria giggled deliciously scandalized but whats yours she asked the real trouble with thanasiot doctrine phostis declared as if pontificating before a synod is that it makes the world and life out to be simpler than they are burn and wreck and starve and youve somehow made the world a better place but what about the people who dont want to be burned out and who like to eat till theyre fat what about the makuraners who would pick up the pieces if videssos fell apartand who tried to make it fall apart the gleaming path takes none of them into account it just goes on along the track it thinks right regardless of any complications thats all true enough olyvria said in fact phostis went on following the gleaming path is almost like getting caught up in a new love affair where you just notice everything thats good and kind about the person you love but none of the flaws olyvria gave him an unfathomable look his analogy pleased him so much that he wondered what was troubling her until she asked in rather a small voice and what does that say about us it saysuh feeling his mouth hanging foolishly open phostis shut it he kept it shut while he did some hard thinking at last much less sure of himself than he had been a moment before he answered i think it says that we cant afford to take us for granted or to think that because were happy now were always going to be happy unless we work to make that happen the romances talk a lot about living happily ever after but they dont say how its done we have to find that out for ourselves i wish youd stop poking fun at the romances seeing as were living one olyvria said but she smiled to take any sting from her words other than that though you make good sense you seem to have a way of doing that thank you he said seriously then he reached out and poked her in the ribs she squawked and whipped her head around curls flying he drew her to him and drowned the squawk in a kiss when at last he had to breathe he asked her softly how are we doing now now well this time she kissed him as for the rest ask me in twenty years he glanced up just for a moment to make sure the door was barred i will imperial crown heavy on his head krispos sat on the throne in the grand courtroom awaiting the approach of the ambassador for khatrish in front of the throne stood barsymes iakovitzes and zaidas krispos hoped the three of them would be enough to protect him from tribos pungent sarcasm the fuzzybearded envoy advanced down the long central aisle of the courtroom between ranks of courtiers who scorned him as both barbarian and heretic he managed to give the impression that their scorn amused him which only irked them the more he prostrated himself at the proper place before krispos throne krispos had debated whether to have the throne rise while tribos head rested on the gleaming marble floor in the end hed decided against it as before when tribo rose he asked has the gearing broken down your majesty or are you just not bothering im not bothering krispos swallowed a sigh so much for the fond hope avtokrators nursed of overawing envoys from less sophisticated lands he inclined his head to tribo ive waited in eager curiosity for your words since you requested this audience honored ambassador youre wondering how ill get on your nerves now you mean mutters rose at tribos undiplomatic language by his foxy grin he reveled in them but when he resumed he spoke more formally i am bidden by the puissant khagan nobad son of gumush to extend khatrishs congratulations to your majesty for your victory over the thanasiot heretics the puissant khagan is gracious krispos said the puissant khagan for all his congratulations is unhappy with your majesty tribo said youve put out the fire in your own house but sparks caught in the thatch of ours and theyre liable to burn down the roof we still have plenty of trouble from the thanasioi in khatrish im sorry to hear that krispos reflected that he wasnt even lying just as videssian thanasioi had spread the heresy to khatrish so foreign followers of the gleaming path might one day bring it back to the empire krispos resumed i dont know what the khagan would have me do now though beyond what ive already done here in my own realm he thinks it hardly just for you to export your problems and then forget about them when they trouble you no more tribo said what would he have me do krispos repeated shall i ship imperial troops to your ports to help your soldiers root out the heretics shall i send in priests i reckon orthodox to uphold the pure and true doctrines tribo made a sour face shall videssos swallow up khatrish you mean thank you your majesty but no if i said aye to that my khagan would likely tie me between horses and whip them to a gallop one going one way and one the other unless he paused to think up a truly interesting and creative end for me khatrish has been free of the imperial yoke for more than three hundred years for reasons you may not understand wed sooner keep it that way as you will krispos said your land and mine are at peace and im happy with that but if you dont want our warriors and you dont want our priests honored ambassador what do you expect us to do about the thanasioi in khatrish you ought to pay us an indemnity for inflicting the heresy on us tribo said the gold would help us take care of the problem for ourselves krispos shook his head if wed deliberately set the thanasioi on you that would be a just claim but videssos just fought a war to put them down here we didnt want them around either im sorry they spread to khatrish but it was no fault of ours shall i bill the puissant khagan every time the balancer heresy you love so well shows its head here in the empire your majesty i know you imperials have a saying when in videssos the city eat fish but till now i hadnt known you hid a sharks dorsal fin under those fancy robes from you honored ambassador thats high praise indeed krispos said which only made tribo look unhappier still the avtokrator went on does your puissant khagan have any other business for you to set before me no your majesty tribo answered i shall convey to him your stubborn refusal to act as justice would dictate and warn you that i cannot answer for the consequences from the makuraner ambassador that would have meant war but videssos badly outweighed khatrish and the two nations despite bickering had not fought for generations so krispos said do tell his puissant self that i admire his gall and that if i could afford to subsidize it i would as is hell just have to smuggle more and hope he makes it up that way i shall convey your insulting and degrading remarks along with your refusal tribo paused he may take you up on that smuggling scheme i know ill stop him if i can krispos mentally began framing orders for more customs inspectors and tighter vigilance along the khatrisher border all the same he knew the easterners would get some untaxed amber through tribo prostrated himself again then rose and walked away from the throne backward until hed withdrawn far enough to turn around without offending court etiquette he was too accomplished a diplomat to do anything so rude as sticking his nose in the air as he marched off but so accomplished a mime that he managed to create that impression without the reality the courtiers began streaming out after the ambassador left the grand courtroom their robes and capes of bright glisten ing silk made them seem a moving field of springtime flowers zaidas turned to krispos and made small silent clappiny motions well done your majesty he said its not every day that the envoy from khatrish whoever he may be leaves an audience in such dismay khatrishers are insolent louts with no respect for their betters barsymes said they disrupt ceremonial merely for the sake of disruption by his tone the offense ranked somewhere between heresy and infanticide on his scale of enormities i dont mind them that much krispos said they just have a hard time taking anything seriously hed lost his own war against ceremonial years before if he needed a reminder the weight of the crown on his head gave him one seeing other folk strike blows against the foethe only foe in the empire or out of it that had overcome himlet him dream about renewing the struggle himself one day he was sadly realist enough to know he did but dream iakovitzes opened his table plucked out a stylus and wrote busily i dont like khatrishers because theyre too apt to cheat when they dicker with us of course they say the same of videssos and theyre probably as right as we are zaidas murmured krispos suspected iakovitzes didnt like khatrishers because they took the same glee he did in flouting staid videssian customand sometimes upstaged him while they were at it that was something he wouldnt say out loud for fear of finding out he was right and wounding iakovitzes in the process the grand courtroom continued to empty a couple of men came forward instead of leaving they carried rolled and sealed parchments in their outstretched right hands haloga guardsmen kept them from getting too close one of the northerners glanced back at krispos he nodded the haloga took the petitions and carried them over to him theyd go into one of the piles on his desk he wondered when hed have the chance to read them theyll reach the top one of these days he thought the petitioners walked down the long aisle toward the doorway krispos rose stretched and descended the stairs from the throne iakovitzes wrote another note you know it might not be so bad if the thanasioi give the khatrishers all the trouble they can handle and a bit more besides let tribo say what he will the day may come when the khagan really has to choose between going under and calling on videssos for aid that would be excellent barsymes said krispos brought kubrat back under videssian rule why not khatrish as well why not krispos thought videssos had never abandoned her claim to kubrat or khatrish or thatagush all lands overwhelmed by khamorth nomads off the plains of pardraya three hundred years before to restore two of them to the empire he might go down in the chronicles as krispos the conqueror that however assumed the khatrishers were ripe to be conquered i dont see it krispos said not altogether regretfully khatrish somehow has a way of fumbling through troubles and coming out on the other side stronger than it has any business being theyre more easygoing about their religion than we are too so heresy has a harder time inciting them they certainly didntdontcare for the thanasioi zaidas said krispos guessed the idea of conquest appealed to him too well see what happens thats all the avtokrator said if it turns to chaos we may try going in wed have to be careful even so though to make sure the khatrishers dont unite againagainst us nothing like a foreign foe to make the problems you have with your neighbors look small remember also your majesty the thanasioi dissemble barsymes said even if the khatrishers seem to put down the heresy of the gleaming path for the time being it may yet spring to life a generation from now a generation from now krispos snorted odds are thatll be phostis worry not mine a year before the idea of passing the empire on to his eldestif phostis was his eldesthad filled him with dread now i expect hell
