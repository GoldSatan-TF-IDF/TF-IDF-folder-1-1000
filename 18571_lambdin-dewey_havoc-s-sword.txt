iacentem gleefully they steep themselves in their brothers blood for exile they change their sweet homes and hearths and seek a country that lies beneath an alien sun georgics book ii publius vergilius maro clerk etienne de gougne heaved a fretful sigh after surveying the large salon just off the equally seedy entrance hall of the commandeered mansion with grips still in hand and rolled up charts still crammed under his armpits he squinted his eyes in dread of the tirade to come once le capitaine saw the place he wished that just once he had had the tiniest dash of courage else his masters transfer to guadeloupe and this foetid clime could have been his excuse to enter the service of some other official perhaps even in his own beloved and exhilarating paris instead of letting himself be meekly dragged ever demeaned and terrified from one arseend of the world to another etienne de gougne could smirk though in his mousy little way that the bulk of le capitaine wrath would fall upon the person whod chosen this abandoned mansion so blithely and carelessly the despised lieutenant de vaisseau jules hainaut for once the swaggering poseur that jumpedup lout that gods noodle what a pigsty lt hainaut said from the doorway making the little clerk eep in sudden dread drop his precious charts in a hollow bonking jumble his grips thudding to the floor and making him spin about oh lieutenant dont do that i beg you de gougne said as he bent to gather his things though secretly pleased to see the look of consternation on the handsome young sprigs face as he realised his error good christ lt jules hainaut breathed taking in just how shabby the interior was when it had looked so promising and grand in his toobrief visit the day before when hed stood on the veranda and had merely peeked in through the smutted window panes assuming this wont do hainaut stated shaking his head no not at all youd better get our gang of noirs to muck all this out before le capitaine arrives little mouse ordering the timid clerk about always made hainaut feel better he stalked into the salon elegant and expensive new boots drumming on the loose woodparquet floor savouring the creaksqueak of excellently made leather his left hand grasped the hilt of his ornately chased smallsword his right hand fisted to his hip the arm akimbo his mind scheming quickly on how to recover from this disaster this spacious salon on the east side of the house had lost its window panes and the winds and rains had gotten in along with a scattering of leaves palm fronds and redbrown wooly furze off the tropical trees the window shutters hung nearly paintless scabbed brokenslatted and crooked a skift of bright glass shards littered the floor along with a few dead birds and a skeletal rat now collapsed upon itself and swarming with ants even as hainaut fanned himself in the closeness of the airless salon with his giltlaced foreandaft bicorne hat he saw a lizard of some kind scuttle from the shutters to seize a cockroach nigh as big as his thumb and he could hear the crunch all the way across the room to make things even worse an entire flotilla a whole shoal of cockroaches fled at that seizure from beneath a torn and tiltlegged sofa to flood along the baseboard before swirling beneath it like a spill of dark ale jules hainaut knew that he was in trouble le capitaine would have him strangled for such carelessness for heaping one more demeaning slight upon him after the several he had suffered from the local officials since they had come ashore on guadeloupe working for le capitaine was rewarding at times profitable in monetary matters and the best of confiscated or commandeered goods such as his ornate sword which formerly had been the property of an elderly junior admiral without the proper zeal and ruthlessness of a true revolutionary you wish it take it le capitaine had told hainaut after the courtmartial for failure and royalist sentiments as it lay on the judges table after the guilty party had been hauled out blade exposed and point toward the doomed signifying a verdict of guilty rewarding and pleasing for jules hainaut too was the aura of fear he could create by merely stating whom he worked for trading on le capitaines dread reputation his new boots the cobbler had made gratis pouring heart and soul into the workmanship and materials as if his life had depended on it his uniforms if not free were gotten at a large shuddery discount but his superior didnt suffer fools or slackers gladly and more than one promising and wellconnected young officer had had his head lopped off for less now what to do what to do hainaut dithered all the while in an outward pose of a man with few cares but for this mere trifle jumpedup foreign farmhand clerk de gougne silently sneered as he gathered up his traps cant even speak good french he circumspectly scoffed with a parisians disdain for anything provincial or anyone born outside la belle france jules hainaut no longer looked it but he had been born a farmboy in the austrian netherlands his parents the sketchiest sort of outlander french hed fled potatogrubbing early had gone to sea at fourteen still nighilliterate and had drifted into the old royal french navy just before the start of the revolution just a lowly matelot with grandiose dreams of being somebody or something some day hed seen quickly how the prevailing winds stood and had gladly if not wholeheartedly embraced republicanism and the jacobism of the sans culottes as a way to advance himself he bought a tricolour revolutionarys cockade and redwool tassel cap and had worn them with outward pride had shouted down with the aristos the loudest and had ridden the coattails of the terror helping to purge the navy of royalists and aristocrats earning a share of the loot taken from them moving up in rank in dead mens shoes for once his lack of education his humble beginnings and his outlandness had worked for him for he was held up as a shining example of how the ideals of the revolution would spread all round the world and conquer the old order most of the rhetoric was greek to hainaut just loud twaddle to be toleratedbut it paid well to listen and cheer and the raids and arrests as a virtuous commoner armed to the teeth and given the awesome power of weaponry over the rich the titled and their minions and lickspittle servants was a heady thing indeed and the cheers escorting accused prisoners through the seaport streets eyes open for the prettiest women and girls who threw corsages and now and then themselves at such a wellknit and stalwart young patriot then when he had been urged to turn informer and spy upon suspect shipmates surviving officers and town citizens and hed come to court to testify tricked out in his scrubbedup borrowed best hainaut had gotten even more favourable attention from the young female citizens most of all after all it wasnt as if the people hed testified against were all that innocent and if he hadnt done it there were two dozen more eager to make names for themselves standing in line behind him so what did it matter when traitors were trundled to the guillotines in the big tumbrils to fill the baskets with their heads they were not family they werent friends of his and most had been unattractive or outright ugly or simply not clever enough to keep their mouths shut and dissemble the latest revolutionary cant which could change from month to month as the various factions in the assembly rose or fell hainaut had advanced to the rank of timmonier the trusty coxswain to a rising young star of a lieutenant who had come up from the lower deck just as he had he ate better than most drank very well and had first pick of the loot could make a pig of himself every night of the week and had thought he had risen high when he had met the man who would change his life he knew hed met real power when his lieutenant had nearly shat his culottes in fear of him after one interview he knew hed met the consummate unscrupulous cynic out to use the revolution to claw back his former honours and position and perhaps le capitaine had seen a fellow spirit in hainaut despite his outward protestations of adoration for the revolution that quickly hed become an aspirant entitled to wear steel on his hip not a crude seamans cutlass but a midshipmans dirk of honour even if his uniform had been a ragpickers offday ensemble hainaut had thrown himself into pleasing le capitaine during the purging of the bordeaux fleet and later in the mediterranean when they ran the infiltrating spyboats the coastal raiding ships and small convoys to support the army facing the piedmontese the genoese neapolitan and muchvaunted austrian armies and it hadnt been hainaut s fault when his small warship under an idiot captain had been taken by the british when le capitaine had trusted him to supervise the mission and wet his feet as a fighting sailor a few weeks on parole on corsica rather pleasant that and hed been exchanged for a british midshipman and warmly welcomed back into le capitaine servicethough the idiot had gotten chopped for failure now jules hainaut was a seasoned lieutenant de vaisseau polished and groomed tutored and pampered and did he continue pleasing his superior the aspirations of commanding a small warship later becoming a capitaine de vaisseau in charge of a tall swift frigate of his own were not beyond his reach if he survived this little disaster and it certainly looked hopeless lt hainaut damned the governorgeneral citizen victor hugues for this insult there were much nicer mansions to be had in the neat little community of bas fort and much closer to the local seat of power too he suspected that governorgeneral hugues a lightskinned mulatto gens du couleur but still a noir lt hainaut accused wanted to show how unimpressed he was by the arrival of le capitaine a possible rival for his position or a spy for the directory despite all their fulsome introductory letters from paris fanning himself some more lt hainaut paced about in the foyer admiring the gloss of his boottoes testing the formerly shiny cuban mahoghany inlaid parquet with a preparatory sigh of disappointment hainaut went to the double doors of the westside salon which were barely ajar pocket doors which hissed into their recesses barely at a touch of the finest craftsmanship ah better he cheered drapes still hung the windows were still glazed chandeliers were still whole and the furniture was worn but useable in point of fact this second salon was jampacked with a jumble of furniture as if two or three other mansions had been looted and the contents stored in this one and behind the salon was a room of equal spaciousness filled with several sets of dining room furnishings hainaut doubted there would be plates cutlery or serving pieces in there but theyd brought their own enough to serve for a few weeks til another warehouse of confiscated goods could be shopped garcon chef hainaut barked over his shoulder to summon the head boy of the workgang they had been loaned ici vite oui bas he answered when he came this salon will be my masters private office hainaut said briskly rubbing his hands in relief that dining room there clean it out it will become le maitres bedchamber comprendre office here bedchamber there hein oui bas je comprend the solidly built man responded send garcons abovestairs surely theres bed furniture find best and fetch it down to there hainaut instructed pointing up then to the dining room bedding and such comprendre literies hein he said in pidgin french since he hadnt heard passable french from the island blacks since stepping ashore they uttered a soft and liquid creole patois oui bas comprend la literie the headman assured him talking as slowly as hainaut as if to covertly twit him back pillows sheets and mattresses send boys for the best make house nouveau clean tout dabord he vowed be tres elegant it had better be hainaut said with a miffed sniff unfamiliar with noirs but suspecting that he was slyly being japed some men to sickle the grass prune the bushes too rehang the shutters there he said pointing again paint walls if paper is hopeless nail the parquet down floor loose floor pieces hein make smooth ah oui the gang leader replied with a resigned shrug all done by sundown comprendre hainaut gleefully insisted the noir winced and sucked his teeth but nodded assent that room there be office for the little mouse clerk lt hainaut slyly instructed small bedcot unbroken desk and chest of drawers nothing good mind well get cracking vite vite hainaut turned and trotted up the staircase without a thought for the herculean task hed just assigned and did they not get it all presentable well too bad for the garcon chef that was what whips were good for hainaut casually supposed pour encourager les autres so they saw the price of failure even hugues partblack himself had kept a form of slavery on guadeloupe after the noirs had been freed poorly paid closely supervised labour gangs might not emulate the bloody massacres of former masters that had torn saint domingue to shreds idle hands were the devils workshop magnifique hainaut whispered on entering the former masters and mistresss chambers on the east side front it was bigger than the salon below it fronted by a deep cool balcony and two sets of double doors with separate shutter doors on the outside the imported furnishings were suitable for a rich aristos paris maison settees chairs and draperies in expensive moire silks elegantly carved nighttables card tables and chairs lamp stands with no windows facing the noreast trades the room had stayed pristine despite being rifled garcon chef up here vite hainaut barked a younger scrawnier noir trotted into the chamber the leaders assistant the souschef dequipage oui bas he asked run tell your chef that all this goes downstairs to my masters bedchamber secondbest from the other front room move in here for me ill take this room comprendre uhh this one answered scratching his pate too fast dammit hainaut snapped impatiently seizing the man by his arm to lead him to the other bedchamber shoving him inside furnishings of here move to grand chamber furnishings in chambre grande you move below comprendre hein du verdammte dreckig monstrositat he swore unconsciously falling back on the bastard german of his youth exchange oui bas the black supposed in a sullen voice oui damn you exchange ah mais oui rapidement the slave beamed go do it then rapidement hainaut disgustedly sneered he strode back to the grand bedchamber to savour his new digs fanning with his hat some more walking out on the wide balcony where tall trees shaded him from the morning sun where woven cane chaises and sidetables awaited and a spectacular view presented itself and he could have sworn that the temperature dropped a quick ten degrees or more in obedience to the trade winds he tipped trash from a cane chair and sat down thinking it was a mortal pity that his grand new bedchamber could never be used for sport but his master was touchy when it came to seeing his aide taking pleasures under his very nose while his own tastes were so outre darker recollections made hainaut shiver his master taking pleasure was not something he would ever wish to see things best left in the dark in prison cellars with the younger weaker and frailer girls the better mon dieu merde alors hainaut silently quailed as some of the work gang came up to begin moving things around at his bidding well with his naval salary and le maitres nowandthen admiring largesse he could hire a tiny but elegant piedaterre room in one of the better harbour lodgings for sport and his offduty momentofarising view would be splendid at any rate guadeloupe was nearly two islands pinched in to a narrow causeway just north and west of pointeapitres environs that linked grandeterre on which he stood and basseterre grandeterre ran eastwest low and lushly verdant despite its exposure to the noreast trades all the way to pointe des chateaux and the farther islet of desirade where dark atlantic rollers met the turquoise caribbean basseterre ran northsouth also incredibly green but mountainous dominated by the peak of the dormant volcano la soufriere tilled as orderly as terrace farms round marseilles its shore fringed with a series of neat little villages and whitesand beach hamlets along its eastern windward shore across the great harbour in which he stood petitbourg stemarie where christopher columbus was reputed to have first landed capesterre belleeau south of there before the coastline curved about souwest hiding trois rivieres the vieux fort and the other leeside harbour of basseterre so beautiful hainaut marvelled so pleasingly alien for once after the bleakness of the rocky wavepunched coasts of europe biscay waters baltic the german sea or le maitres beloved channel ports in brittany even the softer mediterranean or italian shores this was wondrous a grand view he thought it would have to suffice and did le maitres plans spin out in even somewhat proper order or yield success in half the measure hed schemed he would be worked so hard that a view might be all the satisfaction a harried aide might have though it had taken a fair number of kicks and slaps the house was ready for its new masters arrival the jingle and rumble of the coach and four on the roundabout sandshell drive brought out hainaut de gougne and the most docile willing and least threatening blacks whom hainaut had decided to employ they had been sluiced down at the well in the back yard and hurriedly garbed in clean slopclothing to stand muster by the drive enticing aromas from the separate cooking shed wafted coachward tall beeswax candles fluttered in the windows and both closed lanthorns and open torches beamed welcoming cheer from the drive and the wide deep veranda the coach rocked to a stop and an armed guard in the uniform of naval infantry leaped down from the boot to fold down the metal step and open the nearside door before springing to rigid attention his musket unslung and held at present arms his face a patient blank no matter that the senior passenger took half an hour to alight and god help the man who innocently sprang to assist him the fingers of a left hand curled about the door frame a brass tip on a stout ebony walkingstick then a mans right boot emerged blindly groping for the step as someone grunted to shift his weight zut beurk ouf aile merde alors horreur une bete weak cries of alarm sussurated from the aligned blacks who to a man crossed themselves or made warding signs against the evil eye wailing le diable and making hainaut turn to cuff or curse them to worshipful silence le maitrele capitainein paris and toulon le hideux but never in his or his minions hearingalit at last standing on his own feet surveying the house front with a suspicious scowl clump shuffle tick clump shuffle tick on the firmly laid pavers of the sandandbrick walk between the freshly pruned flowering bougainvillea as capitaine de vaisseau guillaume choundas made a torturous way forward his right foot in a regular hightopped boot almost demanded firm ground before the hamstrung left leg in an ironbracedandbound boot swished limply ahead with the bright brass ferrule of the stout walkingstick swung out ahead for balance to ring against the stones guillaume choundass right sleeve was pinned up high under his heavily gilt epaulette folded so it displayed gold buttons and wide oakleaf embroidery near where a sergeant would show chevrons it was a fulldress coat more suited to a junior admiral but very few in the caribbean or europe either would dare to question his right to wear it more gilt oakleaf showed on the high red collar and on the thighs of his dark blue breeches too a large and elaborate bicorne hat slashed foreandaft atop his head raked aggressively low over his eyes eight centimeters of gold edge lace loop and button and tassels gilt as well with a tricolore cockade on one side and bluewhitered egret plumes nodding above the crease below the hat though capitaine choundass face was halfcovered with a stiffened silk mask that disguised a cruel deepscarred ruin the result of a ghastly wound suffered long ago a sword cut that had slashed upwards to slice one eye and his brow in half almost vertically shattered the eye socket chopped off one nostril and xed both lips to a horror worthy of an hieronymous bosch painting of a demon the mask had been expanded lately to cover the nose completely but there was no concealing the split lips that had healed in a rictus of rage welcome mon capitaine hainaut exclaimed stepping off the veranda to greet him and sweep an arm to encompass the house all is ready for you in your grand new lodgings supper will be served just as soon as you wish msieur as i expected cher jules choundas replied almost registering pleasure for a glimmering moment that just as quickly disappeared given your zeal though i have not yet seen inside hein he came close to almost making a jest these dumb beasts are to be our house servants he concluded with a normal frown such as they are msieur best of a poor lot hainaut told him with a disparaging gallic shrug i returned those that did not please to governor hugues to make what use of them he will do a few more officials arrive in need of servants hell be reduced to the very dregs of the government supply nestce pas mon capitaine he concluded with a devious simper think i am le diable do you choundas asked the blacks lined up for inspection almost jovially softvoiced as he clumpticked to within a few feet of them making them shrink back a pace he removed his hat baring florid gingerred hair ah mais oui he said with a shrug hat tucked under his good arm he lifted the mask i am he thundered making the blacks whine cringe visibly shake and almost piss their sloptrousers i will be served with alacrity with diligence and with quiet the one who raises his voice inside who annoys me hell be flayed to his bones and fed to the sharks alive do not make me take notice of you comprendes youve had your one curious look and last winces the next one of you who looks at me askance and even thinks that i am disgusting i will have boiled in hot tar and crucified headdown he let the mask drop back into place shuffled its seating and thrust his hat back onto his head you had better fear me mon garcons he threatened and do my bidding as quietly and unnoticed as mice now go allei vite they scampered in a twinkling pleased with himself choundas turned once more to lt hainaut let us see what you have accomplished jules by the way we will be having dinner guests you know the gallant capitaine desplan but of course maitre capitaine desplan welcome hainaut piped up to the captain of the le bouclier frigate as if they hadnt spent nearly six weeks aboard her in cheektojowl company choundas stomped up to the wood veranda while hainaut made his welcomes to the other captains of their acquaintance off the gunned corvettes that had escorted their older gun frigate and a storeship capitaine de fregate griot of le gascon a stout little fellow of dark features and the much taller and paler capitaine de fregate macpherson off za resolue an emigre jacobite scot whose family had fled to france after the failure of bonnie prince charlie stuart in another officer a mere lieutenant de vaisseau had alit from the carriage too one who hung back shyly et vous msieur that is lieutenant recamier jules choundas informed him as he stood impatiently rapping his stick on the veranda to hurry them inside formerly of the schooner lincendiare he is most familiar with caribbean waters and has a most intriguing tale to tell after dessert and brandy we must avail ourselves of his experience come messieurs let us share a glass of wine and discover what an island cook can do with victuals ah him hainaut thought with malicious glee having read afteraction reports of lincendiare s loss it was no wonder that the poor fellow was diffident hainaut wasnt sure whether lt recamier was to be the main course the dessert or the postprandial entertainment bienvenu msieur recamier he said though putting his best face of ignorant affability on and extending a proper republican hand to shake i trust youll enjoy our offerings for supper they had sailed with an extensive wine cellar and the casks and crates had been ashore long enough for shipstirred lees to settle or be carefully filtered when decanted so choundas set a good table lt hainaut saw to that the soup was a bland cool celery broth the fish a freshcaught pompano served with a local delicacy crabes farcis a locally grown salad course with onions cucumbers and carrots zested with vinaigrette and lime juice the main course chickens were on the tough small and stringy side on a rice pilaf still on the bone but for choundass plate which had been picked off and diced for easier onehanded eating a touch dry and overcooked panfried but enlivened with enough exotic hot sauces and caribbean spices to make an equivalent to a hindee curry normally used to mask a tainted dish hainaut griot desplan and macpherson dug in with a will delighted with fresh shore viands after weeks of saltmeat junk sending servants back for more crisp and pipinghot baguettes time after time after the dreary monotony of stale or weeviled ships biscuit choundas occupied the head of the table with capitaine desplan in the place of honour to his right and griot to his left recamier was to griots left opposite hainaut andtwo empty chairs down at the foot of the table sat poor clerk etienne de gougne the little clerk abstemiously took wee bites then chewed seemingly forever before swallowing before the tiniest sips of wine hainaut had seen to it that his dishes had been overseasoned knowing the timid little clerks penchant for the blander and creamier parisian cooking each bite seemed a torture of hellfire though he would be loath to do or say a thing about it and if he pushed his plate away he wouldnt get anything else lt recamier was another spare diner and imbiber as if trying to keep his wits about him and hope to be forgotten perhaps sooner or later though le maitre would get around to him hainaut was sure stupid waste of the fleet choundas groused on his favourite peeve for the umpteenth time when it would have been better to work them up with weeks of training at sea before gadding off on their adventures we will never meet the biftecks on an equal footing until our seamanship and our cooperation between ships and senior officers markedly improves been that way for years choundas groused shoving his food about his plate with his specially made allinone utensil a pewter fork and spoon on one end and a thin scoop on the other in the aristo navy he sneered we swung at anchor most of the time convenient to shore comforts and got sent out on overseas adventures by foppish ignorant fools trusting that time onpassage would smooth out the rough spots what idiocy if only our superiors would have heeded your suggestions mon capitaine desplan of le bouclier sympathised toadying up agreeably as was his wont since they had first set foot on his decks one devoutly wishes that you could be appointed to the ministry capitaine choundas the darkvisaged hawknosed griot suggested scourge out the useless placekeepers and put real sailors in charge they were so obsequious that hainaut had to stifle a groan of derision toadying was pointless for griot he was a breton one of le maitres fabled celts descended from the bold seafarers of brittany of the same blood as choundas scions of the ancient veneti to hear choundas tell it and endlessly retell it the veneti had been deepwater sailors in their stout oak ships as daring as the phoenicians and might have crossed the trackless oceans to discover the new world long before columbus who had almost outfought julius caesars fleet of eggshellthin coasthugging oared triremes during the gallic wars no griot had no need to lick le maitre arse his heritage was his pass to promotion and favour desplan too before the revolution desplan had been a mere midshipman a commoner who could not expect to rise much higher than lieutenant de vaisseau in royal service without money connections or the rare chance to shine with a spectacular feat of derringdo gaining him notice at the royal court desplan however was from quimper a fluent speaker of the ancient breton tongue that king louiss officials had fought to suppress he and capt choundas had slanged whole afternoons away onpassage desplan even daring to compose heroic poems set in the glorious old daysthen read them aloud first in breton then in french for the unenlightened capitaine macpherson though hmmm hainaut considered giving him a perusal under his lashes as he took a long sip of vin ordinaire the man was tall lean and rawboned as gingeryblond as choundas but more weathered his skin more amenable to harsh sunlight scottish ergo some sort of celt but most unfortunately and overtly catholic of the most egregiously selfeffacing and devout kind not the best thing to be or practice so openly these days in a nation under a regime that had closed great cathedrals and tiny chapels confiscated the great wealth and lands of holy mother church and turned them all into temples of reason where the genius of man was celebrated his corvette la resolue was a smartlyrun ship though kept in perfect trim her crew intensely drilled and disciplined with a gruff fairness their stormy passage had proved macpherson to be a tarry hoaryhanded tarpaulin man as the british the bloodies said it was possible that macpherson would prosper under choundass command but never shine what admiral de brueys will accomplish with the mediterranean fleet well choundas was raspingly continuing he stopped in midcarp pressed his napkin to his lips to stifle a belch and bent at the waist as if in pain mon dieu take this merde away he shoved his plate halfway to the fruit compote on the glossy wood surface and flung his allinone utensil after it in a sudden fit of rage damned negres all fire and peppers he gravelled glaring at hainaut as if it were his fault making hainaut cringe to think that his plate and the loaded one meant for de gougne had been confused shell not do it again msieur hainaut hotly vowed rising ill fetch you a blankmanger at once to ease you le maitre had been suffering stomach troubles ever since he had gotten his orders to sail for the caribbean was his mentor ailing was it something serious enough to threaten hainauts comfortable and lucrative billet he dashed off towards the cooking shed oui go choundas snapped stifling another painful burning and eructation and give that salope a whack or two as warning pardons messieurs foreign service has ruined my trips as sure as grapeshot i could almost savour chinese cooking mandarin was best subtle and elegant both in taste and presentation hoisin from the far north or cantonese though all devils piss garlic and fire bah does that negre cowshide mean to poison me it has been known to happen msieur le capitaine lt recamier spoke up for the first time in half an hour still diffident though it means the slaughter of the entire houseslave staff if they are caught at it many an overly cruel master or mistress has died under mysterious circumstances in the islands sometimes the witch worked by voudoun poisons are so subtle even the ablest physicians cant say the cause was not natural les noirs have a thousand ways to get back at europeans scorches on new clothing pets gone missing lost spoons anything drip at a time never anything worthy of a beating i think your chinois would call it the death of a thousand cuts nestce pas a dripatatime water torture indeed guillaume choundas archly drawled back though with a glint of sudden wariness in his good eye here you are msieur hainaut said returning with a dish of whipped and sweetened wheat flour he retrieved the utensil wiped it on his waistcoat and handed it to choundas after a few moments and a few spoonfuls le maitre seemed much eased and the wary uncomfortable silence ended hainaut returned to his own supper enjoying its taste even if it had cooled while he was away on his urgent errand de brueys choundas dyspeptically snapped picking up where he had left off a cautious old fellow perhaps more suited to a shore or port command than a fighting fleet hein too set in his ways the old idle aristo ways needs everything just so a setpiece that advances in understandable steps we must thank our lucky stars messieurs that we are not part of his folly that little tufthunter whose army he carries general bonaparte is sure to overreach and lead a great part of our navy into trouble better we take malta as planned land and conquer the kingdom of naples second then cross and conquer sicily cutting the mediterranean in two before any farther efforts give the bifteck admiral jervis a real headache and run him back to lisbon again then properly shaken down and trained in seamanship the adriatic the aegean sea and the ottoman turk lands could be ours by simply opening our hands to pluck them oui dearly as we would wish to partake in honour and glory for la belle france and the revolutions expansion to all of europe we must be thankful that we are out here where adventures just as grand await us like proper little sychophants appreciative of their superiors acuity and bold strategic thinking the diners almost stood to clap hainaut didnt quite remember it that way when orders had come from the five demigods who comprised the directory in paris in point of fact his master had raged and cursed throwing things to the four winds howling about betrayal exile and scourging the new men the slimyslick attorneyposeurs whod supplanted the bold firebrands of the revolution shuffling those whod worked the hardest off stage to be forgotten and dismissed without reward a brace of prisoners in for minor offences had been halfdead before le maitre had spent his rage it was though the story of his masters embittered life to be used as a catspaw to the rich and titled wastrels even in the days when he was slim stalwart and handsome in his own fashion now it was exile to the sugar islands where ugly crippled embarassments could succumb to a myriad of plagues and fevers unlookedfor and unloved hainaut grimaced a tad recalling choundass slim successes in the mediterranean his next thankless assignment to outfit general humberts expedition to ireland in a squadron of frigates it hadnt been his fault that lord cornwalliss army had cornered the small army of humberts forcing its semihonourable surrender and a slaughter of its illarmed illtrained irish rebel auxiliaries last year in the batavian republic formerly holland training and encouraging juryarmed merchant ships into frigates and corvettes and scouting vessels only to see the bifteck admiral duncan sweep them from the seas at the battle of camperdown for the scouts failed their main body that hadnt been his fault either but hainaut wondered again whether he had hitched his waggon to an illfavoured star or remained in choundass harness perhaps too long did le maitre fail out here this would be his last chance and hainaut could sink back into the pool of mediocre junior officers living only on his meagre pay with all hopes of future advancement blocked choundas rang a tiny porcelain bell to summon dessert slaves rushed to dole out soft doughy and sugarcrusted pastry shells filled with fresh local berries sopping in heavy whipped cream dessert wine and brandy were fetched out as well the directory and the assembly gave short shrift to failures jules hainaut glumly speculated as he tried a bite of the dessert and found it better than succulent almost too sweet though they did not execute as many as they had in the earlier days hainaut speculated even powerful robespierre had lost his head as an embarassment choundas perhaps but never a handsome cunning fellow such as he he knew when to jump and profit by it promised me a command he did hainaut thought not a privateer but a national ship it was the donkeys carrot that choundas had hung before his eyes what he had groomed him fornot to be his footman his catchfart his dogsbody forever thats what the de gougnes of this world were for after all excellent choundas grunted in rare praise of his berry tart though cher hainaut you must also remind that peau de vache that portions must be cut smaller for me in future ill see to it msieur hainaut swore beaming at his mentor already laying an agreeable aura in which he could sooner or later pose his request for a chance to shine on his own the brandy now i think messieurs choundas announced and we shall now partake of lieutenant recamiers vast experience and his wisdom making recamier stiffen in dread which reaction pleased le maitre no end after all machiavelli had said it was better to be feared than loved though lieutenant recamier knew that le hideux loved to make examples of failures in the performance of their duty to the republic and the navy the fellow had kept a cool head throughout supper believing that a bold front of honour impugned his truth insulted would serve him better than coming over all meek or fearful of being willing to admit error but vowing to do better next time if allowed hainaut had been mildly amazed that recamier had so kept his wits about him that hed not even fidgeted or plucked with his fingers at the tablecloth or his napkin eitherhis hands had stayed innocently inert rising only to gesture or draw his actions against the british frigate that had destroyed his command and captured the american smuggling brig in his charge using the tip of his knife on his placemat they had both anchored for the night off st johns island in the masterless danish virgins yes hed seen the frigate lit up like a whaler hard at work boiling down a catch for its oil he admitted to them a clever ruse yes there shed been at dawn as his schooner and the brig had set ail revealed as a british warship and he had turned at once to interpose his small ship between them and had been the first to fire fifteen minutes altogether he had traded fire with the biftecks his puny pounders against pounders until forced to bear away after roundshot had shattered his schooners helm before relieving tackle could be rigged to the rudder post his little ship had struck a badly charted shoal ripping her bows open stranding her forward third high and dry and dismasting her in an instant unlike some msieur capitaine i did not fire a few shots to salvage honour before striking lt recamier had sulkily declared to one and all eyes level broodingly aflame as if ready to dare anyone to a duel for his good name i had thought to lure the bloody ship onto the shoal in close pursuit but my charts were old so hainaut had scoffed to himself sure that recamier was lying as boldly as a street vendor with a tray of confiscated aristo pocket watches but strangely capt choundas had not challenged him over it and who was to say since lincendiare had not rated a sailing master leaving her navigation to her lowranking captainand all of those charts were now lost with her quite conveniently he thought yes the british frigate had broken off pursuit of the brig to fetchto and lower two boats filled with redcoat marines and sailors then had headed westnorwest into the vast sound east of st thomas to catch the brigwhich she did recamier had witnessed from a high vantage point ashore through his telescope and saw them sailing back down a very narrow channel into the sound where she fetchedto again to recover her boats and men yes recamier had gotten all his crew including his seriously wounded and maimed men into his own boats and had rowed ashore on st john but only after making sure that his command was well alight his colours still flying in fiery defiance and all her damning correspondence rescued jettisoned in weighted bags or boxes or left to burn his precious commission papers and role dequipage as proof of being a proper warship he had salvaged which had proved of great value when he had sailed over to st thomas a day later and presented himself to the danish authorities who had shrugged off the morepunctilious formalities of internment and had treated his wounded well before providing a cartel ship to return him and his men to guadeloupethe danish fee for such compassionate offices a steep one and how closeaboard were the british boats when you left your command lieutenant choundas had probed more than four long musket shots msieur perhaps less lt recamier had replied his eyes a tad too unblinking over that point as if trying too hard to be believed describe them choundas had demanded hmmm tarred hulls msieur perhaps dull black paint the gunwales and waterline bootstripes were cream or pale yellow white oars he had vaguely shrugged taking a sip of wine at last any name displayed mon cher lieutenant choundas had almost purred as if beguiling him into an inescapable trap making hainaut lick his lips in expectation sure that recamier had gone overside in haste not sticking around to take note of such things proteus msieur recamier had calmly and certainly answered though block letters in gilt either side of the lead boats bows and the officer in charge he shouted the ships name as well very bad french of course here am i his fregate les rois his twelfth night cakes ship proteus recamier had tittered making the others laugh les rois not le roiquel drole and that error had carried such versimilitude that captain choundas had chuckled along briefly mind with the rest dismissing his suspicions only an english ignoramus so arrogantly unschooled in any language but his own could mistake the possessive majestys with the plural les rois which any french toddler knew meant a christmastide treat in point of fact lt recamier had picked out the lettering from a very safe halfmile distant with a strong glass abandoning ship as soon as the bloodies had fetchedto sure of what was coming and averse to languishing for years in a prison hulk or scraping by on a pittance in an enemy harbour town on parole with barely two sou to rub together unable to afford his usual wine women and song and women and it was the biftecks who had fired his ship after sorting through his papers which he had left scattered cross his greatcabins leaving his false letter of marque and reprisal taking only his true naval commission leaving orders signed by the newly arrived capitaine de vaisseau guillaume choundas and did he ever discover that well even being kin by marriage to the estimable admiral de brueys would not save him from the guillotines blade a most unfortunate turn of fate then choundas had decided motioning for capitaine griot to top up recamiers wineglass at last but they did not get your ship or her papers she did not go into english harbour with that damnable british flag above her own colours not into english harbour msieur non recamier had objected once her boats were recovered she sailed west not south i watched her til her tgallants dropped below the horizon i suspect that she was not part of the antigua squadron but was from jamaica instead how odd choundas had pondered leaning back in his chair and staring at the ceiling as if easing a cramp from sitting so long poaching perhaps capitaine de fregate macpherson had japed with the british troops gone from saint domingue their frigates are underemployed that far west do they loan frigates to the squadrons out of antigua our tasks will be more difficult with more patrollers at sea opposing us proteus hainaut had mused did not the london papers last year mention her was she not at camperduin against our pitiful allies the batavians he posed using the dutchflemish pronunciation of the battles name i seem to recall took a prize another frigate something he had trailed off vague and foxed by then on his masters wine oui look into that etienne choundas had ordered certainement msieur the harried little clerk had said with a quick bob of his balding head scribbling notes to himself on scrap paper with an everpresent pencil from his waistcoat pockets well mon cher recamier choundas had concluded their supper with an air approaching bonhomie it is too bad that your l incendiare was lost along with the ami brig and all her supplies but no blame can be laid against you you did your best after all hein merci msieur recamier had replied nodding curtly as if it were true and no more than his right with no sign of relief to his demeanour i cannot promise you another command though not for some time choundas had informed him you understand that a new ship may be seen as a reward nestce pas the british knight their captains when they lose after a wellfought action we do not but i am sure that a shore posting for a year or two at your current salary rate of course might prove instructive and rewarding choundas had looked down his ravaged shinymasked nose as if to say that he knew about recamiers three current amours besides his reasonably wellconnected young and attractive wife back in bordeaux i serve at your command of course msieur recamier shrugged back with just the right eager note of toadying but nothing too thick or oily it has been a long day messieurs and i am weary instructive and pleasant as our supper has been i bid you a good night choundas had determined painfully stiffly scraping his chair back on the bare parquet floor and using his stick to rise most creaky by then quick handshakes quick insincere thanks and compliments were exchanged recamier out the door first then macpherson and griot in order of seniority dates on their commissions lastly capt desplan doffed his undonned hat and backed off the wide front veranda to enter the waiting coach that the black garcon chef had whistled up for them all of them but lt recamier most of all were glad to be gone free of their superiors mercurial and scathing temper choundas stood by the door half slumped in weariness and lingering pain of his ancient wounds leaning heavily on his walkingstick before turning to clumpswish back into the foyer he lies like a dog oui jules choundas said with a snarl of anger and a touch of resignation oh his surviving crewmen said he fought well but as for the rest hmmm then why did you not because he did not cringe cher jules choundas barked with a tinge of wonderment in his voice young recamier has hair on his arse to face me so coolly a man of many parts he is and most of them calm calculating and brave he is not a timid cringing shopkeeper and his wife is a distant cousin to admiral de brueys and the directory would look even more unfavourably upon me did i harvest the lads head choundas concluded with a worldweary sigh and shrug he will not make that set of errors again he is one who can learn from his mistakes of course he panicked when he ran aground most likely his first time hein i doubt he left his little ship so late as he claims his boatswain swears that smoke was visible when he got into his boat though the real fire did not come til later when the biftecks got aboard her but he did see to his men his wounded so to punish him severely would degrade the morale of our matelots did a popular and caring officer get guillotined for placing their safety as paramount but he should have fired her at once even leaving his wounded to burn with her msieur hainaut queried aghast at the obvious conclusion and posing his question most carefully certainement choundas callously snapped such sentiment is bourgeois twaddle left over from the old regime hainaut hardly suitable to a commited son of the revolution and the republic one cannot make the omelette without breaking the eggs n estce pas or as the great american revolutionary jefferson said the tree of revolution must now and then be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants well lieutenant recamier will have plenty of time to think on his error and repent of it msieur hainaut snidely tittered a year at least before we employ him again choundas mused yawning loudly and widely unable to cover his mouth unless the need for officers at sea forces my hand say six months if you wish to really rub his lesson in msieur hainaut posed carefully daring to advance his own career you could even send me to sea before him in the next suitable prize a fast american schooner perhaps perhaps so hainaut perhaps so choundas seemed to promise before another gargantuan yawn overtook him it is late the guards are posted the doors and windows locked for the night bon garcon light me to my chamber he barked at the older chief servant good night msieur hainaut bade him sleep well in your new bed your first night in your grand new house thank you jules i believe i will choundas said over his shoulder as he shrugged the right side of his ornate coat off letting it fall down to his left wrist with the servant fretting about him hainaut turned to ascend the stairs to his own lofty chambers but had only taken a step or two when he heard de gougne scuttle across the foyer from his miserable quarters to le maitres in evident haste and concern so hainaut halted and leaned far out hoping to overhear what seemed so urgent to the little mouse what made him so fearful proteus camperduin the orangespruit frigate in the gazette and marine chronicle mumblemumble humum putain he heard choundas bellow mon cul ce salaud de lewrie that bastard that son of a whore is out here his superior screamed instantly so enraged that anyone who crossed him would die as sure as fate the stout walkingstick swished the air something expensive and frangible shattered several breakable somethings ohoh hainaut cravenly thought his bete noire that bane of his very life the author of his wounds and disfigurements was nearby merde alors putain that shit that cunt this time ill kill him this time lewrie hainaut thought not daring to breathe or draw attention to himself that might make him a target now recamiers bane and mine too he captured me once more things went smash the garcon chef yelped in sudden pain then stumbled out of the bedchamber into the office as if physically hurled immediately followed by the little mouse de gougne who was guarding his head with the sheaf of papers his face terrorpale suddenly the idea of getting a small ship of his own to command seemed a trifle less attractive hainaut thought quietly tiptoeing up the stairs for safety better would be to go as a lieutenant aboard a much larger man o war capitaine desplans frigate say with so many large guns and such stout sides under an experienced older captain whod know how to deal with such a clever scourge book one di talem terris avertite pestem nec visu facilis nec dicta adfabilis ulli ye god take such a pest away from earth in aspect foreboding in speech to be accosted by none aeneid book iii publius vergilius maro chapter one sah a voice intruded on his dreams interrupting a matter of great import the fate of the ship of england something that at that instant was but seconds from its penultimate deciding for good or ill sah time twake sah grr ack the dreamer exclaimed which could have stood for ease your helm or all hands to the bracesto him anyway as the deck rocked and shuddered alarmingly whazzuh he queried be almos four o de mornin sah coxswain andrews insisted using his weight upon a knee to jounce the soft civilian mattress a hand was pent in indecision above the hero as he pondered laying hands on a gentleman or dashing a ladle of cool water from the laving bowl on his head then run and blame it on a houseservant but captain alan lewrie rn commanding officer of hms proteus fifth rate frigate managed in reply heavily smacking his lips and creaking one eye open to peruse the ceiling one which he did not in any wise recognise too many damn cherubs and such gmornin sah andrews said aarrr lewrie commented it had been such a vivid dream one which might have been mere seconds from revealing or concluding or fulfilling something whatever it had been it had left him with a cockstand worthy of a marlingspike time is it aye sah andrews replied stepping away from the bed dey be coffee belowstairs black an hot capm mistah cashman hes up already an is coachmans gettin de quipage hitched right then lewrie said with a sigh and a yawn chiding himself for sharing that third bottle of wine with his host kit after supper he should have known better should have kept a soberer head and damn that ceiling lewrie thought scowling as he sat up in bed eros and arrows baretitted shepherd girls and clouds thought i was gone over to heaven for a second or two he flung back the single sheet that covered him swung his legs out to plant his bare feet on the naked wood floor swayed a bit as the last of the wine fumes rose with him and belched bloody hell he gravelled massaging his eyes with the heels of his palms why cant people shoot each other at reasonable hours is it light yet andrews just a tad o false dawn sah andrews said from the bureau where he was brushing lewries dress coat sure enough the scene in the tall french doors leading to the upper balcony was nightdark with only a hint of darker trees swaying against skies just barely brushed with grey touch o fogr mist too sah andrews said frowning ummph lewrie commented bracing his hands on the bed to get himself upright with one eye still shut and the other squinted he shambled to the washhand stand and laving bowl to the ewer full of cool wellwater coz god was he thirsty mind dose andrews cautioned too late oww shitfire mmmm dammit t hell hed stubbed his toes on a dark leather chest just one of many in the room as kit cashman packed up his household for his removal from jamaica in the next few weeks two tumblers of water a quick slosh and scrub on his face and neck a cursory spongedown against the humid cool of a tropic morning and he was primed to part the flaps of his thin cotton underdrawers for a long tinkle into the nightjar feeling some more human at last he sat on a spindly sidechair to don his white silk hose and bind them behind his knees pull on a fresh pair of light sailcloth breeches and slip into his newblacked hessian boots andrews stood by patiently offering him a clean silk shirt with a moderately ruffled breast inset and cuffs helped him bind on his neckstock then held out a cotton waistcoat so he could slip into it his slim sword baldric looped atop that from right shoulder to left hip with a gleaming oval brass breastplate at the centre of his chest then came the kerseymere wool coat the fulldress version with the giltlace buttonholes buttons and pocket detailings and the single fringed gold epaulet of a captain of less than three years seniority that rode on his right shoulder lewrie turned to the mirror above the washhand stand to drag both hands through his hair to welsh comb it with his fingers back above his ears on the sides where thick and slightly wiry hair of midbrown almost lightbrown and further gilt by harsh sunlight off seas innumerable by then curled over ears and temples almost like the bust of a longgone roman gathered in a fashionable swirl low on his forehead andrew plucked at his collar to tug his short spriggish queue of hair to lie outside the tallcollared coat and fiddled with the narrow band and bow of black silk which bound it lewrie had shaved the morning before so that wouldnt delay him he rubbed his stubble adjudging his phyz firm skin a lean face a longpassage sailors permanent tan the upright puckered line of a swordcut on his left cheek from a foolish duel of his own long ago permanent squintlines round his eyes now though merrylookin frown lines or grin lines at the corners of his mouth and eyes of startling colour light grey or blue by temper they looked a trifle grey this bloody premorning and a touch of bleary and redshot too he speculated but altogether not a bad phyz yah hat sah andrews said handing him the best one from a thin wooden box gilt cords and tassels just so cockade and the dogvane loop and button gleaming the gold lacing round the edges bright and butteryyellow instead of verdigrised by seaair like his oldest one well then coffee didje say blam from the lower porch the front veranda a pistol firing as loud and terrierbarksharp as a fourpounder making them both jump bloody man lewrie snapped reclaiming his calm what need of more practice went through a pound o powder yesterday and last night tell cook ill want some toast and jam with my coffee too aye sah andrews replied as lewrie strode to the door with at least the outward appearance of firmminded purpose and sober control of himself at least he avoided the various boxes and chests blam thatd be de lef hand i reckon andrews muttered morning nimrod lewrie bade his host standing bareheaded by a whitewashed column on the veranda balancing cup and saucer and savouring his second refill of coffee heavily laced with localmade brown sugar and thick cream freshstripped from the teat the smell of burned gunpowder lay heavy on the air and a small cumulus cloud of nitres and exploded sulfurs mingled with the predawn fog ah good morning alan me old lieutenantcolonel christopher cashman answered right gaily for such an ungodly hour turning to face him as his manservant quickly reloaded the pair of duelling pistols a scarecrow figure of straw stuffed into white nankeen sloptrousers and loose shirt already holed with long practice stood beyond the shellandsand drive the requisite fifteen paces from cashmans line in the sand and the rickety folding fieldtable that bore his arsenal sleep well lewrie enquired as he lifted a thick slice of hot toasted bread slathered with fresh butter and mango jam to his lips as peaceful and as undisturbed as a babe cashman boasted with a chuckle and a wide grin and lewrie had to admit that he seemed in fine fettle cleareyed and tailsup with gleeful anticipation not dread of facing another mans levelled pistol not an hour hence not nimrod though thats huntin nay rather i fancy meself an achilles this mornin ready to slay my hector and be done he was dressed for it of a certainty with the care and forethought required of a man whod shortly blaze silk shirts were de rigueur more easily drawn in whole patches from bullet wounds kit wore white cotton breeches freshly boiled in lye soap thoroughly rinsed in clean wellwater and airdried on a line strung on the upper balcony above the miasmas and smuts of the daily traffic to the house and the risk of tropical infusions that came from damp soils tall blackandbrowntopped riding boots completed his ensemble thickuns almost proof against a stray ball or a snakebite too and im lewrie asked with a small approving laugh never the greatest of greek scholars my ulysses alan ever the crafty bastard haha didnt he make off with most of the loot in the end lewrie wondered aloud lost it all by shipwreck then went home to his wife at the last cashman said picking up a newly loaded pistol and taking his stance sideon to the target to present the slimmest right profile to a return ball pistol cocked and his forearm vertical the long barrel in perfect alignment with his forearm mortally intent bloody bastard lewrie cringed just had tremind me o bein on the outs with the wife back home he rather doubted that caroline was pining away and spinning wool as faithfully as penelope was it not that caroline a paragon of virtue to his crowcock corinthian nature would ever cuckold him would she down went the right arm hinging like a heavy gate beam and the pistol and forearm were as straight and steady as a sword blade and bang another calibre lead ball plumbed the red wool valentines heart pinned to the straw man now almost punched or clipped into the form of a manylayered cockade or a rose blossom steady is it theres a wonder after last night alan said thinking that even one as cocksure as cashman could use a little encouraging toadying that hour of the morning three shared bottles and a brandy nightcap mere piffle cashman scoffed nought tfuddle a soldiers constitution though you look a tad foxed still thought sailors could hold their wine bgod game enough fort i trust oh ill toe up proper kit no worries lewrie answered an angry second from a harsher retort cashman was not the same man hed been over supper today he had his battleface on and friendship or anothers feelings could be gotohell he had a foe to kill and consideration had little to do with it now did he survive and succeed hed be puffed full of relief and joy and breakfast would be a nighhysterically blissful explosion of highcockalorum but that was for later lewrie polished off his toast and took a sip of his coffee as cashman snatched up the second pistol of a sudden back to the target pistol and forearm vertical again but close to his chest to quickly spin on the balls of his feet take stance and fire another cloud of gunsmoke wreathed him but he was smiling his snapshot had hit awake enough now are ye cashman snapped lets be about it then here comes the coach and god help ledyard beauman chapter two cashmans feud his almost corsican vendetta versus excolonel ledyard beauman had been going on for months lewrie sourly thought as the coachandfour jounced and rumbled over the irregularities in the sandandshell road with both pairs of pistols in boxes in his lap he sat facing aft while cashman took the rear seat facing forward arms folded across his chest chin down and his face made of ruddy granite centred on the rear bench with no need of support from the coachs padded sides or window sills lewrie was crammed into the foreleft corner more than willing to wilt against leather and an open window sill not a word had passed between them in the quarterhour since theyd entered the coach end o my relations with the beaumans root an branch lewrie told himself in the uncomfortable silence and by god but theyre rich and influential shouldve begged off but a friends a friend a promise is a promise odds were kit would blast ledyard beaumans heart clean out of his chest drop him like a poleaxed heifer for veal and the beaumans would blame him damn em for agreeing to be cashmans second whichever way it went the father was retired back in england the sort of huntin shootin tenantwhippin croptramplin fool of the squirearchy but with so much money to sling around he appeared so much more civilised when he sat on his coinpurse and surely was more than welcome round whitehall the admiralty board of trade the court and parliament with half a dozen bought members from his own rotten boroughs to do his bidding in commons mayhap even a skint peer dependent upon his largesse to look out for his interests in lords too one letter from his son hugh now in charge of their plantings and enterprises here in jamaica and they could ruin him not that he stood in particularly good odour already for all his successes at sea the longer the war against revolutionary france and her unlikely ally spain continued the more priggish people were getting he had noticed smallish peccadilloes and indiscretions so easily dismissed back in the s and s were now nearly the stuff of scandal lewrie blamed the wesley brothers the hannah moores and the william wilberforces and all their gooseeyed slackjawed tribe for meddling sermonising reformers for mucking things up with all their shaltnots and viewing with alarm their evangelising their revivalising why did they keep their masscrowd preaching up not only would foxhunting and steeplechasing go by the board thered be an end to bearbaiting dog or cockfighting boys beating the bounds every spring morris dancing and cricket too and fucking and adultery would be rightout of course it was a mortal pity here he was a true blue heart of oak a bold sea officer of the crown and just because hed kept a courtesan for a year or so had an affair with a young widow whod produced him a child on the wrong side of the blanket even the two medals tinkling together on his chest for saint vincent and camperdown meant nothing without a career without a commission or ship hed be back in england permanently on halfpay and facing a hostile wife a clutch of estranged children a toofond amour with a bastard so blissful shed cry their love from the rooftops and another beauman his old love lucy more than ready to spite him and spread every sort of malicious rumour in the better reaches of english society from lands end to john o groats if only ledyardd had a bit o brains in his head lewrie sadly contemplated but no he hadnt his older brother hugh had funded a local regiment of volunteers had urged their swaggerinhandsome and capable neighbour christopher cashman the distinguished exsoldier to take charge and mould it into a creditable unit with that jinglebrained neerdowell indolent fop ledyard taking the honourific office with no real responsibility as colonel of the regiment all he had to do was show up once a month on mess night be fawned over by the locally raised officers much like himidle second or third planters sons and what harm couldve come from that so utterly useless surely he could soldier for a spell or pretend to but ledyard had gotten it in his head that any damn fool with booklearnin could be a military genius washington gage and green for examples in the recent past inspired him accounts of caesars gallic wars of hannibal and lake trasimeno scipio africanus whod crushed hannibal and carthage marlborough even that puritan bastard cromwell had quite turned his noggin so when the regiment had sailed to saint domingue to fight those exslave armies of toussaint louverture another selfeducated general ledyard had taken command in the smoke and confusion of their first battle near portauprince hed gotten a third of his men murdered or wounded or captured by those bloodthirsty rebel slaves whose battle song was kill all the whites or something nearlike it had caused a general panic and rout of half the army then had dashed off atop his blooded stallion with his cronies and toadies croaking in his wake and had left poor cashman to clean up the mess and naturally it was not a bit of his fault but cashmans panic or misunderstanding of orders cashman had been ready to sell up anyway and leave jamaica for someplace new in the united states of america change from being landed to a new career one which didnt require slaves for he was heartsick of the institution a successful last campaign season and he couldve resigned his commission perhaps even sold it to an aspiring major though colonelcies werent bought or sold in the regular army jamaica was another kettle of fish and a rancid one at that where sharp practice was more easily tolerated or ignored now though smeared in the local newspapers by rumour and the sneers of the richer his repute and his property werent worth half a crown to the pound and no matter how the duel ended hed be forced to slink off with but a pittance of his massive investment the fruits of his adult life as a soldier and looter and speculator barely enough for a fresh start and then only did he think small not overreach oh yes ledyard and all the beaumans had a lot to answer for a little hearts blood would pay for all the coach turned off the coast road and skreaked steeply downhill for a space the wood brakeshoes ready to begin smoking as they made for the agreedupon stretch of lowtide beach where the footing would be firm with a last thudding toss and clatter that came nigh to hurling them into each other the coach gained the flatter ground of the strand and the wheels hissed like hungry dragons over sandier grit and thin soil the clopping of hooves subdued to the rushing and faint waterdrumming of a ship underway hmmm lewrie commented taking off his large cocked hat to stick out his head for a looksee hed have said something inane and redundant such as were here had it not been for the razory glints in cashmans eyes for disturbing his deep silent contemplations for a hapenny lewrie realised kit would have bitten his head off hope ledyards been shriven lewrie said instead twisting on a wry lopsided grin whatever it is the vicars do for the halfdead cashman enveloped by a silklined cape merely nodded though there was a hint of amusement to the set of his mouth the coach body rocked on its thick leather suspension straps and the horses blew and shook their heads as andrews and the old black manservant that cashman had brought along sprang down to open the door for them lewrie went out first the two boxes of pistols awkward under his left arm the expensive wood cases chafing on the hilt of his hanger he donned his hat took a deep breath and looked about their killing ground there was very little wind just the mildest little zephyrs off the sea the last afterthought of the steady nightwinds not enough to stir the thin mists in the forest above the beach and the coast road the tendrils of fog that slunk stealthily through the lower scrub of the beach the manchineel trees and seagrapes the withering saplings and wire grasses the low runners that snaked across the sands down the beach a little to the eastrd stood a pair of coachandfours a table set up closer to the proper seawashed beach sands and a party of caped men who stood waiting for him some smoked clay pipes or the spanishstyle cigarillos that were coming into vogue and he could see the faint gleam of coinsilver flasks as they were tipped up for a sip the sheen of larger silver or crystal wineglasses as men drank to kill boredom dread impatience or terror as lewrie began to plod towards them through the deep drysucking coarser sand of the beach above the hightide line and the overwash barrow behind it the men in the other party left their coaches and strode out toward that table so he shorttacked to intercept them the heels of his hessian boots sinking in his ankles quickly beginning to ache from the unnatural enforced gait where toes stayed elevated and rarely had any purchase where even roughseasoned soles clumsily skidded and slipped there were two coaches and at least three saddle horses back of the beach making lewrie frown a little as he turned his head for a cursory look one ornate and its doors emblazoned with a fanciful escutcheon the beaumans didnt exactly merit the second coach was plainer well worn and a touch seedy its team of four mismatched and the typical runtish slabshanked beasts found in the colonies lewrie deemed that one the surgeons the saddle horses though there was an agreedupon limit to how many gentlemen were allowed as witnesses participants and seconds were they cheating he would not put it past them and looked more closely at the trees where some sharpshooter might be lurking ah captain lewrie the older gentleman a mr hendricks and a wellrespected squire planter and magistrate called out of a sudden as if to draw his attention to the immediate field which made lewrie even more suspicious as his second lewrie literally held cashmans honour and safety in his hands not merely the pettifogging details of wellestablished custom usage and punctilio mister hendricks good morning sir lewrie replied halting short of the inviting tabletables he took note there were four in all three in one row well separated from one another with the one in the centre draped in white cloth and agleam with a surgeons field kit of instruments the vials powders and such with which to save the life of the loser the farthest table bore two cases of pistols two pairs of longbarreled death their tableso farwas bare you know mister trollope the surgeon sir lewrie intoned doffing his hat captain sellers of course colonel beaumans second captain sellers captain lewrie that weedy worthy answered with the merest tilt of his head and a hand that just approached his own cocked hat in a returning salute his tone icy and toplofty looking down his nose kin o the dead man o course lewrie told himself spose he has cause tlook gloomy knowin his cousins about tget knackered geratt the surgeons assistant hendricks went on waving an arm in the general direction of a mousy little fussbudget with his hands held rodentlike in the middle of his chest and mister hugh beauman sir lewrie solemnly said in greeting with a faint bow and another doff of his hat he was surprised that the elder brother gave him a doff and bow of equal courtesy since he looked as if he had breakfasted on glass splinters and was trying to pass them without a roar of agony his grimace was worthy of a hanged spaniel your principal colonel cashman is come sir mr hendricks softly enquired sounding the opening bars of the dance of honour he has sir lewrie formally intoned casting his eyes to the slim fop captain sellers and yours captain sellers lewrie asked rather politely he thought but sellers still clad in his full regimentals despite the fact that the th west indies had been mustered out a month before took umbrage and looked even farther down his nose damn you he has sir sellers shot back the colonel is more than ready tut now captain sellers hendricks mournfully chid him with a grimace of distaste decorum hmm aye lewrie could not help tacking on to nettle the little bantam cock his eyes gone wintry steelgrey despite the feral grin on his face someones about tdie the next few minutes twas blaze til death or severe wounding dye recall sir and do you prefer the pretence of still holding active commission mind that i outrank you and tread wary sir now see here sellers spluttered one hand upon the hilt of his smallswordhis left lewrie took note with a smirk of derision not the right with which to draw it and do anything gentlemen please mr hendricks objected meekly scandalised by their behaviour damn yer eyes lewrie hugh beauman barked in a husky basso impertinent swaggerin dammeboy tcha it must have been born in the blood that all the beauman men chopped their thoughts into the pithiest shards of sentences that stood in the stead of another mans entire full minute of prosing mister beauman please hendricks insisted recalling his own dignities in jamaican society the both of you sirs for shame my pardons sir but captain sellers rowed me beyond all temperance lewrie was first to apologise doffing his hat again i do not yet feel need to demand his apology or satisfaction for such a slight upon the field on honour you have my abject apology sir think thatun over toady lewrie smugly thought bestowing his best beatific smile on hendricks his number one shiteatin grin on sellers you wish it well make this like a double weddin two for the price of one hendricks rounded slowly on capt sellers who could do nothing but flummox redden fidget and bob his head as he mumbled like sentiments over his error the occasion for two gentlemen to meet upon the field of honour is a sad regrettable yet solemn uhm occasion mr hendricks gloomily intoned and there is no place for christ on a crutch he makes it sound like a wedding preamble lewrie thought lowering his head and biting the lining of his cheeks to keep from snickering despite all solemnity does anyone object t these two lunaticks blowin their guts out speak now or forever hold yer peace gawd i charge you now sirs is there not another course of action by which the parties may obtain satisfaction without the useless effusion of blood hendricks almost chanted sounding more like a judge or priest than a referee even at this last moment can we not walk away after shaking hands and forgive all enmities captain lewrie i regret that there is not mister hendricks lewrie replied my principal is adamant that both public and private slurs against his character and military prowess his pride and his honour have no other recourse the hurt inflicted is too grievous captain sellers mister beauman as his brother the colonel stands by his account of his actions on saint domingue sir and is in no wise responsible for the characterisations in the papers nor the rumours in society but holds steadfast to his opinion of his former subordinates behaviour as the truth of the matter therefore he cannot and will not retreat from his position without a grievous loss of his own honour and credence capt sellers recited his speech all but written on his coat cuff lewrie suspected and rehearsed all the previous day and in the coach on the way here well somebodys doomed then lewrie glumly thought neither man could demur without suffering the ultimate penalties the label of coward or poltroon would be the worst with liar and weasel coming in strong seconds did ledyard beauman withdraw hed not only become a pariah in jamaica and the entire caribbean but in england as well did he scurry there to hide his shame his supposedly accurate account of the ths role outside portauprince would be exposed as the total fabrication it was and the entire beauman clan would become a laughingstock mister beauman hendricks pressed in a nearwhisper stands by it hugh beauman nighgrowled stonefaced tis too late now duel it is be about it hey damn my eyes but the bastards good as slain his brother for his own damn pride lewrie gawped to himself twas hugh who made him soldier knowin hed be hopeless having failed to reconcile the gentlemen we must proceed mr hendricks ceremoniously announced like a romish priest who the weekly notices over reverts to latin for the daily offices of the mass the agreement is for the exchange of fire from pistols at fifteen paces the principals to continue firing until such time as one or both are mortally struck or incapable of continuing those are still the conditions sirs he asked sellers and lewrie peering at each in turn it is sir both seconds intoned almost as one putting alan in mind of divine services againthe lord be with you from the vicar the congregants responding and also with you each party supplies two brace of weapons i have seen captain sellerss captain lewrie dye have colonel cashmans then please be so good as to place them on yon table and open the boxes so that i and my assistant and captain sellers may inspect them after which you will be free to inspect those brought by colonel ledyard beauman very good sir lewrie replied walking back to the bare and rickety table indicated at the south end of the beach they had chosen this cove and beach for its privacy as well as the fact that it lay nearly sousouwest to nornoreast so the rising sun would not be in either partys eyes he opened the boxes to display the pistols and their accoutrements the lidded pocket full of spare flints the wire ventpricks in their own depression the brass rammers slotted in velvet the bright powder flasks in their snugly sculpted holes and five newcast lead balls for each weapon in troughs gleaming prettily like spare rings in a ladys jewelry case mr hendricks was a good judge of weapons perhaps from a long experience with the code duello and the arguments of his neighbours he pricked the vents with the wires to determine that a doublecharge was not already loaded let the rammers drop down the barrels to coax a clean and empty ring from each pistol checking closely for any hidden riflingsmoothbores only thankee no cheatingthen watched warily as lewrie charged all four with powder added ball and wadding flipped open the raspy frizzens to prime the pans then shut them and left them uncocked the hammers touched only to adjudge how snugly their flints and leathers were screwed down in the dogsjaws discriminatin taste in arms the both of them mr hendricks commented as they repeated the process at beaumans table the best mantons or twiggs and these philadelphiamade beauties he exulted over a pair of teninch barreled silverchased and goldleafedcalibre pistols with glossy burledwalnut furniture though i note that colonel cashman favours the heavier mantons of sixtythree calibre ahem i think were done let us now repair to my neutral table thatun yonder before the others and complete our preparations gentlemen i have the coin he produced a large spanish silver pieceofeight showed them the reverse and obverse the head and the tail and poised it upon the nail of his right thumb first for the south position choose captain sellers uhmm heads sellers blurted after a brief hesitation and tails it is captain lewrie your principal will be posted on the south end of the beach and yours captain sellers will hold the north end of the touch line mmmph sellers grunted not greatly disappointed at that hour there was no superiority to either position the sun would not interfere nor would the land breeze when it sprang up be strong enough to deviate a bullets trajectory the first brace of pistols to be used hendricks continued in a solemn drone heads for colonel cashmans tails will be for colonel beaumans captain lewrie heads lewrie decided quickly and heads it is please be so good as to fetch the initial pair to this table captain lewrie captain sellers oblige as well by bringing forth your choice of pistols should a second exchange be necessary lewrie was partial to mantons as was christopher cashman so he brought over the box containing the inch barreled mantons first as sellers returned with a box containing the silverchased philadelphia duellers all that remains then gentlemen is to announce to your principals that barring a lastminute reconciliation the field is ready for their appearances hendricks concluded lewrie bowed himself away and strode back through the deep sand to the waiting coach all his senses as tautly alert and alive as if it were he who would blaze savouring the dawn as if it were his last false dawn had become a grey but promising predawn the colours of beach forests and the sea turning more vibrant the inshore waters were turning topaz the deeps beyond shading off to a bluegrey barely stirring at slack water of the tide at the death of the night breezes and the noreast trades tan upper beach littered with desperate growth the crown and overwash barrow bearded with tall reeds that faintly swayed to what little breeze sprang up in fitful puffs the greyed shelllitter near the crowns sloughing downward to the hardpan as if smoothed by some titanic sculptors hands to the last wide taupe and greyedwet sands where a grown mans boots could barely leave an impression sand the wet the cool but muggy tidal marsh aroma the crisp tang of crystalled salt the kelp and iodine and bloodcopper odours off the wider open sea assailed his nose wakening the memories of a half of his life near or on the sea lovely damn mornin he thought what a damnfool time tdie he leaned into the open coach door no cashman had he deloped kit he softly called walking round the team of horses ready are we cashman gravelled his voice a tad hoarse alls in order youve the south end and your own barkers for the first shots at least lewrie told him as cashman cast aside his cloak at last tossing it to his coachee odd damn reek lewrie thought looking at a scuffedup pile of sand on the far side of the coach tis puke he realised puke and piss pen quill down me throat cashman explained no trouble in emptying the ol bladder though does the hapless bastard get lucky ill not have coffee kill me slowly never do battle on a full stomach dont ye know the death o many a good man victuals ill keep that in mind lewrie somberly told him lewrie looked off to the forests above the beach chilling as he realised that hed been horribly remiss that all the minutiae had made his suspicions quite fly his head two coaches and three horses whod ridden whod coached and was there someone lurking over yonder with a rifled weapon er andrews a word please the manservant too if you will fetch him along lewrie said turning from his principal do you keep a keen weather eye peeled on those trees lad you see some devilment lurkin you sing out hear me i dont trust the beaumans not to mark their cards that sellers bastard most of all ill do it sah andrews vowed scowling intensely and the black manservant to cashman nodded just as assuredly only a tad reassured lewrie caught up with kit who had gone on by himself singlemindedly plodding along through the loose sands head up clad only in shirt and breeches his stock gone and collars undone and his sleaves rolled halfway to his elbows what was that about kit snippishly demanded keepin em occupied and neutral so no one could accuse us of underhanded doings lewrie lied thinking that the best thing he could do for kit at that moment was to keep his mind on his foe without another dread that would keep him looking over his shoulder ummph cashman said with a snort of understanding well there he is lewrie pointed out cringing to say such an inane thing after all ledyard beauman was coming toward them across the deep sands a tad unsteady to their eyes even at that distance he was tricked out in the full regimentals of the old disbanded th as was his cousin captain sellers blackandtan riding boots buff breeches and waistcoat a gaudy cocked hat awash in white egret feathers and gilt lace and the heavily gilded almost burgundyred coat with buff gilt and crimson facings and buttonholes dear god is that a uniform wearin a man lewrie said in a soft amused whisper no alan tis a corpse in fancy dress cashman growled chapter three god help him ledyard beauman had never made an imposing figure in his life lewrie could recall the whippetskinny little shit from or in his midshipman days sporting exaggerated macaroni fashions years after theyd gone out of style back in england right down to the bright silk or satin shoes with tall redpainted heels and gilt buckles paved with diamond chips now even in full martial figminus his hundredguinea smallswordhe more resembled a pathetic footman masquerading in his masters clothes as part of the mummers crews on christmas eve when times turn topsyturvy twixt servants and masters but without the innate authority or wit to play the lord of misrule mr hendricks summoned principals and seconds to him just by the last edge of the upper beach gentlemen i feel bound by christian duty to appeal to you one last time are you so determined so prejudiced against conciliation that no plea no logic might move you from your intent the dignified older fellow implored i am determined sir christopher cashman quickly answered in a cold brusque manner i too am ready sir ledyard beauman said though in a voice more fluttery and fainter his eyes were red and puffy as if he had suffered a tormented sleepless night and they shimmered and darted like a mouse seeking a bolthole he did not quite shudder he did not chatter his teeth in terror his jaws were clamped much too tight for that and his hands were hidden behind his back near miss d stop his heart lewrie speculated almost feeling a spurt of pity for ledyard who was trying to play up game one boh to a goose d make him fill his breeches surely he must know how good kit is has he ever blamed then it is my sad duty to allow you gentlemen to proceed mr hendricks declaimed colonel beauman your post is to the north and colonel cashman yours is to the south a toeline has been drawn in the sands the coin toss has awarded the first pair of pistols to colonel cashman in a moment or so when both are ready each will take up a pistol from this case strictly keeping it uncocked until commanded you will take up positions either side of the toeline backtoback when i ascertain that you are in all respects prepared i will charge you to cock your locks and you will hold your pistols vertical i will say begin your pace and start a count thusly and one and two and three until i reach the number seven that will represent fourteen paces together with a pace more between you to be determined at the toeline equalling the agreed fifteen paces at the count of seven mind and not a jot before hendricks intoned you may turn and fire at your pleasure i advert to you now sirs the man who turns to fire before the count of seven it will be my and the innocent partys seconds duty to shoot down do you understand me plainly in that regard sirs absolutely sir cashman replied breezily this time as if impatient to get it over with i do sir ledyard agreed with a bob of his head gulping as if just now realising how fatal this was going to be lewrie caught a faint whiff of brandy on the scant wind and it wasnt from the surgeons table on close perusal lewrie could espy a wet stain on ledyard beaumans waistcoat he had obviously partaken of a liberal measure of dutch courage back at his coach poor devil now does the first to fire miss his aim sirs and the second delay his response the first party must stand and receive hendricks further grimly cautioned as is expected of a proper gentleman no worries cashman almost chuckled rather evilly in fact ledyard could but goggle and bob gulping drymouthed do both parties miss on the first exchange you will upon my command immediately turn your backs keeping your fifteen paces separation and wait til your seconds fetch you a fresh pistol which shall be uncocked from those supplied by colonel beauman do you understand captain lewrie captain sellers as soon as both parties are rearmed i will call ready again and a new count of three at three you will be free to cock turn and fire once more after that second exchange assuming neither gentlemen is struck a brief pause in the proceedings will be allowed while fresh pistols will be provided and we shall begin again backtoback at the touchline using the initial procedure is all that clearly understood by all participants understood christopher coolly said ah yes ledyard managed it has been stipulated that this is unfortunately a duel to the death or incapacitation by a severe wound mr hendricks added should one or both of you fall wounded i and surgeon trollope will determine whether the injured party is able to rise and continue this stipulation demanded by colonel cashman shall not admit of any superficial wounding to fulfill his desire for satisfaction barbaric hugh beauman sourly sniffed half to himself then why did your principal agree to it sir mr hendricks countered proceedings shall be halted so the injured party may be examined and queries made to determine whether both principals feel that honour has been satisfied should we continue after a wounding i shall repeat my exposition of the original rules the seconds lewrie perked up and watched capt sellers stiffen with importance before turning his full attention to hendrickss mournful face you will each take up one pistol hendricks instructed sternly you will each take post to my right and left apart from your principals but slightly ahead of me your pistols will remain uncocked until such time as either party commits a shameful act by turning early or attempting to violate the accepted rules of the code duello only then will it be your duty to protect your principal and i assure you that will fire should such a heinous deed occur to mar the honour of the field a second should he commit such a violation will also be shot down understood perfectly sir lewrie said before turning to face sellers and lift a quizzical deriding brow at him sellers reddened again and tossed his head in anger are you both determined then let us be about it sirs do you take positions and we shall begin hendricks ended with a sigh hendricks at the apex of a fatal triangle slightly above the duellists at the top of the slope of hard sand lewrie and sellers two paces lower than the referees their places juggled until hendricks was fussily satisfied beauman and kit either side of that heeldragged furrow in the sand backtoback but not touching about a pace apartalso fussily placed by the demanding hendricks lewrie hoisted his borrowed manton pistol to the vertical his right arm pressed against his chest the firelock safely uncocked and his body turned so that hendricks could see his actions turned to keep an eye on ledyard beauman when he paced up the beach turned to keep one wary eye on sellers too who would be doing the same upon cashman and lewrie as well bye ledyard lewrie snarkily thought seeing the mans ashen look toward his elder brother a silly lopsided grin of dread and farewell write and tell us what hells like lewrie swivelled to see what hugh beauman made of his brothers hapless expression but that worthy was implacable hugh beauman stood far back hands clasped behind his back heaving a great resigned sigh of parting a brief farewell grin creased his granite features he turned back to the principals making a quick prayer for his old friends success and safety that hed shoot straight and true and put a quick end to this and a mercifully quick end of ledyard too a man so foppish petulant and weak couldn t win the world would be a boresome place did kit fall and leave this mortal coil kit had been gazing out to sea savouring perhaps his last precious taste of life but he did turn briefly saw lewries concern and rewarded him with a quick lift of his chin a faint grin and even a wink ready colonel beauman the doughty hendricks called over the mewing of the gulls ready colonel cashman some seabirds glided down near the duellists some flapping in place against the faint wind as if begging for tossed morsels ready cashman cried er yes ledyard beauman managed ready cock your locks begin your pace and one and two kit marched in short parade steps ledyard took childish giant strides as if to turn fifteen paces into a furlong and four and five and six ware lewrie cried as ledyard lost his nerve and turned too early boots skidding on the hard sand and levelling his pistol the shout made kit jerk to a stop flinch and start to turn about and blam ledyard had fired at kit cashmans back damn you lewrie shouted cocking his pistol and bringing it up to aim with a quick plea for permission from mr hendricks shit cashman grunted a pistol ball had struck him twixt his neck and the end of his left shoulder bursting a bloom of scarlet on his white shirt well damme mr hendricks barked his pistol now cocked and ready but unsure of how to proceed shame sir now stand and stand and receive ya bastard cashman roared as he completed his hunching turn and straightened his back hes wounded wait wait ledyard demanded dancing from one foot to the other examine him he has tstop mean tsay wait you must stand and receive first sir the disgusted umpire mr hendricks ordained his voice gone disdainfully formal god above you said no ledyard wheedled as cashman raised his pistol his body turned sidewayson as if beauman still held shot in his locker a practiced instinctive pose he grimly took aim lewrie was dumbstruck and enrapted one couldnt look away from such a shameful cockup ledyards terrordance the mounting horror in his whitened face benumbed him would ledyard drop to beg or simply break and run and kit was taking slow careful aim savouring ledyards fear his teeth bared in the smile of a snarling wolf making him suffer as ledyard was forced to look down that wide fateful bore sellers broke position his left hand clawed under his uniform coat for a hidden pistol sprinting toward ledyard beauman and tossing him the readycocked silverchased barker who gawped at it like a drowning man would stare desperately at an offered ropeend blam the pistol flew toward ledyard who stopped shuffling stretched out to catch it but his shirt billowed at the waist as a ball punched him backwards blood sheeting in an instant eruption driving him down to fall on his rump with his arms still outstretched for the gun like a stiff porcelain doll legs and feet splayed heeldown in a vee captain sellers switched hands flung up his right with his illegal pistol cocked and aimed at kit cashman blamblam as lewrie shot quickly he and hendricks firing at nigh the same time and ledyards cousin jerked and grunted as life was hammered from him to drop lifeless across the lap of his kin hed hoped to save disgusting mr hendricks hissed outraged despicable a gruff cry of pain from behind from hugh beauman to see both slain then a brief silence even from the gulls oh charlie they could clearly hear ledyard beauman weakly say to his cousin giving him a shake or two ye fell down ledyard noticed his own wound at last the gout of blood that stained his breeches and shirt that trickled from his fingertips as he probed the hole in his belly just below his waistband and began to moan fret and pluck at the cloth still numbed damn my eyes sir but never have i witnessed such a craven ungentlemanly doughty hendricks was declaiming as surgeon mister trollope and his assistant rushed to beaumans side to drag away capt sellerss body ledyard at last toppled on his right side his knees drawn up in fetal position whimpering with realisation kit lewrie dropped his pistol where he stood and sprinted to cashmans side as he strode upbeach himself he held his pistol in his right hand that hand pressed to the top of his left shoulder his left arm dangling rigid at his side alan ol son the bloody idiot winged me can ye feature it looksee how bad it is will you theres a good fellow cashman was grinning now a stoic rictus of manful selfcontrol and a bemused puzzlement uhm ragged but clean through yer meat lewrie announced after a long look under the torn shirt where two plumcoloured holes front and back almost made a single bearbite dont think he struck bone but youd best let that trollope fella ascertain that theyre a tad busy at the moment dont ye know but if needs must i could do a fotherin patch over it til theyre free lewrie made it a jape equally manful and dismissive of suffering to perk him up and play up game he offered his pocket flask of brandy i could get your manservant or andrews do a little obeah witchywork make a poultice herbs and fishguts the very idea made cashman dryretch and wobble on his pins a cold sweat popping out on his face as he staggered here son yer lookin peaky sit ye down for a spell and be easy lewrie said helping him down taking his pistol here one of you mister geratt is it he cried for a sawbones the assistant surgeon came running and mr hendricks trundled down to see to him as well your wound is grievous colonel cashman not a bit of it sir cashman shrugged off seconded at once by mr geratts poohpoohing noises and the assurance that no bones were broken as he swabbed probed for cloth and such in the trough of the wound and snipped away the odd ragged edge or two before binding and bandaging him and rigging a sling to immobilise cashmans arm must apologise mister hendricks cashman said making a moue of regret had we known such would occur id have never not your fault sirs hendricks quickly disabused him of all blame mister ledyard beauman in the end was no gentleman nor was his cousin this will redound to no good credit or credence to their cause rest assured that a factual account of this mornings scandalous doins will be known far and wide uhm ive always been partial tdark rum mself when revival is needed you will allow me colonel cashman he said fetching out his own red leather bottle of headysmelling dark rum from which cashman gratefully sucked geratt insisted on a tincture of laudanum be mixed with the rum in a small silver twodram cup god their poor family though hendricks sadly intoned the rum rather a lot of it and the laudanum availed kit most wondrous within minutes he was on his feet again his pain muted and his colour back lewrie andrews and the manservant packed their paraphernalia and began to assist him towards his waiting carriage a last gracious adieu said and conge made to the referees and surgeons for their good offices well damme kit sighed gritting his teeth as they shoved him to a seat on the coachs rear leather bench twas such a good shirt too the most cunning lacework and all that shit was so crosseyed foxed i didnt think he could even hit the ground in one shot much less your shot was a goodun though and hes done for so put it down to blind beginners luck lewrie said tucking the rolled cape and other stuff to either side of him to bolster him from sliding back and forth three four days o hell he has tlook forward to you did good work kit lewries last sight of ledyard beauman a wolfishly satisfied one thankee he was curled up and gasping like a landed fish agony beginning to course outward from his wound with each pulsing beat of his heart the raw fire in his belly stoking hotter and hotter as the numbness that follows wounding wore off belly wounds were fatal and inflicted the sufferings of the damned before the victims departed the mortal coil cashman should have been cackling with glee over his longawaited victory wont be much joy at our breakfast alan sorry cashman said might cry off just go home and you cant and you know it lewrie countered still fussing with the manservants assistance laudanum rum and brandy on your empty stomach a hearty breakfasts the best thing for you and in public where you put on the proper airs else folkll think that hes succeeded at something for once in his miserable life theyd made reservations at a very public tavern in kingston to show off and crow you know the drill modest joy stern duty done sad wonder at his baseness add thatun lewrie babbled the fewer details the better no questions please it was just too egregious make em ask of hendricks and the surgeons hell make em call upon the beaumans if they wish to swoon oer the sordid details will you all quit fussing over me cashman carped squinting at lewrie halfamused and halfrankled to be so cosseted i am nowhere near a piteous dodderer just wanted yer great arse wedged in lewrie complained as he suddenly left off and took his own seat so yer coachee dont rattle ye half tdeath fore we get to the tavern you fool alan cashman said softly reaching out to touch him on his knee had i come close tlosin such a fine friend as you id most like fret a little too he chuckled laughing off such a frank admission between two english gentlemen well there it is then lewrie grumped back immensely glad that he and the world still had kit cashman to make it a vivid place all in he called leaning out the coach window right then lets whip up and go i must own im famished and wait cashman suddenly demanded leaning forward wincing at the effort just for a bit there ye hear it suspension straps creaking as andrews and the manservant took seats by the coachee or at the postillion bench at the rear the stamp and whuffle of the team the jingle of bitts and reins what oh lewrie asked but heard the answer ledyard beaumans pain as they moved him in a litter from the beach to his family coach sounded inordinate surely he was still curled up like a singed worm on his side legs drawn up arms crossed low on his stomach as if cramping from too many green apples ledyard beauman was thinly femininely keening and screaming ah cashman said beaming most happily sleepyeyed from laudanum and liquor but suddenly hugely content damn my eyes but did ya ever hear such a pleasin sound yer whole bleedin life chapter four of course kit cashman couldnt resist the celebration breakfast had been laid on at baltazars the discrete and elegant kingston eatery at tables on the raised section overlooking brickenclosed fountains trellises and herb gardens kits friends former officers of the th who inclined to his cause and wellwishers made it a jolly affair with many toasts made and drunk and champagne cups had sloshed about like so many watering cans might flood those herb gardens and small lawn there was food lewrie was prettywell sure of that but no matter how comestible and welcome by that hour of the morning the victuals were definite alsorans fried eggs tatty hash fletches of bacon and small chops heaps of thicksliced toast and the requisite butter and jams had first been heartily swallowed but had later become more akin to party favours or missiles to be flung or trampled the nighwhite waitress a local who always seemed to serve cashman whenever he and lewrie had dined there was in attendance more as a guest than a servitor half of her time spent lolling in kits lap shrieking and guzzling bussing and petting the hero of the hour with her ornate hair unwinding rather fetchingly more girls of the town most no better than they should be began to turn up as the morning drew on towards am and it looked fair to becoming one of those allday celebrations with baltazars reserved and shut to public custom til next noon fine for kit but he had duties after two last fortifying cups of black coffee drunk standing by the common room bar he reclaimed his sword and hat and departed sure that he wouldnt be missed til teatime if then on the short but a bit unsteady thankee stroll to the dock lewrie and andrews felt the eyes of the town bore into them heard the faint humum of whispered conversation some sounded scandalised but more than half seemed secretly pleased yet too daunted by beauman wealth and influence to cheer them openly however the news had come by fast rider or forest drums the outcome of the duel seemed known as soon as theyd clattered into kingston all this public notice made lewrie check to see if his breeches flap was buttoned more than once as they threaded the last gawping clot of fellow officers merchant captains and crewmen stevedores and servants on the stone quay just in front of the grapes some glaring at him so severely he expected to be called out as he waited for his gig to arrive done for two of em e did lewrie heard one of his oarsmen off his own boat whisper beamingly jubilant and how the devil news of the cockup had reached the ship before he did he had no way of knowing welcome back aboard sir lieutenant adair crisply said his smallsword drawn and held before his face in salute as lewrie climbed aboard hms proteus and took the ondeck crews salute amid a trill of bosuns calls mister adair lewrie said with a brief nod to his third officer now confirmed and possessed of his commission no longer an acting lieutenant putting his mute captains face back on thankee sir dismiss the side party and return the hands to their duties message from the flags come aboard for you sir adair said coughing into his fist oh damn lewrie said wincing at that news he was nowhere near sober enough for official doings did admiral parker abhor duelling or did he loathe affairs of honour turning into cheapside shootouts either way the summons boded ill twas a lieutenant fetched it sir adair informed him worse and worse lewrie thought not a middys errand but drew straws did you lewrie snorted hands in the small of his back diced tsee whod have to tell me uhm seniority sir lt adair mumbled blushing as lewrie twigged to the fact that langlie catterall and adair had all felt the summons was trouble capital t and had all turned queasy for all of their proven courage as commission sea officers it now appeared there were some things thatd make em blanch and you couldnt find little larkin or burns lewrie assumed aloud almost chuckling his newest juniormost midshipmen one a bogirish squires byblow uniformed so poorly it looked as if hed robbed a scarecrow and tother a blinkless drooling lackwit couldnt find em sir adair admitted mostlike theyre still hiding in the cabletiers or furled themselves aloft in the main course goes tprove then that one or both just may be smarter than we give em credit for lewrie replied well give it me then andrews slunk below with his shoregoing bag while lewrie broke the wax seal and unfolded the singlepage note he glanced over toward the palisades the long natural seawall where stood giddy house and the shore residence where admiral parker entertained pass word for my coxn mister adair vast there you men back into the boat lewrie snapped were bound away he stuck the letter into a side pocket of his coat and wishing that he had shaved before the duel that he didn t subtly reek of the winetable at such a pagan hour or that there seemed to be some sticky reddish jam patches some greasy flungchop smuts and some scrambled egg stains on breeches waistcoat and shirt cuffs at the moment the letter stressed his reporting instanter underlined twice with some force so there went a change of clothing or a spongedown shouldve stuck with just throwin bread rolls lewrie sighed to himself as the gigs crew reassembled as andrews reappeared to muster them and damme but dont he look natty took time tscrub the bastard uhm andrews muttered showing his captain the damp towel and tall pewter mug of sudsy water that hed fetched along mebbe on de way ovah sah we could aahh touch ya up a tad i take back everything i just thought about you lewrie said with a grateful smile as the bosuns calls phweeped again to salute his departure leaving andrews in befuddlement as he doffed his hat and scampered back down the manropes and battens to the waiting gig chapter five twas giddy house the old pile that served as administrative headquarters not the stately welcoming and airy admiralty house where admiral sir hyde parker resided that was lewries destination he was escorted to the offices of staff captain sir edward charles was there a pissproud drunken officious prig who despised him more in the caribbean at least lewrie had yet to encounter him he steeled himself for a long rambling and abusive tirade before the double doors swung back to admit him a rap upon those doors and the announcement that he had come at long last drew a hah come roarsir edwards highhanded snip of got ye now ye bastard with an admixture of the enticing coo a starving bridge troll might employ to lure a tasty stray child hat under his arm with the broken dogs vane and eggstained front averted lewrie entered the devils den captain lewrie captain charles growled his bloodshot eyes given youth and clarity by this chance for comeuppance hah sir damme a waiter tip his tray oer ye did he the publicans drinks tray more like disreputable sir most he sneered savouring the word tis a wonder yer shirttails still in how dare disreputable aye another voice chimed in snatching lewries attention to a civilian who stood near the bookcases at the darker end of the spacious offices in a sombre suit of black ditto enlivened by a green satin waistcoat and grinning like a sardonic devil christ just shoot me now lewrie goggled half of a mind to do a bolt not him not another harebrained mister lewrie managed to say unsure whether peel would be under some new alias or was the foreign office spy still sailing under his own colours peel excaptain of household cavalry john no it had been james james peel righthand man to that devious old cutthroat zachariah twigg in the mediterranean several years before you recall me surely captain lewrie peel or whomever said with a taunting smirk over his obvious discomfiture oh indeed sir with fondly remembered shudders of dread lewrie countered with equal banter to his tone though how you wish to be named this time is he concluded with a mystified shrug its still peel captain lewrie peel chuckled coming up to take hands with him it serves as good as any been years has it not sir good to see you again wish i could say the same mister peel lewrie lightly replied but where you and your old master turn up theres no one safe and how is allow me to name to you my new superior captain lewrie peel said deflecting the question and turning them to face the other man who had been lingering near a tall bookcase now burdened with reports and returns rather than books lewrie wondered how he could have missed the peacock the honourable grenville pelham here is our captain alan lewrie in the flesh at last captain lewrie mister grenville pelham ahdedo pelham intoned in a highbred oxonian voice as he allowed his hand to be shaken preferring to be grasped by the fingers not a hearty palmtopalm greeting heard much about you captain much indeed mister pelham sir an honour to make your acquaintance no it ain t but what else can y say lewrie snidely thought the honourable grenville pelham obviously someones promising git was a brisk wee sprout for all his highnosed manner a thoroughbred colt compared to peels sombre suiting though pelham was rigged out in a creamwhite linen coat and breeches cuffs collar and lapels trimmed in dark green satin with a light green waistcoat of nubby silk all sprigged with looping gilt embroidery black shoes and white silk stockings large brass buttons on coat and waistcoat shoe and knee buckles that lewrie suspected were gold not brass and dammit but pelham seemed awfully young to be peels or anyones superior why he couldnt be beyond his midtwenties this dandyprat put lewrie in mind of rear admiral nelson greyhound lean full of nervous energy forever wavering twixt the languid airs of a proper crown official and the titters of an impish university boy pelham wore his own hair fashionably long and wavy but clipped in the back where a gentlemans queue should ride atop his stiff standandfall collar his face was pale and peeling with sunburn his eyes bright and snapping bluethough squinted at the moment as if just a touch leery and darting as if impatient with the social amenities didnt do half of what im reputed sir lewrie said determined to make a decent impression on somebody given the state of his own attire and employing his gruffest gentleman seadog air its all a slander uhm quite pelham said disengaging his fingers as if discomfited though you must admit you are renowned captain good god off on the wrong foot already are we lewrie felt emboldened or enough disgruntled by that tone to remark i assume you spoke with mister twigg before sailing out here then you heard only the naughty bits ahem well pelham commented unsure what to make of that let us begin then thankee captain charles sir edward that is all that we require well not take long i assure you pelham turned to beam false cheer at the man commonly known on the west indies station as the wine cask a hair away from shooing him from his very own office which prompted lewrie to turn about and bestow his own shiteatin grin on that worthy as well ah hmm well o course mister pelham capt charles said flummoxed with much throatclearing and frowning anything for the crown though capt charles grumbled slyly making his complaint known as he snatched up a thick stack of loose papers files and ledger books as if salvaging an inheritanceand gave his wine service a longing famished look perhaps to gauge how much was left in the decanter did they dare partake while he was away with a few more stammers he departed with a bow and an ominous we must discuss things later captain lewrie before the twin doors to his office suite clicked shut behind him pelham did indeed amble over to the desk and pour himself a goodly measure of the white wine after scrounging about for an unused glass in the set of four all of which seemed to have been employed at some time or other since sunrise dear lord hes the taste of a philistine not what id call even a poor vintage has a taste and the finish more like horse liniment the young man snickered may i sir lewrie bade and pelham offered the glass for his tasting lewrie merely sniffed it though and returned it thats navyissue white wine mister pelham we call it miss taylor and a bad vinegar it is too its damn cheap and he can indent for it from the stores house just down the quay by the tengallon cask then lose the chits which all come through him dye see a dirty business lewrie jadedly tsktsked to mr pelham in hopes that he might report the bitter mans peccadilloes and aye navy surgeons can and have used it as a liniment you wish a glass then sir pelham seemed to tease no thankee kindly bit early for me lewrie beamed back really pelham drawled rightly skeptical of that claim in light of lewries dishevelment and his breath gentlemen be seated please he bade instead making free with capt charless furniture and seeming to dither as to whether he himself should sit in authority behind the desk or appear more convivial in one of the club chairs he chose the chair sweeping the long but narrowcut tail of his coat back with an elegant swish as he plopped down and crossed his legs at the knee with his hands in his lap all the go is it lewrie asked tongueincheek to bring the younker down a peg were years behind london fashions out here i havent seen a coat such as yours cut so high to the waist with the tails beginning so far back damme you make me wish the name of your tailor mister pelham or yours captain peel now that they were in private pelham no longer had to pretend to be amused he raised one eyebrow his face stony resting his elbows on the chair arms and steepling his fingers in front of his mouth whilst mr peel coughed into a fist in warning in answer to your earlier question captain lewrie zachariah twigg is now most honourably retired though frequently consulted for his vast knowledge mister twigg was one of my mentors dye see and as soon as i was given this assignment i and captain peel were quick to call on him for background material you will be relieved to know or not given your past relations with that worthy that he keeps well in the main though his constitution will no longer admit to the travail of overseas adventures pelham prosed highnosed from being twitted by a mere sailor we spent the better part of a day and a night in his company and when your presence in the caribbean was revealed to us naturally we discussed your ah attributes and your sense of wit pelham concluded with a sniff well what is the old saying forewarned is forearmed lewrie breezed off unabashed and what was the old farts advice to you dont take any guff off him keep a weathereye peeled for his foolishness was it something very much like that pelham rejoined harumphing mister twigg sends you his warmest regards captain lewrie peel said interjecting to keep their initial interview running smooth and perhaps to allay any rancour believe it or not peel went on with a knowing smirk pardon me sir but thats fiddlers pay lewrie commented mere thanks and wine less the wine and easy for him to say after all the shitten messes he got me into told you all our doings together did he he said returning his attention to pelham the far east and then the mediterranean well heres another platitude for youonce bitten twice shy mister pelham so you will understand why i have my qualms at being dragooned into another neckornothing affair one involving that ogre choundas most especially pelham and peel exchanged glances at that that is why youre here i take it lewrie stated hes in the caribbean im in the caribbean and suddenly here comes a brace o spies from the foreign office just slaverin tput me back in harness to deal with the bastard just one more time he sneered thought i was summoned tbe broken for seconding my friend at his duel which turned to shit by the way what with charles an admiral parker so tight with the planter family we just winnowed but no to my lights its even worse beggin yer pardon o course lewrie said facetiously bowing from the waist in his chair you are demurring from such duty sir pelham charily asked damme you know i cant mister pelham lewrie snapped back you surely hold sealed orders up your sleeve directing me to aid you no matter what i think of it dont you it was not a question yes i do captain lewrie pelham quirkily informed him with a faint superior grin believe me i do understand should you hold any misgivings and he seemed so sincere that lewrie could almost believe him for a moment and yes mister twigg also discovered to me all your past doings and again yes my mentor told me how you react when pushed that since it is beyond your power to demur or be too truculent and insubordinate when handed extraordinary duty beyond your customary brief that your last refuge is an acid and sarcastic wit which wit will seem to border upon insubordination and truculence i was strongly advised to make allowances for when you suffer the odd snit captain lewrie that old bastard twigg knows me too well lewrie thought with a wince mister twigg despite his vast wisdom and his unbroken string of successes pelham drawled fingers steepled once more to feign the sagacity that a man in his position should possess was believe it or not always more sanguine more easygoing than i more accepting of those who would frustrate his efforts or gainsay his directives i believe you will find me to be a fairly tolerant and forgiving fellow captain lewrie but only up to a point and no further threaten me would you lewrie heatedly thought utterly nettled by then you damn puppy it was like being chided by one of his sons perhaps because he had more experience dealing with people not things mister pelham lewrie pointedly drawled back crossing his own legs at the knee and pretending to flick lint from his breeches nor did he no matter his necessity or impatience ever confuse the two good god lewrie thought wincing again did i actually compliment the old cutthroat mine arse on a bandbox now that we know where we stand mr peel tried to mollify quite mister peel lewrie quickly said accepting his offer to move along before he reached over and slapped the wee fool silly youre here im your catspaw youve pressganged me and there it is then you might as well tell it me ahem peel said seizing the initiative so his superior could sit silent and gather his aplomb before speaking too rashly as you may assume mister pelham and i are not to be revealed as crown agents captain lewrie the governorgeneral his excellency the earl of balcarres admiral sir hyde parker and some few of his senior officers are aware of our true identities to the general population were to be known as speculators out from london to make our fortunes mister pelham will pose as the younger son of a wealthy landed family seeking acreage and i will make myself known as the familys advisor from coutts bank a junior partner sent to determine the practicality of the enterprise junior to old mister simon silberberg hmm lewrie chuckled in knowing understanding recalling one of mr twiggs old aliases just so sir peel replied nodding and tipping him a wink and since i also bank with coutts my being seen with you is perfectly innocent i take it mister peel lewrie said grinning exactly sir peel agreed my presence is also uhm to be a voice of reason and temperance upon the impetuous mister pelham serving a second role as a factotum to his familys legitimate worry his governess aye lewrie could not help suggesting with a leer such a frenetic easily aroused young fellow ahem pelham objected to be so characterised despite a role of a lightheaded young wastrel as his agreed alias my how believable lewrie went on cooing it has such a versimilitude quite peel agreed hiding a smile which made lewrie wonder what an experienced agent such as peel himself once a protege under twiggs tutelage thought of being supplanted as the senior man on the mission by a lessexperienced comer with better connexions interest and patronage so whats the plan then lewrie asked deciding they might as well get down to it what part of choundas dye want me to lop off this time dammit thoughthere was another of those guarded looks back and forth twixt pelham and peel this does concern choundas doesnt it lewrie pressed well it is and it does pelham answered with an inscrutable smile though not completely he maddeningly hinted theres bigger fish to fry than him lewrie asked puzzled indeed captain lewrie pelham told him with a condescending little chuckle there still remains the larger matter of winning the french colony of saint domingue for the crown we just lost it lewrie all but yelped in surprise or had you not heard our army beaten evacuated root and branch nothing is ever completely lost captain lewrie pelham said looking down his long aristocratic nose and still wearing a superior grin so long as we remain at war with france the games not ended oh ill allow that the french with this toussaint louverture and his tagragandbobtail slave rabble as their instrument have outscored us the last few innings but barring a sudden declaration of peace the game is still afoot and it is now our turn before the stumps with what lewrie petulantly demanded trying to picture the saint domingue soldiery and pelham on a cricket pitch we sending in another army what may not be gained by force of arms sir the elegant wee pelham chuckled in a conspiratorial whisper may yet be won with the application of guile bribery and diplomacy lewrie had a sudden sinking feeling that this would not be in any way a straightforward propositionand why he had hoped that it would he couldnt imagine he knew in his bones that this time he would really be in for a spell of war on the cheap chapter six looks hellishlost tme lewrie grumbled wishing that capt charless wine was but a tad drinkable he felt badly in need of some to all intents and purposes it does appear so pelham said but appearances can deceive sir we have our sources in france who tell us that the directory in paris and the assembly have their suspicions as to whether saint domingue has been won for france or does louverture have designs of his own which may result in a loss after all there are mercantile forces of great influence who demand saint domingue return to immediate profitability both for their own gain and for the republics they want their lands and their money back even does the trade in cocoa sugar cotton coffee and tobacco go in american hulls once exports are sold in american ports profit is easily exchanged from united states banks to french banks the united states is at war with france lewrie pointed out not officially pelham countered and american merchantmen along with portuguese danish and swedish traders enter the colonys ports daily as captain of a blockading frigate you surely know how impossible it is to stop supposedly neutral trade so long as their cargoes are innocent and no military supplies are discovered granted lewrie moodily agreed a return to profitability though a quick one pelham continued would require a return to the status quo ante on the island that is to say the presence of a french garrison army the dismissal of the exslave armies and this louverture creature being supplanted by a new frenchwhitegovernorgeneral but pelham posed what if louverture doesnt want supplanting hmm what if he owns to dreams of grandeur hes a simple african a former slave at best one generation from the customs of some barbaric kingdom and a crude kingship recalled from his bedtime stories and what worries france is that perhaps liberte egalite et fraternite cannot extend to all not if the plantations must be productive again that would mean the return to human bondage you know of leger sonthonax lewrie a horse showed well at new market lewrie quipped the former governor of saint domingue pelham exclaimed not sure if lewrie was being witty or sublimely uninformed soon as he kicked our forces off louverture finagled to send sonthonax back to france to represent the colony sonthonax is a staunch revolutionary the bloody sort who more than decimated the colonys whites with his guillotines worse than the terror of in france hes a bit of a loose cannon as you sailors might say loves the blacks said in public he wished he was black more than once all that noble savage rot of rousseaus dont ye know then who better to send to paris lewrie assumed aloud laveaux tother ranking frenchman in the colony pelham said he at least is a cultured aristocratic holdover from the old days of the ancien regime and a whole lot cleverer and subtler than leger sonthonax more skilled in faction intrigues just as beloved with louverture were told and leagues more able the question is why did louverture send sonthonax instead of laveaux sonthonax is not in good loaf in paris too fractious a man but deuced lucky in being out of the country when his worst enemies got the chop as he did in the latest instance landing in france just as robespierre went under the guillotine and lost his head pelham snickered robespierre dye say lewrie cried perking up the ogre finally got his hey why thats marvellous news wish we could drink to that lewrie dryly thought but did louverture hope that sonthonax would be eliminated pelham asked the aether and leaned back in his chair staring at the old waterspotted plaster ceiling is laveaux more bendable to his will should he declare total independence or is laveaux less powerful to control events and with sonthonax chopped first would louverture despatch laveaux to face the wrath of the directory next peel chimed in with a sage expression leaving him in sole control no matter pelham said with a disappointed sniff sonthonax survived the latest power shift and is recently returned with fresh orders from the directory but with his power diminished in favour of another so we are informed pelham simply had to leer whos to decide whether louverture has outlived his brief usefulness after he expelled our armies whether his rival general rigaud might be more amenable to frances longterm interests rigaud has created what he calls a mulatto republic in south province round jacmel and jeremie with most of the educated free blacks and educated mulattoes rallied to him hes betrayed louverture more than once changed sides right in the middle of a battle in the brief period both served under the spanish when the dons had designs on the whole island of hispaniola their relations were quite bitter but sir lewrie happily pointed out if only to scotch the superior insiders smirk on pelhams phyz once our troops landed they became tight as ticks our general maitland offered rigaud just about everything but his virgin daughter to change sides but rigaud spurned our every blandishment only so long as we were there mr peel calmly dismissed with a study of his fingernails we evil white devils whod have put em back in chains and slew em by battalions atrocity for atrocity i absolutely refuse to countenance any tales of british atrocities pelham retorted theyre all a pack of lies dreamt up by the directory and stuck in their papers to poison the other powers against us rigaud though now were gone he has no reason to stay true to louverture both are so ambitious theyre sure to fall out then make another bloody war of the skin to determine who rules over what still stands when its ended does louverture win twill be the illiterate and barbaric exslaves oppressing the educated the halfcaste and the remaining whites and reduce saint domingue to the backwardness of the dahomey jungles no no twould be better all round if rigaud came out on top and his morecivilised followers we could deal with rigaud who at least is somewhat sophisticated an educated man schooled in france seen the wider world raised as good as a european by his own white father eats with a knife and fork mr peel interjected feigning an air of wonder which subtle jape went right past pelham but put lewrie to coughing into his fist as you say sir pelham snapped stiffening rigaud can see the commercial realities of reestablishing trade relations with other powers a man who realises whose navy rules the seas a man who sees that any hope of american trade is futile given the vulnerability of yankee merchant ships and the utter weakness of the new united states navy and god knows does either louverture or rigaud hope that the french restore their trade or naval presence theyve another thing coming so you want my help to get to rigaud lewrie surmised in dread of just up and sailing into jacmel like a fart in a trance we offer him whatever it takes to buy him over before the french or the yankees make him a better offer god above we would prefer rigaud to louverture yayss pelham drawled so coolly and casually that it made lewries nape hairs stand on end you wont mind do i not go ashore with you when you dine with either or both lewrie scoffed good god man louverture rigaud christophe or that brute dessalines none of the black generalsd give a tinkers damn for your offers theyd torture you for six days runnin and put your head on a pole the seventh heard their favourite song have you goes ummm eh eh bomba heu heu canga bafio te canga moune de le canga do ki la canga li lewrie gruntchanted pounding the time on the arm of his chair and bobthrusting from the waist mmmm mr peel chuckled catchy it means we swear to kill all the whites and take all their possessions mister pelham lewrie harshly translated let us die if we fail to keep this vow well theyve done for their white owners and a whole british army and theyll do for you if you go there oh rot pelham countered as if jadedly amused just like the terror in france the bulk of the killing is done with laveaux and sonthonax saw to that why louvertures offered amnesty to emigres who came back with our army amnesty and return of their estates to any white planters wholl return to the backcountry and get em running again pay the workers this time of course those who wont lose all claim to their former fortunes sonthonax and laveaux have enough influence and control over the ugly little monkey to place experienced white officers over his black regiments make him see the sense of appointing clever localborn whites in civil government positions guaranteed the safety of any white even children wholl teach reading writing and sums een on the remotest plantations all of whom you hope will turn on him once rigaud announces that hes the bosscock lewrie charily speculated all that was new to him but it didnt signify cause former mastersd never abide a savage exslave regime but they could almost tolerate a moderate and educated pack o halfbreeds who can at least speak some sort o frog dress like them live like them who can eat with a knife and fork yes peel reiterated that is the hope pelham admitted blithely unworried by any mere quibble that once rigaud and louverture fall out as men do sooner or later rigaud will have the troops artillery and support of the prominent leading elements in the colony and civil government appointees swinging his way from what we know of his forces he has excellent prospects of success and pelham related bestowing another of those clever little simpers even he cannot both sidesre locked in a draining war that sooner or later ends in weary stalemate at which time our trade protection and good offices will appear more than welcome gaining us what we seek whether rigaud wins or not slamming the door on american aspirations to extend trade into the colony thence to dominate the entire caribbean peel took up the tale since pelhams cleverness had seemed to exhaust him for the moment retaining and protecting our own stakes in the sugar isles and getting us access to a colony that was wealthier than all ours put together before the war began we must keep a wary eye on the americans captain lewrie else theyll swamp us with their skinflint yankee traders and their wiles and well gradually lose all we own out here god but it was a vaunting scheme and all backalley ambushes and underhanded devilment lewrie studied pelham who was fussing at his neckstock now wilted with perspiration and wondered whether it was his own scheme one that would make his name and career in government or was the preening little popinjay some clever fellows avid apostle mustve looked just inspired back in london lewrie sneered in silence gentlemens club drawing room over port and scads of clean unwrinkled maps gawd was this old twiggs last glorious riposte a guarantee of knighthood even in retirement itd be just like him it has that same freshblood smell well it all sounds promising lewrie said lying damn well and choundas is what going to beat you to it ah choundas pelham exclaimed now revived and rubbing his hands wolfishly we have our sources dont ye know lewrie even in paris the directory and the ministry of marine oh god here we go again lewrie quietly groaned to himself he was despatched to guadeloupe with two missions mr pelham enthusiastically told him the overt one is to organise arm and run privateers and smaller national ships as raiders working for another mulatto victor hugues now promoted to greater responsibility amazin aint it so many coloureds in french service he simpered his second mission is to smuggle arms and supplies into saint domingue land agents and perhaps even speed the export of the money crops pelham said then turned sly again to give his support and aid to he paused as if awaiting applause ill kill him he keeps that up lewrie promised himself to one or tother lewrie finished for him louverture or rigaud whichever looks tbe the winner so france keeps it no matter who gets betrayed erm exactly pelham admitted with a petulant snap of his jaws got it in one captain lewrie now we also know that france has sent out yet another man to keep an eye on louverture laveaux and sonthonax see which way the wind is blowing and determine which of them gets the chop and try on rigaud as a replacement if he gets displeased with louverture so if rigaud looks as if hell go the distance choundas and this new man do the dirty work for us lewrie asked his head cocked over in disbelief mean tsay they back rigaud we let em just get out of their way help choundas along well at the least turn a halfblind eye mr pelham chuckled after a long ponder so long as things go our way that is mine arse on a bandbox lewrie all but yelped i know that guillaume choundas is your particular bete noire captain lewrie pelham dismissively said to soothe him patronisingly and youd like nothing better than to carve him into cutlets but the old monsters played the catspaw for france so whos to say he cant be our catspaw for a bit and all unwitting wouldnt that be delicious oh decimate his privateers should you meet them it goes without saying gather information from the prizes you might take in particular any written directives from choundas himself so we can do a bit of forgery to sow distrust and confusion should the need arise and do you meet up with one of his men o war of course you will be free to engage her and fetch me prisoners to interrogate cant let choundas think hes a completely free hand ha one would hope not sir lewrie gruffly said most unamused youre here hes here you know hes here and we will make sure that he knows of your presence does he not already mr pelham cackled with glee from his schemes youre his nemesis too ye know the temptation to do for you on his part must distract him from the proper discharge of his mission that and your preying upon his toofew ships will blunt whatever aid he can deliver either louverture or rigaud making britain in the end appear the best choice to whoever wins over yonder either one really pelham confessed almost whispering to impart his inside knowledge once again so long as he is dependent upon the crown for his continued peace and prosperity i do believe we might even tolerate an independent abolitionist black republic to gain that end captain lewrie but preferably under rigaud lewrie said sniffing sourly in worldweary amazement at that revelation of course pelham answered shutting his eyes and nodding as if saying ever and amen in his familys pewbox slave or free no matter lewrie pressed a dubious brow up mmm pelham uttered nodding again over steepled hands as if the reenslavement of nearly people was simply a cost of doing business as to that this new man out from paris is just the fellow to stir that pot general hedouville have you heard of him captain lewrie pelham asked expectantly as if preparing to be clever again not in this life no lewrie slowly intoned preparing himself hedouvilles a bloodthirsty butcher pelham was happy to say conquered the royalist enclaves in the vendee region in the early days of their revolution rather brutally a monsieur guillotine and a real terror hell sort things out in quick order mostlike get the colony aboil likely purge citizen sonthonax perhaps even laveaux as well we still have got agents and influence on the island to prompt hedouville to do just that and launch rigaud at louverture if god is just and our slanders take root pelham sniggered hes the new power over yonder is hedouville lewrie looked away towards peel rolling his eyes just about fed up with pelhams how shall we torment the headmaster titterings he found an equally unimpressed ally in peel whose blank attentiveness relaxed enough to curl up his lips in the faintest of weary smiles hedouville is reputed to be blunt direct and quick off the mark peel said once hes made up his mind hes very hard to divert much like a spanish fighting bull beguiled by the cape none too clever really but a force of nature once set in motion the ideal instrument for the directory peel had a clever simper of his own we pour our subtle poisons in his ears and mayhem and disorder will surely follow in short order well you seem to have it all arranged lewrie said surrendering to fate especially when it seemed he had so little choice else my congratulations on a most knacky plan sirs well thankee captain lewrie pelham smirked overcome by the required befitting modesty of an englishman accused of being too clever by half no matter how well it secretly pleased him not all my doing but hopefully peel said rising at last as if the tedious task was outlined well enough for even lewrie to follow it this may make up for the fact that since this war began in weve lost untold millions of pounds and over one hundred thousand men trying to take all the french sugar isles half of em dead and wasted tother half so feverraddled theyre unfit for future service damn em all these tropic pest holes look so beguiling but and pitt and dundas didn t see that goin in lewrie cynically asked himself as he got to his feet as well it aint like the french could hold em if their fleet cant get tsea better wed blockaded em let em rot on the vine so the frogs didnt get hapence o good from em but it didnt appear likely that the prime minister nor the secretary of state for war would have asked him his opinion then or would much care for his chary opinion of them now no they were too damned brilliant too full of themselves just like their wee minion pelham he felt it would be an excruciatingly frustrating adventure orders for me and my ship then sirs lewrie asked as i earlier stated captain lewrie pelham energetically said shooting upright and resetting the cut of his cuffs and waistcoat playing with the lapels of his coat to tug them fashionably snug across his shoulders and the back of his neck raid cruise make a right nuisance of yourself versus choundass ships i have arranged a roving open brief for you with admiral parker so wherever and whenever you and mister peel wish or are led by the evidence you ay discover i am not squeamish as to the means you employ so long as the end is attained pelham coldly stated that sounded promising even was he saddled with peel as supercargo a slab of live lumber who would surely sooner or later try to boss him about as if he were in actual command oh joy lewrie growled in a monotone looking at peel i promise ill be gentle captain sir peel chuckled voice pitched high and virginally singsong drawing lewries wry amusement and choundas lewrie insisted wary of oral instructions from such a man as pelham what of him for now do i just watch stand aloof til we get what we want from his efforts or as mister zachariah twigg once instructed you in the mediterranean i believe it was sir pelham intoned highnosed and for once in deadly earnest you are sir given opportunity no matter how early or late in our plans to kill him dead and put paid to his noxious existence well good god why didnt ye just say so lewrie exclaimed in great relief forced to laugh out loud at such longdelayed end to such a tortuous preamble couldve saved us all the palaver guillaume choundas sir pelham piously declared is still possessed of such demonic cleverness that despite his monstrous soul and his ogreish appearance he was not sent out here by his masters as an exile mister twigg and captain peel both have stressed just how dangerous he remains mostlike does he fail out here thats an end to his usefulness to them but we cannot take the risk of him popping up somewhere else in future his head on a platter might mean a knighthood to the one who fetches it as salome was rewarded when she brought king herod the head of john the baptist blieve shes the one demanded saint johns head after herod saw her dance sir mr peel corrected coughing into his fist quibble quibble quibble pelham groused waving off petty inconsequential facts and laughing at his mistake it dont signify mister peel lewrie gets my meaning indeed i do sir lewrie vowed though irked by pelhams iffy lure and mixed messages as if he needed any further incentives to pursue choundas or was so venal as to fall for such a faithless promise working together again after all this time sir peel said feigning fond reverie making lewrie stifle a lewd comment and a snort of sarcasm theyd gotten on much like mating hedgehogs really testy and spiky what jolly times they were well there you are then pelham concluded pleased that their pairing and their plot was off on a good footing or so he blithely assumed let us not waste a single hour uhm best let me avail myself of that miss taylor after all mister pelham lewrie said changing the subject before he broke out in peels of laughter at just how dense pelham really was that horrid stuff captain lewrie pelham asked aghast lewrie soaked his handkerchief from the decanter and began to sponge his hat i told you the navy finds it useful chapter seven it was pleasant and delightful one midsummers morn when the green fields and the meadows were buried in corn the blackbirds and thrushes sang in every tree and the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day it was a make and mend afternoon following the noon meal for the hands all stores had been laded the aired sails hung windless and slack had been furled and gasketed and an hours smallarms drill had been performed now the crew of hms proteus could caulk or yarn and tend to their own devices tailor their issue clothing shave wash and scrub to be presentable at sunday divisions play board games have an ondecks smoke do carvings or mere whittling whilst they nattered of this and that nap or sing as suited their toobrief freedom the sailor and his true love were out walking one day said the sailor to his true love i am bound far away i am bound for the indies where the loud cannons roar and im going to leave my nancy she s the girl that i adore and im going to leave my nancy and im going to leave my nancy even with the duck awnings rigged over the quarterdeck and the waist it was too warm for chanteys hornpipes or reels so the hands sang a sad forebitter with both fiddlers a boy on the tin whistle and liam desmond droning under them with his uilleann pipes desmond was a cosmopolitan sort for an irishman hed play the english tunes as readily as any from his own sad island and pleasant and delightful was as teary a ballad of love and loss and long partings as anyone could wish for he was equally open to allan ramseys version of auld lang syne roared along with hey johnny cope to sneer at an english general whod run from bonnie prince charlie back in with the few scots aboard turn up a weepy lugubrious version of some welsh dirge or wheeze out gay hornpipes with equal ease he was a treasure lewrie gratefully stripped out of his formal shoregoing togs completely pulled out those offending shirttails and rolled up his sleeves above the elbows with his neckstock discarded and the front of his shirt undone he called for a mug of cool tea from his steward aspinall who brewed it by the halfgallon each dawn on the griddle in the galley weak admittedly given the cost of good leaves with lots of sugar which in the sugar isles was nigh dirtcheap and a generous admixture of the rob of several lemons also available for next to nothing let stand to cool before jugging it made a fine thirstquencher though lewrie did suspect that once jugged in his large pewter pitcher his midmorning libations might be part of the brew from the previous afternoons there were some days such as today when that decoction could almost stand on its hind legs and toddle mister padgett sorted yer paperwork sir aspinall told him and theres letters too off that packet brig come in yesterday ah excellent lewrie enthused rubbing his hands with false gusto at those tidings for the last year no letters from home were good news and damme but wasnt there a tidy pile of them though all thick and thumbstained the outer sheets whereupon the addresses were enscribed the stamps affixed and the wax seals poured were now sepiaed with handling and sea transportation no his official correspondence always took precedence it was safer that way the personal could abide for a piece more after the long passage that fetched them whatever new disaster insult or calumny they contained were at least five or six weeks old and any reply to them would take even longer no matter how screaminducing said the sailor to his true love well i must be on my way for the topsls they are hoisted and the anchors aweigh our warship stands waiting for the next flowing tide but if evver i return again i would make you my bride but if ever i return again but if ever i return again in good voice tday sir aspinall commented did they choose something cheerful lewrie grumbled i spose so he had to admit though that the chorus of rough seamens voices did have a morepleasing harmony than usual detecting the shyly hesitantly offered basses and near falsettos from his liberated exslave sailors the tunes and words were new to them almost alien and their command of the kings english marginal yet his black sailors had an uncanny ear for harmony even their unaccompanied work songs he heard when riding past cane fields ashore had been spoton whatever tune it was theyd sung sometimes hauntingly so mister motte the quartermaster you can hear him there doin the solo part sir aspinall went on he says it come from the s it did when our navy invaded cuba in the seven years war umhmm lewrie said with a nod over his paperwork a tad irked and peering owlishly at aspinalls interrupting maunderings aspinall took the cue and ambled back into his daypantry with a damp dishclout in his hands there to sing along under his breath just loud enough to make lewrie twitch his lips and furl his brows damn his hobbies lewrie gravelled to himself first twas rope work and sennet now then a ring from off her finger she instantlye drew saying hake this dearest william and my heart will go too bloody hell lewrie muttered aspinall he called sir a small chastened voice that its make and mend do you wish tjoin the hands up forrud and sing tis your right ill have no need of you for a while er thankee sir and id admire it aspinall cried hastening out of his pantry and his apron to dash forward to the door that led to the main deck an everpresent notebook and pencil now in hand so he could jot down the words and annotate the tunes notes hmmpfh lewrie sniffed tetchily relieved peace an quiet ooff no sooner had aspinall departed than toulon his stalwart blackandwhite ramcat now grown to a muscular oneandahalf stone hopped into his lap well damme lewrie softly griped and why aint you caulkin the day away the way your tribes sposed to hmm missed me did ye there there ol puss yes yer a goodun rroww toulon braced himself on his hind legs to get right up against his face and rub cheeks and chin against him playnip at his chin and paw his collarbone for attention gruntmewing mostplaintive it took a good ten minutes to cosset him and then toulon became a heavy hot and furry chest plaster which he had to stroke onehanded and read his naval letters with the other toulon closed his eyes and couched his large head on forepaws high under lewries jaws all arumble and now abliss his wee breath tickling at the hollow of his masters throat youre not going to sleep there dye know lewrie chid him mmrrf damn nigh petulant and i will if ive a mind the official bumf done at last lewrie set the last enquiry aside and eyed the pile of personal letters padgett his clerk had already written up replies for him in answer to the business matters they merely awaited his signature getting to the quill and inkwell shifting toulon though would be the very devil after his two days of absence lewrie sidled in his chair squirming and reaching out with his right hand to haul in a fat personal letter without waking toulon fingers scrabbling cross the desk mmarr you heartless bastard the ramcat fussed as he was deposed he was suffered to arch slit his eyes yawn and curl about in his masters lap as lewrie at last got both hands free with which to break the seal on a missive from his father sir hugo st george willoughby and unfold its several sheets his at least were safe to read does he displease you can eat it later lewrie promised his cat who was already eying the crinkly paper with some interest my dearest wastrel son sir hugos epistle began i must really be in trouble back home lewrie deduced still rather greetings and salutations to you avidly gathering the flowers of the sea far off in the caribbean i trust your flowers meaning to say prizemoneys blossom nicely and that your constitution ever a corinthian weeds hardiness continues to thrive pardon pray any discontinuity to this letter but the most momentous news having just arrived i needs must convey it straightaway as the first item of interest my previous first page be hanged on the first day of august your gallant admiral nelson hunted an elusive french fleet to its lair in aboukir bay in egypt and in an action that spanned nigh eight hours took sank or burned every damned one of them their massive flagship locean and their plucky admiral de brueys or some suchlike frog spelling consumed in a twinkling when she was blown to atoms all london all britain is agog good christ lewrie breathed in awe in instant pleasure and in a tiny bit of pique to be swinging at his anchors or cruising fruitless upon a pretty but empty sea and to have missed it nelson the man had such hellish luck though details were scanty his father waxed most rapturous on what little he knew the french had landed on malta and had taken it from the decrepit and corrupt knights of st john who had held it as their feudal fief since the crusades cutting the mediterranean in two and giving the frogs a base from which to oust admiral jervis from those seas for a second time ah that wee frog you spoke of that crude corsican upstart by name of napoleon buenaparte or some such led their army why the devil a french expedition went to egypt god only knows it aint like theyd march from there to bengal had i been in command it would have been sardinia and sicily my next conquest but the tiny bastard is french ever an overvaunting and gasconading race are they not hence as unpredictable and inexplicable as so many young misses yer grandfathers found himself a new dictionary puss lewrie cynically confided to his cat bless me but were you in england at this time and did but go out in publick in uniform youd not be able to buy a drink for a fortnight alan his father went on nor would you suffer to set foot on the ground for being chaired as lustily as a member pon hustings at a byelection and i dare say even your poor wife caroline so hotly set against all things nautical might for a brief respite mind be more forgiving and charitable towards you hmmph lewrie muttered thatll be the day the second page had a great deal crossed out as though the news had interrupted earlier thoughts and sir hugo too abstemious to waste a fresh sheet of highly taxed paper on his own son his father had completed his london house and was now ensconced on panton street convenient to drury lane and the theatres covent garden and the haymarket his haunts of old and the comely women of the commercial persuasion should he get the itch hired an excellent man to run his acres at anglesgreen had taken on suitable house servants had furnished the town house deuced well if he did say so himself at a reasonable expense thankee with the proper style suitable to a semiretired general officer of some meanshaving made the recent acquaintance of lewries erstwhile admirer sir malcolm shockley baronet who had put him in the way of several new investment opportunities beyond his shares in east india company etc though i must own that lady lucy his wife is a horrid coy baggage little better than a common strumpet his father groused at long distance both times ive dined with them both times ive dined them in in return her slippered little toes have nigh stroked my boots raw what you saw in her in your early days i quite understand and admire your taste in point of fact for she is the most fetching mort but you may thank your lucky stars you and she formed no permanent congress else youd have worn her horns since poor shockley so unobservant to her doingsas most men are thank god for i in my green youth and you in yours no error both profitted from abandoned women hard though it may be for you to feature it and hard as it is for me to admit sorely tempted though i am to give her a tumble there is her husband a most decent fellow and the very idea of abusing his trust and hospitality quite rightly daunts me notwithstanding losing immense profits from our mutual enterprises dye see pecuniary fear of loss is not my only motive however besides ive a new one hired by the halfevening who bears a passing likeness to lady lucy newcome from leeds of most fetching aspect and or so i speculate as ripely blessed and of similar pleasingly round dimensions not above twenty who avails when fantasies anent lucy come upon me oh good for you ye old beardsplitter lewrie groaned his father had been round to see theoni connor and lewries byblow alan james connor too reporting that he was now a pretty little lad of two toddling and prattling theoni sent her love o course by the by sir hugo gushed onward that gentlemens lodgings i proposed with sir malcolm shockleys eager backing once i had laid out the particulars and advantages to him is now open we obtained a rather fine st rate residence only slightly gone to seed upon your safe return pray god to england you will be in awe it sits on the corner of wigmore st and duke st just off and convenient to oxford baker sts thus easy to find with dependable carriage service and convenient to govt finance etc it takes the entire corner in point of fact quite a palazzo now set up for fifty with all the desired amenities common room reading room dining etc i myself lacking my panton st house would be tempted to engage a set of rooms and needless to say should you and caroline not have reconciled by your return from foreign service you will be assured of a most lavish roof over your head all at a tidy discount for kin ho notice he dont offer tput me up under his own roof catlin lewrie softly scoffed nor free either the old miser he interpreted toulons blink and earflick to mean aint it a miserable shame unfortunately his father had had little progress to report when it came to making caroline see sense she was not going to pursue any bill of divorcement quite rightly they had both surmised that it would be too expensive a proposition with too much public shame attached and too much enforced contact with her old spurned beau harry embleton who as her member of commons would have to present the bill in london at least caroline had sense enough to avoid that otterfaced fool there had been by last report no further dear friend notes sent her for the simple reason sir hugo concluded that he was at sea beyond the reach of that anonymous gossips spiteful ken and all his previous peccadilloes had been revealed supposedly you are i trust his father had snidely penned if not keeping your breeches buttoned at least possessed of enough caution to not flaunt any of your venereal doings in publick hmm as if you ever did lewrie grumbled swear tchrist did he get to heaven hed tip saint peter the wink and ask where the whores kept ha knew it the old rogue for there had followed an entire paragraph touting the advantages of balancing ones humours with the whores and never squiring one out in the daytime or to any function where ones peers in society might remark youhardly the thing for an english gentleman married or no much less a serving officer etc and etc taught his granny tsuck eggs too mostlike lewrie groaned some more hed heard that particular lecture at least once a month since hed pinched the bottom of his first pubescent scullery maid at thirteen never admit paternity were there fifty before you lewrie singsonged under his breath never lose yer head over any coy slice o mutton think o yer familys good name oh right we never had one he snickered reaching for his mug of cool tea his fathers letter was discontinuous at that for hed left the worst news and three matters of the most import til the last first was the matter of young miss sophie de maubeuge his ward she had fled anglesgreen for london and was now living with his father serving as mistress in the innocent sense his father quickly assured him of his new town house caroline has gotten it into her head and clings to the opinion despite all protestations to the contrary that you and poor wee sophie were at one time she cannot settle upon which intimate sir hugo informed him aboard that french frigate you sailed out of toulon in lisbon before you packed her off to england in some stolen moments during your two short shore leaves since this war began it dont signify to her either or all feature in her accusations depending upon the day of the week and had i not known carolines sweet nature before i would be forced upon an initial acquaintance now to be convinced she was tetched levelheadedness and her usual kind demeanour quite fly her once she gets on the topic needless to say it all created such an impossible situation for poor sophie such glares and frowns such harsh and quibblesome speech finding so much fault with even the simplest domestic tasks that matters came to a head several weeks ago there were shouts accusations made refutations offered yet dismissed to the point that sophie packed summoned a coach and turned up on my doorstoop unannounced reduced to tears and whimpers and i could not deny her shelter as i am certain you will understand so suddenly denied any freedom in anglesgreen so isolated to the farm as she was sophie has at last recovered her cheerful equanimity and now quite relishes going about the city with me now that must cramp his style lewrie cynically hooted daughters his father had marvelled in sophies case granddaughter after a fashion somehow i feel that due to my wastrel ways none of which i truly regret mind i might have missed something in life by not being engaged in childrens raisings for young women are quite delightful creatures to watch blossom i have always felt avuncular or grandfatherly anent sophies development for so she calls me grandpere but one might almost deem my feelings paternal now when closely engaged with her welfare in protecting her from the harshest aspects of life or rakehells such as me in younger guise rest assured that sophie only attends the most uplifting and chaste amusements and events with me of all people her guard church theatre concerts and galleries only the tasteful raree shows dines only with respectable society etc and do we attend a ball rout or drum her dance partners must pass my muster first and she is home and snug in her chambers at a reasonable hour no matter this places upon me a hellish restraint i feel it is my duty in your stead to knew hed complain a tad anyway lewrie chuckled imagining how corseted the old whoremonger must be all for appearances sake and for sophies future respectable marriage prospects and hes not touchin me up for a contribution thelp dress and feed her the second grimmer matter concerned his boys sewallis and hugh nighimprisoned at their bleakly strict boarding school in guildford despite how involved his fatherd been with his new house his arrangements for his country estate and gentlemens club he had tried to keep in touch with the lads but had gotten no responses to his letters when down to anglesgreen he had called upon caroline to enquire how they kept and had not liked the answers the few letters that caroline had gotten had been vague filled with what sounded to his suspicious ears like rote phrases dictated by the headmaster and headmistress or their few employed instructors this had occurred shortly before sophie had eloped so lewrie could understand in retrospect that the tensions had already been treaclethick which had not improved carolines acceptance of his worries as if any questions he had concerning their welfare was a criticism of carolines decision to board them away at an austere public school or a suggestion that she did not fret over them as a proper mother ought sir hugo had though received carolines grumpy permission to call upon them on his way back to london so imagine it dear alan up pops i in full regimental fig in the grandest equipage going liveried coachee postillion catchfart and my trusty orderly trilochan singh in the grand parade uniform of our old th native infantry silks sash tulwar and turban his father had described we caused the most devilish stir in the populace as we clattered in and drew rein yet when i requested of the headmaster and his wife a stout and termagant batterbooby to see the lads i was flatly refused gaudy as we were one would expect theyd have fallen on me like famished vultures with an eye towards a lavish donation and an annual patronage but no not even that they did not attempt flattery did not offer to dine me in or shew off the grounds and in point of fact rather peremptorily wished me off the premises before they summoned a magistrate oh yes says i indeed say they the school maintains a rigid rota from which the students are not to be taken and what of their free time i ask they pray i was rather brusquely told what your sire demanded are they never allowed off the grounds to a sweet shop only under escort by instructors or proctors says the grim wretch who rules that foul dungeon a nastier place i never clapped eyes on and ive seen hindoo toilets thankee very much determining that they were too righteous to bribe i cautioned them that id return before they could say knife with your and my solicitors the chief justice to my old friend and patron the lordlieutenant of surrey and a troop of yeoman cavalry with whom to tear their pile down round their ears and clap them in gaol under suspicion of abuse of their wards and it would be kings bench for the both of them i further threatened to coach back to anglesgreen and fetch their mother and did they refuse her id whistle up the troopers and formal justice bedamned his father crowed in a copperplate hand and didnt caroline look the place over first lewrie griped as he got to his feet to fume and pace deposing toulon from his lap as if shedding a robe damn my eyes what was she thinkin a gloomier tale never youve heard alan his father went on they are of course being beaten were we not all caned in our own school days and are now the better for it corporal punishment breaks intractably wild wills and civilises but i fear that their treatment goes beyond the instructive or necessary punishment is doled out for the slightest infractions for standing idle for too much exuberance during their rare idle play hour for the tiniest error in recitation for chatting too loudly or happily at mealtimes all this from adults mind what sewallis and hugh whisperingly told me passes twixt elder boys and their fags is quite another thing quite exceeding the normal abuse a new boy should expect at his first school my son i strongly suspect that torture premeditated brutal and fiendish cruelties are planned and executed nightly his sire accused and where are the instructors the governess or headmaster when such occurs i ask you the academy is not so large i fear that they might lightly send down any or all malefactors indeed may dread suiting the moneyed parents of such little monsters or lose so many of the students that their socalled school becomes unprofitable they already accept those deemed too difficult or thickheaded the dregs from other schools the dissolute incorrigible or highflown tis a wonder i wasnt sent there then lewrie muttered dashing a hand cross his furrowed brow even more hellish alan were your sons tremulous intimations that such tortures and cruelties are dealt out to those averse to submission to latenight buggery by the older boys sir hugo wrote goddammit lewrie yelped hot to fly home that instant with a sword in hand and deal out some jesus and the moneychangers justice on one and all my lads oh my poor lads whats caroline put you into i coached back to anglesgreen instanter once the lads brief two hours of liberty were done and i was forced to deliver them back into that cesspool of corruption his father wrote not without the severest warning to headmaster headmistress that were my suspicions borne out i would have the law on them and that sewallis and hugh are to be free to write whom they please when they please and write what they please had i the authority i would have snatched them out from that place at once but alas in your absence that is up to caroline she was quite perturbed by my sad relation of the boys condition i fully expect her to do the snatching i also spoke with the vicar at st georges cautioning him not to recommend that school to parents of local parish lads and what the devil was he thinking when he suggested it to caroline are not sewallis and hugh mannerly and quickwitted students in no need of such strict chastisements to improve their wits or behaviours i left the old gooseberry quaking in his slippers let me tell you in dread he was sponsoring buggery passing through guildford once more i did call upon the chief justice and laid my suspicions with him as well so we may soon see the end of this socalled strict christian academy once an enquiry has been begun you must do your part alan and quickly his father stressed write caroline urging her to remove the lads at once and suggest i choose a better this time standing stead for you whilst overseas on kings business offer to pay fees which i will cover for i suspect i am more in the way of money than you at sudden need i did offer to stand for their schooling hughs entry into a good regiment and little charlottes finishing after all do you not recall thence write also to your solicitor mr matthew mountjoy in london urging him to draw up a writ on your behalf naming me as your voice concerning the boys strictly limited to the choice of school and their support in lieu of your presence of course so caroline can have no legitimate objections to such an arrangement yes by god he would soon as he finished reading the rest of his fathers letter matter which has grieved you since sailing son sir hugo continued is your lack of news from sewallis and hugh be sure that you stipulate to mountjoy that the boys must write me as well as their mother concerning their progress and their welfare since i will be partially in loco parentis in this way the lads will be able to write letters to you addressed to me and you will be able to direct your correspondence to them using my panton st address as a subterfuge ho that opportunity to circumvent his wifes spite and hear from his boys once more was almost cheering enough to mollify his earlier anger at how they had and might have been abused even more wondrous his father further suggested that caroline was now vulnerable his final point was that too many things bore down upon her her fear and shame that she had unwittingly exposed her sons to pain and bestiality that she hadnt been a good mother even more vexing had been her wrathful split with sophie her unallayed suspicions notwithstanding and her elderly mother charlottes health was failing it all made sir hugo slyly hinted the perfect opportunity for him to write her no matter that caroline had said shed burn anything that came with his name on it unread there is no better time for a wife to appreciate a husband than when crushed by adversity his father coyly nudged when the weaker sex all at sixes and sevens find need to lean upon her stalwart man with his innate inner strength and in the face of shared adversities form square shoulder to shoulder in wholehearted mutual defence of their children and their welfare no matter how slender a reed that husband be and i think we both know how irresolute and inconstant we willoughbylewrie men turn out to be god help our trusting womenfolk it is their nature to look to men for aid dispirited as caroline is this moment do you intend a reconciliation someday with your good wife then strike whilst the iron is hot using your utmost subtlety nothing too abrupt or promising at first mind cajole her with no recriminations for her foolishness with no sudden vows or wishes for renewal but then i very much doubt that you are in need of advice when it comes to cossetting the fairer sex ho oh yes i do lewrie bewilderedly confessed to his empty greatcabins and his nettled cat evry man does and did ye ever have any advice why the devil didnt ye share it when i needed it he plumped down in his desk chair once more exhausted by fear and anger by outrage how to pen that letter to caroline posing stern and capable and reliable and trustworthy he couldnt even begin to conjure it would be implausible to beg her forgiveness and much too soon to do so too he could not chide her for a brainless chit for being gulled by the vicars advice either and when you came right down to it did he wish to reconcile hmmm he had to give that one a long think turning his chair to face carolines portrait hanging in the diningcoach done back when she was a newlywed in the bahamas in or dewy fresh and pretty with her features unlined but for the natural merry folds below her eyes long silken light brown hair worn long and missish under a widebrim straw bonnet twasnt all looks or beauty though and damn being a sailorman he was gone for a year or two sometimes an entire three years commission and people and things never were the same as they were when he left children sprouted taller into the most amazing creatures totally alien to who theyd been before as strange to him as feathered savages in the great south seas wives had be been a landsman even a tenant squire with even a modicum of ability to work a farm or appear as if he even tried he knew things would have been different between them there would have been no shock of rencontre at the changes they would not have mellowed apart too set in their ways for coping with life as independent agents but would have slowly gradually adapted to each other so that such changes never came as a securityshaking shock of recognition they would have aged together and most importantly living cheektojowl with a goodly wife standing watch and watch with a woman so sweet and intelligent and compatible as caroline it was good chances hed never have strayed well perhaps now and again but twouldve been rare really lewrie was certain that caroline was still more than enough for him as a mate hadnt he deemed her perfect marriage material once he and she had remet in england in long before theyd wed before that anonymous scribbler had exposed his overseas doings hadnt they proved their mutually pleasing compatibility after each separation and readjusted to each other caught up so happy and lighthearted so easily sociable and teasing so much of the same mind wasnt she the same spriteiy but serious levelheaded but adoring girl hed wed reconcile aye he did wish it could he shed theoni connor though and their bastard son almost completely yes though he did owe her an obligation but was a complete break called for then so be it theoni was welloff in her own right with no need of his financial support or wish to bruit her boy alan james connor in genteel society as a bastard he suspected though that as long as the war went on and the admiralty had need of him despite their qualms once reconciled he would be right back at sea years and thousands of miles gone putting into strange harbours as all true sailors did sooner or later could he actually amend his roguish ways sadly he rather doubted it or doubted such a vow surviving an entire year unless he spent his time completely out of sight of land he knew by then his own nature and a lewdun it was he was man enough to confess to himself at the least he eyed the larger stack of letters all from theoni no his solicitor and caroline now took precedence he scooted his chair up to the desk and stretched for paper quill and inkwell mountjoy then the boys then lastly that vital epistle to caroline well to his father thirdly to give thanks for his ministrations and advice which thought gave him shivers caroline last gawd he said with a wondering sigh all this and choundas too well just thankee jesus for all this bounty book two en labor en odiis caput insuperabile nostris lo a heavy taskthis man whom no hate of mine can overcome argonautica book iii valerius flaccus chapter eight mister the honourable grenville pelham with lewries agreement determined that the proteus frigate and lewries tender hide would be safer did she sail for her hunting grounds at once with mr peel to accompany her and lewrie so the game could be put afoot immediately and someone sensible kept a chary eye on her captain to prevent further folly while lewrie didnt think he had much to fear from the beaumans and their allies still all abluster with rage over ledyards demise and the undying shame and dishonour attached to it in court at least there had been some disquieting rumours bandied about involving knives clubs and dark kingston alleys the principal witnesses to the affair were of toogood standing embarrassingly alive and demonstrably unbribable yet someone had to pay so which rumours sworn even as the dust was pattering upon ledyards coffin in the churchyard did admittedly force lewrie to tug his neckstock and gulp a time or two and keep his head swivelling to see who was coming up on his offside the beaumans always had been a crude and immoderate clan who never did anything by halves god sakes look at lucy had been lewries conclusion swiftly followed by never get in much trouble at sea then damme but my men are goin stale swinging idle at anchor so long and finally by lets get after that bastard choundas then at once hes no more vicious than thebeaumans and i can see him comin a long way off so it was with a glad heart and filled with righteous duty that lewrie ordered hms proteus to take in her kedge anchors haul up close to her moor unfurl topsls and jibs and on a fine and freshening slant of wind from off the distant blue mountains stand out proudly past the palisades wreathed in the gunsmoke of her salutes to admiral sir hyde parker perhaps with staff captain sir edward charles eying them much as an owl might ogle an escaped titmouse with shaken fist and a faint cry of ill have ye yet ye bastard to thread the reefs with a harbour pilot aboard and make a joyful offing to the sparkling deeps where captain alan lewrie rn could savour the thought of hah cheated death again despite his previous experience in the caribbean lewrie hadnt known about the odd phenomenon of the sunset green flash that brief eyeblink of time when the sun at last declined its last hot sliver under the horizon and the final glorious reds oranges pinks and greys were interrupted it had been kit cashman whod told him of it over their last goodbye supper the last night in harbour he had been pacing the windward bulwarks of the quarterdeck as was a captains sole right when not below but crossed to leeward with his fingers crossed hoping that cashman hadnt been pulling his leg unblinking he strained his eyes looking directly into the suns ball no not this night for sol blinked out yonder over new spain to the west leaving only the rapidly dulling colours of the usual tropic sunset that could at sea turn starstrewn black as quickly as a closed window shutter if he had been cheated by nature this night or twitted by kits tongueincheek inventions at least the early evening was cooler than the day and the wind rushing cross the deck was a blessing he pushed off the bulwark clapped his hands in the small of his back and paced to the doublewheel and compass binnacle now lit by a whaleoil lanthorn flickering eerily upon the faces of the quartermaster and his mate now standing their trick at the helm he craned his gaze upwards to the sails and rigging in the quickly failing last light ascertaining that everything was just so with nothing out of order or amiss a peek up to weather for threats of storm clouds a look down into the binnacle at the compass where the pointer wavered near to eastsoueast half east as close to the steady noreast wind as proteus could steer and damn pelham lewrie thought frowning sendin us to english harbour antigua first antigua lay nearly due east demanding a hard passage full and by nigh against the trades and days of short tacks to the norwest did they get pushed too far down alee zigzagging on a drunken snails track short boards almost in the opposite direction before they could come about nearer to cuba or hispaniola and sail a long board on larboard tack right on the eye of the wind and something sure to go smash aloft with so much pressure on the rigging he now could barely make out the forms of spare yards booms and light upper topmasts stowed along the gangways and on the boattier beams but was sure that their number would be reduced by the time they anchored quartermaster austen stood to the weather side of the helm his mate to the loord a larger man who braced his strength on the wheel spokes his eyes on the sails aloft whilst austen kept his glued upon the compass a big fellow was the quartermasters mate newcome off a yankee smuggler taken on the north shore of st thomas in the danish virgins where proteus had done a little discreet poaching toby jugg for that was the improbable name hed given when he reluctantly signed ships books as a pressed man had originally been rated an ordinary seaman but had quickly proven able in the past few months and had then struck for quartermasters mate big hulking and darkvisaged surly and noncommunicative jugg had only volunteered to qualify for the joining bounty to send to his woman and child on barbados far to the south odds were proteus would never be called upon to sail there though and if she did lewrie was sure the man would jump ship and theyd never see him again or he would be forced to sic the island garrison on jugg who would fetch him back in chains to be bound to an upright hatch grating and given fourdozen lashes for desertion not too heavy forrud mister austen lewrie asked the senior quartermasters mate not crank erm shes fairbalanced capm austen took a long time to adjudge mebbe a tad light forrud but she tacks righteasy sir watch her head close then lewrie said transferring his gaze to the inscrutable toby jugg and nothing to loord it goes without sayin right jugg ysay so sir jugg growled eyes locked on the main course ahem aspinall interrupted but yer suppers ready fer servin sir aye thankee aspinall lewrie grunted irked by juggs coolness which was just shy of dumb insubordination carry on then men mister catterall i leave you the deck and the watch evening all aye aye sir the second officer piped up after hovering in summoning distance the last ten minutes he clapped his hands behind his back and shortstrutted up to windward filled with his importance quartermasters mate austen waited til he was out of earshot before he dared mutter from the lee corner of his mouth jugg ye bloody idiot austen told his helmmate the capm aint nowhere bad as some an bettern most keep up yer surly airs though an yell push him tflog ye an take back yer ratin sod im jugg whispered back sod all officers an captains sod im whos done right by ye austen pointed out ye toss yerself back table seaman an theres nought tsend yer ol woman an kid show willin why dont ye dont cost tuppence but jugg began to disagree his face working sorrowfully but any explanation or relenting was stopped by lt catterall minds on your duties men no talking there he snapped aye aye sir they chorused mr peel of the foreign offices secret branch simply knew too many secrets it was impossible for lewrie to follow his usual custom of dining in his officers midshipmen and gentlemen warrants as long as peel was aboard peel as supercargo had to be accommodated somewhere apart from casual conversations there was always the risk that peel talked in his sleep or boasted immoderately in his cups the only secure place where peel could sling a bedcot was here in lewries greatcabins and they were already cramped enough aspinalls little daypantry had come down and the chartspace had to shift aft into the day cabin right against lewries bed space and that bed space got crowded aft and inboard into his day cabin which had moved lewries desk and chair settee and guest chairs portable storage chests and winecabinet over to larboard nearer his quartergallery and his seat of easewhere toulons tinlined sand box also was located toulon usually of the most garrulous and playful nature had not taken all those changes kindly whilst he had the run of the entire ship his masters cabins were sacrosanct or at least they should have been the ramcat had not taken well to peel either usually dubiously on guard under the furniture when peel was astir his paws tucked under his chest his eyes slit in oriental wariness evening mister peel lewrie said as he swept back the tails of his coat and sat himself down in the diningcoach captain lewrie peel purred back taking a place about halfway down on lewries left am i given to understand that were having turtle soup tonight delightful green turtle sir aspinall supplied as he poured their wineglasses full waving the neck briefly at the sideboard where a tureen with the lid off fumed smallun but tender turtle steaks too our cook gideon is a wonder lewrie boasted discovering at least something to lighten his grumpy mood over being turfed from his own quarters something with which to ease his careful formality gideon cook how apt peel said with a smirk as some soup was ladled into his bowl your ships cooks name that is cooke with an e lewrie corrected as toulon hopped up on the table by his right hand and sat like a statue watching aspinalls every move for sure enough once lewries bowl had been filled there was a smaller bowl for him mostly fineshredded and softboiled meat with just a bit of broth toulon hunkered down possessively and tucked in now and then glaring at mr peel did he gesture too wide or abruptly for the cats liking his old masters name i presume peel blandly commented his spoon poised before his mouth to blow upon his eyes averted who knows lewrie lied tossing off a shrug of believable innocence free to volunteer at any rate one may only hope sir peel cautioned was he a runaway the punishment for harbouring or succouring him is harsh in point of fact you seem to have a great many blacks in your crew howes hoods brewsters sawyers carpenters basses and whitbreads and nelsons or groom old masters or old trades oh i forgot tis groome with an e he gave lewrie a questioning smirk but bass or quite a spell of yellow fever and malaria earlier this year mister peel lewrie very cautiously stated covering his lies with his napkin to his lips was proteus fortunate so many locals volunteered into her well i aint picky long as i can work and fight my ship odd though peel drilled on glass held pensively in hand that was just about the same time that a coincidental number of young male slaves fled the late ledyard beauman plantings near portland bight was it not one could wonder got me by the nutmegs lewrie frantically thought in dire need of a panicky yeek and did he try to bluster his way out of it he would only make things worse for himself panic gave way though to anger at peel and pelham knowing theyd hold this over him to ensure his cooperation when they already had it the bastards most fortunate aye lewrie conceded busying himself with a spoonful of soup taking thinking time in stroking toulon who had put his food away and was cajoling for more mister pelham now peel continued quite casually is a lad born to wealth as we both know respectable wealth in england means land and property obtaining to the land tenants and rents he was a bit nettled therefore by the uhm coincidence mister pelham however has the acquaintance of sir samuel whitbread and the great commoner charles james fox who are of a persuasive progressive bent he also admires the work of the reverend william wilberforce and mistress hannah moore the earnest reformers mister pelham is not taken quite so much by their views concerning the reform of english society but he agrees with them about the abolition of slavery dye see uhmhmm lewrie commented with his mouth full which seemed safest im ruined im extorted forever which he wondered mister pelham now thinks the slightest bit better of you sir peel informed him did you actually have a hand in it excuse me mister peel lewrie wondered aloud after he got his soup down without choking in shock or relief but not two days ago reenslaving every last black in saint domingue seemed to bother him less than a hangnail damme hes posing as a prospective slave owner how can he hold both views simultaneously ah but theyre french slaves captain lewrie peel brightly replied not englishowned and anyone who tries to put the chains back on em will bleed money soldiers and grief the whole next century let it be a festering boil for the frogs not us louverture is getting the land back into limited production so what he can do disorganised as he is our more enlightened british planters can do just as well if not better perhaps with paid labour dye see lewrie gave that idea the scornful snort it deserved he doubted if anyone could mention british overseas planters and enlightened in the same breath and not be slung into bedlam for lunacy and mister pelhams pose is just that peel snickered for just so long as it is necessary hell make a great show of keen interest into every aspect of slave agriculture then suffer a sudden ah turn of fortune that precludes the purchase of slaves or acres hell make a pest of himself you mean lewrie wryly supposed uhm peel gaily agreed over the lip of his wineglass which means that i wont be saddled with you forever lewrie further assumed your mission ends when choundas is defeated or when saint domingue explodes again when rigaud wins hopefully captain lewrie peel said with a mystifying shrug just how abolitionist is the honourable grenville pelham then lewrie queried enough so to delve into slaverys horrors and write wilberforce and moore all about em so whitbread and fox can screech in the commons and expose the evils frankly sir i would not put it past him peel agreed he is young youve noticed and uhm ardent in his beliefs peel said with a jaded roll of his eyes at such callowness in younger men aint he though lewrie replied chuckling but he was more amused by the fact that pelham was vulnerable too a word in the right ear and jamaica would shun him like the proverbial viper in the breast an abolitionist spy out to ruin them take their profits with emancipation and paidfor workerssteal the food from their childrens mouths he threatens me he goes down with me lewrie vowed to himself pelham presses me too sore and ill have him by the nutmegs i take it that your friend colonel christopher cashman is not enamoured of the institution either captain lewrie peel said as his soup bowl was whisked away to be replaced by a plate of grilled fish and simmered turtle cutlets with small boiled new potatoes chick peas and fried onion slices added no hes not lewrie answered how odd then that hes removed to the carolinas peel said as he broke open a pipinghot roll of shore bread and slathered it with fresh butter butter preserved as long as it lasted on the cool faraft orlop deck sunk in an oak pail of seawater looking at wilmington in north carolina or georgetown in south carolina lewrie supplied feeling more at ease now they were off that damning topic of his guilt damme puss be easy here comes your portions ye aint eatin mine damn yer eyes uhm cotton tobacco and naval stores mostly rice and indigo from georgetown but he will be a factor he told me hes placed orders for the machinery for a sawmill and rice mill no more farming for him i expect kit will prosper no matter where he lights hes the hardpluggin sort and damme but ill miss him lewrie thought once more life be dull thout cashman tstir things up though after their last parting supper three nights before it might be best if life did get ploddingboresome for a while for it had been a rowdy and wet night of wine punch brandy and some of that infamous yankee doodle cornwhisky before theyd bawled out the last bonne chance and adieu to the great displeasure of half thesleeping residents of kingston ah the americans peel simpered im certain that a man of colonel cashmans kidney will greatly improve the ton of their society though hell have to look sharp else the yankees skin him naked in america all is trade everything has its price and everything and everyone seems for sale you are aware i trust that the americans already trade with saint domingue peel asked him yes and we should put a stop to it i take it lewrie said well perhaps peel countered before general maitland negotiated the evacuation of our land forces he and louverture came to what he assumed was a form of agreement regarding trade his defeat ye mean lewrie shot back forever prejudiced to anything maitland did i take it louverture reneged and the great general was skinned by the little black man one could put it that way yes peel said almost wincing at lewries bluntness maitland wined and dined him held a parade for him and fawned something shameful which nearly killed old maitlands soul since he absolutely despised him but even so maitland is nothing if not a cunning diplomatist so he dissembled to him deuced well pisspoor general and a pisspoor negotiator lewrie snapped though much intrigued by the hope of hearing more dirt on the man promised him the moon did louverture agree peel summarised our frigates to keep the frogs at bay british goods arms and munitions brought in by yankee ships just so long as the french didnt get the place back if louverture would declare himself king or something and make saint domingue independent but he didnt lewrie pointed out wasnt even tempted im told peel told him amazed by such sentiments and what hed have done given the chance too much in love with france and the revolution the mother country and the mother tongue though you hear the local patter of the slaveys and even the creoles and it makes you wonder more like louverture knew maitland was dealing with rigaud too and saw right through him lewrie said with a prim sniff when you get down to it do we really want the place better we blockade the coast til kingdom come no imports and they fall apart no exports and they go bust more importantly our planters make money with both fists since french and spanish colonies cant supply tuppence to the world market for sugar molasses and rum and all that but we must peel exclaimed as if presented with heresy have it lewrie scoffed no we dont and if no one else has it or can make hapenny off it its british goods borne by british bottoms that rule tobacco cotton indigo and cocoa and europe would shrivel up and die without em but surely peel sputtered dabbing his lips i know it takes all the fun out of your plots and schemes if the navy just closes the tap and lets saint domingue rot and wither lewrie gleefully declaimed makes your and pelhams presence redundant dont it why i might actually get my cabin space back and france and spain lose all their overseas trade and wealth and we whip em silly sooner or later if their own people dont rise up to demand bread and peace first well i doubt well give up quite that easily captain lewrie mr peel told him once hed gotten his breath back so to speak we have always coveted saint domingue and that very sort of exclusive possession of the caribbean you just mentioned if not exclusive we would have shared it with spain and would have worked in concert to expel the french the danes and the dutch expel the americans too do tell lewrie said beckoning to aspinall for more wine as early as there was a lieutenantcolonel john chalmers foresaw the coming war with france he wrote the foreign office and the prime minister offering a plan to conquer all the sugar isles all sorts of maps and such marked with arrows and little sketches of forts and ships the same sort of paper fantasies that wishtobe generals dream up in peacetime promising grand success if theyre put in charge hmm lewrie sourly suggested military naval or agents well uhm yes peel was forced to admit ambition grows in every breast anyway colonel chalmers suggested that we share the island of hispaniola the entire caribbean with spain and urged that we form a proper alliance with them as the weaker partner which we did for a while lewrie stuck in knife and fork in use til spain turned on us and took hand with the frogs and god knows why french and american ships and trade would have been driven out of these seas completely peel continued as casually as if he were discussing the prospects of a horse at new market spain is old tired and bankrupt what better sort of ally could one ask for colonel chalmers even went so far as to propose that with saint domingue in our hands and the united states trade eliminated all those emigrants from scotland ireland wales and even england would settle down here instead of sailing for america depriving the yankee doodles of an expanding population of enterprising newcomers and all the industries and skills theyd possess or demand once settled talented britons whod lewrie cocked his head to one side and grinned setting down his wineglass so he wouldnt spill when he began to wheeze with laughter mine arse he snorted on a bandbox tell me youre not serious thats the damnedest christ shit on a biscuit well thats what you get when amateurs connive peel replied when lewrie at last subsided as if to prove that his hands had never touched such a scheme property property nothing but property do ye know he went on with a worldlywise snicker ferrea non venerem sed praedam saecula laudent it is not love but booty that this iron age applauds peel cited tibullus bugger him too lewrie retorted with bells on beg your pardon mister peel but unfortunately thats what you get when even the ones who should know better connive yes unfortunately peel admitted you know that maitlands gone to america a mister harcourt from the foreign office is still in saint domingue negotiating on the sly with louverture hope springs eternal the elegant spy said with a faint shrug maitlands brief is to negotiate covert trade arrangements with yankee ships to bear the goods unfortunately he may be a trifle late off the mark their new president john adams does not follow his predecessors advice concerning foreign entanglements as president washington cautioned in his farewell address adams has already sent trade representatives to saint domingue who seem to own the high cards for some reason even though twice as many blacks are enslaved in america as there are on hispaniola lewrie said gawping in surprise they have a bloody hope so do i end up chasing yankee merchantmen it may come to that yes peel intimated we should uhm pretend to continue in amity and cooperation with american men o war versus the frogs for the moment so all my advisories are over the side i spose lewrie had to assume all that blather about equal protection for their traders and such sharing information with the american navy damme this could turn nasty if the yankee doodles aspire to dominate the colonys trade without spilling a drop of blood after we did all the well we wont share all our information of a certainty mr peel warned for instance our agents in paris smuggled us the french private signals for the next three months and those we shall not tell the jonathons about really lewrie exclaimed a slow devilish grin spreading on his face as he contemplated the opportunities for mayhem those signals codes might open to him for now we must be grateful the united states navy is so tiny and weak and most of her captains inexperienced mr peel snickered they barely make a show of force against the few french warships here and those are few and far between as we both know poorcast cannon perhaps greentimbered newbuilt ships he scoffed youd be surprised lewrie was happy to counter recalling a visit aboard their gun twodeck frigate hancock we sell em modern artillery coppering everything they wish a year from now they will be a daunting challenge we get into a new war with em and out come their privateers bad as the frog privateers are theyre fleabites by comparison do they get their hands on the exclusive saint domingue trade it might be our merchantmen swept from these seas if you scratch the jonathons youd find theyd rather have another good bash at us than the french hmm may not signify peel replied grunting his skepticism at that declaration i doubt louverture will trust any slaveholding nation not to do him harm in the long run adamss representations to him may goad the french into a real war or force them to send an army and a fleet out here to quash any attempt to declare saint domingues independence or alliance with the yankee doodles which would put a better face upon our uhm sudden evacuation as well i doubt thats possible lewrie scoffed actually when mister pelham and i were about to depart there was a lengthy article just ready for publication in all the newspapers mr peel told him with a mystifying grin it had been prepared by a government committee well not an official committee hmm i saw a copy of it and fetched it along would you care to read it sir total shite is it lewrie asked you must understand that it was devised to be read in paris by the directory peel related to create a rift or widen the existing rift twixt france and louverture firstly the secondary aim would be to mollify our own populace matter of fact i have it here peel said reaching into the breast pocket of his coat to produce a sheaf of handcopied script lewrie took it warily sure that it would be rank drivel and the ink would be runny in this damp toulon at least was quickly fascinated with anything that crinkled and pawed at the papers and his masters hand mouth open for an experimental nibble no event has happened in the history of the present war of more interest to the cause of humanity or the permanent interests of great britain than the treaty which general maitland has made with the black general toussaint upon the evacuation of san domingo thats what theyre calling it now thought it was saint domingue less french more caribbean and exotic peel explained the independence of that most valuable island is in fact recognised and will be secured against all the efforts which the french can now make to recover it not merely without the expense to england of fortifications or of armies but with the benefit of securing to us its exclusive commerce oh rot lewrie spat louverture was lauded though a mere negro and brigand but one born to vindicate the claims of his species and to show that the character of men is independent of exterior colour the late events will soon engage the public attention and please all parties oh please lewrie gravelled more agitated it is a great point to rescue this formidable island from the grasp of the directory it is a great point gained to the cause of humanity that a negro domination is in fact constituted he read disbelief and bile in his voice in equal measure that the black race whom the christian world to their infamy have been accustomed to degrade every liberal briton will feel proud that this country brought about the happy revolution what unutterable gall tripe godrotted shit aint it peel rejoined as if amused by lewries naivety toulon pounced upon the papers now held in a limp right hand with a glad little cry of victory and many brisk digging motions no no little man lewrie chid him snatching them away with his left hand and shoving them downtable to peel not these make you sick to your stomach bad as a hairball damn my eyes peel whod believe that dont much signify peel admitted once in the papers its official and whos to say diff rent the next generational take this account for gospel think of the widows and orphans peel said with a dismissive sniff suddenly the kin of those hundred thousand dead crippled or debilitated have a crumb to cling to that their lads went for the good of humanity twas in a good cause peel said scornfully pontificating as all the ministers parish vicars members of parliament lewrie strongly suspected would soon tearfully declaim lewrie picked up his refilled wineglass and leaned back from the table oh he could have pretended to be so sickened by the whole affair that hed been put off his victuals but that wasnt the case he was still hungry disgust had no effect on his digestion i spose he finally said after three moody sips that nearly drained his wineglass the same sort of devious cant was spread in the last war back when i was just commissioned or a mid cant that i mostlike believed a glass with you captain lewrie peel proposed summoning aspinall to top them up to an honourable world honourable world lewrie intoned touching glasses with him but pausing before drinking to the salvation of our personal honour instead mister peel despite the bloody world and the sardonic mr peel surprised him by sighing amen uhm those private identity signals mister peel he asked after draining his glass and waving for a refill ye wouldnt happen thave those in another pocket would you in point of fact i do captain lewrie but another toast then mister peel lewrie proposed to ah mischief mischief and confusion to the french chapter nine something dragged him up from the depths of an almost dreamless sleepa commotion on deck no it was the faint groan of working timbers and the motion of his sybaritic hanging bedcot that was made almost wide enough for two a most suspect luxury in the spartan world of the navy proteus was still on larboard tack her decks heeled to starboard as she rolled and ranted and the bedcot hung foreandaft swayed lefttoright but with a snubbing little jerk and a yawing a twist every now and then one opened eye revealed utter blackness in the closed windows of the overhead coachtop toulon not liking what the cot was doing one little bit fussed and fretted on the wood edge ready to jump down lewrie flung back the single mildewed sheet that covered him and put a leg over a foot on the deck ready to roll to his left and leave it there was a thud of a musket butt outside his forrud cabin door awfcer o th watch mister adair sah come lewrie called back groping in the darkness for a pair of canvas trousers hed left draped over a convenient chair back my pardons captain lt adair said entering the cabins with a weak hornpane lanthorn in one hand and his hat in the other but the wind is come more easterly and the seas are getting up somewhat felt her working lewrie grunted as he finished buttoning up the front flap of the trousers and fumbled his toes into his shoes whats the time and where stands the wind mister adair just gone two bells of the middle watch sir adair replied and the wind has backed a full point weve hauled off with it just this minute sir but she needs easing aye lewrie decided aloud shrugging into a thighlength tarred sailcloth coatnow that he had adairs light by which to find it lead on mister adair once on deck near the quartermasters who were straining on the helm he could smell rough weather up to windward a freshwater miasma that put him in mind of a water wells dank throat a sliver of moon gave faint light but there were a few wisps of semiopaque scud near it and just enough moonlight and starlight to reveal a solid blankness up in the noreast well damme lewrie muttered as the wind gusted fitful for an ominous moment or two and the banshees keened in the miles of stays sheets halliards and braces before falling off as if dying suddenly allowing proteus to roll more upright and groan like an old woman turning over in her arthritic sleep ease her hell mister adair well rig for heavy weather pipe all hands well strike topmasts and take first reefs in both courses and topsls hand the staysls and outer jibs as well first off hands to the braces once on deck and well ease her another point off the wind to a close reach aye aye sir mister towpenny pipe all hands something the matter mr peel enquired popping up like some jackinthebox by lewries side wrapped in a blanket over shirt and breeches weathers making up mister peel lewrie snapped wishing the man wouldnt do that coming up on his blind side and scaring him like a graveyard ghost have to prepare for it and bear off soueast i see how much delay will there be then to our arrival at antigua peel asked following lewrie to the compass binnacle where lewrie took a long squint at the traverse board three days lewrie speculated a whole bloody week no one could tell you that mister peel depends on how rough its going to get from where the wind blows how hard if our lucks out well end up halfway to barbados or stagger down nigh to the viceroyalty of new granada wish tvisit the dons and buy some cigarillos do ye mister peel not particularly captain lewrie no peel said a shakiness to his voice despite his stab at jocularity which sound made lewrie turn to peer at him with a faint grin was this blow peels first experience of heavy weather he hadnt spent that much time on ships in the mediterranean during their last pairing and might have had good winds and easy seas on his way there even in the fickle bay of biscay it had been heard of though twas damned rare ah mister winwood lewrie said turning his attention to the sailing master as he lumbered up from the gunroom and the main deck to the quarterdeck with one of his charts under one arm as proteus awoke with a thunder of horny bare feet on oak amid the shrills of bosuns calls i intend to remain on larboard tack long as shell bear it new course oh sousoueast to begin with any dangers we should know of on that course til we run aground on saint vincent that is let me consult this particular chart captain sir mr winwood ponderously soberly said carefully unrolling it and pegging it to the traverse board and waving a ships boy forward with a better lanthorn so they could see it ah your initial estimate of landfall near saint vincent should this slant of wind persist sir may be correct and though the weather may plague us i know of no shoals or reefs to the lee of the windwards sir winwood was hopeless lewrie thought following the mans ruler and coursetracing finger on the chart he seemingly had no sense of humour onduty or off a hurricane do you think captain lewrie peel asked of him clutching his windflagged blanket close round his chest and shoulders hurricane winds usually veer more northerly first as mister winwood may tell you mister peel lewrie told him the counterclockwise rotation demonstrably proven throughout years of observation mister peel is not present here winwood said though this is the season for them he trailed off shrugging damme is he actually pullin peels leg lewrie wondered grinning at the seeming jape no just bein his own cautious self pardons captain but the hands are all on deck and standing by braces and sheets mr adair reported very well mister adair put the helm up a point and ease the set of the sails lewrie bade him seeing lts langlie and catterall now on deck in case something went amiss uhm lt adair quailed for a second at the enormity of the task which had just fallen on his slim barely experienced shoulders obviously hoping that mr langlie the first lieutenant would supplant him aye aye sir lewrie paced uphill to the windward bulwarks to observe with the fingers of his right hand crossed in the pocket of his storm coat his left elbow braced over the caprail and his left leg straddling a taut thick breeching rope of a larboard quarterdeck carronade after a moment he took his hand from his pocket crooked a finger and bade lt langlie to join him evening sir langlie said doffing his hat which let a gust of wind dance his romantic dark curls has to learn sometime lewrie commented jutting his chin at mr adair now standing by the forrud quarterdeck rail and the nettings with a brass speakingtrumpet to his mouth and bawling orders do you have any qualms mister langlie hes a good seasoned lad sir langlie replied and just as smart as paint hell cope with it i expect and if he dont well here you are mister langlie ready for anything lewrie chuckled leaning close to langlies ear so that his words didnt reach his juniormost officer soon as weve eased her strike topmasts this may blow out by dawn but better safe than sorry id admire did you oversee that sir and id expect mister adair will be much relieved that you do take charge until we have her reefed down snug then let him finish the middle watch alone aye sir langlie answered grinning in secret with lewrie course now soueast by east sir adair shouted up to them a moment later broad reaching ready to hand staysls and outer jibs carry on mister adair lewrie shouted back forcing himself to slouch against the railings and direct his attention outboard far up to weather in search of the coming storm though once weve done and hes come offwatch mister langlie you will inform him that my order book requires that i be summoned much earlier than he did gently mister langlie hmmm lewrie suggested to langlie a sly grin on his face a tooconfident officer of the watch is about as dangerous as one with none i half suspect hes realised his mistake sir langlie said in return and sometimes it isnt overconfidence that keeps the watch officer mum but the fear of looking foolish or incapabletil it is indeed much too late sir ill have him supervise the lowering of the foremast tophamper thats a task that wont make him feel as if we distrust his abilities sir an excellent idea mister langlie thankee do so aye sir take reefs next so no one aloft is in too much danger mister langlie lewrie instructed as the first few patters of raindrops hit his bare head and face get her flatter on her bottom so the handsre not flung halfway to the horizon a brisk and efficient halfhours labour later and hms proteus was rigged for heavy weather with furled and gasketed tgallants and royals yards and the topmasts lowered to the decks bound snug among the piles of spare spars on the boattier beams with both fore and main courses taken in one reef and all three topsls at two reefs only the main topmast staysl still flying twixt the main and the fore mast and the two innermost jibs on the bow still standing to balance her spanker and helm effort by then it was raining buckets whitecaps and white horses to windward rose heaved and curled stark closeaboard but they werent breaking or flying spume off the wavetops yet and the winds though gusting and moaning now and again were weaker than the gust front which had preceded the rain lewrie sat and steamed in his impermeable storm coat and worst oldest hat hed had his canvas slingchair fetched up and lashed to the larboard side near the mizenmast shrouds where he could keep a wary eye on things something else for older more senior officers to chide him for should they ever see it that chair real tarryhanded tarpaulin men lived and died on their feet when on deck never stuck a hand in a pocket never slouched or leaned on anything never had a wee nap either lewrie held to most concepts about how a seacaptain should behave even the one about holding the power of life and death of being the nextbest thing to god when sailing independently but did god have an idle streak well then savin mself for important chores he oft told himself as he once flore did that night fore called trise to the occasion didnt god himselfnot make and mend the first sunday after six days work at creatin the world that hard a week idve caulked away the seventh the striking of six bells of the middle watch roused him from a soggy nod with a grunted mmmph three in the morning and an hour til all hands were summoned again to scrub decks it was still black as a boot and the seas were still lively but the frigate was easier in her motion no longer yawing as she scaled the waves no longer in full cry of working timbers nor jerksnubbing twisting when meeting a wave as her bow dipped she sat firmly on her starboard shoulder to the press of wind and the faint wails aloft were the keens of passage not torment he rose and stretched undid the buttons of his storm coat and let out the trapped sweaty air letting the coat be swept abaft of his hips and chest by god but the forceful airs were almost nippycool as refreshing as a rare shore bath in a brass or copper hiptub off went his hat to allow the winds to have their way to cool his scalp to recomb his locks and the fitful rain to rinse away a weeks worth of oils and dander fitful rain hmmm he took note it no longer pummeled him or slanted in like stinging grapeshot in point of fact half the drops he felt were large dollops windstripped from sails and rigging aloft he heard gurgles above the soughing roar of proteus hull slicing a firm way over the waves scuppers to loord were open and rainwater sheeted cross the angled deck to go gargling out alee canvas scoops led fresh clean water into spare casks and smaller kegs and a workparty under the purser mr cootes direction were trundling caught barrels on their lower rims to the edge of the companionway hatches to be lashed or bowsed firmly in place til dawn when they would be lowered down to the orlop giving them a few more days of stores with which to keep the sea just that much longer in search of their foes lewrie went forward to the nearest chute tore off his storm coat and bent over it for an impromptu shower wishing he had his bar of soap handy thoroughly rinsing his hair scrubbing his face and chest restoring his alertness wishing that he could shed all of his clothing swing the scoop over a little and lay and wallow on deck in the steady stream without sacrificing his dignity the keg was full to hell with it lift the end there direct it at me lewrie ordered there even clad in shirt and sloptrousers he turned under the spurts rinsing salt crystals mildew and old sweat from his clothes first then perhaps cleaning his skin beneath second god thatll wake you up he exclaimed for the water was as cool as the dying storm winds while his hands stood about and gawped with broad smiles on their faces everyone take the opportunity for a good scrub while it lasted men oh aye sir a sailor agreed een got up enough lather tshave with sir another said for salt water would never lather with soap and the usual issue for bodily use was a meagre cup a day but for the happenstance of a rain shower drunk our fill for oncet we did capum a third chortled whos got the cup then lewrie cried give it here and caught two full wooden piggins of sweet fresh rainwater from the canvas scoop and downed them like a sweaty smith ah thankee rare treat that carry on men and after we take noon sights well double the water ration for one day at least now weve enough to go around sated indeed with his belly sloshing which forced a belch from his lips lewrie picked up his storm coat draped it over one arm put his hat on and paced back to the helm and the waiting mr adair who had less than an hour left of the middle watch mister adair he said peering at the compass bowl captain sir the winds easing and the seas not as boisterous course is still soueast by east though i do believe she might abide our standing a touch closer to the wind again sir our run by dead reckoning mister adair lewrie asked uhm halfhour casts of the log sir adair said fumbling a soggy sheet of folded paper from the breast pocket of his coat his marks had been made with a stub of metallic lead and done in the dark or the faint binnacle glow so his accounting was extremely difficult to read but adair found a way to decypher it ten knots then eight nine knots even reefed and eased lewrie caught himself counting on his fingers to keep track a spell of ten knots during gusts of the storm three casts in a row hmmm at least twenty miles alee of our former course sir and about thirty miles forrud over the ground sorry adair puzzled out at last mister winwood leave his precious chart did he mister adair aye sir in the cabinet lewrie fetched it out and knelt under the lit binnacle straining his eyes to find the finely pencilled marks of their course using a handy pair of dividers and a parallel ruler to estimate the deviation and pace it out to leeward on soueast by east well damme mister adair lewrie said rising even if the wind shifts back to the noreast well spend another day beating back westnorwest to make it up or miss antigua completely put us into the lee of guadeloupe even if we could return to our old course this instant and what was so important about putting into english harbour on antigua lewrie wondered was it a mere courtesy call to let the local admiral know that they were in his waters but not under his command on secret business did peel have someone to meet there with intelligence which might await him that was that vital to their mission he rather doubted it guadeloupe though was south of antigua and not by much just about as much as theyd lost during the stormif they stayed on a course a little to leeward of their old one even if the trades swung back where they belonged guadeloupe the last french stronghold in the antillesand now guillaume choundass lair lewrie bent under the binnacle lamp to study the chart just one more time tracing a nail to the eastrd aye mister adair the wind has eased he said rolling up the chart and stowing it away try to brace her up a point to windward a halfpoint if thats all shell tolerate and hold it til the end of watch and inform mister langlie when he replaces you he paced back up to his rightful place to windward took hold of the bulwarks and gripped trying to divine what message the sea sent up his arms they were too far out to feel the return waves from the lee shore of the distant islands but in his minds eye he could see hms proteus at tomorrows dawn perhaps halfway up the coast above basseterre the main leeside port on guadeloupe ready to raise merry hell with any shipping he encountered thankee god he whispered aloft for a heavensent slant o wind now could you give me just one more chapter ten lt jules hainaut looked about the decks of his small schooner a captured american trader only sixtyfour feet on the range of the deck and tried to savour his temporary command for as long as it lasted tried to tamp down his disappointment that it was only for the day and that le maitre captain choundas seemed averse to ever letting him free god forbid but ever since choundas had learned that his bete noire was in the caribbean the monstrous old ogre had come over all protective as if hed not risk his pet his like a son to me protege beyond his sight until lewrie and proteus had been eliminated by his other experienced pets desplan griot and macpherson the talented the promising the mature merde alors but it made hainaut feel like a mewling infant a kitten with its eyes barely open and vulnerable to the backgarden crows whod carry it off like a ripe worm limpudente her american name had been saucy was not even the captaines to give him for she was basically the yardboat governorgeneral hugues used to tour his coastal fortifications or sail to marie galante island with his friends wenches and baskets of wine and food for his occasional romps a faded neglected yacht capitaine choundas despised long trips in coaches and a riding horse was pure torture on his mangled body sowhen he had decided to accompany the le bouclier frigate to basseterre to complete her lading for her first aggressive cruise he needed a comfortable way to return and limpudente was available follow us to basseterre jules choundas had ordered and i will take passage back to pointeapitre with you try not to run her aground mon cher msieur hugues would never forgive me if you wreck her and he already despises me enough hed saidwithout humour even that was galling as if hainaut had never been a tarpaulin man a welltrained matelot boathandler or aspirant who had stood a watch by himself well for one day at least he was not a papershuffling lieutenant de vaisseau a mere catchfart to his master he had challenged limpudents lethargic crew to sail her as she was meant to be sailed had infused them with enthusiasm and had heated their blood with a doleout of navalissue arrack the fierce but coarse brandy before he even got the schooner away from the dock with a promise of double the usual wine ration with their noon meal if they showed that magnificent frigate a clean pair of heels and danced a quadrille round her even with a weeded bottom and both running and standing rigging in need of reroving or replacement l impudente could dance under all the sail she could bear hed stood out with the wind up her skirts to carve graceful figures beyond the harbour moles to wait for le bouclier then once on course southwest then west he had weaved her about from one side of the frigates bows to the other sometimes falling back to pace her alee then up to windward ducking under her stern and pretending to fire raking broadsides into her transom capitaine desplan and his officers and the frigates eager crew had first goodnaturedly jeered them then later cheered them as the aptly named schooner had taunted and flirted about her hainaut didnt see capitaine choundas peering over the side during his antics which was disappointing as he strove so hard to prove himself a trustworthy shiphandler but surely the others were telling him limpudente had threaded the middle of the fivemilewide channel between the vieux fort and the island of terredebas in the saintes with antics done for a while and the frigate finally spreading enough sail to threaten to run her down dead astern of her in the deeps that limpudente was sounding she stood out a good six kilometers hainaut was iffy when it came to the new measurements that the directory had invented but in the old measurements he was sure he was out far enough to miss any reefs or shoals and would not damage their governorgenerals little playpretty he had turned north with the trades a bit ahead of abeam and the lithe schooner had gathered speed and heeled dashing spray as high as the middle of her jibs seeming to chuckle in delight to make such a gladsome way as hainaut did onward rocking and romping ranting over the bright sea until he was far above basseterre and stood offandon to allow the frigate to sail in and anchor first far from any risk of falling foul of her at last he angled in toward the harbour which was no true harbour at all just a leeside road off the town and its quayside street his crew ready to shorttack once he turned her up eastward planning to ghost in alongside le bouclier once she had both anchors down heu lieutenant the schooners permanent bosun said from the tillerhead theres something going on astern i think msieur touch more lee helm timmonier hainaut told the helmsman as he stepped past the long tiller sweep to the taffrail to raise his telescope a particularly fine one looted from the same disgraced admiral who had supplied his smallsword mon dieu merde alors hainaut spat in alarm the bloodies hard tmiss thank god lewrie said pointing his telescope its tubes collapsed at the volcano of la soufriere to the southeast and the other peak at the north end of the island that was just about as tall it appears well make landfall just about level with a town called mister winwood deshaies sir the sailing master informed him after a quick peek at his chart about seven miles offshore id make it before we bear away due south close enough lewrie said with a wolfish grin on his phyz as he paced about near the windward ladderhead which would soon be the engaged side if most french ships were inshore if theyve watchers ashore well sail faster than a messenger can ride and if they have semaphore towers it dont signify panic and bags o shit thats what were here for after all though i simply dont understand why we havent seen a single one of our warships all the way here its possible sir that most of them are lurking to windward of the island lt langlie commented where they can snatch prizes it is not love but booty that this iron age applauds do ye know lewrie cited not above borrowing from mr peels stock of erudite quotes though the latin had quite flown his head tibullus i believe aha speakin o booty he lifted his glass to eye a schooner of decent size that stood abeam the wind close inshore but heading outward inshore of her was a small ship fullrigged and threemasted that was also standing out to sea as if she hadnt a care or an enemy in the world time to hoist the false tricolours mister langlie he said aye aye sir and do i have tfire a salute to their governorgeneral id not bemoan the waste o powder either lewrie chuckled all in the best of causes aint it mister peel alls fair in love and war that remains to be seen captain lewrie peel frostily said by his side his nose was still out of joint that no argument he offered could dissuade the mercurial capt lewrie from his enterprise though peel had to admit that lewries preparations had been little short of masterful proteuss masts and spars right to the yardarm ends had been painted in the french fashion two large tricolour flags flew from the mainmast truck and spanker and even her sails had been altered with wet woodash from the galley fires brushed on to mimic the different seaming system of french sailmakers her own sailmaker mr rayne and his crew had basted the jibs to appear narrowercut and had raised up the roach at the jibs feet before painting false seams the bastings could quickly be freed by firm yanks on the spunyarn smallstuff twine returning proteus to fullbellied sailpower in a twinkling lastly despite his protestations that the private signals not be used except in the most important circumstances mr peel had been forced to turn them over with lewrie committed to his madness and his officers and crew so exuberantly enamoured of the plan he could do no less no matter that their use this day would clue the french to changing them the day after shes making a hoist sir lt adair cried standing aft with the signals midshipman and afterguard an interrogative followed by a string of numeral flags mister peel lewrie said turning to their resident spy ah uhm peel muttered lifting a heavy borrowed telescope to his eye trying to keep the schooner in the ocular and focussed with the frigate bounding and rolling beneath him it is the challenge to which we should reply he referred to a sheaf of papers i have it sir lt adair insisted quickly calling numbered flags to the sailors standing by the windward halliards french flags were numbered differently but the stolen private signals book had the coloured illustrations in order to sort them out on this day in the middle tenday of the newfangled french month the proper reply was a fiveflag hoist nine two eleven thirty repeater which signal quickly soared aloft as high as the mizenmast top each bundled flag suddenly blossoming as the light binding twine was shaken out that wont put them off will it lt langlie fretted that were miles more efficient than any frog ship ive seen when it comes to breaking signals sir stead of hanking them on and sending them up straight from the lockers free to fly and hmmm lewrie frowned having not taken that into consideration til now inefficiency wasnt limited to french ships though hed seen signalmen start a hoist with the first flag let it flap near to the bulwarks as the next was attached so the message crawled up one item at a time mister peel whats a merchantman doing with naval private signals he asked instead could she be a privateer very possibly a privateer or a captured merchant ship turned to naval use captain lewrie peel answered with an equal frown was she sloppy at her hoist mister adair lewrie demanded a tad sir aye lt adair agreed lets call her a privateer then lewrie decided lifting his own telescope til we know better and assume shell take us for a real frog warship with a martinet bastard for a captain compared to their idle ways just so long as it gets us within close cannon shot before her captain figures it out bout two miles now just about sir mr winwood estimated aloud more sails inshore sir midshipman elwes pointed out wee singlemasted fishermen mostlike damme shes making another hoist lt adair groused waving j his signalmen to haul their own quickly down mister peel may i ask your assistance i speak french but translating and sorting out the flags both of course mister adair peel acquiesced despite his opposition to the whole endeavour as long as they were there why not make every effort to pull it off bienvenu from where bound she asks adair called out damme where are we from sir rochefort lewrie quickly extemporised weve cruised along the carolinas with no luck and are short of provisions got chased off by american frigates tell him break it up into three hoists if you can keep em gogglin us mister peel whats a good name for a frog frigate thats been unfortunate at taking prizes uhm lheureux fortunate sir peel said snapping his fingers as if inspired and breaking his first impish grin of the last two days aha yes make it so mister adair quickly lewrie bade aye sir uhm however dye spell that mister peel and now gentlemen lewrie continued turning to his assembled officers let us beat to quarters take your stations and god help the french lt adair had to stay on the quarterdeck instead of going forward to supervise the forrudmost guns and foremast in close cooperation with mr peel and midshipman elwes to sort out the proper flags to convey their fictitious identity and recent past to the inquisitive schooner she a guardacosta lewrie wondered lifting his glass one more time were close enough now i can see semaphore towers ashore but they aint wagging yet waitin for the schooner ttell em who and what we are are they well just you keep on waitin damn you all youll know us soon enough ahem mr winwood said at his side time to turn south along the coast i take it sir lewrie asked with a faint grin taking time to turn and look at him aye captain winwood solemnly agreed with a slow nod very well sir haul our wind and shape the new course aye aye sir shes hauling her wind too sir lt adair announced new hoist damn what does that mean not for us mister adair lewrie snapped let it pass this time theres a semaphore station halfway up yonder mountain thats working its arms can they not read our hoists mostlike theyre asking the schooner to tell em what shes learned as proteus fell off the trades to take the wind on her larboard quarter the schooner angled out from the coast to close her the gaffhung fore and main sails winged and bellied out as she wore across the wind and approached at a angle aiming as if to meet proteus bowsprit to bowsprit the range dropped rapidly as the frigates crew settled down beside their greatguns or knelt below the bulwarks with muskets a keeneyed observer might have noticed that proteus had her gunports free to swing outboard a few inches with each roll ready to be hauled up and out of the way the second that the order to fire was given the larboard pounders were readyloaded and hauled up close to the bulwarks a few last tugs on the tackles would jut their snouts into firing position the flintlock strikers were so far uncocked but primed with the firing lanyards already in the guncaptains hands but held loosely the focsle carronades the quarterdeck carronades were manned behind closed ports only a few designated men allowed to appear above the bulwarks to slouch idle prepared to wave until the trap was to be sprung it was a rare french man o war that fitted carronades so far in this war the sight of them would have been a dead giveaway half mile lewrie muttered from the side of his mouth about that aye sir lt langlie agreed striving to appear casual and inoffensive as he paced about the quarterdeck lewrie strode to the helm and took up a brass speakingtrumpet then shambled back to the bulwarks as if he had all the time in the world wouldnt harm a flea and had the most pacific intentions just about ready to smile wave widely and speak the frog schooner he held the speakingtrumpet high in plain sight and as the range got shorter and shorter he could see the schooners captain standing with his own amplifying device by her starboard lee rails waiting for the chance to speak him too evidently the semaphore station had been satisfied for after a brief flurry of spinning telegraph arms it had gone inert again one quick scan of the windward horizon showed lewrie that the fishing boats were still casting their nets the threemasted ship still stood out to sea a little beyond their bows would pass to leeward about a mile off off the harbour town of basseterre the frigates putative destination lewrie thought he could see another threemaster with weary tanstained sails a ship he took for another merchantman standing out to sea he got a glimpse of a larger threemaster entering harbour brailing up as she ghosted shoreward close to basseterre was another schooner rounding off sir lt langlie cautioned sure enough at a distance of no more than a british cable the schooner had swung about to run alongside them allo msieur the schooners captain called with his brass trumpet to his lips ici labeille le navire de guerre auxiliare the bee mr peel snickered as he came up to the windward to lewries side no matter naval custom against him being there unasked who just got stung lewrie chortled run out and fire ports skreaked open to thud against the upper bulwarks tackle sheaves squealed and heavy carriage trucks rumbled like a stampede of cattle as the guns were run out the last few feet false flags down lewrie shouted hed made that mistake long ago when first as commander of the jester sloop and had caught a grim packet for it no matter how successful his ruse de guerre had been he had strictly cautioned the mids and signalmen to haul the tricolours down and get their own ensigns up as soon as the ports opened but halfway aloft lewrie thought close enough for kings work he looked forward to lt catterall who stood in the middle of the gundeck with his sword drawn and held high over his shoulder who was looking most anxiously back at him fire lewrie shouted as his true colours reached the tops on the downroll fire lt catterall bawled three pounder carronades doubleshotted with solid balls and what amounted to a small keg of plumsized grapeshot and thirteen pounders each loaded with two balls went off almost as one creating a sudden murderous avalanche of metal and a choking cloud of sulfurous reeking smoke propelled windward punctured by the flight of the shot that only slowly drifted back over their own decks then alee as the hands sprang to sponge and swab out to charge and then reload the barrels to prime the locks and begin to grunt and slave to run out for another broadside but another broadside would not be necessary the schooner was a converted trading vessel with thin civilian scantlings framed with the parsimony of a skinflint yankee doodle with light timbers put farther apart than naval practice she was a shambles both masts were sheared off just above her ravaged bulwarks and she looked like a pheasant that had been gutshot by a lucky closein blast from a fowlers shotgun her starboard side bore so many ragged shotholes some right on her waterline already gurgling and frothing with dirty spume and foetid venting air from belowdecks that there was no hope of saving her theyd punched her almost to a full stop and she was already listing to starboard as if to hide her hurts hold fire mister catterall lewrie shouted forrud no need for another drop it lads deadun wait til we corner the next rat mister langlie helm up and hands to the braces lay us closeaboard yon threemaster just off our starboard bow aye sir the first officer barked looking greedy as he began to issue quick instructions mister catterall secure the larboard battery next victim we will engage to starboard the runtsized fullrigged ship quavered as if shocked before her topmen began to scramble aloft to free more sail as hands sprang to the braces to wear her a little off the wind to run due west winds on her starboard quarter which obviously was her best point of sail puts me in mind of a dutchman sir mr winwood commented to his captain his face screwed up in concentration after a long study with his telescope a tad shorter than your avrage threemaster a lot beamier and her bows bluffer shallower draughted too id expect lewrie added bound to be slow as treacle even did she have a full gale up her skirts wont get far i doubt sir winwood said with a even rarer sniff of satisfaction nigheven pleasure even broke a faint smile on his phyz the usually stolid sailing master rubbed his hands together with a sandy rasping of a practiced tarpaulin man inured to ropes and exposure half his entire life small she might be shabby she might be but the merchant ship was deeply laden with something sure to be valuable if she was dutch she was very far from home and a very rare sight in the caribbean with most of the socalled batavian republics colonies occupied by british forces holland was occupied by the french but it was a cooperative occupation so lewrie had heard the ideals of the french revolution had found fertile soil in a fair number of dutch hearts who had aided the earlier american revolution so eagerly allied with the frogs sailing from a french port the merchant ship was surely up to something nefarious in aid of some joint scheme she might be gunnl deep with arms and munitions for saint domingue she was sailing deeper into the caribbean not for home shed be what was termed good prize no wonder mr winwood was rubbing his hands together so gladlyhe was already assessing his share of her capture and sale it was too bad lewrie thought that he was counting chickens thatd never hatch steer direct up her stern mister langlie lewrie ordered i wish to get up to pistolshot before we bear up and rake her youll not try to uhm mr winwood gasped scandalised by the loss of guineas might be a frigate i saw off basseterre mister winwood he told the sailing master no time to fetchto and sway out boats for a boardingparty well one boat perhaps so we may set her afire and be certain shes a total loss sorry my savings could use infusions of prizemoney too but he swung back to look at the threemaster now pinned like some struggling butterfly on proteus jibboom and bowsprit as the frigate bore a touch alee of her as if to intersect her course and swing about due west to present the previously used larboard battery a flag from the batavian republic now flew above her tall galleried stern windows it was too far for lewrie to shout advice to the dutch captain though he did glare at the stout figure by her taffrail and pushed his thoughts at him strike fool fore im forced tkill you chapter eleven now where is he going capitaine de vaisseau guillaume choundas dyspeptically said peering out over the taffrail of le bouclier as she drummed and thundered to the last of the orderly chaos of a ship come to anchor into the wind topmen were aloft fisting the last sails by the brails to the yards after the topsls had bellied flat aback when she had steered noreast to brake to a stop men of the afterguard on the quarterdeck swarmed around him to strain against the mizen topsl and tgallant halliards and jears to lower the yards to the crosstree and fightingtop more men stood by the after capstan with the kedge anchors messenger line already fleeted about the capstan drum waiting for the stern kedge to be rowed out with le boucliers stoutest cutter and dropped the frigate was faintly shuddering as she made a slight sternway falling back from her best bower paying out scope on cable run out through the larboard hawsehole beginning to snub to the resistance of a wellgrounded anchor he is having the time of his life msieur capitaine desplan answered with an indulgent chuckle your pardons but he has so many stern responsibilities for such a spirited young man and he serves a most demanding master nestce pas choundas painfully turned to glare at desplan wondering if his comments were any sort of criticism but no desplan still smiled as if he had no reason to cringe from choundass wrath she is shabby and badly maintained msieur but that schooner handles as lively as a thoroughbred stallion desplan went on once we would have relished such sport until stern duty and command of ships and squadrons forced us to growl at the world to be that free and young again ah what a brief joy to dance with your very first little ship msieur remember umph choundas finally allowed i do indeed la colombe she was named a despatchboat she too was an american schooner aptly named she was she flew like a dove umph well for a brief moment choundas had almost seemed human in sweet reverie of his early days as a newly appointed lieutenant not even a lieutenant de vaisseau yet but that moment swiftly passed and he turned and clumpswishticked back to the taffrail glowering as little limpudente came about and began to gather speed to run into the port at long last perhaps choundas thought jules hainaut had suddenly remembered that the noonday meal that captain desplan would soon serve would be infinitely better than the cheese sausages and vin ordinaire carried aboard the schooner in a palmetto hamper he was waving even if the schooner was nearly a mile or more off all of them mon dieu captain desplan suddenly exclaimed grunting as if suddenly punched in the abdomen msieur choundas the semaphore it sends the alarm signal what choundas slowly turned to watch the long arms of the semaphore tower swish pause then swish to a new bit of its message an urgent signal that repeatedenemy in sight capitaine desplan choundas growled of a sudden stamping the ferrule of his cane on the deck get this ship underway at once if you have to cut your anchor cables do it vite vite before you lose her the bloodies are paying us a visit ponderously choundas turned to look out to sea once more out beyond the canted masts of hainauts onrushing schooner he could see a pall of sour greybrown smoke a few miles away could see the topsls and courses of a threemasted ship headed south see a smaller ship to the left of the smoke pall that was turning to run one that would be a prize capture before the halfhour glass would turn sudden boiling rage surged up his throat made him wish to howl and jibber at the slackness the inattention of the signal stations up the coast the idle workaday shamblers pretending to maintain watch and where was that commandeered schooner he had posted to the leeward coast of basseterre to guard against such a raid if despite his sternest warnings and implied threats those hapless islandborn creole timeservers had decided to tuck into the lee of pointe allegre and fish or go ashore for a leisurely threehour meal they would learn that his threats were not empty that even close ties to governor hugues would not save them but nohe could not must not bellow and stamp as he wished le bouclier caught in the middle of the evolution of anchoring and taking in all sail was already a madhouse her captain mates and senior officers already made enough noise to interrupt their matelots work then rush to undo all their labours of the past quarterhour and get way on her again besides he was guillaume choundas le hideux the ugly monster whom all feared one thoughtless rant and that useful aura of terror would evaporate leaving him recalled as just another panicky officer whod windmilled his arms and floundered then people would laugh at his haplessness and his disfigurements making him a pitiable object of fun with no real authority or respect no he could only stand by the flag lockers and taffrail lanthorns leaning his bad leg against them and drum impatient fingers on the silver handle of his cane in an outward sham of calm as if he were quickly scheming but aflame with murderous rage the slack captain of that guardship would pay and this bloody anglais too once this marvellous frigate got sorted out and under sail there was still a chance to salvage things such as his successful reputation and his continued career helm down mister langlie lewrie ordered as the struggling merchantman pressed on westerly course due south for a bit lieutenant catterall rake her as you bear aye aye sir catterall shouted back as mystified as anyone else aboard aghast at the idea of passing up such a rich prize of not even firing a warning shot to force her to strike proteus hauled up more to windward sailors on the sailtending gangways freeing braces to let the yards swing to ease the press of the wind and the increasing heel that might angle the artillery too low open ports catterall cried run out and guncaptains aim low as you bear fire he slashed down his sword though no gun had yet crossed the dutch ships stern just a few breaths more and standing between the guns catteralls view was limited to the bulwarks and the open gunports the crossdeck beams over his head with rowing boats stowed in chocks to starboard there was the gangway now full of marines with their levelled muskets the end of proteus mainmast course sail the ordered tangle of the dutch ships mizenmast rigging spanker topsl and tgallant and that batavian republic flag that was just starting to be lowered catterall glanced aft at captain lewrie standing foursquare by the rolledhammock reenforced quarterdeck rails and netting that overlooked the gundeck surely hed call for fire to be checked before it was too late before now theyd struck the pounder bowchaser and pounder carronade mounted on the forecastle went off almost as one a sharpish barking instantly echoed by a titanic booming followed by the foremost pounder longbarrel gun in the starboard battery as it slammed backwards in recoil doubleshotted catterall turned back to the target even more mystified mouth open to reduce the pummeling on his eardrums as guns closer to him lit off and hurled themselves inboard looked up as the marines with their confiscated yankeemade rifles chose targets and volleyed up above them and the gangway bulwark rather significant chunks of timbers and gilded pieces of the dutch merchantmans stern were soaring skyward in a cloud of gunsmoke and punchedfree dirt and paint chips catterall heard the dutch ship scream as her entire stern was hammered in could hear the slamming and rending of the merchantmans guts as roundshot langridge and grapeshot eviscerated her innards as far forward as her foremast snapping stout carline posts knees and hull timbers like so many frail toothpicks the broadside swept past him sternward gusting hot foul winds gushing grey thunderheads of spent powder and the quarterdeck carronades bellowing last put paid to the foe catterall could hear human screams this time their flag was down blown down but the captain was not calling the cease fire proteus wore about to the west as catteralls gunners reloaded and ran out once more to fire into the stricken ship along her larboard side this time leaving him gaping openmouthed unable to feature such deliberate destruction on the downroll mister catterall sink the bitch he heard not bad not bad at all lewrie allowed as proteus wore about sutherly after her second crushing broadside they had blown her stern in shot away both rudder and transom post then punched great holes on the waterline where the everhungry sea now sucked and surged into her remorselessly the merchantmans mizenmast had been sheered off belowdecks had swivelled and fallen forward into her mainmasts rigging to drag that shottorn assembly into ruin as well to drape her larboard side like a funeral shroud shes afire too sir lt langlie pointed out his arm extended toward her bows where her galley fire still smouldering under the steeptubs and grills so soon after feeding her complement had spilled from the bricklined pits catching fresh fuel alight hot air rippled up from below distorted and wavering like the air over a forge thin skeins of smoke jetted from the gaps in her deck planks or side scantlings as if bellowsdriven with now and then a wink of tiny yellow flamelets peekabooing over the bulwarks saves us the trouble of stopping to light her ourselves was the grimly satisfied reply he got from captain lewrie she began to strike her colours captain lewrie peel accused i dont see why you had to damn you sir lewrie barked turning on him my word is law aboard this ship and ill thankee to remember it her flag still flew her captain had not yielded her up and ive no time to line my purse with an enemy man o war in the offing dye hear me plain sir i will be forced to report that peel retorted stung to the quick by such harsh ungentlemanly language such a sudden challenge damn what you report mister peel lewrie sneered his hands clasped behind his back leaning forward from the waist his face close to peels forcing him to take half a step backwards we came here to inspire terror mister peel fear of us greater than any that bogeyman choundas carries with him in their navy their privateers their merchantmen alike sir but peel was weakly forced to object taken aback by this new bloodthirsty aspect to a man hed always considered competent but too flibbertigibbet the consequences our repute now you just contemplate the implications of that why dont you mister peel lewrie continued in a softer voice with slyness creeping onto his face while we try our metal with yon frog frigate mister langlie lewrie barked spinning away shape course to stand seaward of the port with the wind a touch forrud of abeam for greater speed i want us at close quarters with that frigate before she gets a goodly way on shes still bowson to the town maybe had anchors down before being alerted he lifted his glass to peer hungrily at her measuring speed and distance warily overestimating how quickly she could cut cables and make sail giving the french the benefit of the doubt as to how wellprepared they would be by the time proteus was level with her choundas was rumoured to have come in a frigate was this his under his direct command or not her captain and officers had to be a cut above the usual jumpedup radicals with skills gone rusty for spending too long in harbour lewrie hoped the enemy frigate was the one based on guadeloupe before choundas arrivedbut he wasnt ready to wager the lives of his crew on this being the case mister catterall load and then secure the starboard battery lewrie called to his second officer then doubleshot the larboard to the muzzles with grape langridge starshot barshot and chainshot hop to it lads were going to skin the monsoors alive vite vite vite choundas muttered under his breath as if he could will desplan and his crew to quicker preparation the cables had been cut anchors bedamned and the bitter ends not even buoyed for later recovery they could always take new ones from a fearful merchantman courses had been freed by energetic young topmen who had slashed the gaskets away clew lines had been freed by men on deck and the sails let fall on their own not eased down fore course and topsl were now laid flat aback their masts and the jibs were fully hoisted then drawn by human force to starboard to get their frigates head down alee the spanker over the after quarterdeck shivered as men of the afterguard tailed on the sheets to drag it over to starboard as well to force le boucliers stern to walk windward and twist her more windabeam to work her off the town blocks sheaves cried and squeaked as her main and mizen topsl yards crept up off the rests one snaillike foot at a time to choundass impatient eyes the enemy ship was hullup now dashing down upon them with a bone in her teeth all but her main course drawing well and that sail showing but a single reef so far was fate merciful choundas thought they might brail it up to reduce the threat of fire from the sparks of her own gunnery reducing her speed giving his own frigate a chance he looked over the stern down the long transom post past the massive pintles and gudgeons and the wide tapered slab of the rudder choundas felt a cold bleak despair settle in his stomach as if hed gulped down a sorbet too quickly even with the rudder hardover the sea round its blade only barely swirled little stronger than a spoon in a cup of coffee a flowing tide would spin eddies greater than that he stood erect shambled about to his right to lay hold of the larboard taffrail lanthornpostand found a cause for sudden hope the steeple of a church ashore was no longer pinned over the larboard catheads but was now roughly amidships right over the larboard entryport she was moving falling off and making way vite vite sacrebleu vite he urgently whispered what should we do msieur the petty officer normally in command of l impudente asked of his temporary amateur captain get ready to fight of course lt jules hainaut responded mon dieu merde alors the petty officer almost whimpered but with what msieur he waved a hand at limpudentes open deck and low bulwarks where nested a pitiful set of six pounder popguns the shot racks beside them holding a skimpy allotment of balls there were iron stanchions set into the railings for swivelguns mere pounders or pounders so light that a single man could heave them up from belowempty at the moment as bare as a whores arse with what we have marinier hainaut chuckled back honour demands it are the swivels below not rusted in a heap oui some the petty officer shrugged in reply shot and cartridge bags uhm oui aussi but then fetch them up at least four of them if we indeed have four hainaut patiently ordered and place them two to each beam for now i might wish all four on one side later depending load them then man the deckguns the petty officers jaw dropped he almost dared to roll eyes in derisiondid roll them as he swung an arm at the fifteen men in the crew officeur uhm hainaut more sternly said gaston msieur the burly man supplied you have met my master capitaine choundas what do you think he would do with the frenchmen who shied away from battle how angry do you think that he already is after this hell be looking for any one or any thing on which to work off his wrath eu merde the petty officer gasped paling quickly oui i see your point msieur lieutenant to arms mes amis to arms fetch up the swivelguns vite vite hainaut held his amusement in check as he watched his crewmen scurrying to cast off the bowsings and lashings on the deckguns scuttling below to fetch up swivels and powder charges guntools and more shot limpudente still stood outward on starboard tack with the wind a bit before her beam and with the british frigate bearing down on her like nemesis hainaut thought of a sudden recalling a scrap of classic lore that capt choundas had crammed into his head whether he liked it or not his schooner would pass out to sea a good mile before the enemys course and his could intersect and limpudente could be well out of her starboard batterys certain range the frigate might try her eye on him but it would be random and poorly directed with low odds of a hit he would be as safe as a babe in its mothers arms no it was the appearance of bellicosity that was needed here he smugly told himself once the frigate was off his own stern as he held this course he would tack limpudente and come about to tail her a few pinprick irritations up her stern enough to be seen and remembered by otherssuch hopeless bravery against such horrid oddsand his master capitaine choundas could no longer deny such a plucky fellow a ship of his own could he even better lt hainaut fantasised it didnt look as if today would be a good day for the doughty capitaine desplan his dashing frigate was going to be pummeled unless she got under way a lot faster and she would barely have time to settle on a course and get her people to their battle stations before the foe was on her poor poor navy hainaut moresoberly contemplated always the butt of the joke not like the tales i heard coming up in the royal french fleet not like how equal the challenge we could make during the last war now the republic needs dashing plucky captains to take on the bloodies captains like moi and if his master was slain in the battle to come or crippled even more to the point that he could no longer function well what a pity quel dommage if le bouclier lost a lieutenant or two resulting in a shuffle from the corvettes to staff her leaving vacancies on the other warships his chances for advancement would be just as good what is that british toast i heard he muttered to himself as he manned the tillerbar alone ah heres to a bloody war or a sickly season chapter twelve pot thisun too sir lt langlie asked as a saucy schooner hared off to leeward below their bows about half a mile off lewrie balefully looked at the potential prey then forrud one more time juggling speed and time three minutes more he reckoned and proteus would just about be in close range of the french frigate his gun crews had both batteries loaded and already run out ready for firing ready prepared in their minds as well to dash over to the starboard side lever shift and take aim at the schooner that was opening the range rapidly then take time to swab out charge reload and run out then dash back to larboard and just get their breath back before engaging a real foe no itd only unsettle them at that moment they were oaksteady whilst his view through his glass showed a french crew still at sixes and sevens all atwitter and thinking dire fretful thoughts he hoped dont think so mister langlie lewrie decided a waste of shot and powder mister larkin he called to his seediest midshipman aye sor the little bogirish crisply replied in his paddy accent lifting his right hand to knuckle his hat keep a weathereye on yon schooner and sing out if she comes back on the wind lewrie ordered aye oi i will sor sir larkin amended blushing very good mister larkin now gentlemen lets be about it lewrie said rubbing his hands together in anticipation i think we will take a page from their book of tactics this morning gentlemen mister catterall your first broadside from the larboard battery will be on the upxo quoins out take her masts and rigging down at about two cables range second broadside you will fire on the pent of the scend doubleshotted twixt wind and water and hull her from then on aye aye sir no matter how sternly a british warship was disciplined and no matter how coolheaded her people were to act when at quarters during a battle between ships the men could not help but snicker grin and nudge each other were they about to serve their foes something novel something clever and unexpected and this time was no exception alan lewrie could almost grin in expectation too thinking about barshot chainshot and bags of grapeshot waiting in the hard iron barrels of his guns a few hands took time to look back at him as he stood over them at the break of the quarterdeck beaming with pleasure at his slyboots knackiness ships boyservants crouched round the companionway hatches and on the ladders that led below with leather cartridge cases ready for the second broadside guncaptains had already selected their roundest truest pounder shot two per barrel for a second doubleshotted broadsidethe best from the garlands without filedaway rust patches the tiny dimples and slices that would have been ignored or hidden in the rush of battle by an extra glob of blacking but that would send them caroming offaim when loosed brail up the main course mister langlie lewrie said with an upward glance winds freshening we still cut a fine feather without it the last cast of the log had shown nigh ten knots and steering soueast with the trades fine on the larboard quarter their frigate would still keep a goodly speed perhaps a whole eight knots proteus was aroar with the slick bustle of her passage her bow waves twin creaming mustachioes that hissedsang down her flanks four cables now do you judge it mister winwood under four sir the sailing master responded after a ponder and a squint or two nearing three three seven hundred and twenty yards hmmm ready to come to due south mister langlie when i call two cables is our boy lewrie lifted his glass for a final look at their foe topmen were sliding down from aloft her fightingtops were still being manned but her scurrying crew was now mostly out of sight behind or below her bulwarks slaving away at her starboard guns mostlikely there he saw the frigates gunports begin to hinge upward the muzzles of her greatguns here and there started to emerge in jerks and twitches they aimin high lewrie asked himself thats their usual wont tcripple first usually do it much sooner were they ready to fight take our masts down then close but were already closed aint we two and a half captain mr winwood said tenser and edgier take aim mister catterall lewrie barked take careful aim no rushing men be sure of your shots with nothing wasted by god just cause you wish thear some more loud bangs this lovely mornin slack in those trigger lines now easy wait for it lt catterall was wailing sword held high and almost on his tiptoes in expectation two sir the experienced winwood adjudged at last by broadside on the uproll fire lewrie bellowed over proteus rolled with her sails straining windfull from astern slowly and majestically larboard side dipping then rising up to linger for a breath or two pent atop the gentle scend of inshore waters fire lt catterall howled slashing down dramatically to the deck almost bowed from the waist helm up a point mister langlie lewrie shouted in the roar as all her guns went off together due south again ayeaye sir langlie cried back his voice lost in the din the larboard horizon disappeared in a sudden cumulus of powder smoke that the wind shoved back in their faces keeping pace with them as proteus bowled onwards but slowly thinning to reveal damn my eyes just lovely shootin lewrie crowed eagerly by the larboard bulwark choke on that you snaileatin bastards he said in a chortle that didnt carry too far filled with an impatient legjiggly boys elation as if ready to titter or giggle with the joy of a christmas eves anticipation the french frigates upper masts and sails had been riddled and shattered her main topmasts over the fightingtop had been sheered away completely hanging to windward her mizen topsl had split open and the sailless crojack yard sagged in two in a downward vee her spanker had been shot free of its sheets and was winged out so far that lewrie was seeing it edgeon of its leach ladderlike shrouds showed gaps where starshot or chainshot had scissored them above and below the fightingtop platforms which had been swept clean of sharpshooters and swivelguns her fore topmasts swayed forward ten degrees out of true her mizen topmasts were slowly whipsawing at each long roll by broadside fire lt catterall shrieked as the frigates fell together at an angle gundrunk and lost in battle lust the french reply broadside rushed and disorganised was ragged heavy roundshot howled past in satanic moans and keens amid the gunsmoke tall white feathers of spray leaped skyward as some balls struck short and caromed upwards over the deck missing bulwarks and attacking proteus in her rigging by accident unintentionally cracking upon masts or spars or pillowthumping through rigidly windarced sails even so there were a few parrotsquawks the quick rrawrks of shot striking home twixt wind and water along with the yelps and shrieks of alarm or sudden pain and disbelief as sailors and marines were showered with iron shards or flying splinters some as long as a mans forearm and half as thick well im damned lt langlie cried wiping his face looking outward as the gunsmoke thinned once more sir less she bears up abeam the wind well bowrake her the french frigate had already taken a fearful drubbing at that second broadside great shotholes along her line of midships ports had turned several into one long bloody gash below her gunnls and gundeck her glossy black hull had been punctured leaving starshaped holes and ragged plank ends with one smallish one right on the waterline and music to lewries battered ears the noreast trades bore sounds of fright suffering and consternation as the enemy frigates way fell off from the loss of so much sail and her attempt to swing abeam to them by brute helm force she could not turn quick though could not protect her vitals from a bowrake as you bear fire amid squeals of agony many tortured rrawrks of rivened wood and the pistolpop of stays they bowled shot down her entire length through her flimsier bow planking her foremast tumbled into ruin and her mizen topmasts swayed pivoted then plummeted down taking the broken crojack yard fightingtop and spanker gaff with it burying her quarterdeck in a blizzard of trash cease fire mister catterall lewrie shouted going forward i think the frogsve had their fill of us for a good long while hey lads think weve left a callingcard theyll remember next time then more softly to mr langlie take us dead off the winds sir seaward and alee of the saintes yonder stand ready to wear her onto starboard tack the wind fine on the quarter should it be necessary let fall the main course and sheet home too weve done a good mornings work well not stay to take her sir langlie just had to wonder and risk them getting even a little of their own back mister langlie i think not far as they know we didnt lose a single man and sank or crippled three vessels in an hour let em think on that and be daunted lewrie said with a smug sniff damme what in the hell light shot had moaned overhead smacking through the mizen topsl and tgallant that schooner sor hes up our stern sor mr larkin said so close that lewrie almost tripped over him hands to the braces mister langlie mister catterall you will man the starboard battery once we wear about lewrie snapped and why didnt you alert me mister larkin when i couldnt make ye hear me sor all but tugged at yer coat oi did but niver th larkin spluttered in sudden fear oh lewrie grunted knowing how remiss hed been thankee mister larkin my pardons but i do that sometimes tug away next time if you must it saves our ship and our peoples lives ill not chide you for it shell mostlike duck away cross our stern once weve altered course sir mr winwood sourly supposed perhaps well get lucky and wing her first lewrie replied either way we force her to cut and run then well sail away to the norwest and out of reach of her puny broadsides like shes not worth our attention lewrie paced aft to stand by the taffrail and lifted his telescope then snorted in disgust will you look at this he scoffed shes firing at half a mile perhaps a tad more with fourpounders i expect he guessed as he gauged the keen of a ball passing to larboard well clear of any hope of striking ready to come about sir langlie reported larboard guns secured and the starboard battery manned lewrie watched the schooner haring up their wake swaying back on course after yawing to open her gunarcs for her last broadside did proteus come about shed rapidly lose speed whilst the schooner kept lashing along reducing the range to a quartermile hopefully too quickly for that schooner captain to appreciate his danger one good broadside from his pounders should put the wind up him very well mister langlie new course nornorwest full and by mister larkin run tell lieutenant catterall well be hard on the wind and hes to put the quoins fullin before he fires aye sor sir the little imp happily cried before dashing forward glad to have escaped his captains wrath and to be back in his good books oh dear the sailing master muttered as they watched the wee foeman begin to swing as proteus too began to heel over and change course but the poor fellow just chose the wrong tack to take sir lets hope we make his life a little more exciting the next few moments sir lewrie snickered stand by they could hear lt catterall shouting faintly half his volume stolen by the rush of the wind on the downroll eu merde petty officer gaston muttered once again wincing into his thin coat as the british frigates gunports opened fire lt hainaut shouted urgently fire now then get on the sheets and well wear about quickly his larboard pounders fired smouldering linstocks put to the touchholes of the oldfashioned guns without even an attempt to lay or aim them crisp terrierlike bangs rapped out then a sharp double bang as the swivelguns made their contribution even pointing upwards at fortyfive degrees their loads of scrapiron and pistol balls would more likely come back down like a sudden rain squall not a third of the way to the anglais warshipwhich fired back moans keens and shrieks of deadly hurtling metal ran up the musical scale as they neared some passing close enough to bludgeon men half off their feet with the wind of their passing one smashing closeaboard not twenty newfangled meters from the larboard side a monster column of water leaping skyward as high as the foremast truck to come pelting down like the rains of a tropic hurricane wetting everything and everyone in an instant smothering the wind from the foreandaft gaff sails and jibs knocking hainauts elegant cocked hat off into the filthy scuppers and drenching his best uniform and his carefully combed coif til he looked and felt like a halfdrowned wharf rat we will tack he cried hands to the sheets ready to come about yes they were more than ready by the look of it helm is alee he shouted putting his whole weight on the tiller bar away limpudente danced force back in her sails and agile again showing her stern to the bloodies next broadside then swinging past the eye of the wind to run just a dab south of due east making herself a very small thin target incidentally now we will haul our wind and show her our starboard sides hainaut screeched at his shaken crew we will fire one last set of shots from the starboard guns then go back on the wind i promise he had to add that the first part of his orders had them looking outright mutinous just one more for the honour of our glorious flag mes amis to show les anglais we will never be daunted hainaut didnt care if shot was rammed home or not the bangs and the powder smoke would suffice for a show of defiance for a show free sheets and take a strain helms up ease the sheets wait til the decks level for gods sake wait now fire and sheet home helm is alee and we are bound for home and mother what in hell was that in aid of i wonder lt devereux the marine officer asked with a wry gawping oneeyecocked expression some young and cocky monsoor with dung for brains catterall chuckled his guns were shot out swabbed clean flintlocks removed and the tompions inserted into the cooling muzzles the gunports had been let drop and lashed shut and his magnificent pounder blomefeld pattern greatguns were now firmly bowsed to the bulwarks their trucks chocked and train and runout tackle neatly overhauled a last spongedown to remove the powder stains and catterall could go aft for a welldeserved glass of claret from the gunroom stores looking up at their marine officer on the gangway above him catterall imagined that devereux was looking a tad dry himself and might even after such a successful mornings work dip into his personal stores and offer to share a bottle with them devereux had private funds in addition to his pay and a much more refined palate his wine stock was headandshoulders above anything to which mrs catteralls second son could ever aspire not if they kept blasting perfectly good prize vessels off the face of the ocean instead of taking them that is good rubdown sarnt skipwith devereux instructed handing over his pennsylvania riflemusket and do tell private doakes he is not to dab gunoil on the stock this time hmm sah and did you do good practice sir catterall asked rather doubt it mister catterall devereux dismissively said our closest approach was just under three hundred yards and even the riflemusket cant guarantee accuracy that far did keep em worried though i expect to hear balls hum round their ears that far away lord im dry as dust catterall ventured hands in the small of his back and creaking himself in a backwards arc to resettle bones well splice the mainbrace if ive learned anything about the captain devereux promised soon as everythings bristol fashion catterall turned away for a last lookover of his charges making a face at the very thought of rum and thinking that lt devereux was a stingy bastard at times oh jolly he falsely cheered now mister winwood lewrie said beckoning the sailing master up to the starboard mizen shrouds at nornorwest should we attempt to work our way to windward below monserrat or should we stand on til we fetch nevis or saint kitts before tacking for antigua i suggest we stand on sir mr winwood said the tradesre back to normal so far that is not above saint kitts though very well consult your charts and make a best guess for me as to when and where we may safely shave nevis aye no need to put us on a lee shore on saint kitts should the trades back easterly aye sir i shall see to it mister peel lewrie beckoned again as winwood went down to the binnacle cabinet a moment of your time if you please captain lewrie peel said tightlipped and still truculent my apologies for any billingsgate language in the heat of the moment mister peel lewrie casually explained but if we are bound to work handinglove til god knows when i spose i do owe you further explanation of my madness he continued with a disarming grin i quite understand you wish to take choundas down a peg in the eyes of his compatriots captain lewrie peel coolly allowed stiffly formal i would also imagine that tweaking his nose this morning was something personal to you quite right mister peel lewrie cheerfully confessed was he watching this morning or will he just hear of it hell know the name of our ship and you have already told me that he knows im in command of her your mister pelham suggested that that knowledge might lure him into folly since chasing me down to kill me is personal to him too this little piece of work should fix his attention hellishwondrous right granted captain lewrie peel said gravely nodding and seeming to relent his insulted stiffness a tad but what it do among his smuggling captains and crews his small and weak auxiliaries his privateers lewrie posed beaming with evil glee i deliberately destroyed that dutch ship to make the point that do they cross my hawse therell be no mercy long as they work for choundas that rumour will get round among em count on it soon as proteus and lewrie and choundas are linked other warships might play by the accepted rules but theyd best write their wills and sleep with one eye open as long as im at sea and any british frigate that hauls up within their sight just might be proteus and lewrie hey yes peel said after a long frown i do see your point sir so do you accept my apology mister peel lewrie asked i do captain lewrie peel replied with a smile at last and his hand out for shaking do you accept mine as well for being my own secretive self when it came to the private signals did we wait to use them they would have been out of date in another two months in any event so for not going direct to antigua as mister pelham wished too and disputing your decision to come here i will endeavour to explain myself more plainly in future lewrie vowed shaking peels hand but for now i must carry on sir so lewrie said turning away to head for the hammock nettings overlooking the gundeck and gangways ready to address the crew oh captain lewrie peel called after him something else i spose i must apologise for damme but the thinking you put into your raid it showed such unexpected uhm sagacity and what mister peel lewrie hooted youre sorry you thought all i could do was plod round a quarterdeck and cry luff or fetch out yer whores something like that sir peel answered with a faint wince to be so clearly understood not that he didnt think that captain lewrie could ever be consistently clever but he did have his moments accepted sir lewrie chuckled with a faint bow and a grand doff of his hat then he was busy with the surgeon mr hodson whom he allowed to mount the quarterdeck to make his report and expressing his wonder that not a single sailor had been killed and only six men had been hurt with the further good news that only one of the wounded hands was considered a sickberth patient sure enough once hms proteus had made a goodly offing and had sailed the shore of guadeloupe under the horizon with only the twin peaks of basseterre still showing the brightly painted rum keg was fetched up from below with all due ceremony and martial music from the marine drummers and fifers to welcoming cheers from her thirsty successful man o warsmen chapter thirteen le bouclier was anchored once more to her second bower and her lesser kedge this time with her unharmed larboard side facing to seaward with little limpudente tied up along her ravaged starboard side saws screeched and rasped metal hammers and wooden mauls thudded and drummed and old wood cried as it was torn away with crowlevers for replacement with fresh planking brought up from the bosuns stores blocks shrilled as dismounted cannon were lowered back onto carriages set back on their trucks as shattered carriages stripped of any useful fittings were hoisted overside for scrapping or firewood ashore as replacement yards and topmasts were swayed aloft up through the lubbers holes in the savaged fightingtops to be jiggled then bound into place by weary topmen the starboard gangway was heaped with the thick rolls of sails too singed or shottorn to salvage fresh rolls of spare sails huge hillocks of salvageable canvas and bolts of new cloth smothered the forward gundeck where le voilier the sailmaker and his crew cut snipped basted and sewed to patch damaged sails or start completely new replacements installing grommets reeflines and boltropes inside the edging seams smaller bundles too much resembling the hopeful rolls of sailcloth also littered the starboard gangway and about the thick foot of the mainmast trunk in a thighhigh heap stacked like cordwood to free deck space for the workingparties those were the corpses the dead had been hastily shrouded without the benefit of washing first so their coverings were not the ecru of new canvas nor the darker weatherstained parchment dun of used they were splotched or even brightly splashed with drying gore the bile and ordure of gutted men slain in midmorning they still awaited transport ashore to the cemetery outside the port and it was now nearly sunset the horrible day had been very hot and still they already stank le boucliers survivors avoided the stacks if they could walking on eggs as far away as possible but too tired too dulled by fear and shock by then to hold their noses at the mounting reek studiously ignoring them most of the time if they could it was only when a dead man somewhere in the sloping mass round the mainmast swelled with rapid tropic putrefaction vented the foul gases in eerie groans or sighs that the matelots would take notice and leap away in alarm crossing themselves in dread that some poor devil under the pile still lived and was trying to worm out from under that crushing weight calling for aid from his shipmates with whom he had laughed and japed just a few hours before and sailors of any nation were superstitious they could quite easily believe that somewhere among those bundled shattered husks the confused terrified spirits of the slain were beginning to stir to walk and wail as night drew nigh to torment the living until properly buried ashore the stench of the dead lay over le bouclier like a harbour fog and the trade wind fading with the heat of the day could not disperse it leeward belowdecks the air was even closer and hotter even more foetid despite the rigging of windscoops and the liberal use of vinegar and washwater to scour the decks a miasma from wounded sailors stashed below continually welled up like hot smoke from a chimneypot as if driven by their wails moans and frantic fretful mumblings as they weighed their odds of living or faced the certain prospect of dying halfdrunk on rum or cheap brandy used to dull their pains or allay the shock of amputation their desperate prayers and weepings seemed to create the wind that wafted the stink of their wounds aloft through companionways scuttles and limber holes ever renewable no matter what brief relief a gust of the trades might bestow screams and halfshrieked pleas soared upwards too as the surgeon and his mates civilian surgeons from the town of basseterre and even an exalted physician or two plied their gruesome trade bonesaws rasped now and then when amputations were necessary they were necessary quite often they were quicker than any attempt to draw out shards of wood splinters bits of cloth shotscraps or shattered bone chips leaving time to deal with those who needed careful attention supposedly a healthy young man could recover could live without use of a foot a hand an arm or a leg guillaume choundas kept station well up to windward as best he was able clumsily perched atop the breech of a quarterdeck gun as doleful reports came to him his monstrous countenance was set in a grim and stoic brooding deathmask broken only by a snarling decision or abrupt jerk of his head as the messengers stood near shivering in dread of him his cane was leaned on the guncarriage so he could use his remaining hand and a silk handkerchief to whisk the swarms of flies and the stinks briefly away the flies large and pustulently bottlegreen had found them even before the frigate had begun to limp shoreward two whole miles offshore moments after the thricedamned british frigate had jauntily sailed out of arcs or reach of their guns the flies numbers had only increased once they had anchored within a cable of the quays though their numbers were equal to a biblical plague choundas noted that they no longer darted about quite as frantically as before he imagined they were now sated merely buzzing about to boast another of their victories another of their mortal feasts able to get one boat down before the fire got so hot that we had to abandon her mynheer grizzled dutch captain haljewin was explaining a dirty rumpled handkerchief to his own nose lost your ship lost the munitions and rations for our general rigaud and his mulatto republic choundas rasped not even bothering to glance at the man better you pretended to strike and fetchedto the british devil gave us no chance mynheer haljewin protested he crossed my stern and shattered us crushed our side in with a second broadside then sailed on without a second glance as if theyd known whose cargo it was had they fired a warning shot and ordered me to strike i would have believe me it would have given you half an hour to come to my rescue while they were fetchingto and boarding us but you knew we were here citizen haljewin choundas said looking up at last his one eye ablaze in accusation you saluted us as you cleared the port when we came in plain sight rounding le vieux fort had you been the slightest bit clever scared to save your he gave me no time i tell you mynheer haljewin interrupted perhaps he recognised you as a frigate and would not ill take no backtalk from you citizen choundas bawled citizen not mynheer he insisted sneering over the word you utter spineless failure you idiot get out of my sight i did save your sailors off labeille citizen haljewin pointed out though gulping with sudden dread but not the fool in charge of her who should pay with his head i for her loss choundas barked in the beginning she did fly french flags she looked so the dutch merchant master all but babbled in deepening dread i was fooled as were the shore watchers i gather she displayed the proper identity signals i suspect there is a british spy on guadeloupe who told them everything if that is the case citizen kaptein i do not see how i was so much at fault ive lost my ship and half my stalwart lads my livelihood and i saved at least a dozen of your poor sailors one would hope that counts for something one would hope that some recompense is made in recog go to the devil choundas roared fumbling for his cane as an impromptu weapon you knew the risks and you took them eagerly i for gain you wheedling shopkeeper get off this ship and off guadeloupe island before i kill you myself he thundered so irate that he was almost breathless spacing out his words more in need than emphasis the dutchman backed away eyes saucered in stark terror breaking into a quick scamper for the entryport as soon as he was past the reach of choundass cane a naval officer coughed into his fist and scraped his feet having waited with his news until the dread harangue had ended what choundas snapped you are pardon a moi msieur le capitaine the officer with an arm in a sling and his coat draped over his shoulders im lieutenant mercier second officer lieutenant houdon our first officer wishes to report that the shotholes on the waterline are now plugged with no need for entering the graving dock msieur if she is careened at the beach permanent replacement planking can be done quickly pointeapitres storehouses can supply us with new topmasts enough rope of sufficient thickness and quality to replace stays and the running rigging may be a difficulty unless we will take it from some merchantman choundas gravelled as he looked aloft in the fading light to assay the gaps in the maze of rigging and masts why isnt lieutenant houdon reporting to me the first officer msieur is aft in the greatcabins with capitaine desplan mercier explained the capitaine goes away from us he said using the squeamish euphemism for dying choundas had despaired for a brief minute or two he thought that le bouclier had won through after all and had gotten organised for a singleship battletil that first devastating broadside in her masts and rigging that was so unenglish an opening move draped in wreckage gunports masked and artillery smothered making it too dangerous a risk of fire to reply he and capitaine desplan could do nothing but stand on the quarterdeck and grieve wincing at the coming broadsides which had killed or wounded nearly an hundred of her crew the sad grimace on desplans honest celticbreton face a moment later and the mizen topmast and shattered crojack yard crashed down on him mashing his midsection and hips breaking both legs in several places manful without a cry desplan had been freed borne aft by loyal weeping matelots who truly admired him uttering faint gasps flinching and going ahahah at each seating jounce he had known even as the masts came down that the gallant desplan would be dead by sundown it had been a fellow bretons sight perhaps desplan had felt one himself for he had not tried to move out of the way but had just gazed upwards as if transfixed before being enveloped and crushed had he had a sudden foreboding that his race was run choundas idly drew the brass foot of his cane over the irregularities in the splintered and warped deck omens and portents signs and messages from elder celtic gods in whom choundas still believed for had not the ominous raven cawed and alit on his right just minutes before that salaud lewrie had all but blown his arm away with an impossible single shot three times the best musket range the last time they had crossed swords in the genoese hills lewrie the proteus frigate it was inconceivable that lewrie that swaggering irreverent and bawdy brute could be that clever that he had appeared by mere coincidence surely he had been aided aimed by his betters his masters the dutchman haljewins feeble excuses and attempt to point the finger somewhere else just might have a grain of truth to them choundas dismissed lt merciers presence as utterly as he ignored the droning flies in speculation of betrayal and treason done by someone close to governorgeneral hugues or close to himself it would have to be someone on guadeloupe with access to secret signal books the new private signals that had come out from france in this very ship someone who could get access to fishing boats so they could be smuggled to the lurking british or pass them to a spy already in place who could make the arrangements someone who had seen a copy of kaptein haljewins cargo manifests of all they sent to bolster general rigauds forces the largesse to buy his allegiance once citizen hedouville got ashore on saint domingue and contacted rigaud with the directorys proposal to make him the new ruler in the name of france the british such a perfidious race thinking themselves so very clever and subtle choundas thought sneering had they intended to flaunt lewrie in his face to divert him from his plans as if he was so brainless so driven by a need for revenge that hed fly after him mewl in mad circles like a kitten chasing a streamer of wool yarn well hed see about that the fools he shifted his good leg under him and slid off the gun breech bracing himself erect with his cane maitre he heard lt hainaut say by his side lt mercier had departed perhaps minutes before after suffering his inattention i thought you could use some refreshment he added offering a shiny pewter mug and an arm on which to lean but choundas brushed him off to make his own way to the break of the quarterdeck nettings creaky in his joints from long stillness and longago maiming clumpshuffletick clumpshuffletick til he could lean upon the railings and discard his cane with the eversolicitous hainaut at his elbow the whole way watered wine msieur quite cool hainaut tempted choundas turned his head to study him for a moment there was a subtle difference to hainauts voice to his demeanour not quite so much smarmy deference as he usually displayed which deference always secretly amused choundas to see his protege toady so eagerly yet be so ambitious and scheming and imagine that he disguised it now he sounded smug pleased with himself of a certainty but selfconfident as well daring to be his own man not choundass was he merci jules choundas allowed reaching out for the pewter mug now that his hand was free and took a long gulp or two all those poor men never had a chance msieur hainaut mourned removing his hat rather the worse for wear choundas noted and shaking his head sadly as if honouring the dead and wounded a waste of good material jules choundas growled but we will be free of them by dawn had we met les anglais far out at sea we would be cursed with them for days after all good catholic widows cannot remarry until some bit of their dead husbands is shipped for burial in france choundas said with a dismissive singsong in the dirt with the worms following the old customs and superstitions we would have been forced to bury them in the gravel ballast belowdecks until we came into port peu what ancient idiocy he scoffed eu merde hainaut grimaced in seeming agreement the bloodies shove their dead out a gunport without even a kind word choundas casually informed him between appreciated sips of his wine those too mangled to live they bash on the head with guntools or mallets then shove them over unconcious to drown that is british mercy hein we must avenge them msieur hainaut vowed with some heat to his voice we must strike back we cannot let this pass unanswered choundas eyed him more closely hainauts zeal for vengeance sounded suspiciously like true conviction not one of his usual poses what had gotten into the lad choundas had to wonder all in good time jules choundas promised with a sly smile but i shall not be diverted by such a silly sentimental passion even if it was that salaud lewrie msieur i saw him plain close enough to read his ships name close enough to recognise him at once hainaut declared halfquestioning but mostly boasting in case his master had forgotten how bravely he had shown choundas uttered an evil little laugh turning his gaze on his aide the sort of appraisal that would shrivel the scrotums of braver men choundas had seen limpudentes attack jules had never gotten quite as close as that but was there anything praiseworthy to the whole disastrous day his terriernip charges had seemed to drive away the bloodies in the eyes of the towns inhabitants the uninformed you did well today jules choundas decided to say merci msieur hainaut responded turning so hellishly stern and heroically modest that choundas had to bite down on the lining of his cheek not to laugh in his face at such posturing i must give this frigate a new captain jules choundas began msieur hainaut asked as if it were grievous news to him and indeed a mortal pity hope and greed rising despite his best efforts griot i think choundas continued between sips of his wine lieutenant houdon to take griots corvette he could not serve under a new man when he is senior enough for a ship of his own he makes a good impression n estce pas that fellow mercier i think his name is promoted to first officer under griot he kept a cool head on his shoulders during the worst of our drubbing and me hainaut furiously thought and what for me griot obviously will wish to bring one of his lieutenants with him so he has one familiar face in his coterie choundas speculated quite understandable hainaut allowed though squirming with expectation leaving a lieutenants berth open aboard le gascon choundas temptingly decided does anyone able spring to mind jules well hainaut began to say averse to just blurting out to one and all his aspirations if he wasnt such a failure there is that recamier fellow msieur but heh heh no hes commanded a ship after all to be made third officer under another that is not the use i eventually intend for him after he has had enough time to ponder his sins choundas quibbled well if were really desperate msieur i could ah that is to say might a spell of seaduty continue my nautical education as an officer hainaut finally flummoxed out i can already hand reef and steer stand a watch as capitaine desplan allowed me as we sailed to guadeloupe and you do merit some reward jules oui choundas grumbled as juniormost officer well hmmm i must think on that come let us board your ratty little schooner take me back to pointeapitre you can show me what a tarry young man you are hein but of course msieur hainaut said with an enthusiasm that he did not feel almost despising the sly bastard for taunting him so cruelly but with such a cruel ogre what could he really expect and once in my own bed after a good supper i will sleep on it jules i promise choundas vowed you will not visit capitaine desplan before he goes away from us msieur hainaut asked without thinking i think not hainaut choundas said more frostily as if he had been criticised the good capitaine fell as a true breton sailor and warrior without complaint or regret to paw over him and weep a flood of loss is womanly i will make a proper oration at his grave hurry now jules it has been a long long day and im weary aye msieur hainaut replied walking close to choundas for a prop should he need it as they went to the entryport and after serving you so well so long hainaut mutinously told himself you wouldnt even come to say goodbye to me if i fell your tool disposable tool and nothing more just give me even a tiny ship and ill make my own way from here on book three rebus semper pudor absit in artis away with scruple in adversity argonautica book v valerius flaccus chapter fourteen mister peel capt lewrie said alighting from the spavined roan prad which he had ridden up to and back from admiralty house on its lofty airy hilltop overlooking english harbour he could not quite disguise a smug expression he had ridden whilst mr peel had been forced to take shanks ponies for his call upon the governorgeneral that is to walk and a long upward walk it had been peel was plucking his coat and waistcoat away from his sopping shirt and mopping his streaming face as lewrie sprang down by the boat landing captain lewrie peel finally managed to reply from a parched mouth damme youd think thered be a pinch of wind at the least leeside harbour mister peel lewrie informally informed him absolutely vital in the islands the eastrd hills block most of it and shirley heights polishes it off most days at least we had wind where we anchored peel said fanning his hat and peering longingly to the outer roads not much but some and somed do for me bout now well have you under the quarterdeck awnings soakin yer feet in a pan of cool water fore you can say jack ketch lewrie vowed so how was your reception with your uhm coconspirators in the governorgenerals office oh not too horrid considering sir peel wryly said with a grimace given our use of french private signals which i gather are thought too valuable to use at all unless we spotted jesus and a band of angels descending for the second coming shrieks of consternation viewing with alarm all the proper forms of disapproval of which officialdom is possible but for the fact that mister pelham holds superior position to them and might have authorised me to employ them at my discretion a view from which i did not disabuse them might i enquire what sort of warm reception you received sir and that is not a pun upon todays weather peel grinned regaining his breath and his equanimity after such a torrid stroll ginger beer sirs ginger beer a street vendor cried as he wheeled a handcart down the stone quay near the boat landing best fer tang best fer th bilious cool ginger beer wholl buy the local admiral was of much the same mind mister peel got cobbed rather well lewrie confessed your confederates in the governorgenerals mansion just did release them to him he just distributed them to his captains and now theyre all for nought so therell be no gullible prizes brought in by guile hence no admirals share damme i do hope he hasnt spent his expected windfall already and we poached on his private game park without declaring ourselves first and damn our eyes we didnt fetch him in even a rowboat to show for our raid he could care less was guillaume choundas the antichrist himself hes never heard of him so you may imagine all the rest if we do have some form of admiralty orders then sail independent instanter just get out of his harbour and his sight could we peel asked sail instanter do we need anything firewood and water the usual plaint lewrie told him with a shrug you not really peel admitted there were some rather intriguin hints that i garnered twixt the howls and such hints which we just might wish to follow up he suggested tapping his noggin with a conspiratorial air and that maddening smirk of private information best we add livestock to our requests then lewrie supposed it sounds as if well be cruising longer than our fresh meat holds out or poking our bows into waters where we couldnt buy a goat ginger beer sir ginger beer fer yer cabin stores capum the vendor tempted keeps longern ships water hit do an wont go flat an tasteless like smallbeer sailor were you my man peel enquired taking in the ragged ticken striped sloptrousers the man wore those from a much earlier issue each leg as wide as the waistband and ending below his knees aye sir th ol ariadne in th last war the man proudly said afore she woz hulked right yonder she were fer years an scrapped her did they lewrie asked peering closely at the grizzled fellow trying to place him or to determine that his claims were false where poor old ariadne had lain stripped down to a gantline as a receiving and stores ship perhaps later a sheer hulk rigged to pull lower masts like bad teeth there was now an equally sadlooking bluffbowed gun third rate er bottom woz bout rotted out capum beached her yonder an burned er for er fittings an er nails the man said in it woz come out in she did i were mainmast capm then she got laid up i went aboard th ol jamaica but i lost me ratin then got ruptured an discharged just fore the war ended in stayed out here hever since here sir i know ye capum edgemon lewrie exclaimed suddenly dredging the mans name up from the distant past you taught me handin and reefin mister ashburn sir the man beamed no lewrie he told him a tad abashed to be mistaken for a much tarrier more promising and handsomer midshipman of those times oh lord mister lewrie aye edgemon cried twas you tried tcatch at poor topman wot got pushed off the main topsl yard wot was is name gibbs lewrie supplied mister rolston pushed him aye sir at lil bastard edgemon snarled the memory still sour beggin yer pardon capum spect hes a capum hisself by now an god elp pore sailormen no hes dead lewrie happily related died at the nore a common seaman and mutineer under a new name hung sir is sorts bound fer th gibbet edgemon beamed no i killed him lewrie flatly said have a free piggin o ginger beer on me then sir ill have a whole barricoe sir lewrie declared of a sudden whats your charge for five gallons lor sir uhm eight shillins sorry tsay make it ten gallons and heres a guinea lewrie said going for his purse to produce an actual gold coin not the usual scrip that had even made its way to the caribbean as war replacement for specie will that buy a piggin for me mister peel and my boat crew cover most andsome capum lewrie edgemon swore thankee right kindly alluz knew youd make a righttarry awfcer sir oh dont trowel it on lewrie thought though smiling all the whilethe way i remember it you despaired id ever master running bowlines ill take oh one fivegallon barricoe myself mr peel stated thatd be eight did you say ten sir edgemon slyly said tipping his former favourite midshipman a sly wink peel rolled his eyes but paid as well mister peels treat lads lewrie lied to his boatcrew he thought you looked halfstrangled sittin out in the sun so long as extra piggins were fetched and filled from the handcart the three requisite barricoes were laid between the thwarts of lewries gig do i owe more peel whispered to lewrie as they stood in what little shade there was apart from the boatcrew and why say it was done in my name captain lewrie youre not navy mister peel lewrie said in an equally soft snicker theres only so much jollity twixt a captain and his hands that is allowed else he appears tbe playin favourites or goes too slack and popularity dick then he erodes his own authority done in your name though and nought o mine dye see what a civilian does ignorant o navy ways dont signify for you aint in the line of command mister peel you cannot seem to care for their comfort or welfare sir care aye mister peel but cosset or pamper never youll recompense me my two shillings then captain lewrie peel snickered twas in a good cause after all he pointed out should o bid quicker mister peel lewrie chuckled back with sly glee you cant keep up with risin prices thats your own lookout ahh that was refreshing lets get under way coming sir aye coming peel said snorting at his diddlement coming so is christmas lewrie said with a laugh peel was indeed sitting in the shade of the quarterdeck awning with his bare feet stuck into a wideish pan of cool seawater sleeves rolled to the elbow and shirt opened to midchest when captain lewrie came on deck again at the first challenging shout from the midshipman of the harbour watch the unfortunate mr burns a rowing boat was at the starboard entryport and peel sat down his mug of ginger beer boat ahoy burns croaked his pubescent voice cracking who goes there hoy the ship an equally teenaged voice cried back barge to the united states armed ship thomas sumter with an invitation for your captain and officers mister burns lewrie snapped from behind the gawky scarecrow making him almost leap out of his shoes in sudden alarm boat coming alongside sir burns stammered from the uhm that jonathon ship lying over yonder with an invitation sir let em lay alongside and come up mister burns lewrie decided since theyre almost hooked onto the mainchains already uhm aye sir burns parroted gulping in dread before going to the entryport to converse with the barge mister pendarves man sideparty for a lieutenant turn out the duty watch and well discuss your nodding off right after mister burns lewrie said glowering you mister pendarves the bosun his strong right arm and the gunners daughter for being so remiss aye aye sir burns miserably said his lower lip quivering hmm quite the uniform sir peel took note with a smirk as he came to lewries side all the go is it of your own devising i trust it was lewrie snapped back trying to ignore him his experiment with light cotton uniform coats instead of hardfinished wool in the tropics had been an utter failure the dark blue coats had dyed waistcoats shirts breeches tops and anything else they brushed against including upholstered greatcabin furniture and the goldlace pocket trimmings and ornate cuff detailings even detachable gilt epaulets had turned a suspiciously bright greenish tinge at the edges now with most of the offending dye leached from them and the major damage done to his wardrobe lewrie was left with a brace of coats of a disturbing light blue which could still bleed faint tints if caught on deck in a driving rain it was use them or admit to one and all his serious error so lewrie perversely clung to them though their use was severely limited to clearweather days far from shore or those rare days at anchor when he had no shore calls to make and expected none in return and you paid your tailor in full i spose before uhm peel whispered in mocking amusement yess lewrie hissed back disgruntled oh dear peel commiserated whatever surly rebuke lewrie had in mind was squelched by the arrival of an officer at the lip of the entryport saluted by a small sideparty requisite for the welcome of a lieutenant whichever navy claimed him excluding the french of course lewrie had thought he had seen the uniforms of the new american navy when he had been dined aboard uss hancock but this fellow looked like a relic of their defunct continental navy which lewrie could but briefly recall from one brisk encounter in his midshipman days in white stockings dark blue breeches dark blue coat with bright red turnback lapels and cuffs a red waistcoat with gilt edging and doffing a very oldfashioned tricorne hat to the saluting sailors and marines as the bosuns calls shrilled and twittered permission tcome aboard sirs the strange officer called permission granted lewrie allowed with a captainly grunt allow me tname myself tyou sir the man went on sweeping his hat low in a greeting bow though with a confused look on his phyz lieutenant ranald seabright of the united states armed ship thomas sumter i bring an invitation from captain douglas mcgilliveray to your captain and such officers as he may wish tbring to dine aboard the sumter this evnin sir might i enquire if your captain is now aboard one of the charleston mcgilliverays is your captain lewrie asked stepping forward with a surprised grin he is indeed sir lt seabright declared taken aback perhaps by the skyblue apparition before him and you are sir alan lewrie captain of his britannic majestys frigate the proteus sir lewrie told him doffing his own hat and making a bow oh dlighted tmake your acquaintance captain lewrie sir seabright said in what lewrie recognised as a low country carolinas accent seabrights sir was more akin to suh damme lewrie thought still eying the oldfashioned uniform in some suspicion as to whether the united states navy actually had one or did they let their officers wear whatever was handy last time that captain kershaw and most of his officers were from the carolinas are there any noreast yankees at sea lt seabright though was eying his own uniform coat with just as much dubious suspicion as if of half a mind that lewrie was having him on and the nape of his neck was actually turning red he really is ye know peel said tongueincheek once made the acquaintance of a mister mcgilliveray lewrie said one of your merchant adventurers among the indians to the west might your captain be kin dye think mister seabright certain of it sir seabright replied more at ease suddenly thats exactly what my captains people did before the late war then i shall accept captain mcgilliverays kind invitation in good expectation of resuming as well as making the acquaintance urn how many of my officers mister seabright lewrie asked still trying to dredge up the christian name of the mcgilliveray hed met in spanish florida towards the end of the revolution he thought it was something scottish clannish highlanderish unpronounceable yourself plus three others sir seabright answered whomever you choose the captain will have one midshipman attable sir kin he explained with a shrug so ah very well sir lewrie said asking the time to be expected two lieutenants and one younker to keep yours company at the foot of the table then til then mister seabright and thankee was that wise captain lewrie mr peel said after departure honours had been paid and the barge was being stroked back over to a sleek frigatelike threemaster about half a mile farther up the roads the yankee doodles recall what mister pelham told you sir they are more competitors than allies other than our signals book we do not share information with them it might be taken as uhm by our superiors that is oh rot mister peel lewrie breezed off if anything itll prove tbe a harmless diversion we get a chance to see if the smaller american warships are built as stout and novel as their new fortyfour gunned frigates i told you bout them didnt i you told me theyve established anchorages in prince rupert bay on dominica and in south friars bay on saint kitts much closer to guadeloupe mind and what they know of these waters and french activities might be fresher than our information we could learn more from them than they from us if played right i spose sir peel dubiously said and we without actually saying that were here on a specific mission lewrie slyly hinted discover to them who and what choundas is now do they feel like making the effort to stop his business as the best way to protect their own trade wed have more eyes and ears at sea helping us run him to ground and all unwitting too theyre a spankin new navy just itchin tbeat the bejesus out of the frogs tgain fame and honour tlay the foundation for a permanent fleet not subject to the whims o their congresss parsimony damme mister peel theyd best whip somebody soon so eager for a victory or two that theyd go after choundas in our stead captain lewrie peel snickered as he saw the sense of this piddling little revelation to their supper hosts damme they divert him from his plans or do they really corner him and beat the stuffing from him i shant cry lewrie vowed however the deeds done hey and there is always the possibility that should they meet up with choundas and lose to his greater cleverness and skill mister peel said with a quizzical brow up well perhaps their congress and voters decide having a national navy instead of a gaggle of revenue cutters and thirteen state militias at sea is a bad idea hence no competition in the caribbean and their trade protection put into our good hands captain lewrie hmm intrestin whichd please your mister pelham and his masters in london right down to the ground lewrie realised beaming at just how devious peel could be sending him home wearin the laurel crown gettin him off my back and you promoted and feted or whatever it is they do in the foreign office to good and faithful servants they mostly came from privateersmen smugglers and pirates peel seemed to agree our americans set a thief tcatch a thief youre saying lewrie laughed something like that captain lewrie and itll be amusing too mister peel lewrie brightly told him already shuffling through his mental muster book for people to take with him that evening the mcgilliveray i met was halfscot and halfmuskogee indian whom the jonathons call creeks the longer we spent up the apalachicola river in spanish florida the more native he went til he got so guttural i couldnt understand half of what he said and made me feel for my scalp evry morning is his kinsman even close to the same barearsed buckskin sort youll be able tdine out on the tale the next five years youll wig and powder for safetys sake or wear your own hair then captain lewrie peel proposed chuckling oh they hardly ever scalp their supper guests mister peel lewrie cheerfully said less theyre hellish liquored up lets see yes lieutenant adair will go with me show em a real scot for a change not their rusticated variety hell mostlike bowl em over might even cite whole pages of guid auld robbie burns at em dont know of him mister peel the scot poet and songster oh well and midshipman grace to pair with their younker grace came up from the nore fisheries not two years ago common as anything so hell appeal to their egalitarian ideals whether they really practice them or not peel stuck in catterall no hed scalp somebody does he get into his cups and theres sure tbe american cornwhisky third guest hmm what about you mister peel might turn out tbe a rare treat if not i could take lieutenant langlie he sings well when liquored peel and cornwhisky though walking on his knees and howling talk about amusing indeed lewrie maliciously thought chapter fifteen the uss thomas sumter was not a true frigate though she looked like one at first glance long fairly low in the bulwarks flushdeck at the forecastle and quarterdeck but waisted between her foremast and main in conventional style with upper gangways just wide enough for sailhandling and service of the swivelguns that would mount on the stanchions set atop her bulwarks though armed with twentytwo pounders on the gundeck and equipped with two pounder chaseguns on her forecastle and six more on her quarterdeckmaking her a gunner and a jackass frigate in any nations navyshe was officially rated as an armed ship in temporary service most of the former colonies now states had raised subscription funds literally by the bushelbaskets with which they meant to build men o war but in the meantime some of the funds were used to purchase likely merchant ships for arming and conversion until the real ones slid off the ways and got to sea though sumter was all trig and bristol fashion as clean and freshsmelling as a spankingnew ship meticulously maintained by her crew and with her yards squared to a mathematical perfection lewrie wasnt particularly impressed by her in his professional appraisal sumter had very little tumblehome above her gundeck to reduce her hulls topweight having been designed for maximum space in cargo holds and orlop so he suspected that she might not be as stiff as he might have liked in a blow since like all americanbuilt ships hed seen he thought her oversparred and would likely carry too much canvas aloft making her tender her bulwarks and hull scantlings werent as thick as a proper warships either and from what short time they had had on an abbreviated tour before going aft he saw that her beams timbers futtocks and knees had been sawn to lighter civilian specifications and spaced a few more vulnerable inches apart on their centres shed not withstand a long drawnout drubbing twixt wind and water did she cross hawse with a french fifth rate frigate perhaps not even a wellmanned and gunned sixth rate corvette armed with sixteen or twenty cannon those drawbacks didnt seem to faze captain mcgilliveray though he was immoderately proud of her boasting of what a swift sailer she was how capable of carrying all plain sail even in blustery weather though with all squaresls reduced one reef lewrie had brought lt adair midshipman grace and had finally chosen peel instead of his first officer for the third guest the hope of seeing peel three sheets to the wind on cornwhisky was just too tempting and was any intelligence to be gleaned peel was trained for such subtle delving and discovery after all thought wed begin with claret captain lewrie sumters captain announced opening his winecabinet claret not rum appears to be the lifeblood of the gallant royal navy and on that head captain mcgilliveray lewrie responded i took the liberty of fetching off a halfdozen of claret from my lazarette stores as a gift to you you are quite kind sir i am most grateful for your thoughtful present mcgilliveray a wellknit fellow in his late thirties said with a wolfishly pleased look he was not red indian dark but seamanly dark and sported an abundantly thick thatch of gingerblond hair too nothing like what lewrie had expected given our present setto with the french you can imagine that claret is neither readily available in the states nor anyones first choice of potation in public at least though what folk wish with their suppers is another matter entirely i fear our smugglers arent as capable as yours captain lewrie he japed with a sly twinkle yours just have farther to go captain mcgilliveray lewrie responded in kind accepting a glass whereas our bold english smugglers have but to cross the narrow sea i expect the channel islesd float for all the casks and bottles hidden in every cave and cove as for me though a friend of mine just recently removed to the carolinas by the way introduced me to american whisky with such near to hand tis a wonder anyone in the united states would care whether claret is available at any price then in return for your kindness sir allow me to give a man who truly appreciates good corn squeezings a barricoe of our portable grain mcgilliveray exclaimed after all the troubles we have had regardin whisky lately id admire to introduce you to the best upland piedmont distillation highly gratified sir thankee lewrie truthfully told him tis mellow amber and actually aged much like a good brandy in oak wine casks mcgilliveray enthused none of your ginclear or weekold popskull either some think it rivals the best brandy trouble with whisky sir lewrie asked once glasses had been shoved into every hand and mcgilliveray had waved them into seats and capt mcgilliveray took a gleeful five minutes to describe a recent whisky rebellion by backcountry settlers who had objected quite vehemently to a mere pennypergallon tax on whisky possibly the major trade item in the backcountry and in most instances the only medium of exchange a replacement money the coinstrapped united states had it had taken gen george washington and a callup of the various state militias to form a field army to put it down though once the riot act in essence was read the rebellion had melted away excuse me for asking captain mcgilliveray peel said but i was under the impression that your earlier articles of confederation and your constitution prohibited your federal government from interfering with the sovereign states especially with armed force aye they do mcgilliveray replied frowning and it was indeed troublin given how much britons distrust a large standin army you can certainly understand our misgivins though it had to be scotched else our fragile new economyd collapse you ask for a payment in coin back home taxes in coin and god knows how folkd be able tpay you alexander hamilton and his new national bank well mind you mister hamiltons as patriotic as anyone but it does sound so frenchified and coinhungry a proposition that a great many folk hope itll never see the light o day lewrie had taken mcgilliverays exposition on the rebellion in mostly one ear taking note of his surroundings not asked for more than the occasional do tell and egad to show interest where the uss hancocks capt kershaws greatcabins had been the opulent quarters of a wealthy man those of a rich and titled man back in england mcgilliverays were spartan in the extreme lewrie knew he was related to a rich mercantile family and obviously had been educated at considerable expense his speech alone told him that the decks were covered with naileddown and painted canvas the colour a drabbish solid brown not the blackandwhite parquet chequer of a british man o war the interior panels were offwhite and not a single painting graced them his desk in his daycabin his chairs and such were crudely made dullfinished and almost graceless sailcloth curtains could be drawn to cover the transom sashwindows in the stern but the drapes seemed an afterthought and made from parchmenttan used sail scraps lewrie took a peek at the waiting dining table dull platters and place settings of dark pewter awaited them with but two fourhole candelabras and a lone pitcher of brightpolished pewter in the centre the glasses were nondescript befogged by long use and many scrubbings by clumsy servants in seawater mostlike whaleoil lanthorns hung overheadmica panels set in leaddark pewter or old tin and not a single glint of brass to be seen anywhere in the greatcabins not a single family portrait nothing personal to sumters captain lewrie was put in mind of the poorest village pubs and coaching inns he had ever seen was mcgilliveray a poor relation or as abstemious as a prelate in a poor parish eking out his dignity on the widows occasional charity and ten scrimpy pounds per annum damme what do they pay yankee captains he had to ask himself he did set a good table though with boiled shrimp done in a low country spicebroth roasted chickens odd yelloworange potatoes that he called yams and were quite sweet with a slather of his fresh butter beefsteaks from a freshkilled bullock and miles fatter and tenderer than anything he could have purchased from the british dockyard with lashings of cornmeal bread island chickpeas with diced onions and a tangy midmeal salad wine flowed as did whisky and lewrie noted that lt seabright capt mcgilliveray his first officer a lt claiborne and a freshfaced midshipman introduced to him as one desmond mcgilliveray freely imbibed the whisky like mothers milk politics and religion were of course banned topics and anything related to business was out too so supper conversation was limited americans and britons shared little in common the last fifteen years since the end of the revolution but a common language and even that was beginning to diverge they did not share music and song as they evolved nor dramas nor even london or court gossip needless to say the aforementioned yams came in for a lot of praise and discussion which led to longings for freshkilled venison comparisons of furrin dishes theyd come across in their voyages or the more exotic social customs witnessed so long as they had nothing to do with prurient or bawdy talk accompanied by winks and nudges food it seemed was safest with farming practices coming in a strong second and caribbean cuisine third lewrie held forth for the chinese or hindoo cooking and seasonings which led to questions about his adventures in the far east tween the wars a little covert work captain mcgilliveray lewrie told him with a wink bout the time your first merchant ships were putting in at canton many of ours and more than a few of yours were disappearing more than could be blamed on local pirates admiralty sent out a strong third rate disguised as a country ship not part of the east india company and sure tbe a prime target turned out tbe a french plot handinglove with mindanao pirates to build an alliance thatd capture everyones trade but theirs the next time war came well we put paid to em in the end couldnt blurt out that the french had a disguised squadron out there any more than we could reveal our own twas a hard three years all in all but it came right at last and god but twas priceless the startled uneasy look on mr peels face as he sketched out the nub of the tale that mission any of its sort was supposed to be held forever under the rose wait for thisun then lewrie mulishly thought as peel pleaded with his eyes for silence and no more details concluding with a harsh glare of warning in point of fact the frenchman who led their activities there is now here in the caribbean on guadeloupe lewrie told them with a secretive hunching forward as if sharing the unsharable his name is guillaume choundas and im told he directs their privateers and minor warships brutally ugly fellow lewrie said describing choundass current appearance you run across him you would do your nation the greatest service by eliminating him hes the cleverest brute ever ive come across mostlike sent out to counter your navys presence here dont you wish to finish him yourself captain lewrie young midshipman mcgilliveray asked his eyes alight at the prospects evidently the us navy was not quite as tolerant of outspoken gentlemen in training for his captain uncle glowered him to abashed silence and the teen reddened and ducked his head id give my right arm young sir lewrie declared and save the world a great deal of future grief though i very much doubt well ever heave in sight of one another just so long as somebody does i will spot the victor a case of champagne do i hear the glad news my word what a coup thatd be for your new navy what that went down well every american at the table got a wolfish speculative expression at that suggestion promotion glory and honour for themselves their new nation and navy a feat which would ensure a permanent us navy never again to be laid up or sold off once their emergency measures were no longer necessary lewrie took a peek cross the table to peel who was thinlipped and flinteyed at how much lewrie had revealed at how blatantly he had tossed the bait in their direction their eyes met and peels mouth quirked a touch though he did incline his head in mute and grudging agreement perhaps he would have brought choundass name up much more subtly but it was done and no real harm had resulted yet and you mister peel lt claiborne sumters first officer enquired you look like a travellin man so weathered an all are you royal navy too id expect you have a favourite cuisine as well uhm i am peel began flummoxing in search of a bona fide of a sudden spain portugal and the mediterranean region mostly i represent coutts bank in london so i do get about somewhat old family friend of my wifes british relations sir lewrie lied coveririg for him i bank with coutts so when james wrote he was being sent out to search for suitable acreage for a banks client i offered him passage to antigua from kingston safer passage than he could expect aboard a civilian packet my wife by the by originally came from the cape fear country in north carolina upriver near cross creek and campbelltown the scots settlements we first met during the last war in wilmington why that was right up the coast why that almost made her a scot herself and had he ever heard the tale of flora macdonald mistress of bonnie prince charlie whod landed at wilmington and married a local whod raised a tory highland regiment unfortunately defeated at widow moores creek bridge just outside wilmington but a chiswick was she why captain mcgilliveray had known of them had met a sewallis chiswick before the unpleasantness i my late fatherinlaw sir and the namesake of my eldest son lewrie happily exclaimed i served with carolines brothers burgess and governour chiswick quite incidentally really at yorktown rifle regiment one of ours actually but why i do blieve i was introduced to them too mustve been in or just before capt mcgilliveray gleefully said he was a carolinian from a distinctive region of the united states one thinly populated compared to the northern states and he was a scot a celt and vitally enthralled as all southerners were by family lineages what caroline had once said was a parlour game more popular than blindmans buff or cards what shed termed whos your people just lads they were then capt mcgilliveray recalled with a smile but likely lookin dash it i even think i remember a young girl quite the sweet miss with em blond hair and the merriest eyes that surely was my caroline sir lewrie agreed so all the chiswicks are in england now mcgilliveray asked no sir just her immediate family one branch remained and still farm in the cape fear some chiswicks and most of her former kin the mcdaniels who supported independence lewrie had to say ah we lost so many good friends an neighbours mcgilliveray said sighing when there was no need for em teut an run wed of put all the bitterness bhind us by now not if you burned each other out and murdered your own cousins lewrie sourly thought careful to keep a neutral expression as he remembered how caroline and her family had come as refugees to wilmington in rags and tears of betrayal now as i recall mister seabright tellin me once he returned from bearin my invitation captain lewrie mcgilliveray went on in a playful mood did you not tell him that you had met a mcgilliveray some time or other forget his christian name sorry tsay lewrie replied but there was a young man name of mcgilliveray with whom i served for a few weeks in just after i gained my commission he had been londoneducated came out from england with an older fellow who wished to try and influence the muskogee indians your pardons captain but as i recall this particular mcgilliveray or some of his kin were in the overmountain trade with the indian tribes and he was of partial indian blood lewrie stated with a hapless moue of chagrin unsure of how tales of whiteindian unions went down with touchy americans from the south and with capt mcgilliveray in particular had his kinsman been a black sheep a remittance man or a stain on their escutcheon was indian blood as shameful as a whitenegro blend seemed to be we tried to get the muskogee and seminolee to side with us to take on the spanish lewrie further said with another apologetic shrug spose that made him a tory to you all from charleston he said and lets not tell em the plan was tturn the indians loose on rebel settlers and drive em into the sea lewrie thought devil take the hindmost and the scalps my uncle roberts son my cousin desmond capt mcgilliveray said primly almost sadly all joy of comparing heritage quite dashed worst thing the famly ever did sendin some of us to england tmake cambridge scholars turned desmonds head round sorry t say my abject pardons for broaching the subject sir lewrie said much abashed though im told that even your great benjamin franklin and his son took opposing tacks during the revolution i did not oh tis long done with captain lewrie mcgilliveray allowed and desmonds been dead and gone these past twelve years he tried to placate but only came off grumpier more uneasy than anything else half the families in america had a toryrebel altercation if you look close once the war was over though desmond did come home and we reconciled our diffrences my brothers and i inherited the city firm and the sea trade whilst desmond managed the hide and fur trade among the indians here sir you actually went among the muskogee when he did or merely aye captain mcgilliveray lewrie replied just about to preen a bit more and tell them another tale of derringdo and proper modesty bedamned escorted him inshore then up the apalachicola river in our ships boats then overland to a muskogee town the name escapes me by a large lake me him a company of fusiliers and a foreign office you knew my father sir midshipman mcgilliveray blurted from the foot of the table startling them all to an uneasy silence lewrie turned to look at him the lad was gapemouthed in astonishment and sudden pleasure the stain on the mcgilliveray escutcheon best left unsaid or not lewrie suspected that the poor lad had never been told very much about his halfbreed sire who had served against his own kin during the revolution to boot despite his uncles declaration that theyd reconciled and put the rift behind them indeed i did young sir lewrie told him and a formidable fellow he was too brave alert and clever skilled in the lore of the forest and the nicest manners of the drawing room at home in a chickee or a mansion a bold horseman a skilled hunter the simple use of a longforgotten indian word for hut seemed to please the midshipman no end for he beamed wider expectantly as if starved for information long denied him of the white turtle clan i recall lewrie further reminisced or was it the wind clan on his mothers side muskogee royally as it were in any event he stood high in their councils with their uhm mikkos and their talwas their ministers and chiefs as grand as a peer in the house of lords lewrie told him the terms springing to the forefront of his memory after all those years at his urging i ended up anhissi myself toward the end made of their fire young mcgilliveray exclaimed with growing excitement to my grandmothers huti a grand honour is it not uncle captain sorry young desmond reddened it was indeed mister mcgilliveray his uncle gravely said and and were you there then captain lewrie midshipman mcgilliveray hesitantly pressed his curiosity getting the better of him and to the great astonishment of midshipman grace seated beside him who had never heard the like back in staid old england then you must have met my mother they were married grandfather robbie always told me on that trip you must have seen her ah lewrie hedged trying not to gawp the boys father he sourly recalled had been the hugest sort of prig and he doubted that cambridge had had a thing to do with it desmond mcgilliveray as he knew him had ranted like a baptist hedgepriest against fornication twixt the english and the indians forever lecturing and scolding the livelong day regarding sensible muskogee customs and how stupid and heathenish whites and lewrie in particular were frankly lewrie had come to quite heartily despise him dont even look at an indian woman especially when she was in her courses dont even piss in a stream above them lewrie couldnt recall desmond mcgilliveray even smiling at one of them hed taken no wife as long as lewrie had been ashore and inland with him perhaps after theyd sailed off that frail little dandyprat from the foreign office dead and all their plans gone for nought even after thinking they had a settled agreement that the muskogee would back england in the war only one marriage i recall and that was mine at the point of the knife lewrie thought working his mouth in silent resentful reverie twos desmond made me do it and thought it hilarious my mother was a visiting cherokee princess young mcgilliveray stated with a stubborn pissmeintheeye pride as if daring anyone to demean his antecedents probably from long practice her name in cherokee meant soft rabbit grandfather robbie said my father was dumbstruck in his tracks by her from the very first and soft rabbit goddamn lewrie quietly screeched almost knocking his wineglass over he aint that stiffnecks boy hes mine shit his mouth dropped open of its own volition his eyes blared as wide as a newsaddled colts as he took note of the lads eyes greyblue eyes just like his own and what had his father sir hugo smirked after calling upon theoni connor and her newborn bastard right after the nore mutiny hes got your eyes alan me son the old rakehell had cooed followed by a gleeful cackle his eyes soft rabbits glossy and thick ravenblack hair but with a fairer englishmans complexion that hed never have gotten from a union twixt soft rabbit and a halfblood even were mcgilliveray as fair as a finn a leaner face not rounded a fine nose not hawkish i knew her lewrie confessed met her he quickly amended damme didn t i just he frantically thought recalling all the sweet stolen hours when they went at it like fevered stoats like newlyweds and the only reason he and soft rabbit had been made to leap the sword was because she was war booty a slave taken by a muskogee war party up near the tanasi river far to the north a girl slave of the haughty wind clan couldn t birth a bastard and holding a rantipoling outsider responsible was amusing to them the poor deluded lad lewrie thought what was she like sir young midshipman mcgilliveray begged oh wondrous handsome lewrie truthfully said pretty as a picture not so very tall dye know but as slim and graceful as any doe deer sorry but they didnt wed whilst i was at their town and i never conversed with her gad imagine lettin an outsider english sailor such as me in such exalted company what point of fact the last time i saw your father was when he and his warriors escorted us back to our boats then downriver to the sea the spanish had gotten wind of our presence and they and the apalachee attacked us before we started unloading the trade goods and arms wed promised it was neckornothing there for a bit til your father rallied his warriors and ran them off all i was left to show for it was a bayonet in the thigh and a tale ttell early spring of it was and he called you imathla lubotskulgi captain mcgilliveray contributed of a sudden drawing lewries attention to the top of the table in creek thats little warrior desmond told me that he declared seeming to gawp in wonder over such a coincidence happening in regards to his longdead relative all these years and both gone to their maker of the smallpox id quite forgotten but well i am dashed the other supper guests smiled but he didnt though mcgilliveray didnt sound gawpish quite the opposite in point of fact as he squeamishly uneasily looked away eyes almost panicked and averted harumphing to reclaim his proper demeanour he knows lewrie thought cringing fighting manfully to keep a calm exterior himself and not turn and look at midshipman mcgilliveray desmond must have told him who really fathered the lad he looks so english he dve had to indians annul bad marriages at the green corn ceremonies soft rabbit mustve said ours didnt take when i didnt come back for her and mcgilliveray took her on said hed see to her and didn t he just the bastard well gentlemen capt mcgilliveray said balling up his napkin and laying it aside let us have the port or the whisky fetched out and honour our distinguished guests with a hearty toast to the king of england charge your glasses if you will lewrie again chose whisky he was badly in need of it at a nod midshipman mcgilliveray at the foot of the table rose and proposed the toast to king george iii with all the fulsome titles including defender of the faith of the church of england to which midshipman grace responded with a shorter toast to the president of the united statesthen the serious toasting and imbibing began chapter sixteen thank god for a quiet day in port lewrie muttered to himself as he struggled out of his coat sleeves with his longsuffering manservant aspinall trying to help trying to keep up with his captains slow staggering circle of the daycabin wouldnt trust me with the charge of a rowboat tmorrow you circle i pull yer sleeve sir thats th way aspinall meekly suggested mind yer kitty rrrowwr toulon bickered fleeing the imminent danger from his beloved masters clumping feet wisely taking his tail and paws out of reach in an offended scurry under the settee who won mister peel lewrie asked rather loudly mr peel temporarily stashed somewhat upright against the dealandcanvas partition to his cabin didnt answer he was too busy contemplating his shoes arms lankly dangling just about ready to drool them or us uhm sir peel finally responded looking up blearily up the cavalry huzzah forward the kings own heavy horse why the damn fools drunk as a lord lewrie chortled as he kicked a constricting shoe toward the diningcoach he stopped circling long enough for aspinall to start undoing the buttons of his waistcoat items which were too scientific for him at the moment aye sir so e is aspinall agreed smothering a giggle aspinall lewrie said peering at him as if imparting some eternal but urgent verity the yankee doodlesre a hopeless drunken lot itll do for em in the end i spect so sir aspinall said peeling the waistcoat off setting lewrie to circling again aspinall threw a helpless look at coxn andrews who was doing for mr peel and his coat and things damme ive lost a perfectly good shoe lewrie complained tis here someplace sir honest aspinall told him do slip tother off and ill mate em up now fer yer stock an shirt sir and ill fetch yer dressin gown lean on this sir will ye lewrie kicked the second off this one skittered underneath the settee causing toulon to yowl once more and scuttle off for someplace safer where people didnt shoot things at him dry dry dry lewrie carped noting rather squiffily in point of fact that hed been leant against his winecabinet he felt in need of liquid refreshment but the flimsy latch appeared too elaborate a safeguard for his fingers too ginger beer sah coxn andrews suggested plumping mr peel into a chair so he could remove his shoes good fo settlin a riled stomach ill fetch some from yo lazarette capital lewrie crowed swaying we have any ten gallon sir fetched aboard this mornin aspinall said coming back to lumber lewrie into a chair as well poor kershaw the clown lewrie commented tittering over what hed heard aboard the sumter once the dinner party had gotten so soaked that gossip had flowed as freely as the liquors capt kershaw of the hancock frigate had made a total muck of his new command hed been told lewrie had thought she carried too much artillery and he was right shed been caught in a blow windward of dominica and with too much endweight fore and aft had bucked and reared had hobbyhorsed and rolled so precipitously that her upper masts and spars had nearly carried away and her lower masts had been strained almost to breaking capt mcgilliveray had intimated rather slurringly inhiscupsgleeful that kershaw had refused to lower topmasts til far too late then without telling anyone at prince rupert bay hed sailed off for havana to make repairs despite their secretary of the navy stodderts strict caution to avoid entering such a pestilential harbour within a week a fifth of kershaws crew had gone down with yellow jack once repaired capt kershaw had taken hancock back to sea though not back to his assigned cruising ground no hed taken her all the way home cutting his tour in the caribbean far too short and to make matters even worse whilst onpassage up the chesapeake to moor hancock in the pratique or quarantine anchorage below baltimore had stranded her on a shoal above york river which grounding had finally sprung her indifferently repaired foremast the last stroke had come when the secretary of the navy mister benjamin stoddert on an inspection trip to baltimores dock facilities and new naval construction had gone aboard her once she had cleared pratique and had come into baltimore irked that a whole vital month of usefulness had been lost whilst quarantined the result of ignoring his orders regarding havana stoddert had discovered capt kershaws quirks mcgilliveray and his officers had jeeringly pointed out how sybaritic and luxurious kershaws cabins had been furnished as grandiose as an ottoman pashas harem and in complete disregard of the plainer usages of spare and simple american virtue and how kershaws own ideas of a fashionable naval uniform bought from that grandees purse for himself and his officers once theyd called at kingston jamaica was too frenchified as lewrie had judged them when first hed seen them the unfortunate kershaw was too well connected in both senate and house of representatives and too bloody rich to sack stoddert could however reward him with command of a proposed twodecker to be built in new york some day when pigs could fly perhaps sending kershaw to the chilly spartansouled thou shalt not north and relieving him with all due respect and ceremony with another officer kershaw had been welcome to take along those of his officers who were his favourites which kind consideration mostlike pulled up several more cackhanded weeds by the roots as well well no wonder lewrie had been confused by the plainness hed found aboard sumter suddenly he supposed hed have to strip his own greatcabins of half his furnishings did he return the favour and dine uss sumters officers aboard that or be taken for an indolent sybarite lewrie would have put more thought into that but he was interrupted by the harsh noise of a chair being dragged cross his blackandwhite painted canvas deck covering mr peelevidently not able to walk but still of a mind to gabwas hauling up to him by fits and starts hands clasped on the chair arms attempting hindoo mystic levitation bump by hopping bump whilst employing his heels as oars to drag forward by main force americansre quite upset lewrie peel slurringly said though trying to overenunciate he had one eye open and was obviously having some trouble focussing thatun and who wouldnt be i ask you lewrie replied without a clue as to what it was that peel wished to maunder about kershaw south carolinian one of them bad form bein relieved even fr cause peel tried to explain massachummm a down east yankee replacin im hic useful that belch ssssectional bitternessss lewrie replied so liking the sound of it that he tilted his head and hissed like a serpent for a few more moments dear god but were foxed numb lips hmmm and who wouldnt be i ask you peel heartily agreed as their ginger beer came hellish brew cornwhisky hic hellish stuff cant see how jonathons stay upright past dinner hic worse than the plague o gin back home blue ruin tasty belch though lewrie commented oh ahrr mr peel vigourously said nodding so we learn anything tnight lewrie thought to enquire oh bags sir peel enthusiastically claimed he then paused though openmouthed and cockheaded his silence broken by a few more hiccoughs and the odd eructation itll come tme spanish bitters sah coxn andrews suggested presenting them with a smallish glassstoppered vial and a plate of sliced lemons on which he liberally sprinkled the vials contents mistah durant sah he say bitters an lemons be dah grand specific fer hiccins settle yer bileish humours good as gingah beer tboot bite down capm whyeverd we come here i wonder god damn my eyes lewrie grumbled as he gnawed on a quarter of lemon then quickly blared his eyes and grimaced at the taste and smell turd waterd be belch quickly followed by mr peels similar sentiment after hed bit down on his quarterlemon he sucked in great gulps of air and drained his mug of ginger beer to erase the foul taste deep breath an hold her fo a full minute mistah peel sah andrews solicitously instructed an yah hiccins be gone gack peel replied cheeks bulging and a hand pressed to his mouth and the good eye floundering about for the welcome sight of any receptacle in which to cast his accounts christ dont puke on my deck chequer lewrie sourly thought as he held his own breath and watched you ve already ruined it enough he ran out of wind slightly before peel and began to gasp his lungs and chest gulping air like a washdeck pump sucked spillage lord god peel said with a miserable groan after a last and stentorian and prolonged belch think ive been purged bettah though sah andrews enquired yes matter o fact i am thankee you were sayin huh oh what did we learn lewrie reiterated and whyd we come to antigua why we came here to introduce ourselves to the powers that be captain lewrie peel told him head drooping as if suddenly spent by his dosing with bitters learn how rife are the frog privateers sightings of french men o war oh and where yankee merchant ships are trading thats what sumters people told me south o here for the most part where you find one you find the other sharks an pilot fish lewrie seemed to agree but some go into jacmel peel added finally looking up and looking as bedraggled as deaths head on a mopstick didnt mean to reveal that but in whisky veritas what ah lewrie exclaimed as if grasping an eternal verity or solid geometry never mind then but mister peel that means that we must be two ships cover jacmel up north or cruise far down along the leewards to aruba and spanish new granada kill choundas and his captains with one hand blockade rigaud with tother to demonstrate he held up first the left hand then the right and wiggled his fingers of which he seemed to have twice perhaps thrice the requisite number rather fascinatin really and no no peel carped as if dealing with a toddlers questions choundas on guadeloupe yankee merchants meet up at dominica sumter convoyed dozens of em here hired stores ship too left her there prince rupert bay here there maybe up as far as saint croix goods for rigaud or louverture start from guadeloupe do you see catch em first leg o their passage jamaica squadron gets the ones headin for portauprince or jacmel last leg what stop that lewrie growled gods sake write it all down write it now peel gawped cant even spell ink in now aye lewrie owlishly insisted so one of us remembers it in the mornin but dash it lewrie i say else well have task the yankees all over again whisky an all mister peel oh oh peel gasped point taken indeed well im for bed can i find it lewrie announced trying to rise of his own volition lots tdo in the morrow repaint all the masts and spars britishfashion else the fortsll take fright an shoot us to kindling stores tlade naps ttake oh thankee andrews touch tlarboard is it hung from the overhead now thats cunning sways a good deal id imagine ah aspinall do get mister peel ink quill and paper will you he called out while his coxn took his dressing gown and poured him into his bedcot and to all a good night peels muttered grumbles were simply music to his ears as he got comfortable the windows in the coachtop overhead were open with a tiny trysail set as a windscoop lewrie fanned his sheet then let it drop to his waist savouring the rare nighttime coolness after a bit of relative silence marred only by peels faint curses and the shit of his quill nib toulon at last decided that peace had been restored and slunk out of hiding in the starboard quartergallery storage and leaped up to join him slinging his bulk into the crook of lewries arm and kneading for pets beginning to purr right lustily as his masters hand stroked and wriggled upon his neck and head in vino and whisky veritas lewrie drunkenly thought on the verge of whirling unconsciousness and whatd i let slip this evnin kindest if the lad never knows hes my bastard halfindian lifes already hard enough for im and caroline never learns it either i want reconcile hed be the last straw damme but i mustve strewed byblows like dust in a high wind my git a likely lookin lad he is though chapter seventeen shattered shattered in knee timbers and futtocks from upper first futtock to fourth amidships along with her ribs her graceful stem choke piece knee of the head stemson timbers and apronincluding her fore rib pieces and futtocks were shattered once they had stripped le bouclier down to a gantline with only her lower masts standing with all her ballast stores and guns removed and careened her on the shingly leeside beach near basseterre the surveyors from the dockyard had discovered just how grievous and extensive her damage was the surveyors and the few skilled shipwrights still left on the island of guadeloupe after the purging and execution of the royalists and the suspect held little hope that the magnificent frigate could be sufficiently rebuilt oh in france certainement they said with high shrugs in the caribbean though there were no stout oak trees nor were there great curving timbers of the proper arcs or thickness nor the right seasoning and just to replace her outer and inner planking and lighter damage to carline posts bulwarks and rails would exhaust their scant supply of imported oak the shipwrights were most apologetic but there was little they could do for le bouclier oh could a ship bear a surveyor and a team of shipwrights to cuba or some other spanish possession local mahogany might serve for permanent repair materials but selecting the rightshaped trees felling them sawing them and transporting them back to basseterre would take months even then the mahogany would still require months more for proper seasoning and drying heartbreaking msieur le capitaine the master shipwright and the commissaire of the dockyard both had said then had fled his presence before the expected storm broke heartbreaking indeed capt guillaume choundas thought what a wondrous frigate le bouclier had been the equal if not the better of any bloody warship in the caribbeannow a useless lifeless hulk and damn that salaud lewrie to the deepest level of hades just as heartbreaking though more understandable was what he heard from his superior the commissaire civil victor hugues he still had his single frigate now cruising for american prizes off the coast of the guyanas far to the southwest did she come in in need of repair hugues was certain that choundas would offer bits and pieces from le bouclier to keep one powerful man o war able to daunt the biftecks and that choundas would do so in the proper cooperative spirit in accord with the ideals of the revolution you still have two rather fine corvettes capitaine choundas hugues had said with a vengeful smirk which have yet to put to sea to challenge the bloodies let them sail singly or as a small squadron officers and men off your stricken frigate may reenforce their crews or you may transfer those now idled to my command and i will put them to good use aboard the several enemy merchant ships took before your arrival with cannon from le bouclier i could outfit at least three more raiders to pursue le guerre de course i am the senior naval officer on guadeloupe msieur le commissaire choundas had thundered back appointed by the hand of director paul barras premier of the directory of five they are my cannon my sailors and officers and do they sit idle in port for lack of cooperation from the islands commissaire civil believe me msieur he will know of it in short order unless in the cooperative spirit according to the ideals of la revolution prize vessels suitable to my needs which also now lie idle for want of cooperation are not turned over to me i a bitter compromise had been reached hugues had not been sure that choundass writ might prove to carry more power than his own with the directory or that the ogre just might have the ear of paul barras after all hugues got le bouclier for scrapyard use and four of her greatguns with which to form a protective shore battery at deshaies choundas received a mere two prize ships for conversion a small brig and one schooner to be armed with no more than ten guns apiece crewed by as many matelots as he wished to employ for boarders and passage crews for any prizes taken wounded off le bouclier who recovered they would become huguess naval infantry other than choundass personal guard detail would be landed ashore and put under huguess command to reenforce his skimpy man garrison choundas sat and sweated stripped down to shirt and breeches and fanning himself with a top silver plaited palmetto hand fan among the princes of the lanun rovers or mindanao pirate fleets there had been tiny young girls with cool wetted bundles of palm fronds extremely young girls who would come whenever he had beckoned would wind out of their colourfully printed batik wraps to service him or cheerfully submissively let themselves be pressed down spread and taken as casually as they spat betel juice not so casually the second time he took them but their fear then their weak whines and pleadings even their looks of revulsion had been doubly sweet and invigourating back when he was a normallooking man before that salaud lewrie lamed and maimed him he fanned a little harder shifting his crippled leg to ease an everpresent dull ache with perspiration popping anew to trickle down his cheeks and the small of his backpartly from the effort put into fanning for relief from the sullen afternoons heat partly from being frustrated to lose the tumescence in his groin that such fond reverie had engendered and could never be relieved quite so easily as then and partly from the intrusion of his undying hatred for the englishman and the harm hed done his magnificent frigate his noir servants damn hugues for freeing them damn hugues too for charging him rente on the use of them by the week damn them for drawing the line on what they would or would not do for their new master and his coterie as if some things were below their dignity as if they had any sense of dignity to upset they dared lay complaints of illusage with victor huguess sous commissaires civils they insolently dared to quit his house when they didnt just run off and implored the commissaires for employment with any other house even at lower wages if they had to the commissaires had sent letters chiding him for harshness he was to pay more for the services of those who remained there were fewer servants in his retinue doing the same amount of labour and illiterate or not those remaining noirs seemed as if they knew those letters by heart cleaning laundry and yardwork was now done in lacklustre fashion dishes and glassware appeared at meals spotted and stained and had to be sent back over and over til he was satisfied the cuisine already upsetting was now slovenly overdone or underdone some days too spicy to be stood and on others so bland as to be nearly tasteless and the new male cook and his assistant had a rare knack for finding the toughest oldest and scrawniest victuals whether fish fowl or meat lank wilted halfshriveled vegetables halfwashed salad greens almost brown or black on the leaf edges and their mute dogeyed blankfaced portrayals of dumb innocence their shamblingslow headscratching shows of utter ignorance they behaved much as that lt recamier had cautioned spoons and utensils went missing saucers and cups inexplicably got broken or chipped costly bedlinens brought from france got torn permanently stained or so poorly repaired that the caterpillarsized seams made them useless for sleeping despite constant warnings about open windows and doors birds lizards and shoals of cafards the huge evilsmelling cockroaches endemic to the tropics invaded infested the house and their bedding every night and each dawn resulting in a stampede of noirs who went tittering and yelping to chase them down and expel themresulting in something fragile and valuable being broken each time merde alors every bottle of wine that was opened tasted as if it had been watered no matter that he inspected the corks and leaden seals closely no matter that his clerk etienne practically stood guard over his cellar with all the crates placed in de gougnes cramped office and bedchamber with a marine infantry sentry in the foyer right outside the doors and not a blessed one of them would fan him screeching tirades made no more impression than if choundas had howled at the tide like king canute ordering it to go out not in and he could not beat them whip them kick them or slap them as one could casually do hindoos chinese or filipinos and it was galling to him one letter had suggested spending more of his pay to purchase a better cuisine for all including servants of garbing them in better clothing of supplying shoes and stockings but he would be damned if he would the cost of that notwithstanding there was no way choundas would stoop to bribing noirs to treat him better or be mocked for a soft touch it would be a token of total surrender and even if he dismissed them all and started with a fresh crew of servants word of his ineffectivenesshis defangingwould be all over the island by the next sunset making him the laughingstock of noirs creoles and frenchborn alike he fanned himself some more and swabbed his face and neck with a small towel that had once been coldly moist but now reeked of sweat mildew and armpits he painfully drew his chair up to his massive and elegant desk to study his manning problems lt houdon could command the brig the larger prize vessel now being armed and converted for a commerce raider lt mercier would be his second officer and capt griot would have to surrender one of his junior lieutenants to make the necessary third bien capitaine macpherson for all his drawbacks was a masterful seaman able to command la resolue without his first officer and his first lieutenant would be seasoned and made of the same mould as he by now that officer would get the large schooners command aussi bien junior lieutenants would move up in seniority aspirants would become actinglieutenants aboard the corvettes no the schooner needed two more officers and the brig needed a fourth perhaps to serve as prizemaster when she took a suitably big or valuable merchantman the schooner too damn this heat choundas found it hard to think he took a deep breath of hot still and musty air squirmed about so his sweatsodden shirt became cooler by exposure and pored over the names in the copied musters he ticked off a few names chose a couple then leaned back in frustration against the damp leather chairback chewing absently on the end of his expensive pens rosewood stylus it was one of the new steelnibbed pens just coming into vogue and common use instead of goose quills and he proudly thought for a moment another example of his nations inventiveness like the leadcore pencil recamier no jules hainaut hmmm what was he to do with young jules he wondered the lad had shown well the day that le bouclier had died hainaut was tarryhanded when he put his mind to it and was overdue for reward for his services to him as well as his recent pluckiness but yet what that idiotic dutch captain haljewin had said stuck in choundass suspicious mind and kept resurfacing someone who had known the dutch ships cargo and day of her departure someone who knew his plans must have betrayed her had betrayed poor capt desplan and le bouclier to the british how else to explain how lewrie and his frigate had arrived just at the perfect moment lewrie was a swaggering dumb beast a weapon to be wielded by his betters nothing more choundas disparagingly sneered in the far east lewrie had been under the thumb of a much slyer man that murderous cutthroat the spare and hatchetfaced anglais spy zachariah twigg together they had ruined his plans a second time in the mediterranean in despite being forewarned by citizen pouzin his enigmatic civilian counterpart sent down from paris posing as a mere banking clerk a juif from coutts bank named simon silberberg of lewries acquaintance twigg had hah old twigg would be now but choundas did not think he could go far wrong to suspect that he still spun his webs this far from london using a younger protege who would find that beastly ignoramus lewrie once again a useful catspaw a younger spy who had already obtained his secret navy signals books and had not old twigg or silberberg or whatever he called himselfand lewrietaken one of his coasting vessels full of arms to encourage the piedmontese and savoyards into french service another delicate mission most effectively stopped and jules hainaut had been aboard her had he not taken prisoner and held for a mere six weeks before being exchanged for a british midshipman then returned to his side hed thought then that it had been a suspiciously short imprisonment but had twigg turned hainaut back on him as a secret informer as lewrie had somehow turned that claudia mastandrea slut who had been sent to milk him dry of information then poison him as he and citizen pouzin had arranged all his schemes had turned to dust after hainaut had come back to him hadnt they how did les anglais know of his coming to guadeloupe learn of haljewins sailing day know his decision to shift le bouclier over to basseterre and when from a nest of traitors and spies already here n the island or from one he had unwittingly brought with him choundas had always known that jules hainauts eager deference was cynical playacting the lad was out for his pleasures promotion a fat purse and his prick he had taken him on anyway knowing what good use he could make of a shrewd and pragmatic rogue the revolution badly needed men who would not flinch from ruthlessness and jules had proved that he could ignore false sentiments and perform what he was ordered to do choundas had worked round his sham and had even found the lad amusing at times he had groomed him tutored him to improve his effectiveness in the future he didnt wish to think the worst of the lad there could be a spy placed or bought off long ago there could be someone whom he had yet to suspect and it would be galling for choundas to admit he had nurtured a viper in his breast all this time he would give hainaut the benefit of the doubt for now at sea he would no longer be privy to the plans he would improvise now that choundas knew that his old ones might be compromised if jules was the spy he would have no way to communicate with the british did lewrie and the british continue to plague him with more inexplicable coincidences choundas would know that hainaut was innocent but did the fortunes of his small squadron and his new raiders improve beyond all hopes and the deep investigation he would begin the very next morning fail to turn up another suspected traitor it would be sad but for the lack of another explanation choundas would have no other choice but to denounce and arrest hainaut put him to the question to sear the truth from him then turn him over to the gendarmes for trial and a sure and certain execution under the blade of the merciless victor huguess monsieur guillotine and if blameless well hainaut would get his seasoning for future duty to france as a naval officer his fondest wish choundas thought to watch his reactions for carefully hidden upset or too much joy no hed dissemble pretend to be glad but not too glad sham sadness to be leaving choundass side perhaps even pipe his eyes with loss at leaving the service of such a fine master pah it would prove nothing choundas suspected he was too fly there were blank lines opposite the positions of the schooner now renamed la vigilante choundas dipped the steel nib of his pen in the inkwell paused over the lines dieuxieme or troisieme second or third officer a real reward choundas whispered his fiendish face even uglier as he smiled so widely as he clumsily wrote hainauts name on the line for second officer written with his left hand the name was almost illegible even to him but choundas was sure that his mousy and harassed little clerk etienne de gougne would be able to decypher it when he made the fair copies in his copperplate hand and gloat with studiously hidden glee to be rid of his tormentor chapter eighteen the two warships sailed together clawing out their offing from antigua to the eastsoueast and closehauled to windward on the larboard tack though hms proteus had been quicker off the mark to seize the windward advantage smothering the uss thomas sumter in her lee by her spread of sail the american ship had still surged up almost abeam of her by late afternoon as the days heat faded as the airs borne by the trade wind grew denser fresher from the careenage i expect sir mr winwood said as the reason with a cleaner bottom equal our waterline length captain lt langlie supposed as well so it stands to reason that both hulls perform equally perhaps a touch finer in her entry than ours but no better handled lt catterall said with a dismissive sniff longer yards with larger courses surely lt adair dared to comment as they watched the sumter bowl along barely half a mile alee especially pon her tgallants and royals fullerbellied jibs mmhmm lewrie replied to their guesses telescope to one eye for the last ten minutes entire intent upon his study of her converted from a merchantman shes fuller in her beam too lt langlie pondered aloud so perhaps she sits more upright than we just a few degrees stiffer and sailing on a flatter bottom with a pronounced shoulder not as rounded as our chines sir mmhmm lewrie said again and that only because he sensed the pregnant pause in their musings that required a response on his part merchantman or no shes a swift sailer ill grant them mr winwood admitted with a hint of grumbling over any vessel that could rival a britishbuilt britishmasted and britishrigged ship one set up to suit his experiences and his captains aye swift lewrie mumbled his arms tiring at last he let the barrel of the strongest dayglass rest on the lee bulwarks of the quarterdeck for a bit he peered about to windward then aloft to the commissioning pendants stiffdriven coachwhip to the clouds on the horizon in search of dirty weather there was none the pendant was fully horizontal its swallowtail tip fluttering in concert with the lee edges of the jibs and courses even with the larboard battery run out and the starboard run in proteus was just a pinch slower than the yankee man o war perhaps by as much as a quarter of a knot and the cleanliness of her quickwork could not explain it americans simply built faster ships lewrie decided just like the french did proteus had been based on a british interpretation of a captured french frigate whose lines had been taken off and copied but perhaps not copied closely enough puts me in mind of something from the beatitudes hey mister winwood lewrie asked the sailing master how does it go that the first shall be last and the last shall be first no matter if they outfoot us or point a degree or two more to windward really proteus was made to dominate not sprint stay the course in all weathers keep the seas and then hammer the swifter when we finally corner em or simply chase em off sir lt catterall said with a grunt of agreement make em outrun us in fear well said sir lewrie told him with a brief grin which drew growls of like sentiment from the rest as he turned back to leeward to raise his telescope once again bracing the tube on the ratlines of the mizen stays this time he sobered quickly though dropping back into a brown study usually foreign to his nature or his officers experience with him his statement had been his first utterance in the past hour other than a curt directive or two to improve their ships handling and intent upon sumter once more he gave all indications of ignoring anything they said lewrie was not studying sumter in search of a weakness that he could use to keep proteus ahead though in fact the idea of sailing her hullunder was the last thing he wished to do no matter how competitive he would usually act to maintain the honour of the royal navy his ship or his crew he was not in truth peering so intently upon sumter as he was keeping an eye on one of her midshipmen his son his bastard son who was at that moment perched aloft high in the sumter main weather stays just below her futtock shrouds with a glass in his hands too which he lifted every now and again to caution his captainuncle to proteus next race strategem two other boys of sumters cockpit were perched with him all three hooting and cheering as the american armed ship gradually gained a few more yards on proteus theyd wave their tricorne hats and whoop and halloo teethbared and mouths open in perfect os like a pantomimes show against the thunder of the winds theyd lean far out with only a finger and a shoe heel gripping the ratlines and stays daring each other to greater follies of tarry derringdo and each time midshipman desmond mcgilliveray matched or bettered their feats lewrie sucked in his breath as if to shout and warn them to belay all that he could see a grizzled bosun atop the bulwarks at the base of the stays fist shaking and mouth open to bawl caution at them but with boys that age what he shouted mostlike went in one ear and out the other and lewrie still felt twinges of worry a fathers worry desmond lifted his glass lowered it then waved wide beaming looking directly into the lens of the powerful dayglass as if he knew he was being watched so closely he raised his glass again and lewrie lowered his knowing he was being eyed and pantomimed a solid grip on the stays with both hands and was much relieved to see the lad seem to obey and loop an arm and a shin inside the ratlines round a rigid stay lewrie made a large gesture of swabbing a coat sleeve over a worried brow dont do that he silently mouthed over the water boat ahoy midshipman larkin had challenged two days following that drunken supper and the youthful voice shouting in reply had drawn lewrie to the deck the turnout for a foreign midshipman was as thin as charity so it was larkin who led mr midshipman mcgilliveray to the quarterdeck from the entryport with his sealed letter for proteuss captain who met them personally captain mcgilliverays sincerest respects to you sir and im charged to deliver to you this message captain lewrie sir the lad had crisply stated doffing his hat and making a courtly leg worthy of an english mid reporting to an admiralthough no english mid would ever peer so intently or so openly and perhaps only a famous man such as jervis or nelson would elicit such an awestruck expression as midshipman mcgilliveray displayed thank you mister mcgilliveray lewrie had replied properly gruff and stoical his hand out for the letter i was instructed to wait upon your written reply sir and mcgilliveray said stumbling for the first time he had shown none of the usual youthful curiosity one might expect of a fellow boarding one of king georges ships for the first time not even craning his head about to see how other navies did things rigged things but kept his gaze wideeyed upon lewrie far more intently than any courtly book of gentlemanly behaviour could advise when dealing with ones superiors or elders oill see ta him sor whilst i shall rather larkin offered eyes almost crossed in concentration on proper speech no that wont be necessary mister larkin but thankee ill have mister mcgilliveray below to my quarters lewrie decided which unexpected offer of hospitality confused one but delighted the other aspinall this is mister mcgilliveray off the united states armed ship thomas sumter lewrie told his cabinsteward as he seated himself behind his desk mister mcgilliveray my man aspinall and a better aid and comfort youll rarely see keeps me minding my ps and qs does aspinall sit lad sit howdje do sir aspinall had cheerfully said knuckling his forehead draw us each a ginger beer would you aspinall lewrie bade as he tore open the wax seal of the letter still faintly soft still warm to the touch thank you kindly sir mcgilliveray said seated in an upholstered chair before the desk hat in his lap and almost squirming with some inner fretfulness despite the halfsmile he evinced his curiosity did extend to looking about the greatcabins finally hello lewrie looked up to see toulon who had leaped atop the desk in curiosity of his own perching himself on the very edge of the desk to crane his neck forward and bob to study the newcomer thats toulon lewrie had told him where i got him in when he was a kitten he was just about as huge as disaster so thats how he got his name hes almost outgrown his clumsiness but he can still surprise you hes a bigun sure enough sir the lad said cautiously petting the ramcat ruffling the fur under toulons intricately plaited sennetwork collar with the brass disk hung from it as big as a bobcat nigh twenty pounds or so sir sure enough toulon surprised stretching too far in his bliss and diving nosefirst to the deck to make it less embarrassing toulon leaped into the boys lap as if that was what he intended all along lewrie unfolded the pages of his letter and read the first lines or so then whuffed in alarm despite any misgivings or forebodings capt mcgilliveray might feel the boys uncle had determined to reveal the facts of his parentage to the lad he had blabbed all ah captain lewrie mr peel had cheerfully called out emerging from his dogbox cabin a visitor have you no one to arouse your interest mister peel lewrie had almost snapped regretting such a curt dismissal at once not for peels sake but for how lightly he might esteem the lad pray take a turn on deck mister peel ive a letter from captain mcgilliveray of sumter very well sir peel had responded sounding intrigued as well as a tad miffed to be shooed out as he departed mcgilliveray had thought it odd for his kinsman to turn up with a wife and a son especially a paleskinned and blueeyed infant so very unlike himself they had stayed but briefly in charleston after the revolution had ended since his bride soft rabbit could never gain entree into cultured society even if she could have adapted to civilised dressor shoesor could have learned to speak fluent english it was a muskogee marriage after all as informal as that of a black city couple jumping the broomstick in the slave quarters desmond and soft rabbit had resided with the boys grandfather robert at his plantationcumtrading post on the edge of civilisation far up the savannah river and no circuitriding parson had made it any more formal from what capt mcgilliveray had discovered during their brief visit during a later trip to uncle roberts he thought their marriage one more of convenience than a love match as if desmond felt hed had to do the right thing by her after her exploitation by an english sailoradventurer for the good of his tribe and clan name and soft rabbit had acquiesced since the babe needed a father and she needed support that a lowstatus former slave could not get in a proud clan huti among the muskogee capt mcgilliveray had gently railed against his kinsman deeming him a stiffnecked prig who had taken upon himself the burden and duty to atone for white callousness desmond did need someone to cook and clean sew his clothes and service his rare bouts of prim desires the boy was desmonds experiment he was halfwhite and deserved the same chance his putative stepfather had had to gain an education so he could function in the white world if he so chose with a solid grounding in muskogee lore and trailcraft should he choose that life at best perhaps the lad could find a place in the family overmountain indian trade a symbolic bridge to desmonds vaunting dreams of a partially civilised muskogeeseminoleecherokeechickasawchoctawapalachee race coexisting at the borders of the united states like the iroquois league as the semibarbaric german and gallic tribes had coexisted with ancient rome as the various hindoo tribes served a burgeoning british empire in india a project but never a beloved son a comforting worker but never a goody wife alas sadly the smallpox put paid to those plans capt mcgilliveray had written desmond and soft rabbit were carried off and kindly old uncle robert quite enervated to the point that the lad was brought to us in charleston by desmonds youngest brother iain and an older muskogee nursemaid when the lad was three and became my ward whereupon he did receive the best of everything we mcgilliverays could bestow on one of our own and young desmonds connexions with his indian nature were effectively severed curious as the lad seemed anent his antecedents i must confess that i can recall no true fondness beyond his mother toddler that he was when he came to us he held no particular air of grief for his late stepfather even when considering how stoic our indians comport themselves so when i at last informed the lad of the identity of his actual father ithankfullydiscerned not a great disappointment on his part nor did desmond evince any sudden surprise i suspect that the old muskogee nursemaid who stayed with us til her passing in was present when you and desmond took part in your adventures and imparted to him the truth meddlin fool lewrie had thought at that moment theres whole regiments o lads never knew who quickened em but still prospered silence mightve been kinder he was settled in his mind as an orphan with a silver spoon and all now christ imagine my astonishment two evenings past sir when your comments made me put two and two together capt mcgilliveray had penned further the utter coincidence and the odds against such i only knew what little desmond had related to me and that long ago anent your identity or character and must confess that i knew nothing about you other than your most recent success off guadeloupe enquiries made ashore though sir quickly satisfied my curiosity as to the illustrious name you have gained in the royal navy and the many successes you have had against your kings foes fame which i was quick to pass on to young desmond who enflamed by his own eager curiosity made enquiries ashore whilst on his errands among midshipmen warrants and those few officers who might deign to converse with him such revelations assured him that he is the scion of a most capable and honourable gentleman only heard the good parts lewrie had silently thought squirming in sudden dread waitll the other shoe drops so now what they passin him onto me im tbe his daddy of a sudden dear god im to set him an example lewrie had laid the letter aside and looked up to see his son stroking toulon who was now all but cradled in the crook of one arm belly exposed and paws in the air with his head laid back in rapture to be getting such diligent attention the lad looked him in the eyes and gulped near to shying should lewrie speak a single callous word well well lewrie finally said after clearing his throat it would appear that were kin young sir now what the bloody hell do we make of that dont dont know sir desmond meekly said with a gulp i never meant tleave your mother leave soft rabbit but lewrie began stammering a tad your fatherdesmond twas him said it would be best that hed see to her after i sailed away i was wounded touch and go that id live for a while there anyway so it seemed best all round couldnt have taken her to london any more than desmond could have settled her in charleston was she really a princess like he said sir desmond asked in almost a desperate pleading a cherokee princess lewrie sat up with a start smothering the wince he felt a captured cherokee princess he finally lied unable to disabuse all the lads callow assumptions those sticking points to which his very self clung mankiller the great warrior of your fathers white wind clan raided far north and took her brought her back for a valuable slave quite a coup they thought she wasnt visiting the muskogee said the tseluki werent the real people not as good as them couldnt even talk right the cherokee they told me but they let you marry her even so sir desmond pressed at him snuggling toulon to him as if for comfort being an outsider and all i meant was it she served me supper one night lewrie told him reminiscing almost happily despite the awkward circumstances and i was lost in a trice unmarried muskogee girls may choose whom they wish and we met later down at the lake we talked or tried to and she was so very fetching and handsome so slim and wee really very sweet and gentle a girl and smart as paint too quick to learn things uhm randy as a stoat lewrie had thought do i dare tell him that yet you never thought to write her or look for her once the war ended sir if you loved her as much as she id barely made my lieutenantcy and the royal navy distrusts junior officers who marry lewrie extemporised squirming in embarassment were to make commander first then marry some retired admirals proper daughter does she come with acres attached thats even better dye see young sir besides they slung me ashore in london on halfpay then shipped me halfway round the world to india and the chinese coast for nigh on three years by then id met my caroline the lady on the bulkhead sir shes very pretty do you have children dare i ask sir desmond shyly probed three two boys and a daughter lewrie said crossing his fingers over how long that situation might continue and a ward to boot a genteel french girl well young woman by now whose kin were slain at toulon promised a dying french officer i knew from the revolution that id see for his cousin sophie youd like her ill wager unless of course you have a special young miss dear to your heart back in charleston lewrie thought to tease to finagle more probing and upsetting questions oh none particular yet sir the lad actually blushed before turning a touch gloomy even as a mcgilliveray dyou see were a longsettled and respectable family and all but but people still think you not quite the ton because the lad merely bobbed his head as if in shame seemingly more intent on nuzzling toulon to his chin which was just heavenly to the ramcat well damn their blue blood i say lewrie barked uhm this sudden revelation how widespread dye wish it to be among yer peers and such would a british father make things worse for you or better pardons but i aint had much experience at this youve spent so much time a lewrie flummoxed hand waving for words bastard sir the lad suddenly said with toocandid heat well dye want tput it that way aye lewrie answered with an embarrassed grimace no harm in it really im a bastard myself that snapped the lads head up right quick struth lewrie vowed little matter of hiring a false justice stead of proper clergy when my own father sir hugo st george willoughby took my mother elisabeth lewrie to wife a little jape arranged by his fellow officers in the fourth regiment of foot you know the kings own the drunken lot o sots she died soon as i was born and i got lost in a parish poor house nigh a year and was lucky to live cruel as they care for orphan gits til my father came and got me out here lad does your uncle your captain require you back aboard any time soon or would you care to go ashore with me and dine i expect weve a lot of catching up to do i expect we do sir the lad said almost pathetically grateful and eager and id i would be greatly honoured to accept an invitation to dine with you sir because coz ive yet tmeet a mid who wasnt halfstarved that too sir desmond mcgilliveray confessed all smiles of a sudden er should i call you sir or captain lewrie or well once you learn what a sordid family youre kin to make up your own mind as to that lewrie allowed aspinall id admire did you pass the word for coxn andrews and my boatcrew ill dine ashore with mister mcgilliveray he said springing to his feet aye aye sir your fathers knighted sir desmond happily bubbled as they gathered hats and such is he a lord and your pardons but those medals you wore at supper tother night no he aint lewrie gleefully related he was knighted for bravery a majorgeneral now though mostly retired on his estate nothing much really nothing grand thisuns for saint vincent we were in shoutin distance of captain nelson at thatun and thisuns for camperdown when we trounced the dutch under duncan the wild scot oh hes a tall craggy figure white hair stickin up six ways from sunday and you wear a hanger instead of a smallsword best for boardingparty brawls dont ye know cut and slash as well as skewer and short enough to whip about when its shouldertoshoulder desmond to which use of his christian name the lad beamed so widely his face threatened to split in half as lewrie laid a tentative claiming hand atop his shoulder lightlyostensibly to steer him ahead of him on the way out past the marine sentry to the gundeck and god help us the both of us lewrie had thought signal from the sumter sir midshipman grace sang out as the bunting soared aloft from the man o war abeam of them and alee making lewrie shift his telescope aft towards her mizenmast where the powerful dayglass forced him to scan the signal flags toptobottom one at a time she sends farewell and adieu sir her second hoist is haul wind for am hauling wind id suppose does she propose to order a royal navy frigate to escort her to dominica thats another matter lewrie heard lt catterall gravel spell out best of fortune to her best you may lad lewrie told grace mister windwood aye sir the sailing master answered stepping closer weve enough searoom to come about and run betwixt guadeloupe and montserrat mister winwood lewrie asked him more than sufficient captain winwood soberly assured him very well sir and thankee lewrie replied well let the sumter haul off well alee before we come about ourselves thomas sumter would be taking the outside passage to windward of guadeloupe that scorpions nest for her base in prince rupert bay on dominica heavily laden with freshslaughtered and salted beef and pork with her decks also burdened by meat on the hoof to victual any arriving american warships even so burdened however she would leap at the chance to engage any french she encountered capt mcgilliveray had assured in his letters final pages as for hms proteus well mr peel was miffed anew by what lewrie had planned to do when not at loggerheads concerning how the distant mr pelham had instructed them to operate peel was turning out to be a rather amiable companion and god knew that any captain needed some personal contact and conversation besides cats dogs geese and chickens or himself to ease the mute loneliness of command but lewrie suspected that mr james peel would ever be on the quivive for his inspired moments waiting for a heavy shoe to drop proteus would cruise past guadeloupe to leeward again and do victor hugues guillaume choundas and their privateers and smugglers another evil turn if they could find anything at sea to bash then though they would cruise on down to dominica and beyond into the seas where american merchantmen were trading leeward of martinique and st lucia st vincent and the grenadines perhaps as far south as tobago and trinidad as far west as curacao and aruba along the coast of spanish south america even worse in mr peels estimation proteus would cruise along with sumter not as an official squadron but two independent warships which just happened to be in the same waters at the same time and did they sometimes pass within signalling distance in their rovings well who could fault that despite mr pelhams strictures that the united states were rivals not to be trusted their merchant ships not to be aided with such diligence as long as choundas still lived as long as saint domingue was not firmly in britains grasp forever after amen but but mr peel had spluttered when lewrie had revealed his and mcgilliverays scheme to him expostulations from both sides had taken up most of an evening and only the downing of a considerable amount of sweet aged cornwhisky had brought him somewhat round to lewries point of view they wouldnt be down south long since trading season was ending and all those yankee doodle merchantmen would be eager to scuttle off homeward with their treasures before hurricane season quartering and zigzagging the sea in wide sweeps always trending back northrd both proteus and sumter would stand a much better chance of meeting up with the hosts of french privateers bent on taking those treasures lewrie had had to point out that choundas hugues and their seacaptains werent out here for true patriotic reasons after all prize courts were just as respected by republican frogs as they had been by the royal frogs and french officials on guadeloupe were just as avid as admiral sir hyde parker back in kingston for their lucrative share their admirals eighth starve the prize courts of business starve the privateer officers and crews of profit and thered be less of it in future take sink or burn a few of them and put the fear of god into the rest and thatd force them to stay home lay up their ships and boast over their wine in waterfront taverns of what theyd do if only they could break even at it if only they could find enough hands to man their ships these days the poltroons peel could see the sense of it at last though hed had to get pieeyed to do so that choundas would once stung enough come out personally to restore the morale of his piratical lackeys to even the score protect his own profits too and salvage his career peel had kept pointing out that louverture the possible ally general rigaud and the conflict between them was the more important matter that estopping martial aid to eitherfrom the french not their own side should rigaud sign on the right linewas what mr pelham had intended when he despatched them eastward to antigua but lewrie had assured him that they could accomplish that task too indirectly by making the short voyage seem too dangerous by forcing choundas to use his men o war in search of proteus and sumter not in convoying vulnerable merchantmen to jacmel or portauprince and by goading him so sore that he had to find and kill his worst enemy before any convoy could sail uss sumter became a beehive of activity as her crew scrambled aloft and manned her braces to haul her wind and wear about due south and lewrie lost sight of midshipman mcgilliveray who became just one more hand lined up along the yards and footropes of the course sail on her mainmast to shake out reefs like a flock of wrens perched on a barn roof lewrie finally collapsed the tubes of his telescope and tucked it under his left arm abandoning the lee quarterdeck bulwarks to pace uphill to the windward stations to wear mister langlie lewrie told his first lieutenant well come about to souwestbywest and take the trades on the starboard quarter all plain sail after that just fore sunset well shorten sail for a predawn arrival off guadeloupes north coast to see what theyre serving us for breakfast very good sir langlie replied all dutiful and efficient a watchstander but for the faintest hint of a grin at the corner of his lips damn my eyes was that a smirk lewrie fumed to himself and it wasnt the first hed seen in the last day or so either from one and all even from mr peel once hed gotten over his latest hangover it was exasperating but lewrie strongly suspected that his parentage of desmond mcgilliveray was an open secret which was to say it was no secret at all but hed be damned if he didnt rip the buttocks off the next person who found it amusing and how the devil he ever thought to keep their relationship a secret he had no idea after all it wasnt every day that lofty postcaptains in the royal navy befriended lowly gentlemenintraining from anyones navy especially their own unless they were blood kin catercousins or devotees of the windward passage on the prowl for prepubescent victims no one who knew lewrie would ever misconstrue him for a backgammoner or secret molly so that left kinship he had hoped that distant kinship some sixtimesremoved cousin on his wifes side perhaps could explain his sudden attentive doting but that hope had been dashed too many people from focsle to taffrails from the orlop to the mast trucks had cocked their heads aslant and made comparisons of their features their very unthought gestures and had come to the correct conclusion and theyd done it damned fast damn em stood up sidebyside he and desmond mcgilliveray were as alike as two peas in a pod there she goes sir lt langlie pointed out as sumter turned at last falling away suthrd and showing them her stern little goodll come of this lewrie told himself for what felt like the hundredth time he could not imagine how young desmond could improve his situation in life by discovering that he was his bastard not the dead desmonds a bastardly gullion reallythe bastard son of a bastard maybe havin more english blood than indian makes a diffrence he mused like bein a sacatrablack stead of a griffeblack in portauprince help him pass for lilywhite like the sangmeles with one drop o dark blood in an hundred whatll he do take an advertisement in the charleston post and courier and shout it out tone and all brr such thought of adverting his kinship to the world could result in the article being picked up by london papers which caroline would read and devil take the hindmost then why shed sic assassins on him faster than the beaumans could for this final insult hopefully whoever his dreaded anonymous scribbler was who sent those revelatory billets doux to caroline that had ruined his domestic joy would never get wind of desmond safely removed in the relative sense from that nameless scoundrels purview the log of his scandals had dried up so far and pray god the tale stayed as dry as a barbary desert dune lewrie shook himself rocked on the balls of his feet and gave his neck and shoulders an easing roll to loosen the tension of intense observation and worry over young desmonds foolish skylarking with an arch of his back he turned to windward dismissing sumter and with her his secret shame it was actually coolish now that it was getting on for october and the seas were no longer simmered by the tropic sun so soaked up a lot less warmth to be blown along on the trades while not nippy the winds were refreshing and the late afternoon sunshine was milder and balmier not quite so ferocious once the sun was down vanishing in a fingersnap as it did in these climes the wind would be right up the stern flooding through his transom sashwindows cupped by the propped open windows of the coachtop over his cabins despite his qualms he would sleep well tonight he was certain sumter now sat flatter on her bottom rapidly drawing away into the failing twilight with yards angled and sails cupped to sail large upon her occasions though it was too far now to be discerned from her decks or fightingtops lewrie raised a hand and waved her a pleased farewell despite all he was a likely lad chapter nineteen soft rabbit in a fashionable gown and picture hat was laughing with glee as he danced with her at ranelagh gardens under the myriad candles whitesilk heeled shoes and stockinged ankles flirting under the froth of lace at her hems whilst theoni connor stood and fanned herself near the string orchestra in livery and powdered wigs playing inexplicably a lively jig called go to the devil and shake yourself theoni had a mug of ale in her other handand a muskogee papoosa cross her back which bore twin boys peering over one shoulder and beneath an armpit theoni was quite fetching in beaded buckskins but a pair of gnarled tanned and sooty bare feet quite put him off and sir sir midshipman grace said in a harsh whisper near his bedcot mister adairs duty sir and he says to tell you that the enemy is in sight sir woof lewrie grunted pushing himself up from his facedown frog sprawl to an elbow umm where away two points off the starboard bows sir and almost hullup to us sailing about norwestbynorth reefed down for the night he said to tell you sir grace tumbled out with eagerness it is now a quarterglass shy of four bells and mister adair has doused all of our lights soon as the starboard bow lookout sang out and very well mister grace lewrie replied shaking his head to clear the cobwebs the cool air streaming into his cabins had put him into a deep muzzy and dizzying sleep as he had expected the afternoon before move toulon theres a good cat he hissed as he flung off the sheet and quilt hed drawn up sometime after hed caulked out cold toulon was curled up atop the quilt between his spread thighs taking his sweet time to stretch at being wakened at such an ungodly hour aspinall had been summoned from his hammock a deck below in the after stores room but was taking his sweet time arriving too lewrie grabbed the first clothes his hands encountered off the back of a chair near his bedcot and hurriedly dressed mister adair is to call all hands to quarters mister grace he snapped as he drew a shirt over his head no pipes no fifes and drums and tell him ill be on deck directly go scamper lad shirt and breeches shoes and coat and no time to fool with a pair of stockings a trundle cross the cabins to his arms rack for his hanger and to hell with his hat within a frantic two minutes in the dark he was out past the marine sentry on the gundeck and scampering up the starboard ladder to the quarterdeck scant moments ahead of the hands whod come to strip his greatcabins of partitions furniture and fittings to man the pounders mounted rightaft captain sir lt adair reported knuckling his forehead for a salute instead of doffing his hat you can see her in the nightglass sir two points off the starboard bows threemasted fullrigged but reefed down to topsls jibs and spanker for the night lewrie accepted the heavy nightglass and lifted it to his eye espying the strange ship upsidedown and backwards as if sailing on a reciprocal course to her real one due to requirements of the optics in the tube as lt adair prosed on to finish his report about a halfhour before sir just looming behind pointe allegre her going northerly us fetching the point saw her lights but we thought she was just a fishing smack out nighttrawling til we got close enough for her sails to catch some moonlight sir and we divined how big she was very well mister adair my compliments to the lookouts and to your quick judgement regarding our taffrail and binnacle lights i will ah mister langlie that you in the nightshirt is it aye sir his first lieutenant said sounding sheepish about his catchascatchcan state of dress hands aloft and shake out the night reefs in the main and the mizen topsls let fall one reef in the main course lewrie directed waisters to the braces and steer for a point ahead of her bows she shows no sign of spotting us yet and bowson to her she might not til were closeaboard expect to engage with the larboard battery and wheres mister devereux here sir the marine officer replied from near the larboard quarterdeck ladder lewrie could barely make him out by the sheen of his white silk shirt and white cotton breeches quickly masked back to darkness by his batsman who was pushing him into his red tunic black in the faint moonlight of predawn will you be requiring a boardingparty pray god sir lt devereux enquired carefully making his way over tackle ringbolts and the neatly coiled jear and halliard lines by a series of shuffling probing scuffles sorry weve proved boresome of late mister devereux lewrie said chuckling aye man the larboard gangway and be ready to go over to her should she prove to be hostile there were many more comings and goings with a deal of grunts curses and muffled yelps as lesscareful or lessfortunate crewmen or officers stubbed their shoes or bare toes on deck obstructions in the darkness proteus thudded and slammed with the sounds of preparation for battle as seachests furnishings and partitions were slung below or out of the way as guntools were fetched from the racks overhead of the raised mess tables one deck below as shot wadding and powder cartridges began to come up from the ropegarlands or the magazine a deaf man lewrie imagined could have heard the ruckus aboard the ship off their bows what with all the creaking and skreaking of the parrel balls binding the yards to the masts as they changed angles the cries from the hoisting blocks and the loud rustles of freed canvas as the nightreefs were unbound and the yards hoisted higher the clewlines drawing tauter the halliards and even the braces sawing cross wood belaying pins and the tops of the pinrails could be a neutral i spose sir mr winwood cautioned from near the darkened binnacle cabinet then were about to scare some poor yankee or dane out of his shoes and a years growth lewrie japed but i doubt that mister adair said she was ghosting along behind pointe allegre well within sight of guadeloupe from her own decks and what neutrald risk that mmm winwood pondered lewrie could hear his new footwear a handsome pair of hessian boots hed bought at english harbour creak as he rocked on the balls of his feet then perhaps our last raid makes them sail after sunset hoping to be a good halfdays sail out to sea before false dawn captain beyond the ken of any blockaders id be gratified to hear that our last visit resulted in such a panic aye mister winwood lewrie snickered good god whos that he asked as a meaty thud two grunts and a faint dammit arose from the larboard ladder bosun sir mr pendarves reported in a harsh gravelly voice ships at quarters mister catterall begs me treport very good mister pendarves and whos that with you me sir mr peel told him in a loud theatrical whisper i beg your pardon mister pendarves for colliding with you seems this set of stairs isnt wide enough for two at the same time what ladder sir ladder pendarves snarled as he made his way forward bloody damned civilian lubbers by they could all hear him seethe under his breath clumsy cackhanded cunny midshipman of the watch lewrie softly asked hugely amused but holding in his guffaws do you take my keys to the arms lockers forrud to the bosun will you he is to arm waisters bracetenders and landsmen and be ready for a boarding action to larboard oi sor mr larkin said stumbling forward to take the keys and not even bothering to disguise his sniggers as he deftly sprang to a ladder and sprinted forward now wheres our spook goin bump in the night lewrie asked lifting the heavy nightglass again she was right ahead smothered by proteuss jibs quartermaster austen and quartermasters mate toby jugg were on the large helm and steering as if to ram her just abaft of her starboard anchor cathead they could all see her without the use of telescopes now not two cables distant and still as blind as a bat it seemed lewrie could see people round her helm and compass binnacle ghostily underlit by the binnacle lamps see the amber glow of a pipe bowl as a watchstander took a deep draw on it her taffrail lanthorns were merrily agleam and another glow of light loomed below her rails and bulwarks up near her forecastle belfry like the lamps of a lighthouse just under the horizon dear god but theyre clueless lt langlie chortled softly quartermasters lewrie bade well round up alongside her at about a third of a cable thankee our mizen even with their mizen then let wind and sea push us down hulltohull gently and i leave that to your best judgement tjust kiss her aye sir austen and jugg both chorused in tense whispers at a cable mister langlie let fly all to get our way off so we dont scud right past her lewrie continued grappling hooks and boarding parties to be ready the larboard bowchaser to fire when i call for it aye aye sir lt langlie replied leaning over the rail and nettings to pass the word forward and below to the crew barely had he done so when the unidentified ships watchstanders stiffened and froze in surprise having spotted proteus bearing down on them at last and began to fling their arms about and tumble out a string of orders mon dieu questce que tues fous ca va pas non the senior watchkeeping mate howled with the aid of a brass speakingtrumpet his voice a horrified screech detourner detourner maintenant what the hell are you doing are you crazy turn now mr peel was translating quite enjoying the frenchmans discomforture bowchaser mister langlie lewrie drawled larboard chasegun fire followed by a loud bang open the larboard gunports lewrie instructed and begin to round up on her if you please mister peel you speak good frog do you inform her that were british and ill blow her to kindling if she doesnt surrender this instant ici la fregate anglaise proteus and all that and well see which gives em the collywobbles our artillery or dare i hope our fearsome name peel took lt langlies speakingtrumpet and went over to larboardnot without a new tangle with a ringbolt and a curse or twoand shouted their identity and demands at the same time proteus seemed to roar and snarl as the heavy guncarriages trucks thundered forward as the gunports swung upward to bare bloodred squares above and the sight of glossyblack muzzles below them run out in battery putain mon dieu merde alors mort de ma vie aack could be made out among screeches shrill screams and distressed howls of sudden terror as the offduty watch came boiling up from below to gape at the slaughter which lay not a shiplength from them oui not to fire we are the surrender reddition please ease us alongside quartermasters mister devereux ready to board her and round her rabble up lewrie chortled ready boarders order was being sorted out of the french crews panicky chaos braces and sheets were being released from the pinrails to allow her sails to flag and luff powerless as proteus thundered again with the roar and snarl of defiance from every hands throat this time with throattearing savage yells of triumph chapter twenty why the devil are they lookin at me that way lewrie groused as the french captain of their latest prize and a seedylooking dutch trullibubs continued to goggle at him and shrink into themselves whenever he paced near them on the quarterdeck frankly sir you scare the piss out of them mr peel replied well hmm lewrie mused shooting his cuffs and resetting the line of his coat good and who wouldnt be i ask you captain lewrie peel smirked considering hmm lewrie had grabbed one of his bledout skyblue coats had slung his hangers waistbelt over his chest like a cutlasss baldric and had a pair of his doublebarreled pistols shoved into his waistband still without stockings or neckstock and still bareheaded he had to admit that he just might present the slightest image of an unshaven tousled buccaneer of the last century of the bloodthirstiest piratical bent for a fillip lewrie screwed his face into a murderous grimace glared at the pair of them and uttered his best theatrical arrr peel had to turn his back before he laughed out loud after he had mastered himself once more he crossed the quarterdeck to lewries side up to windward as proteus and her prize trailed their colours down basseterres leeward coast just a cable or two outside the range of the french forts but well within plain view and with their union flags flying atop every mast as well as over the biggest french tricolour they could find aboard the merchant ship captain fleury i strongly suspect did piss himself after he got to his quarterdeck sir peel said in a confidential murmur he had heard the rumours about our last raid and taken the dutch captain of that ship we sank aboard as a passenger whod told him all about how brutal we and you were haljewin is his name and a fount of information he is though he did manage to contain his bladder actually pissed himself lewrie snickered my word lets just say that his stockings are yellow and his breeches buttons are rusting sir peel said with a chuckle this haljewin though choundas and hugues had chartered his ship to bear munitions to rigaud at jacmel or jeremie and we cost them sore when it went up in flames haljewin had a rather unpleasant teteatete with choundas afterward and fled aboard captain fleurys ship for safety and a way off the island soonest before choundas murdered him for letting him down dye see and before fleury set sail they had a week or two to hear other interesting bits come down to the waterfront dammit but peel was beginning to play his superiors game that pregnant pause and browarched leer that would force the other person to ask him to continue that would allow peel or pelham to make the uninformed party twist slowly in the wind give them their moments of smug superiority that or slap em silly for holding out arrr lewrie growled with a blackvisaged grimace at peel wont work on me sir peel assured him but peel did relent and inform him of how they had removed choundass frigate from the equation that choundas and hugues were at deadly loggerheads that there were now two corvettes and two additional vessels converted to privateers in choundass little squadron and that the lack of powder and shot of boots tents blankets muskets and such with which to bribe or bedazzle the lighterskinned frencheducated gen rigaud on st domingue to be gen hedouvilles instrument was most effectively ruining french hopes to reclaim the island colony outright captain fleurys ship though sir peel continued just a general cargo hed gotten into jacmel and back out with sugar and coffee cocoa molasses and rum and had come back to basseterre in hopes of selling some of it to local merchants getting an escort from hugues out to the open seas past our patrols round hispaniola and getting his goods back to france aye tight as the french are blockaded here and there lewrie surmised that sort of cargo would be worth its weight in gold even more relishing sir fleury was chartered by hugues peel added beaming with pleasure he and this captain fleury were to split the profits dare i say this loss will anger hugues no end and drive another wedge twixt hugues and choundas where was their escort lewrie asked none available since huguess own frigate is off far west on the spanish main searching for american prizes sir peel said and choundas was so stung by huguess criticism that he sent all his ships to sea six of one halfdozen of the other either way choundas is sure to be held responsible no matter what he did or didnt do so does this haljewin fellow or this fleury know where wed find choundass privateers lewrie demanded eager to crack on sail secure his prize with the admiralty court not half a days sail south on dominica and start hunting them down another matter first sir peel insisted a finger raised arrr mister peel lewrie gravelled impressive sir truly peel mocked no from what haljewin says choundas is turning the island insideout seeking a spy twas choundass conviction that you sir are simply too dim to have pulled off our raid with such an exquisite timing as to estop a vital and secret cargo and catch their most powerful frigate at the exact moment she was being moved from the harbour at pointeapitre to basseterre without the aid of a spy in our employ someone close to choundas dye see sir no mister peel i dont lewrie peevishly groused im just too dim dye see lucky tknow how tpee without foreign office assistance damme my pardons sir peel replied perhaps that could have been better phrased firstly that you had uhm directions and intelligence from british agents in contact with a french turncoat on which to base your actions rumours are though sir dear as guillaume choundasd wish to harvest your liver he holds you to be more lucky than brilliant he was heard to speak of mister zachariah twigg rather disparagingly and was rumoured to suspect that his staff had been uhm compromised and that mister twigg or someone in twiggs employ was pursuing him and dogging his every move just as he was dogged and confounded in the far east then the mediterranean oh the poor crippled old bastard lewrie chortled damme is he feelin persecuted and looking over his shoulder now sir peel insisted you shook him by the ears right considerable put him off his paces we have partially succeeded in unnerving him well lewrie queried turning to face inward with his elbows on the caprails and not feeling quite so demeaned any longer does your uhm department bureau or whatever actually have a spy close to him someone in your pay on guadeloupe now sir peel demurred sniffing that would be telling right then be insufferable lewrie snapped and may ye have much joy of it tell me this then now that weve got the evil shit halfconfounded where do i go tfind his ships so i can plague him some more gone south both fleury and haljewin suspected peel told him bags of yankee trade down that way in the spanish south american possessions and the dutch islands theyre halfstarved for lack of any spanish or dutch ships able to put in with goods halfstarved of new trade goods the last three or four years and halfstarved for real by way of foodstuffs on the dutch isles couldnt grow half of what they needed even before the wars began with no takers for their formerly valuable exports tis a buyers market aye trust the skinflint yankees to make a killing off of em lewrie said with a sneer of distaste natural to any true englishman of gentlemanly pretensions money was fine and all but one could not get caught directly engaged in anything so mundane as trade and all the filthy lucre that came with it one hired factors too common to be further sullied one invested at arms reach and the frogs to make their killing off the americans sir peel rejoined not if we can help it lewrie vowed this suspicion of a spy lark mister peel think itd be worthwhile to put a flea in one of our captives ears and land fleury or this haljewin character ashore before we get to dominica spin em a tale of how we knew theyd sail without escort and when and laid in wait for them he waved an idle hand at the shoreline whipping by to windward well i dont quite hmmm peel commented frowning deeply and steepling widespread fingers to his lips as he bowed his head in thought must admit it does entice does it not sir not exactly in my brief though without approval from mister pelham id rather not gild the lily as it were with too much finesse your superior mister grenville pelham sir is a pieeyed idiot lewrie shot back turning so that only one arm rested on the caprails to face him one whos hundreds of miles alee and hasnt any idea of whats transpired since we sailed from kingston just what he wished to happen and that merely in a general way do we sit round twiddlin our thumbs waiting for specific direction from pelham we might just as well sail back to english harbour and swing about our moorings til epiphany you sent him a report by fast packet soon as we entered antigua harbour i take it i did peel agreed and i am mortalcertain that he would approve every step we have taken so far and praise our industry the boy might as well be in london for all the good he is to us mister peel lewrie pressed with three or four months twixt our correspondence now do we let one or both o these fools go ashore to tell choundas how we took em and how twas a traitor offered them up on a plate to us same as his precious frigate and haljewins cargo was itll have him tearing his hair out by the roots you know how brutal choundas is recall what twigg surely told you about him at that long meeting you had before you sailed out here his charming little diversions like child rape child buggery making people suffer as he takes his pleasure worse than that marquis de sade sonofabitch of theirs aye hes mostlike got fucking and torture as equal partners in his head by now mostlike gets a cockstand at the smell of hot irons and melted lead mostlike set himself up a dungeon and a torture chamber soon as he lit out here mightve been his first priority for all we know lewrie argued with impatient haste as the lee port of basseterre loomed up and the tiny islets of the saintes could be made out before the bows time geography and the trade winds were stealing any opportunity to fetchto and send fleury and haljewin ashore before they were too far souwest of guadeloupe and spend hours beating back to drop under the horizon then return to land captives would be too suspicious a move but to drop them off now would appearnatural hes a vicious beast certainly captain lewrie but peel attempted to counter choundas would adore searchin for a spy in his midst mister peel they could tell him we were bound south thunt his privateers too us sir lewrie and proteus out to harm him personally and all he can is stew and fret that well find one or all and eliminate his little squadron and theres no way he can warn them hes lamed but he aint paralysed hes not the sort to sit patient and trust to fate damme sir hell be forced tdo something to keep his hand in to prove to hugues that hes vital capable hes truly convinced theres a spy responsible for his troubles choundas will move heaven and earth tfind him does he produce one hes vindicated dont you see werent my bloody fault twas those damned british and a damn traitor done it hell have weeks and weeks to sit idle fore those ships of his report back and hes not the man to take his ease in an armchair and catch up on his reading hmmm mr peel said maddeningly dithering while gnawing on a ragged thumbnail and all the while time position and advantage were passing by at a rate of knots theres truth in what you say i grant you captain lewrie but but mine arse mister peel lewrie spluttered the chances are passin us by long as you hem and haw we could fetchto right this minute boomboom boboom faintly from windward the western coast of guadeloupe tucked in upon itself a bit as one reached its southernmost extremities proteus standing due south just beyond the heaviest cannons range had extended her distance by another mile or so as the shore trended away even so the vieux fort on the final point below basseterre had attempted to take them under fire and by the basso notes of the bowling roundshot that went up the scale in an eerie minor key as it neared lewrie suspected pounder or even pounder guns with which to enforce the new threemilelimit of territoriality their maximum range sure enough four massive waterspouts leaped for the sky high as their frigates fightingtops fat yet feathery and aroar as tons of seawater were vertically displaced then slowly collapsed upon themselves as torrential as a mountain rivers falls smaller feathers of spray staggered towards proteus as the massive balls caromed off first graze to second graze then third before losing enough forward momentum to gouge little more than leapingdolphin splashes as they finally sank proteuss sailors jeered and catcalled with derision for such a hopeless show of defiance for their first graze had struck the sea one whole mile or near short of her sides with their final weary splashes still half a mile shy better luck next time froggie lewrie heard landsman desmond shrill between tunneled hands yair waste yer powder monsewer his mate furfy howled it would appear that the french are in a bit of a pique at the moment captain lewrie peel snickered and any boats despatched to port would mostlike be shot to atoms long before they could be identified as truce boats have to make a show of usefulness satisfy the honour of their bloody tricolour rag dont ye know theyre simply too angry to listen to reason at the moment so it appears we can not implement your plan for now sir dammit mister peel they couldnt hit the ground with their bloody hats we could lie off safe as houses lewrie countered i do not dismiss your suggestion out of hand sir peel said with a pinched expression looking as if he was wrapping resistance to the idea about himself as he tucked the lapels of his coat together i only say that it is a matter which will require some cogitation on my part before deciding whether it advances our enterprise or proves to be so transparent a ploy to choundas that we end up appearing just too clever thereby uhm shooting ourselves in the foot by forcing him to deem the presence of a british spy in his circle groundless i also note that we are almost past guadeloupe why it might take hours to sail back right into the teeth of those heavy fortress guns again to return so quickly would be even more transparent to him and no ye dont say lewrie drawled as if he just that instant had had a blinding glimpse of the obvious really he sneered there is hardly a call for sharp words captain lewrie the hell there aint our best shot at it is past whilst we stood here yarnin and cogitatin lewrie spat if not now do tell me when sir ye said yourself twas a good idea in the main damme mister peel i dont have em often you keep assuring me of that god knows young pelham aint here thold your hand and impahis wisdom to you damn you sir peel barked himself rowed beyond temperance damn you for that i need no cosseting to do my best for two pence i would demand satisfaction sir lewrie made a show of withdrawing his coinpurse from a breeches pocket undoing the drawstrings and delving inside for coins jovial blue eyes had gone cold steely grey and his face was a killing mask he raised one brow in deadly query two pence did you say sir gentlemen gentlemen lt langlie intruded all but stepping between them in sudden worry mister peel sir captain sir do but draw a deep breath the both of you and consider the consequences to your good names your careers if nothing else i conjure you ill not be insulted so publicly peel snapped eyes boring into lewries rot allowing lt langlie a lone inch of personal space in which to part them ill not be treated like a lackwit too dumb tpee on my own either lewrie rejoined dear god sirs anthony langlie groused at the both of them as softly and confidentially as he dared while still getting his point across is not our kings business and the destruction of this man choundas more important at the moment than either of your senses of honour and hurt feelings mister langlie lewrie growled rounding on him as if to tear a strip off his hide for daring to gainsay a postcaptain placed over him by that selfsame king your pardons sir but i cannot stand by and see you ruined lt langlie pleaded i know not what grievance or difference you gentlemen share but surely it cannot be so dire a matter over which you must come to loggerheads do pray allow me to counsel cooler minds some time to consider your actions before either of you does or says anything else from which you cannot demur later i know it aint my place captain and i could be broken for it but the desperation in langlies voice the worry in his eyes at last got through to lewrie he drew that demanded deep breath then screwed his eyes shut for a long moment with a long exhalation he relented thankee mister langlie he said forcing a bleak grin onto his phyz thankee for your concern for me and you mister peel langlie felt emboldened to enquire from their supercargo can you not give it a good long think before peel grunted as if hed been punched in the stomach but waved off any further assistance from the first officer thankee mister langlie a minor matter as you say but a trifling passing snit of which i shall say no more other than to characterise it as a professional and brief parting of the minds you will excuse me sir peel asked of langlie doffing his hat and essaying a short bow peel gave lewrie a shorter jerk in his direction too before stomping off for the larboard quarterdeck ladder to go below im sorry sir but it looked as if someone had to langlie said with a groan of worry oh be at ease mister langlie lewrie assured him we were in disagreement over a joke i wished to play on the french still may does he see his way round it once he gets down from his highhorse that is tis not a killing matter less he wishes to make it so i expect a decent dinner and a bottle of my claretll bring him back to his senses just may do the same for me you never can tell lewrie concluded with a wry selfdisparaging grin i am at ease sir langlie replied grinning wider himself thank god how could i ever explain your uhm untimely demise to poor sophie or now you are being impertinent mister langlie lewrie chided him putting his stern face back on for an instant carrying on sir instanter langlie quickly said doffing his hat and making a rapid escape back to his proper duties damn you frogs lewrie thought turning back to face the island as proteus ran large off the wind now just a bit below the fort that was still intent on wasting powder and expensive heavy shot on them i almost had him convinced but for you bastards interrupting i still think its a good idea just cause it aint my pigeon not my line o work dont mean its worthless lucky but not brilliant am i just a faithful gundog tpoint run and fetch am i well well see about that he pushed himself erect from the caprails turned and stomped blackvisaged past his captive captains to the binnacle cabinet left hand flexing fretful on the hilt of his hanger he glared at them in passing speculating which of them the frenchman fleury or the dutch master haljewin however the hell one spelled that would be the better tablet on which to carve his misdirecting message over his shoulder he heard expostulations in windmuffled dutch or french an evil snickerfollowed by more unbelieving splutters shoes clomped on the quarterdeck planks coming nearer excuse me again captain lt langlie said tapping fingers to his hat in a casual salute but our prisoners were asking what your argument with mister peel was all about and i could not help having a bit of fun at their expense i told them sir langlie paused a fist to his mouth to stifle a laugh and ruin his jape i told em that you were going to throw them to the sharks but that mister peel thought only one should go over the side and wed give him the other you did did you mister langlie lewrie said gazing on them past langlies shoulder well tell em well decide which later aye aye sir arrr lewrie called out pointing eenymeenymineymoh at them captain fleury fainted dead away and he really did have a very weak bladder chapter twentyone the admiralty prize court on dominica was ten miles or more to the south of prince rupert bay and its tiny settlement of portsmouth at the leeside port town named roseau from the times when the french had owned the island lewrie had been forced to trade his smart gig for a humbler but larger cutter and sail down to confer with them dominica had been one of those isles infested with carib indians so battlemad and deathdefying that every european power that colonised the antilles had sworn off the place in but that hadnt lasted long britain took it in the french got in back in then britain again at the end of the american revolution the steep fernjungle mountains were simply stiff with caribs making it a real kings bad bargain so was the prize court a greater pack of ignorant inksniffs thieves drunkards and paper buccaneers lewrie had never laid eyes on and it was no wonder that theyd greeted his arrival the same way some gang of adolescent london street imps would welcome the sight of a pieman with a tray of fresh goodies halfliterate spouting doglatin legalese their accents an echo of cockey bow bells halfseasover on cheap rum or strong stingo beer and sporting mementos of their last halfdozen dinners on greasy cuffs waistcoats or breeches unshaven and unwashedlewrie suspected their experience of law had come from the wrong side of some magistrates bench hed have rather dealt with mr peel who still sulked over their contretemps it would have been safer and he would not get gravyspotted off the furniture nor would he depart infested with fleas besides this court would refer everything back to antigua and reams of paper gallons of ink and pounds of stamps and paste would be used up before he his officers and warrants or his sailors saw tuppence sometime in he sourly suspected maybe his grandchildren might have joy of his latest captures profit after that experience which had taken up most of the morning and a horrid dinner at a tumbledown dockside tavern lewrie walked out the long single quay that speared at least one hundred yards out from the beach before the waters at low tide would allow a ships boat to come alongside then rambled on all ramshackley for a good fifty yards more his cutter with its single lugsail furled was the only one in sight at present positively handsome compared to the few scabrous and halfabandoned fishing boats drawn up on the sands he paused to fan himself with his hat and belch biliously from his repast the purported squab had mostlike been seagull and the roast beef of olde england had mostlike barked at the moon and run after cats before its luck had run out the infamous twopenny ordinarys of his native london had nothing to fear for their reputations by comparison and they had mostlike not poisoned half as many patrons he might have tried the pork roast but the natives on the island were reputed to be cannibals and hed not put it past the publican to buy a side of long pig as they said in the great south seas and serve up the loser of some carib feud you men have eat lewrie enquired of his boat crew after he finally reached them he had let them step ashore for a meal and the usual wet with instructions for everyone to be back in two hours and sober mind a quick nosecount assured him that no one had been daft enough to take leg bail in such a nohope port no one appeared groggy eitherwell no more so than usual think it was food sah his coxswain matthew andrews dared to josh with him from his privileged position and long association as his sometime confidant it was burnt and it come on plates law missah gideon he bile wood chips in slush it would o eat bettah capm sah little nelson one of his recent black jamaican volunteers further ventured to say sorry bout that lads lewrie commiserated but i do think my own dinner was potscrapings worse than yours lets shove off back to de ship sah aye andrews said shipping the tillerbar atop the rudder post while lewrie was offered a hand or two on his way aboard the cutter and aft to a seat in the sternsheets two hours later though as the cutter bounded closehauled into prince rupert bay lewrie shaded his eyes for a look round there was hms proteus as pretty as a painting with her prize moored close by there was the yankee stores ship attended by boats come to fetch out supplies there was uss sumter but there were some new arrivals too including a jackass or hermaphrodite brig that flew a small blue harbour jack rightforward sprinkled with thirteen white stars to show that she was an american man o war another of their boughtin and converted armed ships not a vessel built as a warship there were three merchant vessels flying the stars and stripes anchored in the bay as well two were very large threemasted topsl schooners with their tall masts raked much farther aft than lewrie had ever seen before lying near the newcome armed brig farther out in deeper water and unable to anchor closer to shore for being deepladen was a proper threemasted fullrigged ship equally as impressive a specimen of the shipbuilders art and bristol fashion smart damme but those schooners look like theyd be fast as witches even to windward lewrie commented even with the full cargoes they seem to bear ever seen the like andrews masts raked so sharp dough sah dem yankees mebbe crazy was andrewss assessment how dey foot em to de keelsteps an not rip right out id wondah wadnt here dis mornin tink dem mericans be makin up a nothbound trade at las capm it very well could be lewrie agreed i think well satisfy my curiosity before we go back aboard our ship steer for sumter if you will andrews it appears theres a gaggle o boats alongside of her already aye aye sah besides captain mcgilliveray might have something with which to settle our misrable dinners lewrie added with a chuckle captain lewrie sir midshipman desmond mcgilliveray said at the top of the starboard entryport stepping forward past the marine lieutenant in charge of the sideparty that had rendered him honours the lad was almost tailwagging eager to greet him though constricted by the usages and customs of his navy to the doffing of his hat and a bow from the waist mister mcgilliveray lewrie cried with too much heartiness of his own his eyes equally agleam and his carefully stern expression creased by an involuntary smile well met young sir we saw you come in with your prize sir the lad exclaimed in joy plopping his tricorne back on his head anyoldhow did she put up much of a fight sir did she resist very long or once his own giltlaced cocked hat was back on his own head he astounded the boy by extending his right hand for a warmer greeting a hand that young mcgilliveray took with a puppyish delight and shook in return right heartily steered right up to her yardarm to yardarm in the dark and only fired one bowchaser just twake em long enough to surrender lewrie replied proud for a chance to boast and preen ill tell it all to you later should we have the chance but i have come to see your captain first he is aboard sir and aft midshipman mcgilliveray informed him only slightly crestfallen i shall tell him that you have come aboard captain lewrie this way please lewries arrival alongside though had created enough stir to draw sumter first officer lt claiborne from the greatcabins aft to the gangway minus sword and hat ah captain lewrie good lt claiborne said coming over to greet him as well you got our captains note i see uhm no mister claiborne i came direct from roseau and the prize court offices lewrie told him and you escaped with your purse captain lewrie congratulations claiborne replied frowning for a second my captain is now in conversation with several of our merchant masters and wished to speak with you regarding their informations a glad happenstance you came to call on us if you will follow me captain lewrie lead on sir talk to you later lad lewrie promised to his newly acquired offspring he was led down a ladder to the gundeck then aft into the cabins under the quarterdeck clutching the hilt of his hanger in one hand and his hat in the other suddenly selfconscious to be ogled like some raree show with many faint fond almost doting smiles to every hand lewrie could only conclude that sumters people had gotten a whiff of rumour concerning his relationship to midshipman mcgilliveray who was obviously a younker well thought of aboard that ship to begin with damme even that hawkfaced marine lieutenant goggled me like a newborn swaddlin babe lewrie groused to himself as he was admitted to the daycabin where the air was close hot and still despite the opened windows coachtop and windscoops where several men ceased their conversation and rose to greet him lewrie blinked to adapt to the dimness of the cabins after the harsh brightness of the deck captain lewrie thank you for responding to my request for a conference so quickly capt mcgilliveray said coming forward to take hands with him he gave lewrie no time to explain that he had not gotten mcgilliverays note but began to introduce the others present there was another us navy officer off the hermaphrodite brig an almost painfully tall and gaunt darkvisaged fellow in his middle thirties named to him as one captain randolph of the armed brig uss oglethorpe proudly commissioned in savannah captain lewrie suh capt randolph told him with a warm smile an named f r one of your english lords james oglethorpe who founded th georgia colony he said in addition and in a liquid drawl even rounder and deeper than south carolinian mcgilliverays were such a thing possible and ya know what they say randolph mcgilliveray japed him that all the rogues went tgeorgia ha ha proud of it suh proud of it randolph happily rejoined and captains ezekiel crowninshield and gabriel crowninshield mcgilliveray continued indicating a pair of stouter and younger men who were at first glance as alike as a pair of bookends gingery haired and florid their schooners are outta mystic connecticut magnificent and fast sailers the iroquois and the algonquin twins as well sirs lewrie asked of them after a greeting built sidebyside in the same yard captain lewrie he was gladly told in a much harsher downeast yankee nasal twang first swam within a week of each other too one brother said raced him hyuh the other boasted beat him all hollow and last but not least mcgilliveray said further captain grant off the sarah and jane captain grant captain lewrie of the proteus frigate your servant sir lewrie politely said though the name was nagging at him the ship and her captain both as he stepped closer to take grants hand oh tis you sir well met again why bless my soul if it aint that little popinjay laddy who gave me so much grief in the bahamas grant exclaimed ruint a whole cargo o caicos salt on me too eightysix was it just a lieutenant then ye were in yer little converted bombketch alacrity captain grant lewrie supplied him but then youd not have lost so dearly had you obeyed the navigation acts and steered wide o me and the salt wouldnt have been used for bulwarks and your ship not commandeered as bait if youd stayed in the turks islands and testified gainst calico jack finneys pirates as i asked you to lewrie still held grants hand though they were done shaking his smile could have been mistaken for courteous but there was a definite frost to his voice well we live an learn do we not captain lewrie grant at last said with a wintry smile of his own almost pulling himself free we do indeed sir lewrie replied whatever happened tcalico jack finney grant had to enquire i chased him into charleston harbour and killed the bastard lewrie told him in a casual offhand way still grinning dear lord that was you captain lewrie capt mcgilliveray said with a gasp of wonder why i watched the whole thing from the battery my my my will wonders never cease that weve crossed each others hawses if ya will more than once in so many things well life is funny that way aye captain mcgilliveray i grant ye lewrie answered glad to turn his direction and dismiss grant everbody says that capt randolph of the oglethorpe mused but usually with long faces when they do he japed solemnfaced if youll have a seat and join us captain lewrie a glass of something cool weve cold tea or mcgilliveray offered cold tead be capital thankee sir lewrie said as he seated himself i take it that you were discussing some matter concerning a mercantile nature sirs missing ships sir mcgilliveray intoned as his cabin servant fetched lewrie a tall tumbler of tea with the unheardof luxury of a chunk of ice in it walsham massachusetts one of the crowninshields boasted to him the dons an the dutchiesre mad for th stuff our new england ice cant pack it outta the andes mountains fore it melts i guess mule trains too slow toosmall packets zekiel the other crowninshield quibbled has tbe stowed in bulk in chaff an sawdust outta sunlight keeps itself frozen ya see weve lost a ship mebbe two the brother lewrie now knew to name ezekiel baldly announced stealing mcgilliverays thunder as the yankee doodles would say in their colourfully colloquial way down south the one dubbed gabriel stuck in sailed behind us had em in sight for a piece older schooners slowern ours ezekiel chimed in and we were racin each other like i said so we sailed em under mohican was tput in at saint lucia but thatd only delay her two days or so no more and and chippewa was tcome inta roseau tmeet us gabriel grumbled but weve laid over almost a week now and theres neither hide nor hair o either one of em capm lewrie and were getting worried ill lay ya coasted up hyuh task of em but powerful worried ezekiel crowninshield butted in wasnt a speck o foul weather on our passage and nary even a squall astern of us did we see tupset em trusted salty masters and mates good an true mystic lads in the crews too so gabriel crowninshield interrupted shrugging in mystification so no mutiny or buccaneering lewrie surmised sipping at his tea already suspecting the worst gentlemen i fear that those ships have been taken by french cruisers lewrie was forced to tell them when i took my prize last night we learned some things from our prisoners that captain of whom i spoke captain mcgilliveray that guillaume choundas we took away his best frigate a few weeks ago but he still commands two corvettes and now has converted a schooner and a brig as privateers and our captives told us hed sent em south to prey on american ships in particular to hurt your commerce as sorely as youve hurt theirs and make himself and their governorgeneral victor hugues a pile of tin if he cant challenge american warships round hispaniola and further up north he intended to put all four vessels to sea beyond your immediate reach and purge you from the oceans as you made passage home with all those rich cargoes of yours sorry and who d prefer lumber ice and barrel staves to sugar coffee and cocoa lewrie thought scorning american exports and the products of their limited industries well they do ship rum and decent beer onliest place they can take em is guadeloupe captain grant spluttered breaking the stunned sad silence following lewries revelation bless my soul cant ya blockade em can ya not dash back an try to intercept em ayup one of the crowninshields supplied aye intercept em grant gravelled catch em before they fetch em into basseterre or pointeapitre get word tyour other warships capm lewrie ya cant be th only frigate in these parts three days into the teeth of the trades to antigua and then what sirs lewrie demanded spreading his hands at the futility i am heartily sorry for your losses gentlemen but do i haunt either or both harbours in hopes of recapturing your ships any americans taken as prizes im not fulfilling my proper duty better i damn my eyes lewrie grant exploded and here i thought ya were a fireeatin scrapper better i take proteus south sir lewrie reiterated with his teeth on edge for do i lurk close inshore of guadeloupe for weeks whats happening to a dozen two dozen other american merchantmen down south how many ships will make it here to form a convoy if the damn french are free to run riot nossirs im away down the windwards this very evening as far as caracas if i must sumterll clear port as well sir capt mcgilliveray vowed randolph you want to take charge here and wait for the promised frigate tcome in or would ya prefer tsail in company with me and find a proper fight for a change let our consul keep an eye on things here capm mcgilliveray capt randolph cried leaping to his feet though careful not to knock his head on the overhead beams or planking for sure as theres god in his heaven my sword my right arm and my ship are yours id be that eager tshow those swaggerin monsoors what its like to tangle with a pack o georgia wildcats bring em on yeehah he ended with a shout a red indian warriors feral battlescream that made lewries hackles and nape hairs stand on end aboard sumter that howl caused her crew and capt randolphs boatcrew laying alongside to raise a screeching wolfs chorus of their own as they suspected that they would no longer swing idle round the moorings to await the plodding drudgery of convoying but would be going out to look for a proper standup fight at long last uhm given this sudden and unlookedfor turn of events lewrie carefully began to say once he had recovered his aplomb using caution before the unwitting civilians not privy to their governments or his and mcgilliverays covert arrangement and since it is british as well as american merchantmen at peril and notwithstanding the lack of a formal pact twixt your president and the crown perhaps we could ah aid each other in our respective searches for the french privateers captain mcgilliveray an excellent suggestion captain lewrie mcgilliveray replied shamming the utmost surprise at such a generous offer then amid the enthusiastic huzzahs from randolph and the merchant masters he gave lewrie an enigmatic smile and the tiniest incline of his head as a reward i and my government stand forever in your debt for your openhanded and cooperative spirit lost in the cheering and toasting however was the fact that no british ships or very few at most were in danger they didnt trade on the spanish main or with the dutch isles with both nations allies to france a toast was raised to lewries alacrity and support and while it was being drunk and he posed all disparagingly aw pshaw modest his mind was mildly ascheme no matter what pelham wanted what his london masters wanted it made eminent sense and to the devil with saint domingue and who owned it america and great britain he marvelled sworn enemies not fifteen years past despite the lingering grievances and distrust created during their revolution their burgeoning commercial competition and rivalry they were going to war as temporary allies on the same side for a blessed once could this lead to better things he speculated and what allies theyd make too even if they were so ruled by their enthusiasms so unenglish in revealing their feelings such as their screams howls and cheers at present well so was he when you came right down to it wearing a public mask of blase boredom definitely did not become him in fact he rather liked the freedom to howl and wished he possessed it oh lord he thought peels sure tgo off like a bomb chapter twentytwo ah captain lewrie peel said after he had gotten back aboard proteus and had made it below to his greatcabins peel was sitting in the diningcoach in the middle of writing a letter to his master mr pelham lewrie supposed as he tore open his neckstock unbuckled his sword belt and removed his coat youre back at last i have been meaning to discuss your idea with you thatun you proposed on deck yesterday concerning the uhm peel enigmatically said with a vague wave of his hand in aspinalls direction oh yes lewrie responded feigning idle interest and making his face a placid englishmans mask again id relish a ginger beer aspinall theres a good fellow the americans served cold tea when i was aboard sumter just now the decoction in which i indulge sir mr peel told him all chirpy and pleasant as if yesterdays bitter argument hadnt happened lewrie answered with ice sir the yankees still had a small supply of their massachusetts ice aboard worth its weight in gold with the dons one of their merchant masters informed me he took a seat at the table across from peel i am suddenly jealous sir peel said with a groan of envy at the prospect and made a moue of faint distaste at his mug of tea i suppose we shall not see the like til the first american traders call at kingston next spring alas yer beer sir aspinall said fetching lewrie a foaming mug thankee aspinall thatll be all for a bit lewrie said with a brief smile do you take a turn on deck and get some air cabins are stuffy god knows even with the canvas chutes rigged aye sir and i will his manservant replied departing with a long hank of spunyarn he quickly fetched from what was left of his tiny daypantry so he could continue his sennetwork so youve considered the idea have you mister peel lewrie said once they were alone he could not show as much keen interest in what peel decided for frankly the developments aboard sumter had made the quickly spun scheme quite fly his head he could sham renewed interest though and trust that fear of rejection would explain a lack of greater enthusiasm in his demeanour i have sir peel stated once i had uhm cooled off a bit dye see he made another moue tossed off a shrug and chuckled softly and ive come to the conclusion that encouraging choundas in imagining that hes a traitor in his vicinity is actually a rather neat piece of misdirection one which i am sure that mister pelham would approve were he here one frankly which he might have dreamt up himself was he privy to the intelligence we just discovered excellent lewrie crowed slapping the dining table with his open palm capital and i am certain that youve concocted a scheme for getting our prisoners back to guadeloupe and blabbing what you wish to choundas itll be a clever bit knowing you mister peel more subtle than any could have come up with on short notice mean tsay lewrie gushed then paused thinking that he was laying on the praise a bit too thick for peel to credit so soon after their howling snit he had a very large and heavy shoe which he was about to drop on the longsuffering bastards head after all and it would be nice to agree on something anything before dropping it well sir peel continued though he did pause a bit himself to give lewrie the tiniest chary look captain haljewin was the one sprung the idea of a spy on choundas from what i gathered whilst interrogating the man haljewin had bags of unguarded time since his capture to converse with the french captain and his mates as separate interrogations with them revealed they are all now convinced that someone on guadeloupe betrayed them to us last night and i was careful to leave them with the impression that they werent far wrong without actually confirming the existence of a spy or spies but neither did i go out of my way to deny it dye see captain lewrie let him have joy of it lewrie thought preen gladsome for now during my interrogations i also discovered that choundas has a rather small but trusted staff peel went on almost happily in his element privy to things lewrie didnt know and glad to impart them theres a captain griot commanding a corvette name of le gascon a breton and you know what stock choundas puts in his ancient celts and veneti warriors men of the ancient blood and all god yes lewrie agreed mad for em his other corvette is commanded by a captain macpherson one of those emigre scots who fled after the battle of culloden he was born in france but his parents were minor scots aristocracy mostlike landed gentry in the squirearchy with but dim and distant relation to a proper laird in france though til the revolution they were awarded the title of chevalier or bought it king louiss court at versailles was as corrupt as the ottoman turks but captain macpherson is catholic a breastbeater of the staunchest sort hmm a fallen aristo and a papist to boot lewrie said with a chuckle thatd make him doubly suspect to the directory in paris all the antireligion cant they spout theres bishops back home now calling france the antichrist already he your choice then in a pinch hed serve mainwell i do confess peel laughed though hes reckoned a superb officer and shiphandler rather popular with his officers and men well thought of in general oh well then lewrie said with a shrug and a sip of beer should a wellliked and trusted man be labeled a spy and traitor sir and were enough proofs manufactured to convince choundas and hugues of his guilt peel merrily plotted the implications of that strike much wider and deeper than guadeloupe firstly if a man like macpherson cant be trusted then who can and secondly would it not set off a frenzy of jacobin revulsion gainst catholics in france or create a catholic resistance to the directory and the revolution do you see the possibilities sir theyre breathtaking peel exulted oh lewrie gasped itd set off another terror worse than the one of ninetythree half their peopled be witchfindin among the other half and everyoned be suspect theyd keep their guillotines workin round the clock decimating their officer corps purging it all over again of capable people and promoting the rabid fools most loyal to the republic from the rear ranks to the officers mess peel chortled in glee as he contemplated the reach of his scheme turning ordinary seamen into postcaptains lewrie added with an evil snicker aye hed do rightwondrous this macpherson fellow but he may be a bit too straight for our purposes peel went on choundas maintains a very small staff as i said there is his aidedecamp his flaglieutenant i suppose youd say in naval parlance jules hainaut a lieutenant de vaisseau now just a midshipman an aspirant the last time we dealt with choundas in the mediterranean recall him do you peel asked tongueincheek sly no not really lewrie replied frowning you should you captured him peel informed him enjoying a look of surprise on lewries phyz thatchhaired lout looked like a swineherd tattered uniform all out at elbows and knees perhaps lewrie had to confess his ignorance cant really say hmmm wasnt dutch or something was he my old clerk mister mountjoy had to interview him hmmm itll come to me the very fellow peel insisted the sort whod sell his own mother did she fetch a good knockdown price mister twigg determined parrots the right slogans toadies with the best of em and fawns on choundas so he can trade on his fearsome repute so the frog prisoners say a right bastard in their opinion one of the charming rogues for some reason though choundas has sent him away from him after neardoting on the young sprog all these years appointed him aboard that new auxiliary man o war schooner and hes mostlike at sea now think choundas has tumbled to him at last lewrie enquired or gotten fed up with his ways it happened after captain haljewin first brought up the topic of a spy whod betrayed his ship and that frigate we smashed peel hinted tapping the side of his nose if this hainaut would sell up his mother for pocketmoney perhaps choundas suspects hed be open to a shower o british guineas hmm but hes at sea now like you said lewrie pointed out to him how could he have betrayed our prize to us unless hainaut was part of a whole cabal of agents mr peel countered and the very thought of thatd have choundas and hugues puttin half the island through questions worthy of the spanish inquisition torture chambers and all is that what you intend then mister peel lewrie asked in awe of his daring now that peel was hitting his full devious stride dear lord whatve i started lewrie had to ask himself lastly theres choundass longtime clerk peel told him in a less enthusiastic manner after a calming sip of tea hes known as the mouse frightened to death of working for choundas but too scared to leave his employ by now id reckon knows where too many bodies are buried all that meek as a catchfart scorned and abused by one and all theres no love lost twixt him and choundas none lost where hainauts concerned either who better to make a target than choundass sorry little longsuffering clerk who has access to every secret and every move and choundass every idle musing hmm so lewrie posed growing tired of peels machinations there was a surprise to spring a ship to get under way before dark and the precious time in which to do both was quickly wasting i defer to you as to which you intend to give to choundas if you havent done so already let something oh so accidentally slip to our prisoners or will you require them to stay aboard a while longer before clueing them in impatient for them to go lewrie peel asked him the longer theyre aboard the more they might pick up of our doings is all lewrie countered with a minor lie of disinterest in them you cant keep secrets for very long aboard a ship without a hint of it leakin forrud you know that youve seen it better if we foist em off to the prize court ashore on parole or gaoled like we would with your runofthemill enemy civilian prisoners else we make em wonder why we treated em diffrent and start thinkin about the why of it and theres your scheme taken with a grain o salt as soon as choundas grills em mind you mister peel hes a suspicious old shit whats kept him alive and thrivin all this time hey youre absolutely right captain lewrie peel responded perking up with new determination and energy we cant risk them picking up the slightest thing that might blow the gaff as you sailormen are wont to say they must be put ashore at once but with no unseemly haste of course of course lewrie agreed much relieved that peel was amenable to his suggestion with strict instructions that the prize court officials repatriate them soonest peel schemed on rising to his feet to pace a week or so do you think would be the customary usage well good luck with that lewrie said sorry to disabuse him the court officials are the worst pack o drunk slovenly layabouts lever ive encountered might take em weeks to recall they have prisoners might have tbribe em theyre venal enough damn peel spat knocking his fists together in frustration the scheme must be put in play at once well well try bribery and see what haste the court officials can mount then now that he was aboard the scheme indeed its principal author he could brook no delay in its deployment choundas will be sure to believe fleury if not haljewin im certain of it or do their accounts agree with each other thought haljewin fled before choundas had his arse cheeks for breakfast lewrie asked you send him back hes mostlike dead i as mutton no matter does choundas eat his tale up like plum duff blieve theres a french sayin captain lewrie peel said in a cynical drawl bout how one cant make an omelette without breaking an egg or two he dined with the devil with a short spoon ah lewrie commented to that ultimate coldbloodedness oh well then there goes one egg whos the other your target with macpherson and hainaut both at sea were left with just one possibility choundass clerk name of etienne de gougne hell do the covert vengeance of the meekly oppressed the underpaid and unappreciated peel sketched out in a worldweary tone a hint of others already in place who contacted de gougne once he came ashore the ones who run the messages out to sea all that vast conspiracy secret royalists and their lackeys waging their secret war gainst the revolution and the republic revenge for those who already died under huguess guillotine when he retook guadeloupe and lopped off over a thousand heads with the ghost of zachariah twigg and his evil minions the master puppeteers behind it all with gold in plenty oh perfidious albion peel mockingly cried from the french point of view the despicable grasping conniving anglais we rosbifs biftecks we satanic les sanglants you could take that to drury lane mister peel lewrie congratulated even briefly applauding him languidly spiritlessly like the better sort of theatregoer in london he rose to his feet and pulled his watch from his fob pocket opened the face four bells of the day watch chimed from the forecastle belfry two in the afternoon which conformed to what his watch told him he closed the face of his watch and slipped it back into its pocket let me ask you something mister peel lewrie requested i asked you once before but you and mister pelham got access to the french signals books somehow you know rather a lot about whos who on guadeloupe and choundass inner circle is there a spy or a conspiracy of agents on the island do you really own people close to the directory in paris too and what did i say when first you asked sir peel smirked come over all superior and inscrutable again that i could not tell tales out of school was that how i put it what do you think that your department has the place riddled with spies lewrie declared were you afraid my suggestion might expose people you had in place already was that why you rejected it out of hand and so dismissively he wearily accused their spat still rankling my apologies for being brusque sir peel said with a bow in his direction truly aye there is some small shred of truth in your surmise that not all the french on guadeloupe are resigned to the success of the revolution less effective or informative as we wish nor as widespread as we could hope but i am relatively sanguine that whatever false spoor we lay for choundas to follow it will not lead too close to our true operatives do we actually lose one or two minor players well thats the cost of doing such business regrettable but there you are dear lord lewrie gawped hed thought peel coldblooded before but that took the cake well then lewrie declared rising energetically lots to do and the hours too short as usual well upanchor and sail down to roseau deliver our prize to the court now theyve her manifests and such land our prisoners with em then he concluded with an anticipatory wince well get under way bout dusk sorry peel queried in surprise get under way did ye say wherever are we bound this time sir id thought oh didnt i tell you lewrie blurted out in a rush as if to trample peels objections with his news the yankees are missing some merchant vessels and are sailing to go look for them after i told em about choundas and his four raiders bein at sea they swore they would run them down too but think they might need a spot o help he gave peel a rapid thumbnail sketch peels mouth gaped open wider and wider the more lewrie explained to him so were tsail with em lewrie concluded with three ships to make up almost a proper little squadron and sweep the seas as far south as caracas might scoop up the odd don or dutch trader as well ye never can tell peel more prizesd suit dont ye but peel spluttered turning nigh plumcomplexioned both of his hands were squeezed into bonewhite fists as he fought to hold in his sudden rage but like we discussed dont ye know lewrie insisted when you got so both sheets aft on whisky wed go south and mcgilliveray and sumter would scout with us well now weve oglethorpe along as well and you agreed to it do you recall he quickly pointed out lewrie you peel squawked damn my eyes foreign office maitland lord balcarres and pelham all their cautions keep the yankees at arms reach half a foe and and you just up and decide to on your bloat your own whim spur of after gaining your agreement mister peel lewrie pouted damn ydammit lewrie peel retorted raising his fists as if ready to take him on barehanded you just cant our prisonersll see all three men o war two american and one british sail together mister peel and theyll dread the chance theres been an alliance made against em but news of it hasnt got to em yet thatll give hugues and choundas something to bite on drive em bugeatin slung into bedlam mad mad enough to lash out and declare real war on the united states then we get em as allies and whoever managed that wins himself a knighthood and peel lowered his fists exhaled long and hard nigh to a death rattle and dropped his head he jerked out his chair and sagged into it cradling his face in his hands fingers kneading his temples you need tbe leashed i swear you do lewrie he weakly said leashed and muzzled like a oh i thought i was prepared to deal with you thought i had your measure years ago twigg he warned me tkeep you on a taut rein but think of the possibilities lewrie beguiled think of the disaster peel said with a sorrowful groan if it all goes bust now really mister peel lewrie countered what could possibly go much wrong with chasing after french warships the mind boggles peel croaked damn my eyes lewrie but youve done it to me again lord whatll pelham say well i must go on deck and get us ready to sail lewrie told him more than eager to get away back on his quarterdeck where he was completely in charge where peel wasnt in point of fact dont know as i can trust you outta my sight that long peel almost whimpered leashed and muzzled like a dancin bear he sounded almost wistful at that image later mister peel lewrie said scooping up his hat and coat and making his escape once on the quarterdeck he passed the word for lt langlie to apprise him of their sailing as he waited for him to appear there came the sound of a mug clanking off a bulkhead later followed by another and perhaps the sound of flung furniture hes takin that well lewrie could but suppose book four maturate fugam gegique haec dicte vestro non illi imperium pelagi saevumque tridentum sed mihi sorte datum speed your flight and bear this word to your king not to him but to me were given by lot the lordship of the sea and the dread trident aeneid book i publius vergilius maro chapter twentythree lieutenant de vaisseau jules hainaut relished pacing his small quarterdeck as the sun threatened to rise in the east like a proper and salted sea officer his hands were clasped in the small of his back in imitation of the aristo captains and lieutenants hed served when hed been a humble seaman as was the custom in all navies he could pace or strut alone up to windward facing the trades and the soontoberisen sun savouring the shivery damp coolness that was so welcome before the harsh warmth of the usual tropic day he rocked on the balls of his feet enjoying the creak of those brightbuffed boots on his legs and fiddled with the hilt of his precious smallsword the name hainaut was sure that he had made for himself was going to be the talk of the entire colony figuring prominently in the despatches back to paris and the ministry of marine too no matter how derisive his moreexperienced fellow officers aboard la vigilante had been towards him her new capitaine lt pelletier from capitaine macphersons corvette had been highly dubious of his appointment into la vigilante as his second officer almost openly sneering at him for being a dilettante more suited to odious shore duties as well as the catchfart to such a bloodyhanded ogre as choundas even the midshipman now actinglieutenant digne the third officer had seemed to mock and disdain him jealous of not being named secondincommand to his friend pelletier hainaut had thought well he had shown them what he was made of with an unaccustomed show of diligence and nautical skill with saucy courage in the taking of their four prizes and his willingness to come aboard this captured schooner mohican as a prizemaster when they had begun to scrape the bottom of the barrel for enough people to man them all with a sham of energy and even unselfish generosity and he had mostly won them over this schooner mohican and her neartwin that sailed not a mile alongside her the chippewa were fine vesselsfast handy and seakindly for all their outlandish rigging and their steeply raked masts their valuable cargoes notwithstanding hainaut was sure that mohican and her sister would make magnificent commerce raiders if bought in and converted to men o war under choundass control not as privateers under hugues not so large that either demanded a senior officer in command too lt hainaut had as soon as hed moved his seachest and traps aboard mohican determined that he would be her captain he had at last nagged hinted and cajoled himself away from choundas the damned crippled monster and by fetching in such booty this mohican would be his permanent escape his route to the fame glory and profit he wishedhe wouldwin in future a year or two and any odium from having been choundass creature would be forgotten and dawn msieur the older petty officer who now stood watches as a temporary quarterdeck officer announced as the sun finally burst above the eastern horizon lt hainaut crossed to the helm to take a peek at the marvellous book hed found in mohicans greatcabins that tabulated true sunrise and sunset to longitude he juggled the book and the seachart grunting in satisfaction as he noted that theyd made a decent distance to weather during the night just that tiny bit farther east and a safe haven in basseterre or pointeapitre the casts of the knot log added up to an impressive sum of northing too hainaut set the book and the slate aside and stepped off their probable course with a pivoting brass divider and a ruler unless they ran into foul weather or roaming enemy warships their entire convoy of prizes and raiders would make a triumphant landfall at guadeloupe in three more days the two corvettes le gascon and la resolue with their much greater hold capacities and the stores with which to keep the seas for months still prowled down south nearer the spanish main trinidad and tobago to show the flag to their dubious allies the spanish and dutch and put iron back into their sagging spines as well as to take prizes they would not return for weeks more perhaps for now it would be this prize these ships and their successful captors that would arrive first to win the cheers from guadeloupe and earn the most in the prize court with all the valuable and tasty goods they bore very well hainaut said at last time to send the lookouts aloft timmonier and tell the cook he may start breakfast oui msieur lieutenant the temporary secondincommand said in reply hainaut was irked that he had yet to address him the way he wished as capitaine some it seemed needed more convincing than others hainaut turned away and strode aft to the taffrails to stand atop the transom lockers and grip the starboard lanthorn for a better view astern taking a moment to enjoy how straight and true was mohicans wake and how narrow the creamywhite road she cut over the sea was fine in her entry slim in her moulded breadth yet wide enough to carry cargo and be stiff even beating to windward whatever the americans had done when forming her body below her waterline let her slice through instead of bully the waves she must be mine hainaut fervently thought again he felt he would die did he not keep her as his own this rapierquick and epeeslim marvel glass he demanded over his shoulder his right hand out to take the telescope when it was fetched to him without looking to see if he was being obeyed but of course he was instantly there was la vigilante well hulldown and perhaps eight or ten kilometres back shackled to their slowest and dowdiest pair of prize trading brigs lt houdons big brig la celtiqueanother of his odious masters conceits to honour his damnable bloodand three prizes were perhaps a mile or more astern of la vigilante but being a much less weatherly pack of squareriggers were rather far down alee mohican and chippewa even under all plain sail had outraced them all since sundown hainauts stomach rumbled with hunger as he lowered his glass and hopped down from atop the transom lockers mohican was positively crammed with good things to eat on her long passage back to her miserably cold home port her manger held dozens of chickens six pigs and four sheep and the hens laid enough eggs for a fouregg omelette for his breakfast there were still loaves and loaves of fresh bread aft with strong piquant south american coffee beans by the gigantic sack hed have fresh unwormed cheese a whole pot of coffee and a chicken breast with his eggs brightened with freshground spanish pepper with firstpressing turbinado sugar with oversweet goats milk to whip into the eggs to make his coffee elegantly au lait with luscious jams and pearlydewed fresh butter to smear on lighttoasted bread allo a lookout precariously perched on the mainmast topsl yard shouted down attention three strange sail alee two points off the larboard quarter and approaching quickly allo we see them hainaut screeched back even before he mounted the transom lockers once more and swung his telescope in the indicated direction oui there were three of them two fullrigged ships and a brig they were bounding along under every stitch of sail all to the royals foreandaft staysls flying and steering almost across the trades to the eastsoueast thundering up from the dark leeward horizon as if to pass ahead of la celtique group of prizes ahead of his own ship la vigilante and her group too allo the mainmast lookout cried once more i see flags they are warships two frigates and a brig o war one is anglais and two are americaine the lookout yelped in consternation together hainaut cried just as disconcerted as the lookout americans and the british together mon dieu merde alors have the amis declared war on france there came a faint muffled cheer from belowdecks from their prisoners who had once owned and sailed mohican as the lookouts cry worked its way down to the forehold where nonplussed french sailors just as amazed as hainaut guarded them now stunned to garrulousness and loose lips someone go shut those scum up hainaut shouted for want of a better idea at the moment this prize can go into basseterre with no survivors and no one the wiser if they keep that up tell them what shall we do msieur lieutenant the petty officer asked from below him standing by the transom lockers do hainaut replied he might have meant to sound angry and properly indignant but it came out more as a question too what can we do he finally snarled after chewing on his lower lip we have barely enough hands to man this prize and guard our captives there are only six cannon aboard and those halfrusted we must uhm place discretion above valour much as it pains me of course timmonier of course msieur the older petty officer replied sounding just the faintest bit disgusted despite the horrible odds we must run for port oui choundas and hugues must know that the americans and bloodies work together against us now timmonier hainaut claimed striving to make it sound like an honourable but reluctant duty oui msieur stiffly and coolly blankfaced obedient hands aloft to no hainaut flummoxed thinking to deploy the crossyard topsls for more speed but perceiving that they were already on the eyes of the wind maintain course timmonier signal petty officer manon on chippewa to stay close up with us and hold his course at least two of our prizes will make port and our terrible information take heart msieur not all our profit is lost hein his senior petty officer did not look as if the retention of a pittance of their expected prizemoney would satisfy him but he did as he was bade turning away with the sketchiest of hand salutes la vigilante surely would be lost hainaut thought as he went forward to the helm and the compass binnacle cabinet he waved off the ships boy who had come to snuff the night lanthorn long enough to produce a spanish cigaro from a waistcoat pocket and lean into the cabinet to puff it alight off the flame lt pelletier would not come ashore to bolster his reputation with praise alas pelletier and digne would be exchanged sooner or later but that might be months in the future in the meantime though whatever he jules would say would be gospel a modest and selfdeprecating description of his own part with a praiseworthy display of anger that he could do no more to save them perhaps a show of shame that there was nothing he could do and play the part of the innocent man who chides himself as guilty hmmm hainaut thought that would redound to his continuing good credit wellmeaning people would surely clap him on the shoulder and say that he had no reason to scathe himself mere bad luck nestce pas and hainaut calculated with even more capable officers in british or american prison hulks there would be more ships in need of captains than there were men to command them mohican surely must be his after all now had he a full crew and the weight of metal to match against the upstart americans if not that british frigate then who knew what he could have accomplished if only oh if only he whispered beginning to rehearse and script how he would wring his hands in anguish once he stepped ashore jules hainaut stood looking outboard puffing on his cigaro secretly savouring the richness of south american tobaccos but trying on the opening scene and facial expressions to evince frustration and bitter sadness for his first small audience his own prize crew yes some good could come of this disaster after all good for him all round had he the wit and panache with which to play it jules hainaut smugly thought allo the mainmast lookout shrilled to the deck again what hainaut barked back in instant irritation with a scowl on his face he quickly amended his tone of voice and expression to one more suitable and tragically heroic our friends have a chance the anglais frigate lieutenant i see her before she is that proteus that bloody devil ah mon dieu hainaut gawped in true shock a sinking feeling in his innards then they are truly lost quel dommage merci he had wit to shout to the lookout a great pity indeed msieur lieutenant the petty officer said shaking his head in fearful awe how can that salaud be everywhere as if he reads our minds as if perhaps he does timmonier hainaut suddenly responded with a suspicious frownthen a wry and rueful grimace of understanding perhaps this was not mere bad luck but betrayal we must get word back to guadeloupe that this devil ship and that cochon lewrie have struck again as if by a miraculous coincidence no this cannot be credited he must have been told our every move by a traitor poor pelletier and poor digne hainaut thought scowling over this chilling explanation for all their troubles of late it is all up with thempelletier must have had the shortest captaincy in history and digne in his borrowed lieutenant s coat hell still owe a tailor for the uniform he ordered if he survives british captivity quel dommage i never liked them anyway weve the angle on them by god sir lt catterall exulted as they watched the sails of the french ships the slivers of hulls on the horizon heave up high enough to be seen with a glass sharp eyes the oglethorpe had aloft tspot em so quick on the false dawn sharp eyes indeed sir captain lewrie agreed well be up with them in another half hour do you concur mister winwood uhm the oglethorpe in a half hour captain proteus not a quarterhour later id estimate the sailing master answered after a long ponder in his usually mournful mooing cautiousness then well take at least one prize thanks be to god lewrie chuckled unless sumter overtakes us cant share out equally though sir lt langlie speculated all three ships will be in sight at the time of capture but weve no formal alliance with the americans which allows for sharing and there is the strong possibility that those french prizes yonder are the missing american merchantmen they reported so might not captains mcgilliveray and randolph demand that we return the retaken ships to their custody captain damn my eyes mister langlie lewrie said turning on him in mock anger but youve a quibblesome bent before your breakfast or your coffee do i ask my man aspinall to fetch us all a pot will you let me keep just one well sir i hardly the wellknit young man began to quibble but stopped redfaced among his fellow officers mirth i know theres no profit for us this morning mister langlie lewrie went on awarding him a wider grin and indeed i shall return what american ships are possibly retaken to our cousins is there any actual profit in our gesture perhaps itll come later in a real alliance twixt our countries against the frogs dye see sir best all round really if we dont even take public credit for assisting the yankees but their president adams their naval secretary and their congress will learn of it eventually as will admiralty and the crown secret gratitude from the americans and tacit approval by his majestys government may be all we may expect yet the mightiest oaks from little acorns grow do they not sir lt adair his alwaysclever scots third officer slyly drawled they do indeed mister adair lewrie said with a glad nod those french ships would have been so easy to miss in the grey murk of predawn but for a very sharpeyed lookout on uss oglethorpe itruth proteus had been half an hour into the morning watch with her peoples and her officers attention engaged mostly inboard halfpast am and the summons for all hands that began a ships day and it had been then that a sharpeyed lookout of their own had spotted oglethorpe at the very edge of vision ten miles aloof up to windward at the tip of their patrol line and pencilsketched in black against the eastrd sky he had discerned the tiny square blocks of a signal hoist in the space twixt her main and mizen masts and her new course as she foreshortened turning more soueasterly to investigate something almost as easy to miss had proteus lookout blinked was a tiny ruddy ember that winked into a brief life when she fired off a starboard lee bowchaser to draw their attention without being able to read the signal hoist but realising that oglethorpe was attempting to convey something of importance to them lt catterall who normally stood the morning watch had sent word aft to his captain who had ordered their course altered to close the american brig o war hoist a signal to alert sumter off to their lee down west by at least another ten miles and fire off a starboard chase gun of their own and the hunt was on lewrie had aspinall come to the quarterdeck and arranged for a pot of black coffee then paced off alone to the windward side with a telescope in hand steeling himself for the ordeal and flexing his left arm to test its strength after his wound received at camperdown which had resulted in the tiniest bit of weakness he clambered aloft for a look of his ownup onto a quarterdeck carronade slide mount to the bulwarks into the mizen stays and ratlines up the tartacky and bedewed shrouds as far as the crossbracing taut stays below the top with a groan of rusty practice knowing he needed a higher vantage he cautiously threaded his body tween the catharpings then transferred over to futtock shrouds and clambered up them until his bare head was butted against the bottom of the top platform inside the futtock shrouds not taking the more perilous outside passage that required dangling from deathgrips of his hands and feet like a spider hanging from its disturbed web til one reached the lip of the top and the maze of deadeye blocks to haul oneself up and over like a housebreaker breasting a brick curtain wall should do this more often he chid himself and his wellknown idleness im goin all potty and short o breath damme if ill end up like other captains all tripes an trullibubs knowing himself though perhaps too well by then such a vow he suspected would be quite forgotten by the start of the forenoon once he got his breath back to normal and his glass unslung he could see that catterall was right they did indeed have the angle on them the suspect horde of ships had been discovered down to the soueast first of all and uss oglethorpe had made a sharp turn easterly to stand as close to the noreast trades as she could bear to place herself before the bows of the vessels she had espied flogging roughly to the north on the opposing starboard tack and as close to the winds as they could steer as well proteus had followed quickly and was now roughly astern of oglethorpe on the same point of sail and course a quick look astern showed him uss sumter just a bit sutherly of their own creaming wake to stay in undisturbed water so her hull could slice cleaner and swifter about eight miles or so astern but gaining rapidly it appeared that capt mcgilliveray had not been boasting about sumter speediness and proteus well she was no slowcoach this morning either lewrie was proud to note thanks to her careening and hull scraping a scant three months earlier at kingston she would gain on randolphs oglethorpe just as sumter would gain on her til there might not be three miles between them when they engaged now that the predawn grew lighter lewrie could make out that there were three gaggles of ships roughly three points off their starboard bows the closest group was all squareriggers slower and less weatherly when trying to make progress beating to windward a little farther off and ahead of the squareriggers was a second gaggle and they were all foreandaftrigged schooners able to point higher and outfoot their confederates strive as they might though they were just a bit too far down to the soueast and not fast enough to get up to windward and make it a long stern chase before the oglethorpe interposed herself cross their hawses and there was a final brace of schooners then almost dead ahead of the yankee brig o war also closehauled on starboard tack those theyd not catch lewrie grumpily decided once a quartermile aloof of oglethorpe theyd stride off like arabian threeyearolds at the derby races and require a day and a night to overhaul the nearest group didnt have a chance in hell lewrie assessed stand on tack and come about to larboard tack to steer easterly or haul their wind and scud back the way theyd come either choice theyd be too slow to escape their pursuers past noon the trio of schooners would be the handiest and quickest did they tack and run there was a good chance that the chase could require the whole day and some of the next but for the fact that east of em lay grenada st vincent and the grenadines and the maze of isles and cays and coral reefs which lay between st vincent and grenada all of which were either garrisoned occupied or patrolled by royal navy vessels not ninety miles to windward of where they stood that instant it would be a case of out of the frying pan into the fire for them did they choose that course oh you are so gloriously fucked lewrie gleefully whispered to himself as he closed the tubes of his telescope the longer you stay blind to us down here in the dark the worse itll be too he reslung his glass squirmed about to grasp firm handholds and toeholds and descended the inner face of the futtocks threaded back through the catharpings turned about and made his way back to the bulwarks where he could hop atop the carronade slide then step onto safe and sure footing on his own quarterdeck once more scented and smutted with fresh tar and slush the rancid suety skimmings of the steeptubs from boiled saltmeats that kept the rigging supple and rainproof by god ye cant stay clean aboard ship he ruefully told himself as he swiped his tacky hands on the seat of his sloptrousers go through damn near a quarter o my pay with the purser just tstay presentablejust look at mister coote the greedy bastard takin my measure for freshissue slops already gimleteyed nipcheese cant understand why they havent spotted us yet he said to his officers not that itd do em much good if they did well bag all but the two dead ahead of us one way or tother ah aspinall coffee fr all sir no creamr sugar sorry tsay his man said passing out tin mugs dangled off a hank of twine and holding a large black ironlidded pot with the aid of a dishclout your pardons captain lewrie their purser mr coote asked but i was wondering should we serve a cold meal of cheese biscuit and smallbeer or do you think we might have time to boil up burgoo cold victuals sorry tsay mister coote lewrie told their much putupon older and straightlaced purser do the french spin out a long stern chase though id admire did the people be served a hot dinner to atone for it very good sir coote agreed with a small bow oh my sir do you wish ive a new bale of sloptrousers come aboard at antigua ill root out a pair or two in your size should i captain mr coote could not fathom why lewrie chuckled and shook his head in secret amusement before giving his assent just enough fr one mug sir sorry aspinall said as lewrie was served last per his standing instructions galleys stanched barely time enough for the one aspinall lewrie said as he accepted the searinghot thin tin mug and then itll be frogs a la fricasee for breakfast well relight the galley fires and grill em to a turn hear hear his assembled officers and warrants rumbled for at least another quarterhour the ad hoc squadron swooped onward as the gloom of predawn gradually lightened without the french taking any notice of them lost in the leeward darkness lewrie felt sure that their straining tgallants and royals then the topsls must be spotted as the bowl of sunrise spilled over and expanded illuminating their upper canvas almost turning them as bright as so many mirrors weary tan sailcloth would first appear as white as newfallen snow practically shouting here we are then glow as hot as a wellstoked fireplace when the rising sun coated them shimmery gilded but they were almost hullup to the nearest pack the squareriggers hullup to them before the french reacted the sumter had caught up within two miles of proteus by then and began to veer away a little more off the wind on a direct course for the squarerigged ships and brigs one mile ahead oglethorpe was within minutes of crossing the bows of the foreandaftrigged group lewrie now turned out in proper uniform including sword belt paced the quarterdeck waiting for the inevitable escape manoeuvres on the part of the french they had to tack or wear run soueast after tacking or run south or souwest after wearing about lewrie had also decided to allow the yankees the principal role in the endeavour unless they ran into trouble he would keep proteus between oglethorpe and sumter like a flagship directing the activities of subordinate ships those two schooners up to windward by now and safe as houses he turned to look in their direction lifting his telescope yes they were at least five miles upwind in the noreast and sure to escape and carry word of this encounter to guadeloupe if they didnt run afoul of other british warships and that was simply fine to lewries lights except for one short fight off their own coast that had netted them a french privateer the yankees hadnt scored any successes yet and were more than due one reclaiming their missing merchant vessels and fighting a brace of french privateers or national ships would embolden their whole nation that a british frigate had been a supporting partner might result in an even closer cooperation in future even a formal alliance he couldnt take the lead role though the americans stubborn younger brother pride and mistrust of their former enemy would never allow him to play the old salt and senior officer on the scene had he tried theyd have damned his blood and swanned off on their truculent own lewrie strongly suspected yet his standing off a bit appearing in command of yankee subordinates would dovetail with french suspicions to a tee he could speculate the french espoused a lingering liking for the jonathons they had eagerly bankrupted themselves to support the revolution sent troops and fleets to aid them and had embraced everything rustic plain and yankee doodle including that damned song that had driven him halfdaft when he had been surrounded at yorktown along with doddering old benjamin franklin and his ratty raccoon caps as paragons of simple plebeian virtuewhich had also dovetailed quite nicely with their reigning philosophers like that rousseau fellow with all his cant about noble savages the common man and common sense the french had fallen in love with that wildeyed radical thomas paine and his rantings on republicanism and democracy so much so that a few years later they had staged a revolution of their own one theyd mucked up o course being french and all in the beginning of the french revolution it had been american grains delivered in whole armadas of neutral ships that kept them from wholesale famine no no matter their unofficial war against american traders the french still partways admired them of course being french the americans were probably seen as childlike raw bumpkins when compared to the superiority of french society weak rude and rustic in their manners overly prudish and puritan in their mores so unrealistic as to expect honesty fair dealing and prim rectitude from themselves and others so hopelessly naive so unworldly hugues choundas and the directory in paris when word of this reached them could never suspect the americans of being realistic enough to make alliance with great britain too weak on land and sea to take the lead too enamoured of too awed by the innate glory of la belle france to dare those hideous english however were just the sort of scheming cynical master manipulators who could gull the ingenuous americans into folly could tempt them from the eternal gratitude the united states owed france oh how theyd curse stamp their elegantly shod little feet lewrie happily thought how the frogs would feel betrayed and feel fear fear enough to sulk for a time as the french were wont to do then declare war against the united states piqued by such betrayal here in local waters hugues and choundas would be piqued for certain to have lost a brace of raiders lost a flotilla of prizes perhaps gained a new foe it would be months before packets could carry word back and forth from guadeloupe to france with news or instructions and in the meantime they would operate as if befogged theyd keep their main attention on british operations but would be forced to keep glancing over their shoulders lest the united states launch a real war perhaps assemble a hasty fleet to eliminate guadeloupe as a privateering base once and for all by themselves or in league with the odious english and pelham an peel deem me a simpleton ha lewrie thought in glee well they wanted choundas befuddled didnt they and i cant think of a thing that befuddles him better sumter is firing a challenge sir lt langlie reported interrupting lewries musings and the merchantmen are wearing off the wind to the souwest it appears lewrie turned his attention in the opposite direction lifting his glass again indeed he could now make out the dowdiness of the prize vessels how deeply laden and slow they were as they wore now theyd come completely hullup french tricolours flew above yankee gridiron flags at their sterns denoting them as prizes poorly manned prizes he was certain the frogs could not allot a complete crew aboard them even so overmanned as french warships and privateers were when put to sea in expectation of captures if there were now a dozen hands aboard each prize hed eat his hat and half of those would have to stand guard against the original crews retaking their own ship in the wee hours of the middle watch and would a privateer or a warship captain willingly give up his best topmen and able seamen into a prize weakening her own chances of survival or freedom if they met a storm or an enemy man o war he rather doubted it the captor seems shell play mother duck mister langlie lewrie said as he lowered his glass shes standing out to face the sumter to give her prizes time to get away hmmm now well see what yankee warships are made of sir lt langlie said as if sceptical of their fighting prowess should we not uhm close sumter and give her a hand sir oh i expect captain mcgilliveray will give a good account of himself and of his ship mister langlie lewrie replied chuckling almost indulgently sumters indeed fast and handy even delayed by a short action with yonder frog im sure hell run all the prizes to earth by midafternoon theyre awfully slow and do they see their own ship their home taken the french prize crewsll be so dispirited theyll mostlike have themselves a little weep smack their foreheads say sacrebleu and strike their colours nowhere to go then shall we assist the oglethorpe sir langlie asked in impatience spoiling for a good sharp fight does she need us aye lewrie replied looking more easterly nearly across the bows aha see there yon french sheepdog will challenge oglethorpe as well and her prizes seem about to tack for a run soueast as i suspected schooners will be faster do you haul us up closer to weather mister langlie and hoist staysls we will pursue the merchant schooners whilst captain randolph matches metal with the frenchman our yankee cousins might be so pugnacious and aggressive they might forget that they sailed south to recover their missing traders lets get some speed on and overtake em for them aye aye sir lt langlie crisply answered a bit mystified perhaps and a tad disappointed that theyd not take a larger part in the developing battle but obedient as always and mister langlie lewrie added arresting the man in midstride once weve a goodly way on you may beat to quarters aye aye sir langlie said back with much more enthusiasm now well see what this newhatched american navy is made of lewrie muttered to himself busy with his telescope indeed chapter twentyfour cannon fire erupted to their starboard side an ominous punctuation to the longrolling drums and the urgent fifes summoning sailors from below as sumter and the french brig o war began to trade shots mr james peel drawn to the quarterdeck as well by their martial preparations had learned enough by then to ask permission to ascend a larboard ladder before clumping up into the open air lewrie took scant note of his arrival a brief smirk crossing his lips at the thought of mr peel being driven to the deck whether he wished to go or not in action there would be no sulking in his canvaswalled cabin for partitions and bedcot would have to come down to give gun crews room in which to serve their pounder pieces aft it was come up or get trampled lewrie looked down into the ships waist spotting the landsmen idlers and waisters who were lumbering his furnishings and chests down the companionways to the orlop there went his own seachest already locked peels however was shut but not locked with shirt cuffs or sock ends showing under the lid worse than a midshipmans chest all on top and nothing handy lewrie found cause to snicker a moment later and here came aspinall clutching a seabag filled with his pantry things and hobby things and toulon cradled in one arm and none too happy about it well not take part captain lewrie peel asked after he had himself a good look about not too active a part i trust ye know what mister pelhamd i intend to allow the yankees their due honours mister peel lewrie told him the merchantmen are theirs to reclaim after all thank christ peel muttered sounding immensely relieved for the moment at least tis bad enough were even here dye i shant tread on their pride either mister peel ill let em learn to toddle on their own til they look as if theyve bitten off more than they can chew then well wade in if we must i was afraid youd say that peel muttered half to himself for now were haring after yonder prize schooners dye see mister peel lewrie pointed out handing him the telescope so they dont break free whilst the men o war slug it out excuse me captain sir midshipman grace said coming up and knuckling his forehead in salute his waistcoat and coat sleeves wet right through but the last cast of the log reads eleven and a quarter knots sir she flies like a cambridge coach this morning sir damme if she doesnt lewrie said beaming with pride at his frigates fine turn of speed shes bored and hungry today mister grace good ships are like fine blooded horses they go stale do you keep em reined back our proteus knows when a fights in the offing like a good warhorse she wants a part in it and bless her for her spirit sir grace eagerly agreed ill never understand you sailormen peel grumpily confessed after grace had gone back to his place in the afterguard what mystifying language you use what superstitions about ships souls were a contrary lot lewrie allowed in all good humour as he watched sumter and the french brig o war engaging one would think mister jonathan swift used your sort for caricatures when he wrote gullivers travels peel harumphed further not everyone peels their boiled eggs from the pointy end do you mean to say mister peel lewrie pretended to find inexplicable why i never heard the like tsk tsk oh whats the use peel groaned half under his breath again damme but theyre good shots our yankees lewrie exclaimed as sumter loosed her entire broadside on the french warship at a range of about one cable evry ball twixt wind and water by god the french were replying though with a much weaker battery it appeared lewrie could detect deep bellows from some pounders mingled with the sharper barks of smaller guns among the french response even at such close range the french were firing high at masts spars and sails as they usually did to cripple a foe before deciding whether to close or scamper off french men o war mister peel lewrie enthused slapping his palms together with joy manned by french navy men for certain how can you deduce that captain lewrie peel asked privateersmen would never offer battle unless you trapped em in a corner lewrie explained quickly they have too much financial stake in their own vessels and tomorrow is another day run without shame today take more prizes next time privateersmen cant risk damage either repairs come out of their pockets and time spent in dockyard is lost money too whereas naval types know their government will foot the bill peel sardonically supposed and they get paid regardless exactly lewrie said laughing briefly and look you they fire high french navy fashion tmake their opponent too slow so they can get away instead of goin for a quick kill theres professional frog officers over yonder whove been schooled in their tactics maybe too long and too well but damme pisspoor gunners sure enough sumter got off a second broadside wellaimed and laid long before the french could lewrie turned and glared at peel pointing at his telescope in silent urgent demand and peel surrendered it albeit in sullen bad grace then wandered about the deck in search of a replacement headed aft towards the binnacle racks the second french broadside was delayed as the brig o war was instantly pocked with fresh shotholes chunks of gunwale and bulwark timber went flying in clouds of smoke dust and splinters and the brig shuddered as if suffering the ague sending sympathetic shivers aloft that almost spilled wind from her sails the answering broadside when it did come wasnt half the strength of the first either ragged and stuttering and still firing high as if their guncaptains were too panicky to shove the wooden quoins in under the breeches to lever the barrels downward lewrie could gleefully think the french gunners were already near that point where the choreography of gundrill became a teethchattering snotdrooling rota just do your small part swab quickduck load quickduck runout while squatting in dubious safety touchoff without offering your body as a target and hang aiming get shots off no matter where the ball went fast as you could and dont dare look aside at the maimed and the dead or let yourself think imagine it happened to the best of crews lewrie knew when things got desperate and the way that sumters gunners were getting off three wellaimed and laid broadsides every two and a half minutes was creditable in anyones navy sumter paused in her firing as she passed down the side of the french brig larboard side facing larboard side on opposing tacks and then swung up to windward at the last moment slewing a great foaming froth as she performed a radical turn her guns were runout anew smokedulled ebony muzzles levelled like the muskets of a firing squad shell sternrake her by god lewrie exulted full of admiration and succumbing to battlefever even if he was but a spectator and not a yardarmtoyardarm participant for a change and sumter did her guncaptains igniting their powder charges as each piece bore directly up the french brigs stern and at a distance little over a good musket shot he did not need his glass to see the french brig o war shiver again as her mainmast came tumbling down in ruin as round shot bowled her entire length caroming side to side in splintery ricochets that ripped the french ships entrails out a roundshot came bursting out from below her larboard cathead in an immense whirlwind of broken planking some of the inner faces painted red perhaps but it looked like a spurt of her hearts blood his own crew was cheering safe themselves for a rare once and always happy to see monsoor done the dirty a moment later and the crew raised a louder and more enthusiastic cheer for someone upon the french ships quarterdeck cut the flag halliards rightaft abaft her spanker to let a massive tricolour flutter down to drape her stern in sign of surrender thats the way sumter thats the way lewrie hooted in joy at seeing a thing done smartly and well he pounded a fist on the caprail of the quarterdeck nettings bulwark before remembering how glum royal navy captains were supposed to befar too late as usual the uss sumter sailed on for a space then hauled her wind and fell off in pursuit of the squarerigged prize vessels her late foe had struck her colours and was so damaged she would not be going anywhere anytime soon at any rate a sternrake would have killed and wounded so many of the french brigs crew created so much havoc belowdecks that it would take hours for those still on their feet to raise a jurymast aft plug shotholes below the waterline pump her out and get any sort of way on her again a painfully slow and crippled way so slow that any real hopes of escape were foredoomed if the foe decided to renege on her honourbound pledge of surrender a privateer might break his oath and attempt a run for it but french navy officers even jumpedup petty officers made into the gentlemanofficer class might not lewrie thought besides lewrie smugly considered the brig o war had already been working at a disadvantage with so many of her hands away in the prize vessels he doubted they had enough healthy people aboard for a full rowing crew in all four of their ships boats they are uhm disturbingly good mr peel commented in the relative quiet after the guns had fallen silent that was a quick and brutal drubbing welllaid too did you expect any less mister peel lewrie replied they may not have had much of a navy the last time round but theyre among the worlds best sailors as their privateers and that captain john paul jones proved time and again not too surprising really when you think on it they are halfbritish then surely not a people whose nautical aspirations should be encouraged or fostered as it were peel glumly admonished but of course they should lewrie enthusiastically countered theyre damn good didnt you just say so with more ships in commission encouraged by a few more victories like this one they just might declare war on the french and be a tremendous ally and they wouldnt cost us a groat not like the austrians or neapolitans cause theyre too proud to take the sort of subsidies we toss around millions of pounds a year and what have we gotten for our money weakkneed fools and utter failure say we give or sell dirtcheap modern artillery to em its all they need they have southern live oak for hulls the tall straight pines for masts and spars the tar pitch and oils the flax and hemp for sails and rope and do they build a few more frigates like hancock i told you all about her guns powder and shot are all they really lack say the crown reimburses our cannon foundries so they still make the same profit as if they sold em direct and that is money spent at home not thrown away on prussians hindoos the chinee or men in the moon the crown would adore it well given what weve seen this morning yes they seem to be more than capable at sea mr peel tentatively acceded and yes we do waste millions in solid coin ill grant you but theyre rivals in trade lewrie you give em an inch theyll dominate the caribbean the carrying trade theyll never be so strong that theyd threaten our sugar colonies though lewrie objected and as friendly allies with solid commercial ties to us whyever should they oh stop peel said with a groan looking as if he wished to cram his fingers in his ears you make it sound too alluring get thee behind me satan dont tempt me to concede you have led me into folly enough thankee very much what the crown admiralty and your mister pelham cannot seem to see sir is that the americans are a fact of life lewrie pointed out sensing a victory and becoming more diplomatic the french us in some future crisis someone d force em to build a strong fleet now wouldnt it make more sense to woo them while theyre weak make the yankees grateful for our aid make em our friends well its not like training puppies captain lewrie mr peel said with a snort of derision you cant leashtrain a whole nation do recall that british foreign policy must be bound by what is best for us in the long run we do not have friends not permanent friends we have interests just as the americans do really no but youd do best to pet feed and praise a litter o pups get em used to your voice lewrie replied with a wry chuckle else you come home some dark night and find a pack o wolves waitin on you better theyre glad tget their treats and play fetch than forage on your livestock or confuse you with prey hmm what dye say well it might be plausible but peel waffled pray god this is a real insight on your part captain lewrie that it doesnt have anything to do with a certain american midshipman who might need fostering and encouraging dont know what youre talking about lewrie curtly retorted leaning back stiffly drawn oh sir peel cynically drawled as if preferring to talk of anything but lewries madcap idea and more than happy to change what they discussed do you not why its as plain as the nose on your face theres not a man on this ship nor the yankee ships could be in doubt of him being your byblow once he saw you sidebyside it might be hard enough explaining what you just up and did on your own to pelham gainst all his cautions and instructions mind if you were singly motivated to do the crown a valuable service based upon your appreciation of the circumstances obtaining but understand sir that i dont wish to construe your motives have youmotives construed as personal or trivial dye see and i tell you that all ive done ive done with a coldeyed appreciation for the way things truly stand lewrie said teeth gritted in response to such an insult not for a need to impress a young man i cant help it if our superiors back in london are idiots that you got sent out by lordly sots addled with delirium tremens on their good days like that colonel of yours who thought we could starve america of emigrants if we just had saint domingue what i see is a chance to rid the new world of french influence forever do we do this right and to hell with saint domingue wed have a grand ally twixt our canadian holdings and the caribbean with rich trade cross a british lake called the atlantic ocean peel and whos tsay saint domingue cant rot on the vine a few more years til its putrid corpse rots to the bones then begs us and the yankees for peace my god sir i did not peel spluttered good god but theyre at it again lt langlie whispered to the sailing master near the helm amidships of the quarterdeck aye mr windwood took sorrowful note and it does not help hopes of conciliation that you blaspheme mister langlie ah oops sorry we never get saint domingue who bloody cares peel captain lewrie was going on with as much heat as before filthy damn place in the main american trade takes up the slack not just in sugar and rum cocoa and coffee prices for those goods go up cause demand is just as great and our sugar isles fill it at greater profit dont know much of trade frankly but secondhand goods through yankee merchants in partnership with english companies might be arranged now do you really think id go off halfcocked like a twoshilling musket upset your precious mister pelhams impossible scheme for nothing believe me mister peel id not risk my command and my career on the offchance a boy damn near a stranger goes in awe o me and i resent having my motives being portayed that way lewrie took a deep breath and calmed himself at last frowning quizzically to see that peel wasnt fuming like a slowmatch sizzling down to ignite a bombshell a lad whose existence will mostlike ruin my life anyway if my wife ever learns of him lewrie concluded his resentment spent at last forced to grin in selfdeprecating confirmation of his parentage and why aint you howling by now he simply had to ask because i had to know for certain peel mystifyingly replied with you in truth sir who knows what goes on in your head now thats not strictly lewrie flummoxed see here sir no forgive that peel said at last after lewrie let him get a word in edgewise that is all you say is more plausible and possible than anything i heard in london or since we arrived in the caribbean it is lewrie gawped back expecting a verbal knifefight i must own sir peel most reluctantly said that i see the eminent sense the rationale of your thoughts and as far as i see it god help me i can do naught but agree with your assessments mine arse on a bandbox you do lewrie blurted out with a whoosh of relief at long last he could not help but add may i assume that your next letter to mister pelham will tell him of your uhm change of heart then damme have i actually done something clever lewrie asked himself for once in my miserable life it will sir peel vowed though looking a tad beleaguered as he pondered the personal consequences of defying the prevailing opinion of his superiors in london not to mention the hurricane of anger that would come from the highnosed nottobeoutshone mr grenville pelham all else is so much moonshine wishful thinking grossly in error or hopelessly out of date well excellent mister peel lewrie crowed well not completely peel could not help retorting itll be mine arse on the choppingblock might as well be french off with my head he sourly grumbled wrapping his wide lapels over his chest as if a fell wind blew not a tropic one this turns out badly wed best emulate your friend colonel cashman and flee to south carolina find us a safe place to hide from the crowns displeasure of course does it work out lewrie cynically pointed out in much gladder takings almost playfully now your pelham is the fellow gets knighted for quick and clever thinkin i suspect our names will never be mentioned but of course peel answered with one of his accustomed wry smirks as if he was almost back to normal pity there cant be at least a wee shred o credit for us to improve our standing back home though lewrie alluringly hinted it aint every day i come up with a good idea tis a good day i come with an idea at all youre fishing for compliments you can forget it peel told him turning bleak once more and with his hands fiddling at his coat collars as if to armour himself against vicissitude im the one has to tell pelham what you get wont be a jot on my cobbing god he expected folly from you but not from me aye im such a corrupting influence lewrie said bowing his head in mock contrition put it down to the old navy excuse drink and bad companions wont appn agin yer honour sir oh well no thanks no credit peels answer to that was an inarticulate gargle sorry didnt quite catch that lewrie playfully enquired with a hand cupped to one ear it had sounded hellishlike a cranky beargrowl peel turned his back and stomped rather bleakly away towards the taffrails where lewrie had little doubt he would seize the caprails in whiteknuckled hands as if to strangle oak in lieu of a human throat lord knew as a junior officer lewrie had done the same in the face of utter frustration lewrie turned his attention outboard lifting his glass to see the uss oglethorpe brig engage the large french threemasted schooner the schooner had swung off the noreast winds to present her starboard battery using the windforced heel to elevate her cannon for the customary crippling shots at oglethorpes rigging and sails and lewrie took a deep breath and held it in dread expectation as the two vessels bowsprits came level with each other on opposite courses as the american brig blocked the schooner from view their broadsides at what he estimated as about a hundred yards lit off as one in the instant that both ships hulls lay exactly opposite each other as if docked sidebyside one bowsout and the other bowsin a massive cloud of spent powder smoke burst into existence between them in the blink of an eye oglethorpe up to windward was only partially befogged with the smoke quickly clearing as it was blown alee the french schooner was the one thoroughly wreathed in it completely blotted out from view oglethorpes masts shivered and her forecourse yard canted and dropped to be caught by the chainslings rigged to prevent its total loss her sails were pocked and fluttered like carpets or bedding on a clothesline for dusting by very stoutarmed maidsofallwork a bare royal spar on her mainmast went winging away along with about three feet of the slim upper mast that supported it and both standing and running rigging came snaking down as it was severed by chainshot starshot and expanding barshot god in heaven lt langlie was forced to exclaim my word i mean he amended as he realised that prim mr winwood was still near and with his holy face on but what weight of artillery does that yankee brig mount how many cannon can a brig bear and server the french schooner staggered out of the smoke pall her foremast was sheered off about ten feet above the deck her mainmast canted so far aft that it made a rough triangle like a masthoisting sheerlegs where it rested upon her mizen and half her starboard side was hammered so badly that one could almost make out bare ribs her bowsprit and jibboom pointed down into the water like a steering oar and her starboard anchor and cathead were simply gone with such a drag she emerged bowsdown flat on her bottom and low in the water most of her way shot clean off her surging up a vast patch of whitefoaming sea around her as if she rested atop a stony shoal where the waves first broke as they came ashore enough and more it seems mister langlie lewrie said about to dare the seagods and whistle on deck in admiration or surprise proteus s crew raised another gleeful cheer to salute oglethorpe for her quick victory for them it was better than a raree show or a championship cockfight any day they could see the despised french getting their just desserts was simply the nuts to them and the bloodier and more brutal the better damn my bless me mr langlie further commented a glass to his eye as the sailing master pointedly coughed into his fist and issued a cautionary hahemm as if clearing his throat taking the lee position as she did sir with a fair amount of her quickwork exposed at her angle of heel theres sure to be shotholes below her waterline be a shame to lose such a fine prize if she sinks why i do believe you can already judge her down to starboard as if taking water it appears captain randolph is of the same mind sir lewrie said in agreement with his assessment she is listing to starboard oglethorpes coming about and taking in sail save her fore she goes down i spose ah there shes struck her colours took them long enough a blinding glimpse of the obvious that mister langlie sir oglethorpes busy lewrie decided swinging his telescope to eye those french prizes now fleeing to the soueast wish her well and all that but if she wont run down the merchant schooners we shall a point to loord and lets crack on they look deeply laden to me no matter theyre yankeebuilt and fast we stand an excellent chance of overhauling em by midafternoon at the latest aye aye sir mister oleary a point o weather helm haul off a mite and shape course just to windward of the schooners there lt langlie instructed the quartermaster of the watch theyre at least six miles or better off mister langlie for now lets stand down from quarters and serve the crew their breakfasts pass the word to mister coote and the galley folk aye aye sir mister grace lewrie called aft summoning the midshipman to his side aye sir the lad asked still afire with excitement pass the word for aspinall and tell him id admire a fresh pot of coffee and tell the gunroom stewards that the officersll mostlike wish a pot of their own too aye sir grace cried dashing off forward and below almost breathless with secondhand battle glee that had yet to flag lewrie paced aft down the windward side of the quarterdeck as the gun crews removed flintlock igniters gathered up guntools and reinserted the tompions in their unloaded unfired pieces mr peel was pacing forward nearer to the centre of the quarterdeck well that was exciting for a minute or two lewrie commented and we were not required to fire our guns in concert either peel took fairly hopeful note as if he had his fingers crossed behind his backon both hands so far we havent exactly sinned by an act of commission have we mean tsay we didnt do anything overt yet lewrie cautioned with a wee sly grin that was sure to bedevil peels shaky qualms and recriminations we were merely present peel insisted just happened by still its early yet lewrie took delight in pointing out to him who knows what could transpire fore sunset he drawled gods sake dont do that lewrie peel almost pleaded you get your slyboots look on and theres the devil tpay pelham owe you money mister peel lewrie badly asked of course not peel spluttered nonplussed by such a query you owe him then lewrie went on tongueincheck engaged to his sister or some such he catch you with the wrong woman knows your deepest darkest most shameful secret does he no none of that peel insisted though lewrie noted that he turned a tad redfaced and made it too bland for complete credence he controls my career reports on my fitness for future employment in our little bureau that surely cant be all peel lewrie said feigning a pout of disappointment but in some ways youre not the same confident fellow i knew in the med mister twiggs a horrid old fart but i cannot recall you bein so meek with him nor can i recall you bein the sort to hide his light neath a bushel basket and not tell him when hes wrong or give him a better idea diff rent era diff rent superior peel bitterly replied i quite enjoyed working for mister twigg for i could be open with him and he couldnt abide timeservers and toadies i was his partner peel paused working his mouth as he realised that it was time to reveal some home truths i was a cashiered excaptain of the household cavalry not quite the ton to polite society dye see but that never mattered with twigg pelham is a different proposition entirely what sort o blottin did you do in your copybook lewrie queried sure there was a tantalising tale to be heard lets say it involved the wrong earls daughter affianceed to a fellow officer a major in the same regiment for starters peel hesitantly admitted hmmm do tell lewrie gently pressed doesnt sound much like a careerender though young love all that let us say that the young lady in question and the gallant major deserved each other peel said with a bitter sigh so easily bored so needful of amusement she was which cost me dear we peelsre good landed squirearchy lewrie wellenough off but we aint that rich and the regiment was expensive enough to begin with cost of my colours as a cornet then lieutenant then the vacancy as a captain string o chargers the proper kit and uniforms and a sinful messbill each month skinflint maintenance of my dignity was half again steeper than my yearly pay and two freeforall messnights in a month all the sprees about town could put me deep in the hole then she came along i was utterly besotted lost my head and then splurged my way even deeper til the sight o tailors and tradesmend force me to hide in stables til theyd gone toward the end i our estates are entailed so my family couldve cleared my debts but i was foolishly stubborn it not come to that so i you robbed the paymasters lewrie gently nudged i i cheated my fellow officers at cards peel ashamedly confessed come over all hangdog and unable to look at anything but his shoes to buy her baubles dine her out the theatres and such and i she swore shed break her engagement that shed marry me but dye mean tsay you got caught lewrie gawped fraid so peel told him in a soft voice always had a knack for cards i usually came out ahead with honest play and sure to god you know how easy it is to pluck the sort of henheads you find in the better regiments snootfull of drink by ten lackwit by eleven and ready to wager their last stitch on anything you name lucky to even see their cards by then met a few lewrie commented hiding his amusement continually amazed by how arrogantly dense were the second sons of peers of the realm the sort usually found in the elegant regiments and the sort drawn to cavalry were the truly whinnyingstupid thought i could pull it off peel continued god after id skinned em i even lent them some of their losses back at scandalous interest and they wouldnt even blink their sort theyre lucky they could breathe lewrie chuckled anyway one night one of em wasnt drunk as a lord and cried cheater on me the rest took it up and caught me with an extra card or two where they shouldnt have been so peel supplied snorting humorlessly at lewries observation i was asked for my resignationtwas that or a general court and theyd have done anything to avoid a scandal not on their hallowed reputation they forced me to settle up with those id fleeced and everyone but the footmen had their hands out then i was allowed to sell my commission my string of mounts saddlery and all by the time id cleared all my debts though i was barely left with the civilian togs i stood up in horrid stain on the old family escutcheon too dont ye know peel japed trying to make light of it everlasting shame the black sheep happens in the best of families lewrie cryptically commiserated with the fingers of his right hand crossed exactly peel drolly replied looking lewrie up and down with a tongue planted firmly in his own cheek a cynical brow arched you were sayin lewrie harumphed coughing into a fist i was near an american emigrant myself one of the remittance men exiled for his own good peel further informed him but for meeting mister twigg catercousin of my fathers in the foreign office arranged an interview overseas employment exciting doings picking up foreign culture and new languages robust outdoorsy work meet fascinatin new people betray em lewrie stuck in yes good fun all round peel said laughing out loud for a bit til mister twigg retired it was i suppose you could say im compromised now in a way see pelham does have something over me that major whose fiancee i diddled well his fathers country place and pelhams fathers estate are nearly next door both fathers took their seats in lords the same month and both families attend the same parish church their ancestral pewboxes cross the aisle from each other knew all about me from the outset had it in for you right off hey the bastard lewrie said the arrogant little popinjay he is all that and more mr peel mused snobbish impatient with his inferiors sure of his wits and talent when he doesnt have a tenth of twiggs tradecraft nor an hundredth of his sagacity or patience his cleverness when not orderin the murder of thousands lewrie sneered sublimely selfconfident when he has no right to be mr peel went on and not a young fellow open to suggestions an uncle a former ambassador to austria sponsored him with the foreign office naturally he was shoved into our branch twigg was leery soon as hed briefed him warned me to mind my ps and qs he did same as he cautioned me to keep a wary eye on you sorry and who wouldnt i ask you lewrie posed too engrossed with the hope of useful dirt on the pestiferous pelham pelham put me on notice right off peel told him that id best tread wary and sing small or id be an unemployed excaptain of cavalry an employed agent and i was no proper gentleman to boot fetch and tote run his chores hed do the thinking thankee very much damn him he enjoys having me on tenterhooks surely he must know by now that hes been sold a complete bill of goods on this saint domingue business lewrie scoffed he cant expect to win after better men than he broke their health and reputations trying sometimes he makes me wonder lewrie he truly does mr peel said with a slow befuddled shake of his head pelhams one of those who think potholes fill before they step in them as if the rules are different for the rich and titled pelhams smart enough to see this mission as a morass but its rare to see him suffer a single qualm then he comes over all energetic as if does he scheme and wheedle hard enough hes going to win and prove his mettle despite it being a bloody potmess let him then lewrie said with a dismissive shrug he sent you on a journeymans errand to finish off choundas and ride whipperin on me and thank your lucky stars fort were a sideshow to pelhams lights whilst he stays on jamaica with his eyes on what he thinks is the main prize he wont even know he chose wrong til its much too late whereas the doable part of his compound orders our partis well in hand and damnnear done well when you put it that way peel said perking up some how did you get saddled with this chore and pelham anyway well other than mister twigg no one else knew as much about choundas and his methods peel tossed off as if it was of no matter then discovering you were out here so aptly placed someone else of whom i had personal knowledge even twigg said my presence was a necessity i tried to stay in the mediterranean but he said shrugging pelham came as a surprise by then it was simply too late to demur without poisoning my credentials with the bureau and i relish this job hmmm lewrie mused pulling at his nose so all pelham knows is what you tell him in your reports lewrie broadly hinted tapping the side of his nose sagely lewrie that sounds suspiciously mutinous mr peel gaped or pretended to with a hand to his chest as if aghast at what he was hearing you dont actually mean that i should lie to him or are you peel added sounding almost wishful not lie peel no lewrie quibbled just couch things in the best light give him chapter and verse of your best justifications as to the yankee doodles just passing mention of the faint possibility of secret cooperation leadin to better things lewrie sweetly coaxed and make sure that twigg and your superiors back in london are kept appraised of what a spectacular opportunity just fell into your lap your lap peel not pelhams well twigg would like to know what were doing id wager peel muttered indeed looking a trifle illatease at the ploy hes still got good entree at the foreign office and choundas was the main target to him all along twigg was never taken with the scheme about buying saint domingue by suborning louverture or rigaud in a private moment he conjured me to not be too disappointed did the larger scheme fail twigg must have seen that pelham would be in over his head and so aspiring a twit he mostlike plans tbe prime minister lewrie said with a sneer yet you still go out of your way to uphold that too do recall captain lewrie peel said with his nose in the air that i in my fashion and present line o work am as dutybound as you to your admiralty to support my superiors in all they do and obey orders with alacrity and enthusiasm no matter if i think them daft as bats he sardonically commented though i am no longer an army officer i still know how to soldier sir one hopes when you led a troop of horse you could adjust to changes though not just clatter about obedient to outdated orders like a mechanical clockwork toy grenadier when out of touch with a higher authority as we are at present on a roving commission lewrie pressed determined not to appear impatient with peels sturdy sense of honour surely in his line of work such was a hindrance well of course peel allowed but you think like a soldier not a seafarer mister peel and i will tell you the diffrence lewrie added smiling now sure that he had him lured hooked and in play with the gaffing and landing to come as certain as sunrise cant send a galloper off to the colonel and expect an answer an hour or so later once out of sight of land were completely on our own dye see and weeks or months twixt new instructions with only the vaguest idea where wed be found if anyone tried it all depends on time distance and the winds peel i have noticed that ships are driven by the winds believe it or not peel retorted getting his back up again pelham lies downwind of us peel nearly ten days to a whole fortnight theretohere closehauled to antigua lewrie explained with a smirky confidential air no matter how angry you make him he can only cob you longdistance the packet brig hed use to communicate with london starts at a disadvantage to the packets which depart from upwind of jamaica dye see do we put into antigua the next few days assumin a jamaica packets in port and ready to sail your report takes a full week treach him a day more say for pelham to scream and run about in tiny circles before he damns you by post but itll be six weeks fore his irate scribblin reaches london and perhaps six weeks before they tell him he can lop yer prick off and twigg and your superiorsd have your reports two weeks to a month before that by then we could very well have evrything in our bailiwick wrapped up neat as boxing day gifts choundas and a preliminary alliance with the americans both then whos bosscock and whos the goat eh mister peel dear lord lewrie peel exclaimed with a shudder of dread and looked about himself for the prim mr winwood who would chide viceadmirals for blasphemy why is it every time you start scheming that i suddenly feel like a prize ram being led into the shearing pen no worse a runt ram bound for the ballcutter shears these years you spent on your roving commissions so independent i fear youve been hopelessly corrupted o course i have lewrie cheerfully laughed that and all that drink and bad companions i mentioned too but you do believe well get choundas in the end yes i do im sure of it peel was forced to agree do you think well get the yankees into alliance with us well ive my doubts on thatun peel demurred no matter lewrie quickly dismissed with a wave of his hand tis the effort that matters the chance that beguiles when london hears of it from you surely its an option they already considered but to see one of their agents hard at work on it one o their delirium tremens dreams mostlike right up there with brightred maneatin dancin sheep well there is that peel muttered gnawing on a thumbnail by god lewrie the effort would seem bold even inspired i do take your point did one wish to present the crown with a plan more likely of fruition as ambitious as seizing saint domingue thats certain uhm to steal attention from pelham it goes without saying mr peel fretfully speculated almost turning queasy for a moment mmmhmm lewrie encouraged with a gesture that could be misconstrued as miming the feeding of ones rival overside to the sharks though some might take it as immoderate boasting peel fidgeted tooting ones own horn of being that sort mean tsay underhanded lewrie drolly supplied quite sneaking lewrie said on not the proper gentlemanly thing well yes peel replied cuttyeyed with embarrassment better than spending your whole career being thought of as an unimaginative rearranker lewrie beguiled a backbencher vicar of bray and disappointing old twiggs expectations of you well there is that peel said stung to the quick by the idea of letting his old mentor down one could express the hope pose the outside possibility theres a good fellow lewrie congratulated him gaffed landed and in the creel he silently chortled but my god what a stiff and righteous prick chapter twentyfive quite a stir were causing sir lt langlie said as proteus rounded up into the wind to let go her best bower at the top end of english harbours outer roads she had been last to enter port after sumter oglethorpe and their five prizes which had first been mistaken for a whole squadron of seven american warships a sight never seen before or even imagined in these waters and indeed we should mister langlie lewrie smugly replied tricked out in his best shoregoing uniform and sword he didnt envy the antiguan merchants once they found that the prizes would go back to their masters after a brief hearing at the admiralty court and no profits would be made from their and their cargoes sale what started as an eightday wonder would become a twoday thrill and the only ones to gain from it would be the taverns the eateries and the prostitutes when victorious yankee sailors were allowed ashore lewrie thought it would be interesting to see how the shoals of french prisoners were handled would america and great britain share the cost of gaoling them aboard the hulks which power could accept a french officers promise of parole which would negotiate his halfpay so he could keep himself in town until exchanged and once paid would france reimburse the united states since they were not at full war with each other lewrie snidely thought those frogsd mostlike sulk in dockside taverns til the last trump since france hadnt taken any us navy ships in combat yet and mostlike wouldnt not here in the caribbean at least proteus had made her number to the shore forts had fired off a gun salute to rearadm harvey commanding the leeward islands station and had received a proper twelve guns in reply just after shed come in all standing swinging up to her anchorage and furling all canvas in a closely choreographed flurry the last scrap vanishing in concert with the anchors splash that impressive arrival his news and his testimony at the prize court would win his frigate and himself a bit of the islands adulation perhaps enough to wake the antigua prize court from its usual torpor and bludgeon its subsidiary on dominica into action concerning their own prize that still swung idle in prince rupert bay frankly he could use the extra money to spruce up the wearandtear on his wardrobe and his accommodations besides his last good run ashore had been months before at christopher cashmans boisterous sendoff at kingston lewrie rocked on the balls of his feet eyes halfclosed in fond speculation of good meals freshwater washing of all his saltstained and itchy garments as lt langlie saw to their anchoring him ashore in sundaydivisions best the st vincent and camperdown medals algeam against his shirt ruffles successful frigate captains could expect a warm welcome from merchants and from the ladies he knew antigua of old why thered be ravishing matrons and grasswidows simply bored to tears by the local society thered be delectably lissome young misses with lashes and fans all aflutter as he languidly smiled halfbowed and doffed his hat thered be smiles in return from the morepromising runners among the ladies the wellhooded secretive perhapses if not bolder carnal comehithers had he at cashmans goingaway no and come to think on it he had been retaining his humours like a catholic monk lately abjuring even tame relief in the practice known in the navy as boxing the jesuitthe one the physicians and parsons condemned for turning manly youth into feeble wheezers with hair on their pink palms too why the devil not he asked himself a man wasn t made to quickly followed by thoughts of caroline and reconciliation then of desmond mcgilliveray and even more bastardly gullions turning up fifteen years hence to plague him hmm perhaps sadly not it was a mortal pity for the antigua ladies were raised right in his estimation as roundheeled and obliging a pack of genteel wantons as anyone could wish for the sort whod trip you with a daintily shod foot then manage to be the first to hit the floor cunningly asprawl beneath you anchors set sir lt langlie reported and lewrie turned to take note of langlies relief at last his onerous task of first officer could ease in harbour well mostly anyway and the battery is secured from the salute very well mister langlie lewrie replied leaving his lusty reveries well row out the stern kedge to there he directed pointing five points off their larboard bows almost abeam we have room to swing by one anchor but id admire did we haul her up so the prevailing winds off our larboard quarters for an easy departure in a few days and not go aboard a nearby ship do we swing foul aye aye sir langlie said looking even more relieved your pardon captain but there seems to be a boat bound for us midshipman elwes announced just there sir sure enough once lewrie had lifted his glass he could see the colours in the sternsheets of a large rowing barge one sporting fully eight oarsmen a bowman a coxswain and a useless midshipman aft by the tiller with a lieutenant seated forward of them along with another man dressed like some sort of buskined sportsman out for a shoot on his private game park commanding admirals barge maybe the port captains lewrie intuited officer a flaglieutenant the pastyfaced shorebound sort but why the civilian lewrie allowed himself a wry smirk supposing that a functionary from the islands governorgeneral had been sent out to see what all the fuss was about and had been caught sitting for a portrait as nimrod the mighty hunter with fowlingpiece custom rifled musket a brace of setters at his feet with parrots in their mouths and all damme though he further wondered whats left on antigua worth huntin anymore rats and runaway sailors permission to mount the quarterdeck mr peel enquired halfway up the larboard ladder natty in his other suit of ditto this one in sombre grey rather than black with a subdued maroon waistcoat oh shit oh hell lewrie spat lowering his telescope for a second so he could rub his disbelieving eye well if you feel that way about it peel griped piqued mister the honourable grenville pelham is come to call on us lewrie told him in that barge yonder what pelham whatthebloodyhellishedoinghere peel gawped leaping to the quarterdeck the bulwarks and seizing lewries glass for a gapejawed squint of his own where oh my eyes no borrow mine i insist lewrie grumbled gods teeth at least he looks pleased peel took hopeful note hes up and waving like his best horse just came in first hmmm this may not be too bad ne defice coeptis falter not in what thou hast begun valerius flaccus peel cited taking what heart he could thatun made lewrie wince it had been that neerdowell peter rushtons droll advice just after they had set fire to the governors coachhouse at harrow which had gone up in a most spectacular blaze surpassing their wildest expectations just before he and that other scoundrel clothworthy chute had gotten clean away leaving lewrie to be nabbed with the portfire in his hands the caning theyd escaped since lewrie was stupidly honourable enough not to tattle had been biblical which thrashing hadnt held a candle to the one his father sir hugo had given him after hed been sent down in shame along with the long bill for damages falter not indeed pah my word mister peel but what a load of balls lewrie replied pass word for my servant aspinall there if pelham seems happy peel best we let him crow over whatever it is thats made him so before we uhm tell him what weve been up to perhaps over a large bowl o punch hey one with a liberal admixture o whisky ive been to saint domingue grenville pelhamm boastfully announced once they were alone in lewries greatcabins direct action thats the thing and damme gentlemen but i do avow that were on the cusp of success at long last carpe diem what seize the day so i did uhmm tasty punch this whats in it diff rent oh some celebratory champagne lewrie said ticking off the ingredients and manfully striving not to roll his eyes at all the old latin adages being bandied about in public school boy style with a poohpoohing wave properly french o course cool tea bottle o dessert wine a halfgallon o ginger beer sugar and lemon the usual ingredients mostly saint domingue though really well well got our mister harcourt to slip toussaint louverture a letter asking to meet him on lie gonaves the middle of the bay just off portauprince on the strictest qt and he did pelham said preening ugliest little monkey ever you did see but shrewd for being a butler in his early days or so he thought hey oddest damn eyes he has too like a lions his best feature since hes so short squat and bowlegged went whats the hindoo word in disguise i did in mufti lewrie supplied for his father used the term after years and bloody years with a john company sepoy regiment i was wondrin why you were clad so uhm peel commented for pelham was still wearing a dark buff suit of ditto with a waistcoat in a green shade most often seen on sadly neglected houseplants a pale tan unbleached linen shirt tall riding boots covered by darkbrown corduroy spatterdashes to midthigh buttoned up the outside with dark horn buttons and had come aboard sporting a flatcrowned widebrimmed farmers hat halfburied in assorted darkbrown feathers the hat was of cheap felt not beaver of a colour that lewrie could only describe as shitbrickle or dyspeptic dog turd ochre lewrie could only assume that pelham had struck an earthshaking bargain with louverture if he still felt need to sport his costume days or even weeks later like a muskogee warrior displaying his mostrecent scalps mufti that was it pelham crowed holding out his tall mug for a second refill louvertures nigh illiterate and cannot even speak halfway decent french just their horrid creole pate patois mean tsay i say pate hmm so did your negotiations proceed to the point that we should offer congratulations all round sir peel asked him sharing a look with lewrie at pelhams slip got a much better reception with general rigaud pelham said with a slyboots wink louverture was standoffish said hed give britains terms a good ponder though i think he was just stallin for time to see what his putative master general hedouville would do for him slavishly bound to france is louverture as we supposed peel slavish hah rigaud though has fewer supporters and troops but better organised and armed and easily supplied through jacmel and a strong stone fortress to protect his rear whites rich landed mulattoes and halfcastes the educated and civilised as good as any in paris fore the wars and the ladies not to boast but in a lone week the presence of a mannered english gentleman allowed me more carnal pleasure than a whole six months on my grand tour of the continent ha ha rigaud would take hands with hedouville in a heartbeat tsave his hide before louverture is sicced on him but hedouvilles nothing substantial to offer him not like we could no british troops ashore this time but artillery shot and powder and enough arms munitions boots and accoutrements to arm more of his followers enough horses to haul guns and mount a large mobile force that could ride circles round louvertures barefoot infantry will turn the trick rigaud was all ears let me tell you and much more receptive almost slavering so you will recommend rigaud to lord balcarres at jamaica to the foreign office sir peel asked with a troubled frown already have mister peel pelham bragged and lit a fire to gather all the arms horses and saddlery we may soonest came here to do the same the quicker rigaud gets the goods the better before hedouville makes his offer then on the pretext of louverture blocking british ships in his ports even under false colours we will blockade his parts of the island to guarantee rigauds success i trust you were discrete sir peel went on leaning forward and how did you get there aint stupid peel pelham griped tossing off his third mug of punch and rising to get himself another refill maitland will lay that before him later as for the how i hired a small bahamian boat come to kingston to trade and was headed for the turks and caicos for salt went in my disguises in and out of the bay at night unseen sailed far west before turning for jacmel after so no one ashore had a glimpse of us dressed as a sailor then and gawd what a stench it was all lice and fleas for days played as if wed come to buy coffee and such but the hard parts nearly done and as soon as we can get a convoy to rigaud at jacmel we have saint domingue in our grasp that boat what were bahamians doin lewrie quibbled trading i told you pelham bulled on over his objection a twomasted whatever you call em from an island off great abaco where big merchantmen dont put in much but completely english not to worry captain lewrie every last one of them sounded like a west country peasant or a bristol dockwalloper place where they build a fair number of boats they said long settled but sparsely peopled i think and not much farmland so its trade where they can or perish man o war elbow green turtle guana cay do you recall a name sir lewrie speculated aloud green something edible pelham answered shrugging and sipping green boiled disgusting anyway rigaud wont be cheap mister peel but i held the price down to a quartermillion per year for rigaud and another quartermillion for his cronies and generals so he can pay his troops and hire on the bootless mercenaries we abandoned when we left the island those whove sided with louverture for the promise of a few puny acres of plantation land once they get wind of rigaud having showers of silver coin though we may expect at least a tenth of louvertures army changing sides and haring down to south province and rigauds socalled mulatto republic two months four on the outside and rigaud will be ready to take the field against louverture then perhaps a year from now we step ashore in triumph mister peel captain lewrie having stolen a march on the french and those pesky americans for good and all with not only french saint domingue but the spanish half of hispaniola in our possession as well have to invade santo domingo when toussaint louvertures slave armies are broken thats where he will flee and den up when congratulations are offered you may rest assured i will feature your stalwart efforts in support of my endeavours in the most appreciative terms to the crown so pelham barked beginning to look a touch bleary while ive been up north what have you two been up to in the meantime to bedevil and dethrone guillaume choundas pelham thankfully was too engrossed in dipping himself a new mug of punch to take note of the uneasy silence that followed that enquiry and with his back turned he could not discern the queasy looks that passed between them damme but this is an inspiritin punch pelham enthused with a lipsmacking grin sweet spicy but stout whatd you say was in it rum gin brandy no captured guadeloupe pineapple jamaican cinnamon and allspice lewrie said shifting about in his chair and crossing his legs to protect his true vitals sweet dark rum aye and a local er spiritwhy dont you tell him of our doings mister peel peel mouthed a silent damn you at him then plastered a grin on his face for pelhams benefit and gave his superior a precis of the raid the latest rich prize belonging to hugues and her captains looselipped talk of hugues blaming choundas for her loss with all of huguess expected profits peel laid out the intelligence they had gleaned from their prisoners how much they knew about choundass staff his current state of health his dealing the ruin of his frigate to hugues for two converted raiding vessels choundas now only has two corvettes under his direct command peel related merely sipping at his own punch as pelham continued his eager quaffing and lewrie had a single refill hugues wont give up a single rowboat more sir we learned that choundas escorted a store ship filled mostly with munitions to guadeloupe with very few spare spars or canvas for his own ships beyond what they stowed aboard shortsighted that lewrie felt emboldened to add since mr pelham was soaking up the report along with the punch in a most amenable fashion even going so far as to utter the odd oh well played and ye dont say every now and then there is another small threemaster a captured american ship at pointeapitre awaiting convoying to saint domingue that bears a cargo of armaments mr peel carefully laid out both await orders from general hedouville whether they go to louverture or rigaud i that is we do not think they will ever sail though with our foe choundas stripped of strong escorts both corvettes are cruising far south on the spanish main for prizes yankee ships mostly this deep into hurricane season lewrie added and anyway they cant be expected back at guadeloupe for at least a fortnight depending on how successful their cruise has been we asked some yankee merchant captains how many of their ships could still be down there and slim pickings with everyone eager to get their cargoes home past the cape hatteras weather sir peel hurriedly dismissively explained to cover lewries gaffe and quickly changing the subject weve played a nasty trick on choundas one that will keep him busy peeking under his bedcovers our first raid and destroying his frigate at her weakest moment as was our second seemed so timely that our recent prisoners expressed the worry that there may be a spy sneaking messages offshore to us choundas as we intended sir knows that captain lewrie is responsible mr peel glibly said with a confidential chuckle but as we also know choundas holds a low opinion of the good captains intelligence quite right pelham heartily though woozily agreed arrr was lewries affronted comment to that all but sticking his tongue out at peel and no one can be that lucky so i let slip that another of choundass ancient foes mister zachariah twigg was out here and directing lewries activities mr peel snickered which accidental revelation should be reaching choundas through our exchanged prisoners even as we speak sir that news and the strong suspicion that there is someone extremely close to choundas secretly in our pay will drive him mad a spy who is now collaborating with secret royalists and enemies of his precious republic whom victor hugues didnt catch in his initial witchhunt will why twigg mister peel pelham crossly blurted why not use my name aint pelhams canny enough lewrie awarded himself a larger sip of punch from his engraved silver mug from his days as captain of hms jester concealing a gladsome grin to see mr pelham beginning to succumb to cornwhisky he even began to hum the jolly miller under his breath delighting in the chorus the longer we sit here and drink the merrier we shall bel well sir beg your pardon but choundas has never heard of you peel patiently explained twas mister twigg in partnership with captain lewrie who bested him twice before and the longer you are unknown to the french the more effective you are but once choundas hears that my old mentor has been sicced on him with lewrie for his weapon his worst dreads will be realised he will credit mister twigg with being able to turn a trusted subordinate against him and that will smart considerably imagining that twigg opposes him once more fits choundass vanity like a glove too sir makes him feel as if our side still rightly fears him and his undiminished capabilities which made us desperate enough to bring mister twigg out of wellearned retirementa retirement of which paris surely is awareto estop choundas one last time and and if choundas dont win lewrie felt relaxed enough to add to mr peels subtle blandishments hes done for this time and he sure tgod knows it too no partial coup either for him its all or nothing he cant allow us a single trick or hes dealt out of the game desprate enough tbegin with now until his corvettes return theres nought he can accomplish mr peel continued from pelhams other side making that worthy swivel rather ponderously thats enough time to concentrate on his alleged traitorspy and that spys collaborators why sir choundasll tear guadeloupe down to bedrock hell decimate his household victor huguess staff as well anyone privy to their plans will be suspect anyone the slightest bit connected to people privy to plans mistresses whores bodyservants no love lost twixt choundas and hugues from the very start we mister peel learned lewrie gruffly contributed hugues we heard suspects that choundas was dispatched as his replacement as governor of guadeloupe mr peel informed pelham with a nod and smile for lewries interruption which had slewed mr pelham about again his aristocratic head now wobbling on his neck with one eye squinted in concentration or to maintain his focus choundas has been slighted from the moment he set foot on the island and hates the way hes been treated man that hideous pelham blearily mused cant have too many objections when folk run screamin or shun im did victor hugues fail to vet his staff or miss a few wellplaced reactionaries they call them peel went on which hauled pelhams gaze back to him in his brutal witchhunt choundas would be more than happy to turn up a few and make hugues look the fool maybe choundas does have a secret brief from the directory to supplant him if hugues seems to be losing his grip on things who knows at any rate i accidentally offered up clues pointing to one man extremely close to choundas peel confided to his superior with a slyboots grin his clerk and private secretary etienne de gougne hes slurred as the mouse a meek little scribbler too frightened of the consequences to leave his employ we discovered him or choundas sooner or later lewrie idly stated one leg atop his desk in sublime ease choundas loses the little bastard is done for knows too much and choundas couldnt let him live to blab else old sinsd come back to get choundas shortened by the guillotine and we know choundass penchant for cruelty mister pelham peel said hiding a wider grin to see pelhams eyes slewing beyond his heads direction and starting to glaze over a shot at torturing the truth from the unfortunate fellow will suit choundas down to his toes frustrate him too since this idiot de gougne knows nothing and cant name any names choundas will go barkingmad i expect and turn all his attention on a hunt for our spies he touches huguess staff hugues slaps him down takes command of his remaining ships and choundas goes back to france in chains disgraced and probably down for the madhouse to boot driven to insanity by one too many intrigues hmmm pelham uttered polishing off another mug of that perfidious punch and dipping himself a replacement dont know peel hell be kept so busy so distracted peel pressed ever think we do have spies on guadeloupe hah pelham suddenly snapped choundas snaps em up like pickin daisies where are we then his clerk well dies thout namin names a wider hunt will turn up realuns shuh surely anyone we know lewrie was forced to ask in curiosity uh er no pelham had to admit anyone vital to our cause sir peel asked too i er don know nbody tol me damn em wouldn trust me with their idet ident names their product goes to lord balcarres an he tells me he thinks i need it hic damme that a cat lewrie pelham suddenly said peering owleyed into the diningcoach wherein toulon crouched atop the table next to his hideous hat head bobbing and cocking and his whiskers stiffly forward at the sight of something so alluring and possibly edible why i do blieve it is lewrie replied feigning surprise thank god pelham shuddered sounding much relieved thought it was a ship rat heard o them i have nice puss nice moused so you concur with my putting the scheme in play sir peel decided to ask to get verbal assent before pelham went arseovertit while he could still form sentences what oh knacky ruse yes spose pelham agreed now noticeably swaying clever amusin damme we set sail already im glad you approve of my extemporaneous actions sir peel mostcarefully intoned and that captain lewrie may attest to such an approval he tipped lewrie a broad wink glad to be of service mister peel lewrie gleefully agreed whered those damned colonials get all their prizes pelham enquired plopping down into his sidechair again and tugging at his neckstock as if strangling or suffocating in his toowarm clothes bout ninety miles westnorwest of the grenadines they took four merchantmen back from choundass newest raiders lewrie casually explained thinking that mr pelham was sufficiently liquored to be amenable to part of the truth they also took one of his raiders into the bargain and sank another picked up the survivors from that one and fetched em all in youll have a good time interrogating em i think mister pelham once theyre handed over from the americans to our officials that is shouldve seen em lewrie enthused evry shot twixt wind and water made one strike with a single broadside you there pelham gravelled of a sudden head now well alist and one eye screwed shut yer shipz hic there sir damn my eyes you been coll collab at sea with the yankees spite my tellin ye uh oh lewrie thought shouldve let him slip under the table and kept my mouth shut god damn my eyes you bloody what pelham screeched as he shot to his feet misrable idiot bastard meddlin lewrie swung his leg off the desk as pelham staggered forward hands clawed as if wishing to strangle him but thankfully he did not get that far couldnt in point of fact for toulon proudly bound aft toward his lair under the starboardside settee dragging his oversized widebrimmed befeathered and awkward kill overhauled pelhams stumbling clumping feet which nearcollision raised an outraged howl from the ramcat which howl seemed to levitate the distinguished pelham for a startled second which levitation made pelham come down attempting to avoid the cat or his costly new sportin hat it was hard to judge which and reel and flail about for what little balance was left to him which attempt looked like a marriage of an impromptu irish jig a folk dance involving sombreros reported among the mestizo peoples of the spanish new world and the frantic whirlings of mystic muslim dervishes in the holy land which gay prancing brought forth an accompanying outburst in what might be mistaken for an unknown tongue sounding hellishlike eeh tooah gaah shit hic arreehf the last syllables a wail that ascended the musical scale as mr pelham snagged a booted toe in a ringbolt mid his descent and landed spraddlelegged on his rump with a gay thud rrowwr toulon carped from his lair his kill abandoned owwhunngh was pelhams response quickly followed by a hhrackk quickly followed by the remains of his breakfast dinner mostlike his supper of the evening before and about half a gallon of punch to boot pelhams casting his accounts to neptune didnt do his sickly green waistcoat buff breeches or corduroy spatterdashes a bit of good either now i understand why they call em spatterdashes peel said looking like to puke himself with a pocket handkerchief pressed close to his nose and mouth god in heaven whats he been eating mr pelham caught a whiff of it himself and cast up another flood just before his eyes crossed his face went pasty and he fell insensible to the deck on his right side pelham a mason lewrie enquired quickly masking his own nose mostlike peel mumbled through his handkerchief most rich and titled men are why just wonderin if what he shouted was some secret language lewrie answered shrugging well shouldnt someone help him up or something damned if itll be me peel announced twas your punch done him in you do it aspinall lewrie shouted toward the gundeck sentry pass word for my cabin servant and mister durant the surgeons mate as well carryin board and the loblolly boys he instructed the marine who popped his head through the forrud bulkhead door mops brooms and lots and lots o seawater to himself he muttered may have to rig a washdeck pump never can tell e looks dead peel observed no hell only wish he was when he comes round lewrie poohpoohed gods sake lets go on deck for some air and when knacky little mister pelham can sit up again i want task him about how he got to saint domingue dont care how disguised and careful he said he was theres something about that knockabout tradin vessel he used bothers me dont know why but sounded fishy to me too peel allowed as they made a rapid way aft to lewries private and narrow ladder to the after quarterdeck dont trust his tradecraft the bloody amateur louverture and rigaud hedouville sonthonax and laveaux those lesser generals like dessalines and christophe they all have agents in the opposing camps doubt you could walk from one side of the street to the other without bumping into three or four and a halfdozen more spies scampering off to report on your evry fart and scratch you think pelham was gulled lewrie asked once they reached the brisk fresh air by the taffrails and flag lockers under the tautrigged canvas awnings that now spanned the quarterdeck my dear captain lewrie i am almost certain of it peel said with a sneer that damned fool callow boy let himself get used by just about everyone in power on the island and showed em all just how perfidious are our dealings after him all our hopes for a british saint domingue are completely dashed and pelham did it all by his little self by being just too clever by half well lewrie said at last there lies the packet brig over yonder four to six weeks from now your account could arrive beside his ill have my portable writing desk fetched up do you decide you might need it hmm might fetch up pelhams hat too while youre at it mr peel said with a knowing smile your cat can have the feathers for they aint dyed turkey eagle and pelican plumes mostly but the hat dye might make him sick or as mad as a hatter good suggestion mister peel lewrie said with a bow of gratitude and here i didnt think you cared chapter twentysix lt jules hainaut had barely gotten his prize schooner tied up alongside a stone quay in the harbour of basseterre when the reply to his urgent flag signals came from pointeapitre the other harbour to the east the vieux fort semaphore tower had signalled that his hoists would be relayed to capt choundas as mohican and chippewa had beaten a hobbyhorsing way inshore despite the hundreds of things required of him to secure both prizes see to the surviving crews and turn the vessels over to the local court officials there was no gainsaying the waxsealed letters pithy instruction when it came aboard stained with ammoniacal horsesweat and borne by an equally sweated despatch rider come to me quickly the single sheet of paper said hainaut groaned with weary misery at what strenuous effort that simple directive implied against the winds a despatch boat couldnt fetch pointeapitre til midafternoon next the quickest way was by horseback the only road a raingullied sandandshell track rutted by cartwheels thirtytwo of those newfangled kilometres at least eight hours at a trot or canter supposing a change of horses at capesterre or ste marie was available hainaut would be damned if hed do it at a gallop all the way guillaume choundass wellfeared wrath notwithstanding was he not a warship captain in all but name with all the duty and responsibility that that implied oh hed make a great show of leaving with the utmost despatch but he thought a brief sitdown supper somewhere on the way could be fitted in explained by the plea of stern duty to his hapless matelots and the safeguarding of the prizes which prizes were rare and dearly earned money in le hideuxs purse too after all surely that earned hainaut an extra unbegrudged hour timmonier i am ordered to report to capitaine choundas quick as i may you are in charge until i return hainaut shouted with the proper seeming haste and clattered down the gangplank in the uniform he stood up in bawling at the despatch rider for a fast mount vous imposteur petit the petty officer growled to himself as soon as lt hainaut was lost in the dockside throng ashore go lick your ugly masters arse et va te faire foutre he muttered as he leaned over the side to hock up a hefty and derisive gob of phlegm you are certain it was proteus guillaume choundas rasped in the ghoulishly unflattering light of four fingerthick candles mounted in a single stand on the side of his ornate desk you are certain it was that diable lewrie there is no doubt of it msieur jules hainaut replied with the properly dramatic gravity displaying grim assuredness and a hint of residual anger handinglove with two americain men of war it was proteus in the centre with one each in her van and rear against such overwhelming force i regret there was nothing i could do with my two barely armed and undermanned prizes to aid lieutenant pelletier hainaut gravely explained laying out the disastrous events as best he had observed them til he had sailed the action far aft and under the horizon hainaut had been most careful to swath his clothing at the inn where he had dined rather well in point of fact so there would be no betraying food stains upon his person but from the moment he had come to a dustcloud halt from his last galloped leg of the journey begun at the fivekilometre post outside town to look properly winded and damp with horsesweat capt choundas had peered so closely at him that he felt as if he were under examination with a magnifying glass so sharp glittery and icily dubious was choundass remaining good eye on him so highnosed and aloof did his master regard him and all three ships flew their largest battle flags choundas pressed even though hainaut had arrived shortly after midnight and the interrogation had been going on for more than an hour choundas was dressed in his best giltlaced uniform his neckstock done up and all his waistcoat buttons snugly buttoned as was his masters mind as lucid and penetrating as ever they did msieur hainaut answered with an affirmative nod even if he hadnt been close enough to the action to espy such details and he strove to keep his face bland but not too bland with no owleyed staring or too much rapid blinking to put the lie to his statement hainaut had seen choundas conduct harsher interrogations before and had even been instructed in the telltale frailties of men and women determined to bluff their way out ahum was choundass response to that taking time to swivel to face his detestable little clerk de gougne who pointedly made an additional note of hainauts observation at his masters cue no wine hainaut thought in worry dry work but no wine in the offing how much trouble am i in what kill the bearer of bad news in hainauts experience of choundass little chats with those he would expose and condemn wine was always available to those of too much selfpossession none for the visibly nervous until they had lied their way into a corner wine came first for choundas then was given to the shaky victim with profuse apologies as if they had survived the experiencefollowed by the toocasual just a matter or two more citizen or citizenness to disarm before the verbal blow that struck below the heart hainaut worried and not for the first time exactly where he stood with guillaume choundas this night the man had aged hainaut noted in the few weeks since his ship had sailed on her raiding cruise that arc of choundass face he still exposed to the world was much more serely pruned than when hed wished them all bonne chance his flesh was more collapsed upon the bones and now of a sickly pasty cast as if he had turned hermit not venturing outside his headquarters unless required thinned by poor victuals or the loss of interest in mere food in the face of all his cares and frustrations hainaut almost exposed himself with a faint shudder of dread as he suddenly realised that the vaunted clever and capable ogre was not going to succeed this time guillaume choundas was going to fail and likely drag him down with him when he went more so than ever hainaut now had to be free of him your prizes safely made harbour though hainaut no damage choundas demanded too solicitous of a sudden for credence as if they didnt matter in the slightest yes msieur hainaut answered feigning gruffness as if he were immune to the temptation of prizemoney too two fine schooners belonging to the same amis trading company both are about uhm thirty metres and very fast with promising cargoes of dyewood coffee cotton rough wines and brandies cocoa kegs of limes and lemons cocoanuts sugar and molasses and tons of cigaros or plug tobacco in excellent condition both of them lightly armed of course but stiff and beamy enough to accept a decent battery sixpounders would be best if any are available msieur cannon of fourpounder measurement if not to match their own armament pardon but they would make excellent replacements for those we lost choundas stared at him disconcertingly unblinking for a long time as if turned to stone by hainauts callow presumptions to offer tarryhanded nautical advice to him of course in their present condition they could make a fast passage back to france with their cargoes hainaut spoke up wilting under that obsidian gaze hating himself for making selfdeprecating gestures for altering his confident voice nigh to apologetic wheedling whatever you decide msieur indeed choundas intoned with the faintest crudest lift at the exposed corner of his ravaged mouth well then you have ridden hard and far hainaut and must be desperately hungry and thirsty no ready to fight a wolf for the bones msieur and so dry that i could drink a river hainaut exclaimed with plausible eagerness my poor arse it has been too long since i even sat a horse once in bed i fear ill sleep facedown and need a sitting pillow for a week hence uhm what should i do in the morning msieur ride back to basseterre to deal with your prizes sail back preferably there is my crew to see to one last little matter hainaut choundas interrupted almost as an afterthought which beguilingly coosome tone to his voice froze hainauts innards and then i will let you refresh yourself of course msieur hainaut replied sinking back down onto his chair with his knees ready to buckle did lewrie and the americans choundas posed leaning back in his own chair and toying with a loosely folded sheet of paper with his left hand seem as if they lay in wait for you dash straightaway for our ships could you see any sort of light or signal which might have drawn them to lieutenants houdon and pelletier and their prizes all but the compass binnacle lights had been ordered doused msieur hainaut answered unable to avoid looking perplexed by such a question they did steer directly for the two larger groups just as soon as they heaved up in view yes now that you mention it but that was near dawn and even the binnacles had been snuffed by then it is possible that they kept masthead lookouts aloft after dark or sent theirs aloft earlier than ours msieur but i did not get the impression that they lay in wait for us it was an unfortunate thing that we were spotted by the lead ship in their patrol line furthest to the eastward but did they operate together to intercept any ships returning to guadeloupe they surely would have known to search as far to windward as possible such a fortuitous coincidence though do you not believe jules hein following the first inexplicable fortunate coincidence off basseterre when we lost le bouclier and the arms shipment you do recall that i presume choundas sneered all arch and arctic cold or the recent loss of a rich merchantman just off deshaies not a week ago when lewrie and proteus just happened round pointe allegre just at the instant that a capitaine fleurys ship cleared the cape i was not aware of that loss msieur hainaut said frowning no i am now certain that you were not for you had no way of knowing the day or the hour of her sailing for home choundas told him she was betrayed cher jules just as you were betrayed just as le bouclier and capitaine desplan were betrayed choundas gravelled in a hoarse rasping voice fleury and that fat fool haljewin are prisoners on dominica though at least fleury had the wit to write me of his taking of being for a brief time a prisoner aboard lewries frigate fleury carefully wrote a veiled account of his ordeal in a crude but workable cypher known to me you remember that despicable old salaud who interrogated you when you were captured in the mediterranean the wicked zachariah twigg or simon silberberg whatever he called himself i do msieur hainaut gasped for real unfortunately he is here hainaut choundas barked slamming his left hand on the desktop and making clerk de gougne nearly jump out of his skin fleury described a civilian with lewrie who named himself as a john gunn but from the description i conclude was really twiggs old aide a british agent named james peel seeking my destruction just one more time they have brought twigg out of retirement and paired him and lewrie to destroy me and all my works so far they succeed jules mon dieu hainaut whispered surely not you not through luck not through guile or superior numbers non choundas snapped but through treachery twigg peel and lewrie are being assisted by a spy a whole cabal of spies and traitors operating here on guadeloupe jules under my very nose on my own staff among commissaire huguess most trusted people under my very roof hein su surely you cannot suspect hainaut blustered awash in sudden fear that his master thought it was he i did dear jules choundas whispered as malevolently cruel as a hawk honing beak and talons before tearing its quaking prey into gobbets twigg had you for weeks before exchanging you for british midshipmen the thought had crossed my mind understandably so nestce pas choundas even took a moment to roar with abusive amusement at hainauts gulping and blinking torment as false as you have played me all these years you did make me wonder false msieur really hainaut flummoxed dont pretend undying loyalty hainaut choundas snapped now thinlipped and flushed in aspersion i am not completely blind nor am i deaf you love only yourself hainaut no shame in it so long as when you dissemble energetic fealty to france you are useful to her and to me master i do not even try to swear your undying gratitude or loyalty choundas cautioned while you were at sea things on guadeloupe have taken several turns for the worse or the better depending choundas gloomily said grimacing with distaste in the harsh badly angled candlelight his face resembled that of a satanic ghoul from folk or childrens stories it seems that paris is not happy with our unproductive little war on american trade commissaire hugues has been a thoughtless glutton for money hainaut hes sold privateering commissions throughout the caribbean in every dutch danish and spanish port not just to frenchmen asks for an additional share of the proceeds from our local privateers and uses his prize court to inflate the value of the captures for those who go along with him and for his own gain naturellement that makes for outright piracy preying on our allies too and threatens to upset what coalition the directory has been able to muster against the hated british it took me some time to discover all of this but and now you are prepared to use it against him msieur jules hainaut said more than happy for choundas to turn his bile away from him against another obstacle hainaut took a peek at the mouse to see if etienne de gougne was disappointed that his grilling was ended for the nonce that the little clerks hopes of seeing him broken were dashed and silently relished the nonentitys tiny moue i am indeed jules choundas told him smiling and nodding for paris has seen fit to send us a senior official to look into the matter one of the directorys ridiculous creatures all booted and spurred in a tricolore waist sash and all those silly plumes on his hat desfourneaux is his name i shall see him tomorrow to lay my evidence before him and suggest to him that hugues has so ruined the credit of our privateering commissions that for the moment only good french corsairs remain legal and that the best of them are conscripted into naval service whether they like it or not to sail as warships temporarily to salvage the republics good name under your command not huguess hainaut crowed marvelling at his masters deviousness magnifique msieur masterfully done desfourneaux will clean up the piratical corruption hugues has fostered perhaps he even has orders to place hugues under arrest as a witless fool who has driven the americans into league with the bloodies that piece of news you bring me will spur desfourneaux into even quicker action to remove hugues choundas slyly boasted with hugues his staff and his corrupt circle suspect as well hainaut congratulated with a sage snicker who one wonders might be left to become the new commissaire civil of guadeloupe msieur with care and a becoming outward disdain for greed the vacant post could still prove extremely profitable and pleasureable for the one who proves himself capable nestce pas you see dear jules all my efforts to educate you in the ways of the wider world have borne fruit after all choundas agreed with an evil little laugh i truly never expected such an opportunity to fall into my lap but now that it seems possible ah and the last nail in huguess coffin will be his apparent failure to apprehend the spies who pass information to the british because he let himself be distracted by the lure of riches or perhaps the suggestion that he deliberately left some untouched were sufficiently lucrative bribes paid hmm not that he was in british pay himself no that would be reaching too far to be plausible but as soon as desfourneaux gets his hands on huguess ledgers he is doomed and i will be seen as instrumental to his exposure whether i become governor or not or become the senior naval officer in the caribbean worthy of admirals rank at long last and secondincommand of the island next to the new governor either way i gain and advance choundas cleverly concluded you are sure you would leave my employ hainaut now that my and your prospects for gaining riches power and with that power the access to undreamed pleasures are so close to having to discover the spies i will need the assistance of men i trust experienced with delving into traitors hearts and minds experienced with my techniques of interrogation now could a small insignificant ship of war with all the privations of seafaring be more tempting than that jules hainaut let his mouth fall open slightly as he cocked his head to one side in furious contemplation choundas knew him down to his boots knew what motivated him to what he eventually aspired no matter how seemingly unattainable for a halfaustrian former farmhand and simple sailor tempting as the prospects were though if you need me so badly you must order it msieur of course he temporised but i still desire command of a warship i am not so improved as you think i came from before the mast and the sea is what i know i do aspire to advancement but so be it choundas growled as if disappointed this schooner you brought in jules the one you claim would be a suitable replacement you desire her i do msieur more than anything hainaut vowed though with his fingers crossed for luck for hed seen his master raise the hopes of others only to delight in betraying them a moment later breaking the spirit and heart of his victimsalong with the bones then she is yours jules choundas baldly told him so firmly that hainaut had no fears it was a cruel ploy you will leave with a new commission into her your orders will be to arm her with the guns off both prizes empty them and turn the cargoes over to the prize court officials at basseterre and assemble the crews off both ships into her i will send what midshipmen petty officers and sailors i can spare though after our most recent disaster experienced officers i cannot offer i will make do msieur hainaut confidently swore good for i have quick need of you choundas said businesslike picking up the folded letter he had toyed with earlier i have received a letter from general hedouville on saint domingue at last he intends to throw his support to that pompous mulatto general andre rigaud and has urgent need for the munition ships to sail as soon as possible with la resolue and le gascon away though i cannot despatch the arms convoy and hope that it gets through i can not entrust their safety to even the worthiest of our privateers as an escort either as soon as you are ready for sea in all respects you must dash back down south and recall griot and macpherson from raiding the americans we must do all this before the british can act i will do so msieur hainaut vowed with mounting joy the vile bloodies sent an agent to saint domingue to try to bribe louverture and riguad choundas sneered a total ass it was quite droll was it not etienne oh indeed msieur clerk de gougne chirped back jerked to wakefulness at the mention of his name he had been nodding off now that it seemed his bitterest abuser had gotten away with a whole skin and a grand reward again that salopard twigg does not direct every insidious scheme the british work against us jules choundas snickered even he is compartmented to deal specifically with me while others woo the ignorant noirs their latest agent was so clumsily disguised he might as well have gone ashore with a regimental band he even hired a boat to take him to ile de la gonave then jacmel that had been at kingston to spy for us if you can believe it the silly shit no he didnt hainaut hooted with open glee what an ass americans from okracoke island on the outer banks near cape hatteras choundas cackled long a pirates and buccaneers haven where they make their prime living salvaging the many shipwrecks that come onshore perhaps luring some when times are lean who can say a most practical and realistic lot with a distinct english accent they told this idiot that okracoke was a smallish cay off the abacos in the bahamas and the ignorant fumier bought it naturally they betrayed him for extra money as soon as they put into both ports being rewarded by louverture then rigaud then by hedouville choundas had to pause to let his harsh laughter subside before they left jacmel an aide to general hedouville handed them his letter this letter and brought it and that twit straight to antigua at the same time then hared off here to guadeloupe on the very next tide choundas all but tittered wiping his good eye with a handkerchief and he never knew a thing about it they even taught him seachanties and to dance a hornpipe in his sailors costume mon dieu what a hopeless hainaut wheezed himself well i will get a few hours sleep then get back to mohican as quickly as i can to ready her no real rush hainaut choundas countered so easily turning grim and businesslike after savouring his little coup your orders will take time to write extra crew to assemble the british agent promised much more than he can possibly deliver at short notice it will be weeks before his blandishments are assembled and loaded while ours just wait for the arrival of our ships to escort them a midnight repast a good nights sleep facedown if you must and a hearty breakfast before you depart will be allowed very good msieur hainaut gratefully agreed time enough for me to discover the spy network so this time i do not tip my hand or the day or hour of departure to lewrie and his spymaster choundas mused looking rather weary and ill no matter if he should have been chortling over his clever masterstroke i have two small additional things for you to do for me dear jules if you do not mind but of course msieur hainaut replied anxious to seem full of eager cooperation now that all his dreams had been launched first of all uhm choundas grunted arthritically twisting in his chair no matter how comfortably padded and with his eyes carefully averted before the arrival of hedouvilles letter and the news you brought i was beginning to despair oui even me hainaut time lingers heavily when plans are set in motion and one cannot see or know how they progress n estce pas go to my bedchamber and you will understand a slight amusing diversion he said crankily shes very young and pretty so you might even take joy of her too do you find her pleasing if not dispose of her discretely hainaut chilled with foreboding as he rose and crossed to the double doors that led to his masters groundstory chambers hainaut gently pulled them back and stepped inside fearing what hed find a single candle burned on a nighttable a small bottle of good brandy lay on its side on the carpet empty along with two abandoned glasses and a girl lay tangled in the bedlinens her nearly white cafe au lait complexion a tawny contrast to the white of the sheets her hair was ravendark and curly now undone and bedraggled down to the small of her back and spilled like dried blood over the pillows hainaut stepped to the side of the high bedstead and swept her hair back from her face she was beginning to purple with bruises his master had inflicted in his passion her lips split and caked with a colour darker than paste dried tears streaked her artful makeup but she was indeed very pretty not over thirteen or fourteen as most of choundass bedmates always turned out to be slight slim and petite childwomen with spring buds for breasts hainaut put a hand under her nose and halfopened mouth to feel for breath touched the side of her neck to see if life still throbbed in her yes she was still alive hainaut knelt and sniffed the neck of the empty brandy bottle and detected the aroma of laudanum which le hideux had used to drug her into deliriously sweet helplessness if not complaisance into furtive whimpering silence instead of wails or screams that could draw unwelcome attention from neighbours snuck in the back way as always long after full dark muffled in anonymous cloaks or blankets carried out before dawn and still insensible hainaut heaved a disgusted sigh before pulling the sheet up over the girls bare shoulders and stepping out of the room quietly closing the doors on her fate allow to me ask msieur hainaut said almost tiptoeing and his voice a whisper in some form of deference for that pitiful chit but what degree of disposal did you have in mind scruples dear jules choundas mocked this late in our association my my nothing drastic shes a pretty little whore but a whore nonetheless return her to her master at the bordel where she is employed with a second purse beyond her rental to compensate the bordel owner for his loss of earnings til shes presentable once more the whoremonger has been warned what could happen to him if he makes a fuss have her out before the town wakes choundas grumpily ordered reaching for his walkingstick leaned against his costly desk and painfully getting to his feet at last swaying with weariness and wincing at the pain of an old old man the low candlelight limned him as an ancient grizzled dragon the last matter i mentioned may be done at the same time you return our wee putain that chore is official public and provides a mask for the first very well msieur hainaut assented perplexed again please be so good as to step out on the porch and summon the front entrance sentries capt choundas grimly ordered msieur hainaut gawped in sudden renewed dread that all he had been offered told had been but a cruel charade that all along choundas had been toying with him like a sly cat would torment a fearfrozen mouse teasing it this way and that with soft clawsheathed paws that spy john gunn or james peel whatever he calls himself boasted a little too much to our capitaine fleury jules guillaume choundas continued in a morefamiliar growl rage back in his face and voice accidentally revealing to him that the bloodies have a spy so close to me that the british might as well be sitting in this room this very moment now who could it be jules who could it be does it not make you wonder choundas threatened taking a clumsy pace or two towards him stick boot and brace ominously going clumpshuffletick he is here now msieur hainaut stuttered in surprise and nearterror did choundas still suspect him though hed said he turned his head to look down at etienne de gougne for he knew it was not him besides hed never laid eyes on this anonymous fleury and could not recall snubbing or insulting anyone by that name if this fleury person had laid a charge against him to cover the inept loss of his precious ship but how he is here choundas forebodingly confirmed and slowly swept his own gaze away and down to peer at de gougne as well the little clerk began to rise but choundas drove him back into the chair with a shove of his left hand the mouse surely hainaut scoffed never so relieved in his life all these years you reported behind my back to the directory and their spymaster citizen pouzin choundas gravelled you think i would not learn of it etienne when pouzin seemed to know too much and so quickly on the genoese coast and ever since dont dare deny it did you think he would rescue you should you ever become a liability to me where is citizen pouzin now and where are we hein mmmsieur de gougne blubbered in fright barely able to find breath with which to protest his innocence master that sort of treachery i could abide etienne choundas menacingly rumbled such pettiness was it your sly meek way to get back at me for using you like the insignificant worm that you are but to take british gold to slake your wretched pitiful mousy shopclerks inksniffing clockwatching timeservers slippered bourgeois landbound peasant spite on me you will pay etienne you know you will i will break you into slivers i will make bloodandmarrow soup with your bones and make you drink it before you die with just enough of you left to ride the tumbril to the guillotine so everyone can witness the reward for treason and see justice done but before that etienne choundas promised leaning forward to whisper as sibilantly as a hideous boa constrictor you will name for me every traitor on this island you work with or quel dommage he suddenly mused standing upright and instantly bemused as if his ire had gushed away like the hot air from a montgolfier balloon for clerk etienne de gougne had pissed himself had even fouled his trousers as he fainted dead away slumped bonewhite to the floor him hainaut gaped quite unable to believe he had it in him oui choundas confirmed jabbing with his walkingstick get this gaoled in fort fleur depee and get that trull out of my house too jules now vite vite chapter twentyseven lewrie had given testimony before the prize court and the american merchant vessels had been released to their captains to complete their homeward journeys crews off sumter oglethorpe and proteus had been given shore liberty with sailors of both nations reeling arminarm from one public house to the next for a whole rousing day and night on the second rousing day and night however the question arose to whether the yankee doodles had needed british aid in fighting a brace of french warships whether the aforesaid french men o war were worthy opponents or cringingly weak and lightly armed poltroons whod struck too quickly whether theyd been daunted by american prowess or the mere sight of a british bulldog flying the union flag the resulting brawls twixt yankee salts and british tars actively aided and abetted by other bellicose drunks egging them on with the eager participation in said brawls of stout british islanders and merchant seamen by yankee doodle civilian sailors and gentlemen traders whod taken manly umbrage shortly after reenforced by members of the watch and admiralty dockworkers by publicans whores and their bullybucks and crimps and lastly by the appearance of the heartily despised shore gangs of his majestys navys impress service who came off a rather poor third had redounded to the detriment of the publicans their establishments the whores pimps crimps brothel keepers and mother abbesses and their commercial properties and the peaceable tradespeople and residents of english harbour who had forced the governorgeneral to call out a company of the garrison and declare the riot act bayonets and falldown drunken stupors had ended it which brawl had placed hms proteus her people her officers and most especially her captain in extremely bad odour and lewrie had had what felt like five pounds of hide taken off his backside by both the governorgeneral and rearadmiral harvey and to make matters even worse grenville pelham was not only not expired but able to sit up take nourishment and screech like a wet parrot other than workingparties to fetch supplies the hands off the three ships in question had been banned from further shore liberty a day later the yankee merchantmen had practically been dragooned out to sea at gunpoint to carry their cargoes home and warned to give it a long think before they dared come into english harbour again less they moderated their peoples behaviour the packetbrig gaily flying her postboy flag had departed bearing pelhams boasting reports peels yes but reports and codicils and lewries several hefty sealetters to his wife caroline and his father sir hugo to his ward sophie separate long missives to his sons sewallis and hugh by way of his fathers london lodging house and to his mistress theoni and his other son solicitor and creditors lewrie could pessimistically think that keeping his breeches up and his prick to himself might just be worth it after all he would save hundreds on ink paper and postage on any more bastards avoiding wrist and finger cramp communicating with additional byblows would be he thought a collateral blessing and that monstrous frigate uss hancock had completed repairs and had returned to the caribbean though it was late in the hurricane season commanded by a spankingnew captain one malachi goodell who or so lewrie was informed on the sly by capt mcgilliveray was one of those stiffnecked and overly righteous massachusetts puritans and a newlight a methodist to boot a man of rectitude who brooked as little nonsense as that famously rigid french disciplinarian general martinet and wasnt he shot by his own troops at doesbourg in lewrie had glumly recalled no matter hes here and senior to me and randolph capt mcgilliveray had responded with equal gloom and mightily miffed our crews went on such a tear brought undyin shame on our new navy and our nation he says and theres to be no more of it whilst hes commanding thunderation goodells a boston pumpkin bad as a cotton mather hellfires in your future altar pounder he dont much hold with drink in genral and as for tuppin well i doubt any of our menll set foot ashore til next we dock at charleston and as for lettin the doxies an port wives come aboard to ease em thatll be once in a blue moon put us on notice goodell did come armed with word o th lord a conscience keeper god save us lewrie had japed he cuts his hair bowlheaded like cromwells puritans does he actually he looks more akin to moses mcgilliveray had sadly countered so wildhaired and bearded he looks like an owl in an ivy bush a long thin jack o legs is he gloom doom and piety and while youre up capm lewrie id admire a drop more o yer tasty claret if youre still offerin thankee kindly and i am captain mcgilliveray lewrie had twinkled pouring a topping refill with his own hospitable hand a good sailor though id imagine a right scaly fish from the cradle mcgilliveray had rejoined and one o th first at sea when the massachusetts committee of public safety called for ships tface your customs vessels goodells famly were smugglin untaxed goods in the large way ambitious aspirin so he might be amenable to our budding cooperation do ye think sir lewrie had slyly queried hoping against hope that their new arrival would be just as eager to score a notable newsworthy success against the french hah mcgilliveray had scoffed youd be lucky he dont make you walk the plank do ya go aboard hancock unbidden he meets you at sea alone and shiptoship hed like as not brace up and challenge ya tbattle none too fond o th british is goodell lost one fine armed brig off new bedford and had tswim ashore in his small clothes famly lost a halfdozen smugglin boats burned a sloop o war off rockport so your navy didnt take her and got captured early in spent time in the prison hulks at new york til after th peace got signed long after yorktown ended up a backhanded hero for all he tried but never won much success but he still aspires if offered a shot at the french and capturing choundas lewrie had pressed hopes suddenly dashed oh ill allow hes that eager mcgilliverary had mused ya show him a chance hell mostlike go gallopin tantwivy as hunters after th fox hes the fireeatin sort a captain hackum then lewrie had wondered hopes rising well aye i know hes irked that our piddlin lil subscription ships scored a coup whilst he was drydocked at baltimore kidnappin crewmen boston bowwows and northern yankees hold low opinion o southerners tboot goodell met john paul jones th once and was almost one o his lieutenants and hes regretted the lost opportunity ever since thunderation good as said hes anxious to tussle with th french tshow what the united states and our navy can do sounds like an enterprising fellow lewrie had inveigled with seeming admiration though perhaps a daunting one i should meet him must rather duty requires you could introduce us captain mcgilliveray make the way smooth and straight perhaps on neutral ground not here aboard proteus given captain goodells sentiments he mostliked suspect wed clap him in irons again must i beard him in his own den aboard hancock well then i must i spose but ya that curious capm lewrie mcgilliveray had chortled or are ya a glutton for punishment im under admiralty orders to treat united states navy vessels and their captains with all the respect due those deemed as in amity with his majestys government lewrie had glibly stated we share a foe and would not share a signals book did not our respective governments intend us to work together when our aims coincide your captain goodell fearsome though you depict him is the senior american naval officer in these waters so it only makes eminent good sense to become acquainted professionally i doubt knowing him would be quite as pleasureable as your own acquaintance captain mcgilliveray lewrie chummily had said trying to piss down his back to grease the wheels but still goodell and hancock are the most powerful force now about and itd be a devlish shame did we work at cross purposes well theres that mcgilliveray had casually allowed but capm goodell may have his own ideas about things and hes newcome from home so his ordersre surely fresher than mine france mightve seen sense and called off its trade war by now and wed know nought of it i shouldnt be telling you this but lewrie had confided leaning forward in his chair as mcgilliveray had lolled on the settee to make things even better toulon having perversely taken a liking to their amiable drawling visitor was on the settee too up against the good captains leg with his paws in the air and twining slowly as his chest and belly were idly caressed we strongly suspect that the french intend to move a small convoy but a richun from guadeloupe to saint domingue in the near future two perhaps three vessels laden with supplies for the rebel slaves louverture or rigaud who knows but do either of em end up holdin the high cards over tother they will start fightin again then all the ports get closed and trade be damned til the dust settles dont know who your country backs in that horse race dont care really he had lied dont know as how weve a cock in that fight either captain lewrie mcgilliveray had lied right back just after though he had revealed a bit of his nations preference perhaps his own by adding seems if those two do go at each other itll eliminate one and make the winner so weak hed may be best do those ships get there and let em fight it out and settle it once and for all guillaume choundas we are fairly sure lewrie had lied some more wondering just what it took to spur the man to further ambition is charged with their safe delivery all he has left to use for that purpose are his two corvettes what wed call threemasted sloops of war and moderately armed akin to our sixth rates twenty or twentyfour guns ninepounders mostlike french navy national sloops of war not overarmed privateers takin them bestin em in a proper seafight at odds and theyd have to fight cause choundas has twin at something or be sacked and to abandon the supply ships while saving themselvesd be the last straw so they must stand and your charmin mister peel tell ya all this did he sir capt mcgilliveray had snickered his eyes glimflashy in secret delight or twas that tottyheaded newcome pelham him o th hunt togs dont know what ye mean sir lewrie had grunted pretending total ignorance even going so far as to tuck in his chin and sull up like a bullfrog yer spies capum lewrie mcgilliverary had hooted with mirth yer foreign office or admiralty or whoever pays em spies bout as secretive as house fires th both of em peel aint your clergyman god knows he dont tutor your midshipmen so what else could he be uhm well actually uhm lewrie had flummoxed blushing for a rare once damn dont hold with spies meself mcgilliveray had quibbled dont know why not lewrie had quickly countered your partisan rangers like francis marion the swamp fox your ships namesake thomas sumter thrived on the aid of patriotic spies your esteemed general washington so peel tells me ran an intelligence network in the face of which our foreign office still stands in awe so i can tell capm goodell this mcgilliveray had asked that it came from the horses mouth so tspeak lewrie had given that a good long ponder weighing how wroth and loud pelhams howls would be of how poor jemmy peel would whimper and beat his head against the mizenmast trunk to have been frustrated by one of his wildhair whims again whisky punch wouldnt avail a second time they were onto that ploy so the screeches and expostulationsd be horrid weighted against all that though was the chance of successfully ending their collegial association when choundas was at last conquered and with a great deal of luck hed never have to deal with them ever again in this life that had taken about two ticks of his pocket watch dont see why you cant no lewrie had blithely assented well then well well well prizes and battle my my the estimable capt mcgilliveray had said beaming and rubbing his hands with relish thatd take the trick capm lewrie capm goodelld like nothin better than tbeat you toplofty britons at your own game with your own spies intelligence so you just possibly might bring him round to continuing our cooperation lewrie had posed loathe us though he may theres a good chance of it aye mcgilliveray had said it may be best did we give thunderation a dayr two tclimb down from his high horse over th riots and let me get his ear then have him aboard my ship under some pretence or tother where you just happened along with a pretence of yer own and since both of ya are aboard we dine tgether and i could call upon desmond lewrie had quickly suggested in your brief fight with the french brig by the way the lad comported himself well a credit to your ship and navy brave coolheaded and honourably sir mcgilliveray had said with great though moreformal pleasure a credit to his blood and may god let me claim in all due modesty a credit to his raisin too i should like to hear his account of it lewrie had replied with a note to his voice that expressed his growing fondness though i worry that so much undue attention paid a younker ahem from a total stranger really a foreign postcaptain and from his own uncle and captain ehm dont want his head turned or account himself so grand or singled out that it spoils him others in his mess despisin him for seeming cosseted dye see cruelty of boys all that aye children can be cruel mcgilliveray had glumly agreed some thoughtless and repeatin what their parents say some spiteful and aware o what theyre doin but had we truly cosseted him tried tkeep him from all shakespeares slings and arrows wedve done a greater harm has to stand on his own bottom someday lewrie had commented aye now mostly he was in merry pin dutiful sweet and sly round his betters but he could go cockahoop wild as all boys can too first to th top of th live oaks a fearless horseman a clever student the sort o ladd make most parents pop their buttons tve raised capt mcgilliveray had fondly recalled but there was ever the slur of injun halfbreed or red nigrah and then hed turn sombre and hawkeyed like a caged eagle his gaze focussed out ten mile or better like he was bout ready tspread wings and go someplace finer but youd be delighted tknow capm lewrie your son desmond gave as good or better than he got though my dear martha was put to jobs despair tmend his clothin whenever he came home all skinned and bloodied but ya shouldve seen tother lad hed whipped til they learned hed take no sauce off em they got older it got more subtle o course had to for we made certain he had th very best trainin with sword and pistol as any young gentleman should til he was known as a dead shot and able blade the code duello makes for careful courteous gentlemen lewrie had said with a knowing snicker and circumspect behaviour dont it just mcgilliveray had beamed back it never came to such once he and his peers entered their tweens no twas more a matter o snubbin of few invitations to social occasions unless it was the whole famly invited young ladies were warned he wasnt a suitable match no matter how gentlemanly he was how welleducated and mannerly not tbrag capm lewrie but were a clan o substantial means so never doubt that the boy had the best of evrything and stood second to none when it came time to gussy up for church or grand occasions cept when he came home from play or the hunt lookin as if hed wallowed like the prodigal son with the pigs that is captain mcgilliveray had chortled slapping his knee in a daddys reverie a sort of reverie that lewrie so much at sea but for a few rare years on halfpay tween the wars could but dimly understand he hadnt been there for the outrageous exasperating tomfoolery of his sons hugh or sewallis had no parental tales to share about his precocious girlchild charlotte except for distant letters or giggly remembrances he heard from caroline or theoni now months or years after the deeds were done once he crossed his own doorsill lifes hard on poor orphans lewrie had said squirming with embarrassment embarrassed too to sound so conventionally pious first year or so of my life i thought was one i ought to know my dear sir id no idea long story lewrie had said wincing and squirming some more never knew my mother father late to the ball til he discovered me and took me in two wars past lewrie had harumphed embarrassed like any proper english gentleman to speak too openly of himself pray god though you had one parent who cared enough to take you in and raise you right mcgilliveray had rejoined earnestly and piously restore to you your proper birthright mcgilliveray never did quite fathom why the estimable captain alan lewrie rn hoicked up such a snortful bark of amusement so the lad was more than happy to come away with you and take the sailors life lewrie had quickly asked in order to cover his droll musing on what a loving and caring father sir hugo had really been to lay public claim upon him or the whys of his claiming somewhere on those far horizons o his capt mcgilliveray had agreed coldshouldered as he was twouldve been that or ride away cross the high mountains among his mothers lands has an itchy foot desmond does and though i doubt he gave it much consideration some few years of honourable public service in the uniform of his countrys navy wouldnt go amiss either we reckoned send him to england for further schoolin where no oned know him as halfmuskogee right off was another possibility where even did they learn of his birthright bein exotic might be a help not a hindrance no id suspect that desmond did consider it lewrie replied to take his countrys colours in her time of need to wear uniform and face danger even crave it he had exclaimed rising to fill their glasses one more time then pace even to dream of gaining his commission of coming home one of a few a rare breed a sea officer with a sword on his hip not a trainees dirk an officer and a gentleman in an honourable gentlemanly and selfless profession id imagine that glorious return figured prominently in his fantasies to tweak every tormentors nose out of joint put em all to shame stop the wagging tongues and make all those highnosed young misses go green with regret they ever snubbed him perhaps even make one of em the one he desired forlorn and unrequited all his misrable tween years see him in a sudden and diff rent light we never really thought capt mcgilliveray had begun but broke off before bowing his head and beaming i now strongly feel that you have the right of it sir and are possessed of keen insight into the hearts of young lads might as well captain mcgilliveray lewrie had brushed off with a twinkle to his toplights in thanks for the rare compliment i once was one and may still be god knows theres moren a few whove chid me to grow up so lewrie had chuckled seating himself near his guest you do not think that my intrusive favouritism will do him lasting harm i do not sir you are after all his true father and a man he should know and learn from hes starved for repudiation now that you state things as you have and speak to his hopes and dreams as his captain i cannot dote on him but you sir well dote away and you will introduce me to your ominous captain goodell as soon as you may discover to him the ah temptation which our mutual foe choundas will soon put before him i shall indeed sir mcgilliveray had solemnly promised more i cannot in good conscience ask sir lewrie had said back turning solemnly grandiose as well for which i am eternally in your debt for so much in so many things chapter twentyeight what onerous task lieutenant de vaisseau jules hainaut had been given to scour the windwards and the spanish main in search of those two absent corvettes had barely gotten underway when like a pair of old shoes beneath the bedstead la resolue and le gascon had suddenly heaved up over the souwest horizon not five dawns since his sailing sullenly dragging in their wakes a lone dowdy threemasted merchant ship with a badly faded american gridiron flag hung beneath a much brighter and larger tricolour to signify her new ownership an hour later after making their private numbers to each other all four ships were hoveto on a gently heaving and sunglittered sea and hainaut was proudly taking his first salute as the commander of a warship being welcomed aboard another man o war despite the liberte egalite and fraternite the republic presented to the world the french navy put a bit more stock in the old customs than the directory in paris would have preferred swords swirled like mercury droplets polished st etienne arsenal muskets were slapped about to present arms and wellblacked naval infantry boots stamped on pale sanded decks in creditable precision sailors stood facing the entryport doffing redwoolstocking liberty caps or tarred straw hats with wide brims as hainaut doffed his egretplumed giltlaced bicorne hat to them and stepped aboard the starboard gangway to the surprise of a fair number of the watch officers and midshipmen of le gascon youve come up in the world lieutenant hainaut capt griot the senior officer of the pair of corvettes glumly commented with a ship of your own so soon how delightful for you i am sure and you have come south from guadeloupe why exactly the older breton asked sucking on his teeth for the last bits of his interrupted meal capitaine choundas sent me in search of you msieur hainaut archly replied knowing just where he stood in the doughty griots estimation he has desperate need of you both as quickly as you can be off basseterre i am charged to inform you that griot silenced him with a subtle finger upon his lips then he pointed overside at capt macphersons gig which was just coming near the entryport we will speak of this later below griot said in a faint mutter from the side of his mouth a disaster the expatriate scot macpherson grunted a few minutes later in the privacy of capt griots greatcabins all the officers and men of both raiders gone poor poor pelletier and digne there has been no word of their fates from the british or the americans who took them none came before i sailed msieur hainaut sadly told him as he savoured a grudgingly given glass of wine his eyes surreptitiously evaluating griots taste in furnishings and estimating the depths of his purse la vigilante sank very quickly after a single broadside so we can only hope msieur le capitaine worse though capt griot quickly got to the larger point of things we very well may be in a declared war with the americans and they so you report lieutenant hainaut openly sail allied with the bloodies in spite of that hainaut le hi the capitaine means to press on with the convoy to saint domingue worse than disaster capitaine macpherson hainaut said with his nose in the air it was betrayal treason a ring of spies which capitaine choundas even now is rooting out that was how the bloodies knew when le bouclier would be at her weakest how the first munitions ship was lost the same day and a guard schooner was lost how one of commissaire hugues rich merchant vessels was intercepted mere hours after her sailing and so capitaine choundas believes the bloodies and the amis certainly knew to intercept our prizes and raiders hugues too griot barked jadedly amused serves the greedy salaud right maybe teach him to stop acting like a pirate their prime source of information was etienne de gougne lt hainaut spat then sat back to relish how they took that our master has arrested him there is a new official from france who will likely arrest commissaire hugues too once they get a look at his books bon griot quite joyfully snarled couldnt happen to a better person with the spy ring broken our master is certain that a convoy can make it to saint domingue to jacmel hainaut loftily further informed them more than happy to be the font of all intelligence a letter came from general hedouville hes made his choice and he now will back the mulatto rigaud british agents have been on the island courting both factions so the convoy is urgent before the bloodies can put one together with more and better bribes messieurs that diable lewrie isnt the only british ship at sea griot grumbled no matter that our efficient superior lops off the heads of spies and traitors by the tumbrilload there are other watchers more warships that keep a distant blockade than that that proteus and the fastest most direct passage to jacmel is simply stiff with british ships macpherson cagily muttered stroking his six days growth of beard american ships reported at the north end of dominica on our way antigua nevis and saint kitts barbuda the british virgins and frigates from their jamaica squadron this late in storm season their ships of the line return from halifax freeing lesser ships from close patrolling to range out far afield and every one delighted to be so freed and starving for prize money and action aussi capt griot chimed in his voice chiming as glum as funeral bells without more ships as escort well there is my mohican hainaut gently pointed out to them and now that our master is temporarily in charge of the privateers that commissaire hugues directed hainauts face stung as both of those tarry captains laughed in derisive glee at his expense for being so callow where was all their vaunted elan their esprit he wondered as he was forced to sit and take it they the handpicked master captains carefully chosen from among the hundreds whom choundas could have requested doubted that such a thing could be done even if the british no longer knew when a convoy departed why they even sounded disloyal to le maitre whod made them promoted them gotten them to sea when those hundreds he had not chosen still languished ashore without ships or swung idle in home ports for fear of blockading british fleets and squadrons privateers are cowardly trash capt macpherson scoffed overly cautious mercenaries at best drunken pirates at worst why most of ours arent even french the gutter sweepings of the americas there is another large schooner the equal of mine which was taken by la vigilante and lieutenant pelletier messieurs lt hainaut told them smugly proud of the success of his short raiding cruise in comparison to theirs la chippewa could be commissioned quickly given additional guns and added to the escort shes ready for sea and manned by whom capt griot snapped not even attempting to hide the sneer he shared with capt macpherson desplans sailors were lost with houdon and pelletier we have run out of officers were short of seasoned midshipmen to make acting officers and those few left are cripples sick or incompetent to man your own schooner lieutenant hainaut didnt capitaine choundas scrape the bottom of the barrel do you not carry privateersmen aboard bribed by extra pay to sign navy articles just for a few months not unlimited service there are a few mostly able seamen and a gunner or two hainaut had to admit reddening and crossing his legs defensively as i suspected griot grunted to crew another escort ship means weakening ours macpherson added using our men to brace up shirkers incompetents and inexperienced fools how long would they have to work up together two days it takes months to season a crew to competency no no your suggested armed schooner would be no help perhaps even a hindrance our strength would be diluted making our corvettes less capable and wed all be in the soup messieurs hainaut spluttered ready to glower and sneer at those wellsalted but fainthearted captains before remembering he no longer could swagger or speak in his old master le hideuxs stead surely there is something that we may do to get the convoy through he wheedled pray for a gale of wind and a spell of bad weather in which a convoy may hide capt macpherson piously intoned almost making the sign of the cross on his breast the british would not expect that and keep them in port or more concerned with their own survival griot contributed something we can do well oui our ships will crack on for basseterre quick as we can you lieutenant will take charge of guarding our slower prize ship and make for habour as quick as you can shes richly and deeply laden gosse you lose her or cost us a sou of her value and god help you hein i understand msieur hainaut crisply responded as a junior should though seething to be called gossea youngster hainaut promised himself to remember that slight and somehow someday find a way to make that shitarsed breton oaf pay for it clumpswishtickclumpswishtick guillaume choundas took a deep breath of clean air on the ramparts of fort fleur depee after the long exhausting climb from its cells far below ground next to its magazines and powder rooms even with victor hugues suspended from his office choundas could not order things to suit him hugues was gaoled in relative comfort in his own quarters under honourable arrest his loyal staff smug in their graft and greed continued much as they had before expecting hugues to be exonerated and freed after the new man desfourneaux had received the proper emolument so an office for choundas was still impossible and prisoners were never put in chambers with easy access which amounted to easy egress or contact with coconspirators so there would be no chance to whip up matching stories or let those already caught escape besides the noises that those under rigourous interrogation made disturbed the digestion and a frenchman could never risk such harm to le digestif choundas had barely gotten his wind back and ached like sin in his overworked good leg and bad braced one when his weary leaning on the parapet was interrupted by the brisk arrival of that officious pompous prig desfourneaux who came clattering up the stone stairs in his colourful waist sash costly sword and belt and that ridiculous hat of his bound with another heavily tasseled tricolore sash for a band and redwhiteblue plumes jutting upward to mark him as one of the directorys own your work goes slowly capitaine desfourneaux asked him with a faint whinny slowly yes citizen and yours choundas asked in return oh well have him in the end desfourneaux idly vowed waving a hand as if shooing the everpresent island flies paris has enough reason to recall citizen hugues already but to profit so massively from the execution of ones proper duties the directory is most upset that the infernal man took our reasonable edicts regarding the control and identity of neutral merchant shippers who might aid those invidious british so literally his overzealous prosecution at regulation of that trade he turned into a vicious guerre du course and an unfortunate uhm diplomatic incident now it looks as if the americans have rewarded our gracious aid to their revolution with typical anglosaxon churlishness and become british allies in open war if your young officers report may be credited one would expect formal declaration of war sent here by a truce ship first but those rustics may not understand how nations are supposed to deal with each other i fear huguess greed and zeal caused another war one which our hardpressed republic cannot afford then he should lose his head choundas decided aloud feeling uncharitable to both hugues and desfourneaux and averse to pleasantly idle palaver and my suggestions citizen what of them withdrawing letters of marque and reprisal from all but french owners and masters yes at once desfourneaux said nodding as if a committee decision was instantly enforceable law in every port in the caribbean no matter how farflung as if those just shy of piratical endeavours would cease their depredations when they heard the news a snarl at desfourneauxs idiocy escaped choundass lips conscripting the rest into the navy though arming and training a whole squadron of small ships under your command good citizen desfourneaux maundered on making a moue might be too expensive for now marvelously effective though they might prove under your wellfamed and experienced leadership msieur capitaine ha ha not all then merely the best dozen or so choundas pressed though hed be damned if he would plead or bargain well perhaps two or three more for now desfourneaux said as he shrugged paris sent me to curtail huguess war on commerce fearing his excesses would lead to war with the americans the privateers will then be idle in need of employment if i can offer the best the largest and bestarmed naval commissions choundas insisted it will keep them from real piracy which requires naval pay which france cannot afford msieur desfourneaux quickly told him i will of course write paris to ask for a proper squadron be sent to these waters a real fleet capable of facing the british possibly the americans too to guard guadeloupe and saint domingue against invasion then there will be a place for a man such as yourself as commodore of the small ship flotilla such a position could make you an admiral hein as long as nothing ah unfortunate occured in the meantime desfourneaux slyly added as long as you executed your present duties so well until their arrival that i could recommend you choundas bristled with resentment was the bastard hinting at a bribe or was he about to propose another onerous thankless chore for him to perform just like the aristos had trotted him about the world like the donkey forever chasing the dangled carrot though desfourneaux wore his neckstock and shirt collars loose and open like a good republican or the revolutionaries of the bastilles storming what was he but a canting shopkeeper a jumpedup attorney mimicking a real zealot sent to salvage the mess made by governmental idiocy what did you have in mind citizen choundas gravelled to fulfill general hedouvilles demand for the convoy to saint domingue capitaine desfourneaux smoothly replied quickly the munition ships are ready to sail and my corvettes will be here perhaps within days choundas promised storm season is nearly over and the cooler winds of winter will speed them along once they depart i am more than ready to fulfill the generals demand so your spy who flourished undetected for so long almost in your very pocket capitaine desfourneaux interrupted with a snarky little sharks grin shedding his airy unconcern and amiability he has confessed he has named others your probes yield results not yet choundas said with a frustrated grunt through gritted teeth the little traitors resistance is surprising coming from a meek worm such as he i am unable to employ my usual techniques you see choundas said raising his remaining good hand and people in huguess employ are so oafish that de gougne would perish under their clumsy brutality before he could begin to break i have arrested all the servants as many suspicious coastal dwellers and fishermen as we could but with so little help it may be weeks before i get round to putting the question to them all you see what do the bloodies say desfourneaux smirked that its a poor workman who blames his tools your clerk had but a few hours at best between your opening general hedouvilles letter and his arrest no youve thrown in gaol half the poor fishermen and regular visiting tradesmen to your mansion all your house servants patrols prowl the shores and the docks odds are you caught those whod pass messages odds are your de gougne never had a chance to pass on his discovery assuming hes a spy in the first place hmm desfourneaux slyly suggested de gougne well a rather large black mark to be expunged from your records capitaine if he truly is employed by the british you agree with my assessment then most of what you say is true citizen choundas was forced to admit though the letter from fleury the british agents slip you are sanguine then that the convoy may sail without risk of betrayal desfourneaux pressed come come give me odds that the munitions will reach saint domingue he prissily requested uhm nine or ten to one against interception choundas grudgingly had to say after a long irate fuming with three ships to escort two and since you yourself admit that the back of the spy ring is at least severely hampered if not broken desfourneaux said with an expansive grin there is no reason why you could not take command of the enterprise and personally see it through before completing any investigations here on guadeloupe after your triumphant return but of course citizen i choundas blustered insulted and angered and mightily taken aback both such a coup would go a long way to excuse your harbouring of a possible spy and in expunging what so far has been a long and sad string of failures that your seeming lack of attention concerning your own staff allowed hein desfourneaux said with a leer such an act of personal responsibility and daring might even allay the niggling suspicion that your clerk was not the only person on your staff covertly corresponding with the british or their local informers moi choundas thundered you suspect me after all ive done all ive suffered from the goddamned british is this the way i am to be repaid for my loyalty to the revolution to the republic and to france how dare you you tawdry tartedup little slug you wish me to command the convoy good i will and bedamned to you run the same risk as your followers my dear choundas prove by your being there that it will get through desfourneaux answered lazing at sublime ease against the parapet stones as if choundas was no threat to him his howling rage just a passing gust of wind that is all i ask though we will have a little talk about your insulting manners when you return hein too many years of operating on a roving commission with too free a hand in the disordered early years of our revolution has made you incapable of proper subordination nestce pas perhaps a few weeks at sea will give you time for muchneeded introspection bah choundas snarled raising his walkingstick you hard as it was for him to do he swallowed his ire and lowered his hand knowing that desfourneaux was more dangerous than he seemed that hugues could have company on his way home in irons you see dear capitaine you begin to learn circumspection and manners already desfourneaux gleefully pointed out departing chapter twentynine welcome aboard captain lewrie sir lieutenant seabright said after lewrie had doffed his hat to the assembled crew on sumters deck and plopped it back on his head captain macgilliveray has been expecting you and is waitin aft he added offering his hand with a grin struggling to split open his face making lewrie wonder what he thought of getting introduced to capt malachi thunderation goodell lewrie cocked a brow at him in query as they stood close okracoke sir lt seabright whispered sniggering and about to bust heard o that have ye lewrie whispered back with a careful grin of his own evidently the yankees had gotten wind of mr peels questions ashorehe hadnt been in the riotand the discovery of how completely the foppish mr pelham had been gulled despite misgivings that fellow americans were in the pay of the french it was proof positive that lofty british aristocracy the oppressive mother country in general was both heels short of a whole loaf sorry sir does it cause you any harm but ya must admit it s droll lt seabright snickered ah mister mcgilliveray do you escort captain lewrie aft to the captains cabins aye aye sir desmond mcgilliveray piped up stepping forward from his deferential place beside the clutch of us marines aquiver with expectation welcome aboard sir he stated face abeam thankee kindly uhm mister mcgilliveray lewrie answered tipping the lad a sly wink and smiling back ive ah taken the liberty of fetching off a few items which might prove instructive for your nautical education lewrie said swinging a british marines issue haversack forward from off his right hip and shoulder some books of mine you may find useful my first copy of falconers marine dictionary the edition sorry but it cant have changed that much when ashore i did discover an edition of the atlantic mercury which depicts every pertinent feature of the north american coasts and harbours so you dont run aground more than once in your career dye see uhm he had also thrown in his secondbest set of nautical instruments parallel rules dividers and such a shorebought pencil case folding nibknife and a full dozen virgin wooden pencils to boot and a small block of brazilian gum eraser desmonds face glowed as he opened the stained and bedraggled falconers and read the inscription in the inside cover alan lewrie his book jan like hell its yours thank you desmond gushed ready to tear up quickly adding father in the faintest of whispers in such a manner that lewrie was like to cough choke and spring a leak as well he put the book back in the haversack and slung it over his shoulder i found something i thought you might like when we boarded our foe too sir desmond announced a small relict of taking a french man o war well not such a big foe but but tis early days lewrie assured him who knows what a week might bring next year uhm we mustnt keep your uncle and captain waiting though or captain goodell as forbidding as they say is he lewrie asked with an expectant grimace that and more sir desmond answered rolling his eyes and looking as if did naval custom and usage allow he might fan himself well lets get on with it then lead on young sir ill fetch your present soon as youre aft and below sir thatd be excellent thankee and for your thoughtfulness he told his bastard son hoping that pilfering valuables out of a prizeship didnt run in the family blood recalling a hidden chest of gold aboard a french ship from which he had borrowed a considerable sum whilst in temporary command of her in the last war though i could use money if hes offerin lewrie thought captain malachi goodell was indeed forbidding and did resemble an owl in an ivy bush as capt mcgilliveray had said great fierce glowing eyes flew open as soon as lewrie was admitted to the greatcabins then slitted in panthery study as he had himself a good looksee a long curving beaklike raptors nose jutted from the thatch of a sleek plump beard lewrie assumed that capt goodell had teeth and lips under there somewhere though they were hard to espy goodell was as tall and straight as a musket stood on end and just about that lean big hands flexed as hairybacked as his chin big feet clumped on the deck in awkward pique at the sight of their british interloper legs encased in unadorned wellblacked boots as tall as a dragoonsthough with the usual kneeflaps cut off so thou art the british captain alan lewrie goodell rasped of whom of late so much has been related to me sir i am sir and honoured tmake your acquaintance lewrie pleasantly purred back even if he did feel the nutmegs in his groin pucker and tuck up at the sight and sound of that ominous worthy captain mcgilliveray told me thee might come aboard whilst i was here captain lewrie goodell grumbled though surely he hath told thee of my lack of fondness for the british captain mcgilliveray discovered to me your experiences in the last war captain aye lewrie replied for which i can but offer a poor and unofficial apology times change however circumstances are different and one may hope old grudges are set aside in the face of the new situation which obtains so we may president adams and our navy secretary mister stoddert whom i hold to be otherwise sensible men order me to share signals with thee and fodder off thy dockyards and chandleries to cooperate capt goodell rumbled owleyes asquint and teeth bared turning cooperate into an epithet but not to take hands with thy royal navy openly captains randolph and mcgilliveray have already hove up a cable shy of open alliance sir for which inconsiderate actions i have chastised them now here thee cometh with yet another beguiling fruit from off the tree of wickedness to tempt me as the serpent tempted eve as eve corrupted adam sir he growled in righteous indignation to present you with a chance to use your hancock in the way she was intended sir lewrie calmly rejoined feet apart and hands behind his back he tried on a grin and a casual tone one would assume by now youve shifted hancocks battery since last i was aboard her and lightened her of endweight captain kershaw had burdened her with too many guns so freed she must represent the very best your nation may field in terms of speed and weight of metal so shalt never tell thee what armament a ship of the united states navy bears sir goodell barked tilting his head back and looking down his nose so much for tarry yarnin twixt professionals lewrie thought wincing the brute loves me like satan loves holy water twentyfour pounders on her lower deck twelves above lewrie surmised aloud perhaps even long twelves as chase guns none of which signify captain goodell you may black em with paint cruise about and show the flag even daunt the odd french privateer then plod home with a trade convoy when your biscuit and beer give out or you could black em with powder smoke and eliminate any present or future threat to americanflagged vessels in the caribbean and hamstring the rebellious slave armies of saint domingue for lack of arms whatever designs the united states has on that half of hispaniola would be furthered as well sir he baldly stated and unwittingly playing catspaw to further british designs on that benighted isle sir no never goodell spat back for all of hispaniola i dont give a tinkers fig lewrie honestly told him though doubting that the prim goodell would care for him saying damn so thou sayest sir though thy spies yet scheme to seize it goodell accused aye they do sir lewrie admitted without a qualm and much joy may they have in the doing it keeps them occupied and gives the crown the impression theyre earnin their pay but we both know that the tasks a bootless endeavour much the same could be said for your agents too louverture rigaud some ambitious black general no one suspects none of emll ever trust whites tdeal fair your ships and ours may someday trade there but thatll be all well do cause the black rebels will fight tooth and claw to the last drop of white blood to stay independent and unenslaved we took our shot and lost an hundred thousand men britain wont try again and i doubt that americad spend her soldiers lives that prodigal either speak to your consuls your spies on saint domingue theyll say the same my country does not spy i tell thee goodell snapped moses and his generals did lewrie said tongueincheek as they entered the promised land sir washington did every thunderation capt goodell roared clapping his hands aft of his back and stomping about to give lewrie his insulted back infuriating base cynicism pah idolatrous mockery i am all that and more sir lewrie cheerfully confessed to him ask mister grenville pelham or mister james peel theyll give you chapter and verse our spies sir the ones i know of i care not does saint domingue go poof like sodom and gomorrah and no matter what sealed orders you have from your esteemed mister stoddert sooner or later youll come to the same conclusion what counts in the end is keepin all this doubledealin muck off our escutcheons and doing the honourable thing in our nations names goodell whirled about to face him eyes blared deep in his overhanging hair and cheekhigh thatch this time flatly astonished as if someone had tweaked noah on his buttocks thou just up and names thy schemers captain lewrie goodell hissed goggling surely thou art like no british officer its been my sorrow to experience why dost thou do so sir he demanded blieve me sir you aint the first ever accused me o bein diffrent lewrie said with a selfdeprecating chuckle as to why its cause the prize they seek is fiddlesticks end when the biggest threat is guillaume choundas his warships and his convoy and do you stop his business stead o me i care not a whit captain mcgilliverays told you of him sir of his utter depraved vileness his penchant for torture his prefrence for childr hisst capt goodell snapped raising a hand as if to ward off the devil himself do not i conjure thee sully great jehovahs own sweet air with talk of such unnatural abominations sir sorry but thats what he is sir lewrie said admonished foetid spawn of satan goodell ominously growled is what he is oh that noble france could fall under the sway of such evil men deluded first by wicked popery and despoiled second by those spiteful of even mistaken creeds now we see the rotten fruits of a tyrannical catholicism for what it truly is where its vaunting pomp and mindless rituals lead to the very rim of hells bottomless pit now they besmirch the sweetest words of all i say liberty freedom and democracy wrested from the cruel grasp of an oppressive despot from the maw of mammon the very bedrock of our new nation the best hope for mankind in all the world is sullied and become accursed is become a stink in the nostrils of those whod yearn to emulate us all due to the grievous excesses and bloodyhanded terrors of a revolution betrayed its finest sentiments satanically twisted into a lust for conquest and despotism in the name of the people for man not god its pure authors slain on the altar of reason but not faith capt goodell ranted his voice rising as did his bile arms flogging the air as he angrily paced mcgilliverays greatcabins like a leaping methodist preacher at a welsh revival meeting lewrie was when pressed to it officially a congregant of the church of england hence leery of too much enthusiasm mcgilliveray was from its offshoot what the yankees had professed since their new book of common prayer of as episcopalian in essence the church of england minus king or archbishop of canterbury as defender or final arbiter of the faith both looked glumly at each other fearing that once launched the estimable capt goodell might flail and blather on til the second dog watch amen sir lewrie declared hoping it might cut him short a sudden rapping on the greatcabin doors facing the gundeck provided a better reason for pause though a lootenant adair f om th proteus frigate sir the yankee marine sentry called in properly stiffbacked but with a taint of a sly dubiousness to his voice too my pardons gentlemen lewrie said with a frustrated frown on his phyz just when goodell had sounded like he was haranguing himself into some sort of decision and now thisl aye mister adair he snapped tromping forrud as if to say this had better be good beg pardon captain but weve received an urgent query sir the immaculate mr adair said in a soft shy voice little louder than a confidential whisper from the prize court ashore captain sir rather embarassin really the prize we left at dominica dye see it uhm seems to have gone missing captain it isnt there any longer what lewrie all but shrieked mine thats hey he flummoxed mindful of a righteous glare astern of where he stood he crooked a finger to draw lt adair even closer a few more guarded steps nearer capt mcgilliverays chartspace the revelation was too shameful for even the cockroaches to hear whatthebloodyhelldyemean its gone he hissed almost in adairs shelllike ear the antigua court sent word to the dominica office at roseau to fetch her off to english harbour to be valuated sir adair said all but wringing his hands no matter that it wasnt his fault but shed already sailed sir the roseau office thought shed been sentfor two days ago their letter stated that quartermasters mate jugg came ashore said that midshipman burns and the bosuns mate mister towpenny had got orders to sail here so they let em clear harbour sir and jugg lewrie muttered as if gutpunched that motherless damned ingrate whyd i ever trust him with a ropeend i damn back aboard proteus mister adair and tell mister langlie hes tget her hove in to short stays were off soon as i can return myself a wife and child on where was it barbados sure as fate thatll be where hes bound after that who knows now hes aship with a rich cargo tsell go mister adair be off with you aye aye sir who else had been in the harbour watch hed left behind to see to the prize lewrie asked himself purpling with fury at the embarrassment and dread of monetary loss in equal measure what loss to his reputation well that didnt bear thinking about without a bottle of brandy near to hand willie toffett another hand hed pressed off a yankee smuggler in the danish virgins hed seemed innocent harmless and easygoing had jugg led him by the nose into folly jugg damn him hed trusted and promoted him had let him have the guinea joining bounty so he could send it as a noteofhand to his alleged wife and child on barbados with the ship hed lost midshipman burns too who was even duller and stupider than he looked but to lose an anchored ship in a friendly harbour and mister towpenny the wily and experienced bosuns mate surely hed have stayed loyal and awake if burns had not something the matter captain lewrie mcgilliveray enquired sounding solicitous bad news is it sir hah lewrie barked startled from his sudden funk why no naught at all captain mcgilliveray news of a certainy for good or ill well hate to seem ungracious but i must be off cant dine as i wished captain goodell happy to have made your acquaintance sorry we could not have spoken further he said coming aft to fetch his hat do consider all i said though pray perhaps when i come back we may discuss our mutual interests and discover a way to he hedged wishing to flee before word of shameful foolishness came offshore to the americans return good sir mcgilliveray pressed surprised you are to sea capm lewrie fear i am sir lewrie told him reddening small chore that sort o thing salutations and adieu gentlemen til next we meet lewrie sketched out an abbreviated bow in conge with a hasty sweep of his hat then turned his back on them and almost sprinted to sumter starboard gangways and entryport thanking god that andrews his coxn had already been alerted and was standing by the oarsmen of his gig already drawn from their yarning with the american sailors and waiting for him overside captain captain lewrie sir a tremulous voice froze him in his frenzied tracks though desmond had been aft on the quarterdeck and had scampered forward at the first sign of scurry youre going before dinner sir his newfound son sounded forlorn and abandoned and for the life of him lewrie couldnt depart and disabuse him was there a kings ransom in the offing i fear duty calls young sir lewrie sorrowfully said hoping the lad wouldnt be too hurt by his haste though desmonds face was clouding up with the quick grief of a broken promise a dashed hope my mister adair brought me urgent news which i must act upon quick as you can say jack ketch i did hope we could dine together but i understand sir really desmond swore though his protestation sounded thin time and tide he added with a brave smile and a wise shrug old navy sayin growl ye may but go ye must lewrie told him stepping closer once im back i promise ill make up for it a whole day ashore the two of us does your uncle captain mcgilliveray allow swear cross my heart an hope tdie and how many promises of that sort had he made to sewallis and hugh to little charlotte and caroline in his time and how many had he broken when admiralty called how many vows had desmond heard in his short time on earth too from those he wished to trust cant leave without your present desmond muttered playing up manful and game he pushed forward a hatbox that had seen better days i hope you like it fath sir you will take it with you but of course lewrie exclaimed taking the battered hatbox from him and feeling something inside shift its balance now what in the world do we have here i wonder he teasingly cajoled forced to kneel so he could remove the lid with desmond squatting down aside him and taking the lid for a moment my word now aint he the handsome one lewrie congratulated feeling anything but thankful christ whatll i do with thisun lewrie asked himself aghast for inside the hatbox was a stripling kitten whitefurred in the main with a grey tail and nose two large dark grey smudges above his eyes and twixt his ears two huge impish palegreen eyes peered up at him goggling in wonder as its head bobbed and cocked half from curiosity and half from catlingclumsy imbalance the kitten uttered a wee shrill but loud meek and a shutmouthed little trill gawd toulonll kill him lewrie sadly thought he wont last a dog watch all that white fur too there go my uniforms play up gladsome fool the poor lad meant well damned if he isnt almost toulons exact opposite white where that little scamps black and all what a thoughtful gift desmond my boy most thoughtful indeed he gushed most insincerely as he reached into the hatbox and lifted the kitten out after we boarded the french brig o war i saw him cowering and mewing on her boattier beams desmond happily babbled under a smashedup cutter and how he survived our broadsides i cant rightly say fa sir i took one step in his direction and he just dashed to me and almost clawed his way up my boot and breeches then started in to purring like hed bust soon as i took hold of him oh he s just as smart and clever as a ladys bonnet he is father he took to bed in midshipman alstons hatbox so i had to buy it off him ill recompense you for no twas his oldun and part of the gift since hes so fond of it desmond objected and the little fellows already figured out the right place to make isnt that clever well you give any of em a nice box o sand or dirt a little privacy and thats prettymuch bred in the bone lewrie chuckled as the kitten dug his claws into the giltlaced lapel of his dress coat and made loud sniffing noises and purring fit to bust dont know how toulond like a playmate hes set in his ways but im sure theyll take to each other sooner or later he silently hoped please jesus you like him sir desmond said as lewrie pried the kitten off his coat and gently set him back in the hatbox he put the cover on and he and lewrie stood back up absolutely delighted lewrie lied most earnestly you could not have bought a better were you rich as king midas youre a grand young lad desmond im proud of you for being so quick aboard your foe your uncle tells me youre shaping mainwell as a gentlemanintraining though more attention to your studiesd not go amiss he said playfully making as if to tweak the boys nose he hadnt a clue about desmond as a scholar but such flummerous words always seemed to hit near the mark where midshipmen and boys were concerned proud of your thoughtfulness too and your generosity i call him snowflake desmond proudly imparted well early days he might grow up tbe big as toulon and who ever heard of a champion twostone ramcat named snowflake hey lewrie chortled then softened in dread of hurting the lads feelings mean tsay ye cant insult a proud willful creature with a wrong name have to observe for a time before the apt name comes might end up a smudge a scamp or a rascal you never can tell well i must go son thankee again and soon as im back youll come aboard and dine with me and see how little noname fares right i shall look forward to it father the lad replied with a covert wink before they did their appropriate goodbyes dictated by society and naval etiquette another bloody cat lewrie told himself settling in the sternsheets of his gig with the hatbox in his lap first of a curmudgeons round dozen like poor old captain lilycrop back in christ just spare me still the boy meant well by it im sure he did chapter thirty hms proteus was driven like jehu had driven his chariot sails set all to the royals staysls

and the rarely employed spritsl beneath her plunging jibboom and bowsprit had been spread now stiff with the furious boil and bluster of salt spray flung up from the cutwater and the frigates fine entry driven though he was lewrie did take time to thank proteuss builders the nicholson yards at frindsbury on the medway for frenchifying her and improving on the numerous thames class frigates what he knew about ship design could fill a thimble admittedly and the new science of hydraulics as the learned halfenglish halfswede director of the royal dockyards at karlskrona fredrick af chapman wrote of it was quite beyond him all he knew was that proteus was swift his surgeons mate the scholarly french emigre mr durant once a universitytrained physician before fleeing the terror in france had

sacrificing beaminess and storage capacity surrendering just a bit of forward buoyancy rising straighter and more vertically near her stem pieces to narrow her lowest forefoot and entry her planking

give frenchheld guadeloupe a wide berth this time and with the wind fine on her larboard quarter she was making nearly eleven and a half knots still battering her way against those treacly glittering seas not as fast as the trades blew but close so that hands on deck could get a bit of cooling respite from the afternoon heat and savour the impatient keen and hum of the trades in the rigging the

its rim and madly scrambling to get out for the fifth time trilling and mousesqueaking toulon stood a foot or so aloof of the box with his tail bottled up ears laid flat his back arched and his fur stood on end his comment to such mediations was a long wrathful moaning followed by a fangbaring hiss of equal duration punctuated by a spit and a testy choplicking no name far from being daunted by such a welcome seemed to regard toulons action as a delightful rareeshow and an invitation to play christ almighty now lewrie sighed damme i know he meant well but aye mister grace mister langlies duty sir and im to tell you that the american squadron seems to be astern of us sailing on our same course oh hell this could get embarrassing lewrie muttered contemplating what a horselaugh the yankee doodles would have when they got wind of why hed dashed out of english harbour so frantically aspinall er im going on deck do you try to keep the littlun alive til i return aye sir aspinall replied though regarding such a herculean task with a dubious much putupon expression here toulon heres yer toey play chase with yer favrite toey he dangled a muchclawed and gnawed red wool ball on a length of spun yarn a toy that usually sent toulon into transports of joy and could be counted on for a halfhour of energetic distraction today it elicited an edgy hissspit and several crocodile swishes from his bristledup tail before he returned to his death watch sure its the yankees mister langlie lewrie asked once on the quarterdeck the lookouts familiar with their appearance sir we believe so aye lt langlie replied as they both raised telescopes to study the tiny slivers of sail that barely peeked above the horizon they are ten miles or so astern of us their royals or tgallants in view perhaps a sliver of the lead ships upper topsls now and then when the sea lifts both of us together making up to us lewrie asked mentally crossing his fingers but slowly sir sumter for so the lookout supposes her to be leads them they must have cleared harbour not two hours after we did well damn lewrie grumbled swift as theyve proved in past theyll mostlike be abeam of us by sunset ill have to dine em in and never be able tlive it down we sailed so quickly they must imagine im after choundas and his convoy and want a piece of the action damnnation lewrie gloomily speculated that he could just sail the brig o war uss oglethorpe under and might elude the threemasted sumter as well but hancock and her humourless master goodell he hadnt a hope in hell of outfooting her with her taller masts and overlong spars her larger spread of canvas and her impressive length of keel once she got the bone in her teeth uss hancock could outrun terns do we not light the taffrail lanthorns nor show any binnacle lights we mask all the stern windows and your gunroom and i dine in the dark lewrie hopefully said then add a radical change of course say due west just after full nightfall they might stay on their present heading which would place them ahead of us to the suthrd sir lt langlie glumly commented and sure wed stumble over them within the week and then whatd we say sorry own up that were a pack o fools lewrie spat lowering his telescope who cant keep proper guard on an anchored ship i simply cant imagine that mister jugg turned pirate on us sir langlie said sighing as he took off his hat and trailed fingers through his dark and curly locks a surly glum bastard he was but hed settled in mainwell and was ever in a fair way of performing his duties mister burns well theres henheaded for you but mister towpenny and four reliable hands even toffett to overcome on his own sir idle hands the devils workshop or no captain theyd only been becalmed aboard the prize a little more than a week no i cant see an uprising more like i suspect one of choundass small privateers sneaked in and cut her out in the dead of night when only two or three were awake supposed tbe awake lewrie snidely retorted was it mister burns who had the deck tother hands couldve set fire to her without a harsh word from him the quakin dullard so timid he wouldnt say boh to a goose she could be alongside the basseterre quays on guadeloupe by now sir lt langlie went on that devil victor huguess valuable cargo back in his hands that ogre choundas laughing like a loon at retaking her from you the best of all to him sir langlie remorselessly fantasised getting some of his own back at our expense in more ways than one dye see buffing up yes lewrie finally barked i do see mister langlie clear as a bloody damn bell my pardons sir i langlie said with a wince arrr lewrie gave vent to a piratical growl an expression he was becoming rather fond of it was brusquely eloquent in its own inarticulate way at least sir the rapidity of our departure spared us mister peels or mister pelhams presence langlie pointed out trying to salvage something worthwhile from the ongoing fiasco proving that god is when it suits him just mister langlie we stand on as we are then sir langlie enquired happy for a change of topic until dark aye lewrie grunted little more we can do we could hang the crews clothing in the rigging for a quarterknot more speed if there was a spare inch o rigging left ill be below uhm how is toulon taking to his new uhm lt langlie just had to ask oh simply bloody fine mister langlie like chalk an cheese they are lewrie gravelled slamming the tubes of his telescope shut oil and vinegar ham and bloody eggs thankee for askin lewrie stomped forrud to the larboard windward ladder to the gundeck tromped the steps downward and turned at its base forcing a marine sentry in full kit by his doors to stiffen ready to salute sail ho the mainmast lookout cried again now bloody what lewrie grumbled to himself two sail four points off th starbd bows three sail sailin athwart an bound westnorwest the lookout further howled which tweaked lewrie from his funk and made him scamper to the quarterdeck again just about due west of us he said half to himself deploying his muchabused telescope once more by the barricade of hammock nets four sail now the lookout shrilled four points off th starbd bows mister langlie hands to stations to wear ship lewrie snapped make our new course norwest by west they could be another american convoy late departin for home but wed better investigate ahoy th deck a lookout called down from uss sumters mainmast crosstrees th frigates wearin about tstarbd tack now wheres he goin capt mcgilliveray wondered aloud i could o sworn he was bound for guadeloupe but here he goes aharin off to th norwest most pculiar maybe shes spotted something sir lt claiborne his first officer supposed or what intelligence he received that caused him to tear outta port came a day late aye and th onliest thing thatd whip capm lewrie tsea that i know of d be news that th french convoys sailed mcgilliveray replied like we finally decided maybe thats why proteus wasnt bound direct for guadeloupe in th first place that a british spy got word of their departure time a boat could get to antigua theyd be about this far out on course for jacmel on saint domingue damn my eyes sir but i do blieve capm lewries got lucky and espied em after all desmond mister mcgilliveray mean tsay make a hoist to the hancock lad an make it alter norwest and in pursuit in pursuit o what we dont rightly know yet but theres somethin hes caught scent of thats put his tail up mister claiborne well wear ship to norwest if ya please aye sir and no wonder lewrie was so secretive captain mcgilliveray said half to himself slamming a fist on the nearest bulwark dour as ol thunderation treated him he doesnt want tshare em well well see about that wont we ha ha sumter signals that proteus has worn about to the norwest and seems to be in pursuit of something over the horizon sir goodells first lieutenant related to him with the sombre gravitas their stern captain demanded from men he intended to groom and mould as gentlemen officers if it killed them ah hmm capt goodell replied clearing his throat do thee summon the hands to wear about as well sir so much undue haste is indicative of something worth chasing aye even in one so idle and indolent as captain lewrie struck me like all the british he glowered thunderation what hypocrites are they beguile me for cooperation in his quest after one despicable frenchman appeal to honour then dash off to have it all for himself didst his intelligence smack of too much potential plunder pah hypocrites liars and tyrants every last one of those enervated babylonians une voile the lookout atop le gascons mainmast cried a sail to windward one point aft of the starboard beam royals and topgallants studding sails on topsail yards i see mon dieu merde alors capt griot said with a grimace the enemy has found us after all griot raised his telescope and swept the tubes to their full extension though there was little chance that he could espy anything from the quarterdeck yet what course does she steer capt guillaume choundas shouted upward clumpshuffleticking to the starboard side bows on no she shows her larboard bows steering northwest the lookout responded how many masts choundas cried his throat rasping harshly in unwonted effort and with his eye shut in furious contemplation with an imagined chart of the caribbean in his mind twol so much canvas messieurs i can only make out two the lookout cried after a long frustrating pause of half a minute out of antigua for certain capitaine griot fretted as he paced which lies almost due east of our present position shaping course to the northwest griot was hushed by the raising of his masters left hand for choundas was still thinking and would not be distracted twomasted flying studding sail booms hmm bound out of antigua to the northwest choundas muttered to himself transferring his left hand to massage his throat for it had been years since hed actually commanded at sea where shouting orders had been required i think we see a british packet brig griot northwest perhaps a halfpoint more westerly would be the shortest course to jamaica she might be carrying despatches or orders at speed his good eye flew open and transfixed the scowling griot like a collector would pin a butterfly to a board their contreamiral harvey to their viceamiral sir hyde parker at kingston perhaps choundas said with a wicked smile if she stands on she falls into our laps what the accursed huguenots the socalled acadians call a lagniappe griot a little something extra to make our success complete stand on as innocent as you please i think a falseflag ruse may serve american would be best we could appear as a lateseason convoy on our way to america the few trifling excuses for warships the americans have in these seas are much the size and strength of ours choundas took hold of a mizen shroud and swivelled about slowly to clap eyes on his convoy le gascon and la resolue lay to windward of the merchant ship and trading brig by at least two miles out near where the greatest threat could make the most likely approach one of them la resolue lay aft and to windward about four miles astern of la gascon on the convoys rear flank hainauts much faster and much handier armed schooner scouted ahead by at least another four or five miles quartering back and forth like a bloodhound casting for spoor choundas shut his eye again recalling how la resolue looked could she pass for a merchantman perhaps he decided jules out so far in advance of them though that would never do if any ship could resemble a typical american trader his la mohican was it signal to hainaut choundas briskly ordered his eye and his mouth snapping open to take close station at the head of the convoy spell that out if you must then make signals to capitaine macpherson in la resolue he is to close up as the last ship in column astern of the threemaster no national flags aloft til ordered and then the first to be displayed will be the american we will remain in position to appear as the only escort to a convoy of four and will hoist the american flag when queried she might not wish to come that close capitaine griot said let her fear be only slightly allayed griot let her maintain her present quick and direct course for jamaica and our bows will at some point come within a few scant miles of intersecting i think she will bear off a little to pass ahead of us without forcing us to back and fill or alter course and that will be close enough for a quick dash out to snap her up chapter thirtyone one brig sor midshipman larkin precariously perched aloft on the main royal yard where it crossed the slim upper mast reported theres one schooner and three fullrigged ships sor very well mister larkin lewrie cried back hands cupped at his mouth now lay below and make me a fuller report midshipman larkin as agile and surehanded as the best of the frigates elite topmen slung his borrowed telescope like a musketoon and descended to the crosstrees down the narrow upper shrouds and then found a backstay round which he wrapped his limbs and slid like a streetpedlars monkey to the starboard gangway where he landed with a solid thump to a round of cheers and a clap or two from his messmates in the cockpit and the hands larkin took a brief second to doff his hat perform a bow from the waist then trotted aft to the quarterdeck show me lewrie bade handing the incorrigible young fellow a woodframed slate and stub of chalk and larkin quickly bent to sketch out several sharppointed long ovals with dashes for masts halfway through larkin had to snort and snuffle then wipe his runny nose on his coat sleeve still panting like a pony from his exertions thats why they put buttons on the cuffs in the first place lt langlie commented so welldressed nobles wouldnt use fine clothing as snotrags and chinwipes mister larkin sorry sor touch o sniffles here capm sor schooners ahead threemasted fullrigged ship aftermost another ship then a brig and closer to us another fullrigged ship sor sir i mean standing out like an escort lewrie puzzled aloud aye sir seemed tbe larkin answered his shaggy head cocked to one side over his sketchy results th schooner twas showin er topsls but begun ttake em in whilst i was watchin sight of a frigate in the offing sir id reduce sail and get snug to my fellows too lt catterall deduced in his gruff and blunt way misery loves company so they say hey any flags showing mister larkin lewrie asked none sor sir though this ship here larkin said as he tapped his stub of chalk on the slate by the ship closest to them she was runnin up sets o signal flags an then tothers thisn far aft and th schooner seemed tanswer her sir like other escorting vessels mister larkin lewrie pressed uhm well sorta like sir aye larkin ventured nodding lewrie clapped his hands in the small of his back and rocked on the balls of his feet beginning to beam a sly grin what gentlemen did the learned doctor samuel johnson call it what was the word in his dictionary for when you go in search of one thing but find a better all unexpected mister adair youre our resident scholar it is serendipity captain lt adair supplied grinning in mounting expectation weve discovered the french convoy sir i do blieve we have sir lewrie replied mister langlie a point more westerly do you please put us bowson to them so they see a ship for now and ill have the stunsls spritsl and royals taken in to boot we may need to manoeuvre hard on the wind chainslings to be rigged on the other yards and boarding nets fetched out ready for hoisting mister grace aye sir bend on and be ready to hoist our number and the challenge in this months private signals book the one we share with the american navy lewrie slyly said and dig into your flag lockers and get that yankee courtesy flag ready to hoist as well with our own near to hand of course hop to it gentlemen make it happen instanter was the convoy british hed eat his hat it could only be the americans or the frenchchoundass convoy the jonathons would form much larger convoys with dozens or scores of homebound ships and he either knew the names of every united states navy warship sent to the leewards to escort them or he already knew them by sight now just let em hoist yankee colours and ill know for sure lewrie gloated let em try to answer with the right signals even if they got their hands on em somehow they cant bluff their way out with false identities aloft there lewrie cried to the lookouts how stand those american ships astern of us lead ships nigh hullup sir one of them responded rest are close astern o her showin topsls and courses uhm ill have to hoist the american flag from the foremast sir midshipman grace piped up near his elbow with the wind on the starboard quarter and our bows direct at them theyd not be able to see it plain else but mister elwes has the private signals ready on the larboard mizen halliards sir very well mister grace scamper forrud and bend it on then hoist it soon as you may lewrie bade him impatiently and mr grace scuttled off with the gridiron flag lightly bound in twine under his arm moments later it was soaring aloft still a colourful ball til it reached the halliard peak block where a twitch and the power from the wind let it burst open like a bright flower to stream alee one long minute passed before they got a reply deck there near ships hoisted colours american excellent lewrie chortled now mister elwes hoist away and make what ye will o that monsoor frog the signals soared aloft and broke out in a string of nine code flags the convoy was drawing closer the nearest almost hullup to proteus so there was no way they could not reply to them but lewrie had to pace about and stew for what felt like five minutes before that lone escort whipped off an answer well lewrie demanded of mr elwes who was frantically flipping through his signals book cant make it out sir elwes fretted tis nothing current not in the past six months codes at least she shows a private number for the uss pickering but pickering is a revenue service cutter and she hoisted her private number and the reply to our challenge out of proper sequence sir then shes lyin through her teeth lewrie gladly concluded clapping his hands in glee make to her the usual jibberjaw where bound and such hah ask her if shes seen uss sumter thatll be intresting and on the starbrd halliards mister elwes where she cant read em hoist hancocks number followed by with all despatch and enemy in sight american choundas muttered sullenly fuming at this sudden and disturbing revelation american of all things signal the rest of the ships to hoist american flags griot we will bluff her oui msieur but she hoists another set of signals how do we answer them griot asked him striving to maintain the required sangfroid but revealing his worry anyway she names herself in new codes that we do not possess we were fortunate i had an outofdate copy in my desk but is she a merchantman or a manofwar we do not know until she closes us two corvettes and a wellarmed schooner against a single brig of war griot choundas scathingly sneered merchant or warship in another hour it will not matter for shell be our prize we do know the code flag for repeat angled as she is on the trades her flags are difficult to read she must come closer fall a bit astern of us or press a bit ahead to make them readable close enough for you to sortie out and take her under fire quickly reenforced by la resolue and hainauts schooner tell them we lost the latest signals book in a hard blow and must fall back on the old one surely they have it still and will accommodate a fellow countryman he chuckled ohe the mainmast lookout shouted ships ahoy two no three ships to the starboard beam astern of the nearest one three sets of topsails topgallants and royals headed northwest merde that close griot griped dashing back to the bulwarks with his telescope extended once more this near one must have masked them if we see topsails already they could be up to us in another hour or so mort de ma vie msieur what if they are warships and what if they are a whole convoy choundas barked back in sudden loathing for the usually stoic griots uncharacteristic windiness and hed thought him a breton paragon all this time a worthy scion of the ancient veneti courageous as himself theyre almost hullup to us from the deck sir lt langlie announced six miles perhaps and our yankee cousins are closing us rapidly he said swivelling about for a peek aft well be closeaboard the french in half an hour on this wind the sailing master mr winwood soberly opined and the americans so i do adjudge will be up to broadsides a half hour after that s sir mmhmm lewrie absently acknowledged them all ascheme and a bit too impatient to create a little inventive mischief and mayhem to wait that long the strungout convoy arrayed inlineahead was split in equal halves by proteuss bisecting bowsprit they could haul up harder on the wind and cut them off they could wear once more and duck astern of them go dashing for the leeside and the vulnerably slow escorted ships which didnt plan on it but ive led the yankees to a fight lewrie pondered commit to battle and goodelld never forgive me for wadin in before he could get up and there goes his grudgin gratitude and any chance o future cooperation two corvettes mayhap the schooner is an armed auxiliary too hmm discretion the better part o valour for once use my bloody head for a rare once mister langlie lewrie finally said turning to face his execcutive officer we will bear up hard on the wind new course nornorwest mister grace you still with us once were settled on our new heading you will lower the yankee flag and break out our true colours smartly and make a hoist to the convoy to heave to and prepare to be boarded that same instant to langlie he gleefully explained well sit out here off their starboard bows and let em sulk on things for a bit pull their hair and kick furniture if theyve a mind they wish to come out and fight well be more than happy to oblige em give the americans the chance to participate if they dally long enough too ohe the lookout screamed a minute after the brig of war or the merchant brig had worn about revealing herself as a threemasted ship she is anglais choundas ground his teeth despising the shouts and the man who made them mille diables she is a frigate he wailed spreading consternation by reporting so emotionally damn it choundas rasped stamping his cane on the deck ohe she is that devil ship proteus the lookout howled shoot that dog choundas barked do you not train your men to report correctly griot msieur i griot stammered as flustered as his sailors at the sight of their nemesis how how did he find us who could have betrayed our sailing after all you did to stamp out traitors you are french griot you are breton choundas bellowed in rage his face gone the colour of red plums behave accordingly as a warship captain or ohe the deck the lookout shrilled once more the ships to the east are warships flags at every masthead a corvette a brig of war and perhaps a small frigate astern damn that man choundas spat glaring upward as if his look could kill lewrie is not a devil griot hes but a man a stupid idle arrogant british amateur he sits out there from fear waiting for the americans to come up before he acts americans revenue cutters armed with popguns thinsided merchant ships turned into poor substitutes for men of war we sortie now against him and well have nearly an hour to swarm over him three ships to one and with him taken or crippled lewrie dead at last yes theyll stand off in fear of us oh lewrie dead at long last proteus is a fifth rate frigate of thirtytwo guns capitaine griot recited suddenly so calm that choundas got a crick in his neck from turning his head to glare at him her main artillery consists of twelvepounders her weight of metal is greater than ours together get those damnable rags down griot choundas coldly ordered hoist our glorious tricolore and signal la resolue and la mohican to form lineofbattle on us we will fight and we will conquer do you hear me hein do it vite vite and our charges msieur capt griot asked what should we do with them order the convoy to wear about and make the best of their way back to guadeloupe griot choundas quickly decided if they cannot drive that close to the trades they must run eastsoueast at least until we come to fetch them say for now they are no longer our main concern he disparagingly said hope and rage and a long unused acuity for tactics awakened in his breast we have a battle to fight threetoone sir lt langlie said slyly grinning almost even odds that after all they are french he japed takin em long enough lewrie grunted back brooding on the larboard bulwarks facing their foes they beat up to us theyll hope to bracket us i would in their position the lead corvette to lie off our bows the second abeam and the schooner tplay the bulldog and sternrake us often as she can our yankees oglethorpe has worn about and is after those merchant ships langlie said craning about for a good look theyre mostly out of it bound due south or thereabout sir sumter and hancock are still bound directly for us bout five miles up to windward lewrie took himself a long looksee too feeling oddly calm and satisfied proteus still lay noreast of the french only slowly angling closer to them as the escorting warships swanned about to get ready to fight they were separated by little more than two miles of water now tantalisingly beyond even extreme gunrange the leading french corvette was bound norwest as closehauled to the trades as she could bear the second corvette was still about a mile astern of the first one perhaps a quartermile alee of her consort and unable to pinch or claw up closer the armed schooner showed much more dash though her foreandaft sails allowed her another point higher on the eyes of the wind steering northbyeast almost bowson to proteuss larboard quarter lewrie turned to slouch with his right arm on the bulwarks most uncaptainlylike and squinted at her he imagined a dashing schooner captain might haul up close then tack and try to rake him getting in his licks before the others perhaps to fire up into his frigates rigging and carry away something vital that would allow the corvettes to get into knifefighting distance well two could play that game lewrie thought his ship had not yet reefed or clewed up her main course which would be drawn up out of the way for fear of fire once the guns began to sing she still had all the power of the wind to utilise proteuss yards though she steered a point free of closehauled hed had drawn in loosebraced not quite gathering as much wind as they could if braced in sharp not that obvious to the approaching french yet letting them gain but yes there she went starting to tack the ambitious young shit get a bit to windward then tack and fall down on his vulnerable stern or so he thought mister langlie brace in hard and get a proper way back on her then we will wear lewrie decided of a sudden and close them sir for a while mister langlie lewrie cheerfully replied in the process well force them to tack if they want at us that badly upset whatever theyre planning and bear down on yon schooner so frightful well make her commander squirt his breeches lewrie quickly sketched out once about we will go closehauled on larboard tack and chase the little bastard splitting their forces and isolating him and give the cousins the time to get up and have a proper whack at em im feelin devilish generous today mister langlie lewrie said with a chuckle new course eastsoueast aye aye sir langlie said with a sly grin she wears griot exclaimed then get us about too at once choundas snapped signal to la resolue to conform to our manoeuvres at once msieur capt griot said turning to pass the order to his first officer then turning back to choundas such a tack will bring us much closer to the american warships once we engage proteus they will have time to sail up and take us on our disengaged side if i cannot have that salaud lewrie this time i will at least damage him in passing griot choundas growled a quick action at threetoone odds to cripple and kill then we will break away and go to the rescue of our merchant ships hacking that puny american brig of war apart in the process perhaps even taking her and teaching a lesson to those rustic ingrates oh to be just a mile closer what hell we could play upon lewrie as he wears for hms proteus was coming about first swinging to present her stern to the trades then only slowly handsomely swinging her yards jibs and staysls as she wore across the eyes of the wind offering up her profile to the french corvettes which were swinging their bows at her as they tacked the slowness of the british frigates manoeuvres and their tacks brought all three squareriggers closer to each other yet still frustratingly out of even a most hopeful gunners attempt to hit her one mile beyond rangetorandomshot guillaume choundas hobbled to the head of the larboard gundeck ladder wrapping his left arm about the stanchion for a swivelgun his walkingstick tucked under his arm and thumping his fist on the rails as if to flog le gascon into a breakneck gallop griot canny sailor that he was had the larboard guns run out and the starboard artillery run in near to amidships to loading positions to get her flatter on her bottom le gascons and la resolues bottoms were mostly clean their entries were finer than most and their length of keel was just a bit shorter than the frigates given enough time and both corvettes should stride up to proteus and bracket her between their guns lewrie could squirm about but that would only quicken his death he looked sutherly noting that la resolue was positioned for an engagement on lewries starboard side while le gascon was high enough to take him under fire on his larboard side even allowing for leeward slippage which was unavoidable going hard to windward your protege hainaut has courage msieur griot commented his schooner might get to her before we do yes he does choundas replied irked that his vital calculations of wind leeway and speed were interrupted yet with a sound of grudging pride in his voice even so cleverness too let us hope more cleverness than brute bravery msieur capt griot gloomily intoned once we savage proteus and get past her we must bear away southeast else we approach the americans lineabreast unable to aid each other msieur he pointed out i do not fear their roughcast homemade and light popguns griot choundas declared with a sneer american foundries and powder mills are merde and their gun crews a pack of clumsy children in comparison to how well you and macpherson have trained ours very well msieur griot said keeping his voice neutral in dread of what choundas might order in the heat of rising expectations for battle he feared pointing out how quickly the americans stalked down on them were starting to haul their wind a point or so as if to aim between proteuss stern quarters and his own ships bows and cut them off from pursuit capt griot was fearful too to express what qualms he felt after taking a long look at the trailing small frigate that his lookouts had reported as she loomed taller and taller in his ocular beginning to appear as massive as a cutdown third rate still bearing two decks of guns madness the doughty griot thought his heart heavy we are sacrificed to this ogres revenge madness the frog schooners now about one mile off our starboard quarters sir lt langlie adjudged his telescope to his eye and those corvettes are a mile and a half astern but coming fast one about dead astern tother on our larboard quarter and our yankees only four miles up to windward lewrie added with a satisfied sniff time for some fun mister langlie haul our wind and steer due south mister catterall he shouted forward over the hammock nettings stand by the starboard battery and take that schooner under fire once weve fallen off your best guncaptains to fire as they bear mind let em take their time at it aye aye sir catterall bellowed back pleased as punch to be loosed on their foes at last right you bawdy whoresons proteus heeled groaning almost putting her starboard outboard shroud chain platforms into the sea as her helm was put up as braces and sheets were eased once settled on her new course due south the port lids swung up to make a regular bloodred chequer against the pale paint of her gunwales and the heavy truckcarriages rumbled and squealed as her pounder guns were run out inbattery a long minute passed as guncaptains fussed and fiddled with the elevating quoin blocks directing their crews to shift aim left or right with the long crowlevers to sweat tons of oak and iron a few inches rope tackles and blocks were overhauled for clear recoil paths before the experienced guncaptains took up the lanyards to their flintlock strikers then shot their free fists skyward to show readiness reducing the slack in the lanyards to the last remaining inch as you bear fire lt catterall roared bow to stern her thirteen starboard pounders stuttered out a bellicose thunder some gunners waiting for the scend of the sea to raise the decks nearer to deadlevel before jerking their lanyards in ones twos and threes the guns erupted and lurched inboard with both guns rightaft in lewries greatcabins adding the final kettledrum coda of a quick booboom to lewries ears it was almost excruciatingly musical the french schooner had been almost bowson to proteus following her turn off the wind and her stunned master had kept her bowson mostlikely to present the slimmest target he could to that sudden broadside great lovely columns and feathers of spray leaped skyward about her to either beam or short before her bows but terrifyingly close and bounding upward as darting black specks from first graze barely slowed to howl keen or shriek over her decks or down both of her sides as if she had been assailed by a flying coven of witches thinking quickly the schooners captain ordered her helm hard over to leeward to tack her northward towards the nearest corvette to escape a second pummeling hoping to flit beyond proteuss limited gunarcs as she bared her starboard side to them rolling heeling and every sail panicflogging proteuss gunners raised a jeering howl at the sight of holes that their shot had punched in her canvas now back on the wind mister langlie lewrie ordered all for now mister catterall sorry close your ports but reload then stand by to serve em another weve lost a quartermile to the corvettes sir lt langlie pointed out aye temptin lewrie snickered beaming fit to bust with a playful doublelift of his brows aint we those poor bastards back yonder mister langlie they should be running but theyre not i doubt they could scuttle back to choundas thout dirtyin their guns a time or two hed scrag em for cowardice else counting on it the schooner ploughed on northerly for a minute longer before tacking again to lay herself half a mile in advance of the nearer corvette now up on their larboard quarter some quick flag hoists were made then both vessels hauled their wind a point free to fall off on a bowandquarter line lasking til they lay off proteuss starboard quarters once more then came back to inlineahead hard on the wind the far corvette had fallen off too to match the distance to leeward that proteus had lost with her sutherly swing all of them yet intent on bracketing then pummeling her but by then they had left it too late and the americans were upon them sumter swept in abeam of proteus and thrashing between on a furiously boiling bow and quarter wave her gunports already opened and her curious bright red figurehead of a fighting cock with its neck outstretched and its wings spread in anger catching the reflections of seaglint and appearing as if alive the french schooner hauled her wind again ducking to leeward to upset the aim of sumters larboard gunners showing the yankee her stern as she turned she fired a ragged salvo from her larboard popguns moments before sumter returned the favour and the sea about her frothed leaped and feathered anew with nearmisses and the schooner visibly trembled as heavy roundshot hammered into her the french corvette astern of her hauled her wind too beginning to swing sutherly to stand on closehauled to windward would open her vulnerable bows to a punishing rake and to haul her wind too late would make the bowrake even closer and more damaging she would match her larboard guns to sumters starboard cannon while running for home and hope for the best while hancock massive as a rocky island fortress bore down on the farther corvette remaining upwind of her to oppose larboard guns to larboard guns and just slavering for the frenchman to haul off and expose her fragile stern timbers mister catterall stand by to engage the schooner again do you haul off south mister langlie lewrie bade sumter arrowed in at an angle before swinging abeam of her foe and both broadsides went off almost as one instantly wreathing both ships in an angry grey thunderhead of spent powder smoke upon which the schooner stood out in stark profile after proteus had altered her course the range was only half a mile this time but hold fire mister catterall til she sails below sumter we dont want thit our friends with overs lewrie cautioned but all four vessels were running off the wind to the suthrd denying proteus a clean shot for long minutes whilst topmen aboard the schooner raked her topsl gaskets free and let her extra canvas fall with more sail aloft she slowly began to inch aheadthen had the sauce to let loose her starboard guns at sumters disengaged side and once settled down on course raised her larboard ports and let fly at proteus to boot the sharp yipping bangs didnt amount to guns much larger than pounders and her smalldiametre shot grazed twice or thrice before sinking closeaboard with no effect but lewrie found it galling and as she finally sailed alee of sumter and the battling corvette out in clear air where they could fire on her proteus had to swing two points to windward so her guns could bear even as the range began to open fire lt catterall at last could howl slashing his sword at the deck after long stompaboutcursing moments of utter frustration lowaimed roundshot pillared and columned the waters round the french schooner bounding from first graze to dash low over her decks gnaw a vicious bite from her bulwarks here and there but she sailed on still firingas if it were an equal contest point more to windward mister langlie hit her again lads gut that poxy slugeatin whore lewrie raged knowing that the schooner was outfooting his frigate that if they didnt cripple her soon hed be forced to fall in astern of her and spin out a daylong sternchase in hopes of a few lucky hits from his forward chaseguns to whittle off her speed advantage had he been able to fire on her when shed been closer and dead abeam far down to leeward uss oglethorpe had merged with those fleeing merchantmen a quick peek with a glass showed him it looked like they had already struck their colours and fetchedto there goes all hope oprofit lewrie miserably surmised damme said was feelin generous but not that generous by god hancock is engaging captain lt langlie screeched the only way he could be heard over the general din this ought tbe intresting lewrie muttered turning aft the american frigate had clewed up her main course and had let her way fall off a bit better than a mile and a half astern she now appeared close enough to the french corvette to crash her yardarm tips against the french ships yard ends though there probably remained at least two cables separation between them there was a concerted crash as hancocks weatherdeck guns the pounders mounted on her stout and wide gangway went off together stabbing hot amber and red daggers at the corvette creating a pall of gunsmoke that drifted down on the french warship and the corvettes sails and yards were savaged spindly topmasts and shattered yardarms sent flying in ragged chunks her duncoloured sails clawed and bitten into great rents whipping and collapsing in on themselves hancock altered course in the last seconds as the two warships images overlapped laying her beam parallel to the french ships side and then god help the frogs lewrie muttered rather insincerely that hancocks heavy lowerdeck pounders raged and even at that distance it looked as if the corvette rocked and tipped bobbing like a foldedpaper boat on a pond assailed by a heaping handful of pebbles flung by a spiteful child then almost mercifully all sight of her was blotted out by a titanic pall of powder smoke that blew down upon her hiding her hurts from view even hidden hancocks massive guns firing as they bore and not in broadside still thundered gawd was all that lt langlie could say after seeing that exeunt one french corvette stage left lewrie said awed by such a powerful display damme if she aint completely dismasted right down to the level of her bulwarks he pointed out as the smoke drifted alee and clear of the corvette which now wallowed with all her motive power and most of her way stolen for their own part lt catterall was getting off another broadside at the french schooner gnawing her just a bit more peppering the sea about her but inflicting no lasting harm proteus had to turn up to windward two more points to keep her guns aimed at her but at the same time the schooner was hardening up to the trades too and was in the lead curving out a course ahead of their frigates starboard bow lewrie grimaced in frustration the schooner would prove to be handier and more weatherly proteus could press up another point and then shed be closehauled sailing on the ragged edge of the wind and could go no higher the schooner with its foreandaft sails could go at least a point higher and end up directly ahead of them where only the pair of chaseguns could worry at her and not very effectively at that as the bows plunged and soared bludgeoning their way windward within an hour lewrie knew the schooner would be far enough up to windward on the larboard bows that only one chasegun could fire a swing to leeward to use all his larboard battery would put proteus even farther behind and alee one hour more and the schooner would be out of gunrange he looked about for aid but there was none oglethorpe was now back under sail after securing her two prizes but was too far down in the south alee of proteus to be of any avail oh he could continue to chase the schooner but he doubted he could catch her this side of guadeloupe unless something in her rigging carried away lewrie drew a deep breath held it then let it out in a bitter sigh he had the americans to flatter and congratulate in hopes that their sudden and complete victory might make them so giddy they might leap at continued cooperation even alliance and that was worth much more in the long run than a puny armed schooner taken as prize a lack of gunfire turned his attention westerly far off now almost hulldown sumter and the other french corvette had ceased firing and were now cocked up to windward fetchedto no flag flew on the frenchmans masts well damme lewrie groaned aloud might as well secure the guns mister langlie well not overhaul our chase before beaching us on guadeloupe do you concur sir or do you prefer a shore supper sadly i do sir langlie said pouting with distaste and disappointment games not worth the candle that is one fortunate frog captain out yonder skillful too sir aye damn him whoever he is lewrie spat i fear we will hear more from him in future very well sir secure the guns then get us about and lay us alongside hancock where i must come over all merry andrew and backslap em makes me wish mister pelham had got aboard before we sailed hed know how to piss down their backs in the proper manner hes the smarmy skill to appear sincere til they serve him boiled okra sir his first lieutenant chirped tongueincheek green boiled disgusting did he not say captain with a dash of ground coal stirred in too sir hey okra and ashes from a coke furnace captain okracoke do ye see langlie further japed now youre really reaching mister langlie lame lame lame very good sir chapter thirtytwo it was a rather crowded little assembly as lewries gig stroked over to the uss hancock oglethorpe had fetched up her two prizes as had sumter now looking a little worse for wear after fighting the longest engagement of the day with her french corvette eight vessels now cocked up to windward within the compass of a quartermile with boats bearing victorious officers back and forth other boats transferring a host of prisoners into custody aboard the yankee ships or transferring us marines aboard the prizes to guard captured ships companies hancocks wide weather decks were crowded too as lewrie stood atop the entryport lip to receive the sidepartys salute smiling as pleasant as anyone could wish as he doffed his hat and looked about to see what damage the twodecker frigate had taken none was his assessment what little harm the corvettes lone broadside had done aloft had already been most efficiently reroved and only a few hands were still in her rigging tidying up with paint tar or galley slush ah captain lewrie the stern capt malachi goodell bellowed with uncharacteristic good cheer the author of our triumph over the idolators i am bound the very fellow who drew us on like the pillar of smoke by day drew moses through the wilderness welcome aboard to thee sir wilt thou partake in a celebratory cup of cider captain i would captain goodell and gladly offer you and your fellow captains my congratulations lewrie replied as a steward offered him a mug of something wet from a handsome coinsilver tray goodells cider potation was cool sweet yet sprightly on the tongue and vaguely alcoholic lewrie noted normally i eschew befuddling spirits sir goodell explained to answer lewries mildly puzzled look and encourage others to shun the demonic lure a homemade and slightly aged apple cider though in strict moderation may on certain rare occasions prove harmless though i still lament how prodigally our honest americans imbibe the harder ciders ladies men yea even suckling babes in their cradles quite tasty and refreshing captain goodell lewrie complimented him despite the sermonising and with a full measure may i propose a toast gentlemen he said perking up the assembled officersmcgilliveray randolph and their first officers along with commission officers in hancock to the gallant navy of the united states of america may todays victory be but the first of many hear hear aye huzza yyeehahh the last from the plumphyzzed georgian captain randolph and his first lieutenant evidently goodells mildly aged cider was more inspiriting than captain goodell imagined if taken aboard in sufficient quantities and since cheers made for dry throats the servants were hardpressed to refill all the empty mugs and aye mcgilliveray had had a hard fight of it for his opponent la resolue had resisted bravely til her unfortunate capt macpherson had perished and all his deck officers had fallen leaving it to a wounded master gunner to strike her colours and her slaughter had been simply frightful mcgilliveray relished to inform him but have no fear capm lewrie desmond came through without a scratch and he showed as cool and brave as ever ya could ask for first across when we come up closeaboard and stormed her and hows that new kitty he gave ya he begged me ask missed all th fun capt randolph imparted between mugs of soreneeded refreshment mount fourteen spankin fine twelvepounders and only fired six o th starboard battry at two ships and they struck quickz a wink they did aye fourteen of em an longnines on focsle and quarterdeck too twentytwo guns dont that beat all for a lil ol converted brig o war oh too bad that schooner outfooted ya a clean sweepd been sweeter by far but somebody has trun back t guadeloupe with his tail twixt his legs an bear th bad news to that devil choundas dont ya know perhaps next time so wellarmed sir your gallant oglethorpe will be the one to surprise greedy and unwary frenchmen lewrie said feeling unctuous and irked though striving to please assuming theyll feel pugnacious after such a drubbing as you gave em today twas smartly quickly and efficiently done sir my congratulations to you and your accurate gunners a moment captain lewrie goodell intruded now more formal in mien wouldst thou care to meet one of our unfortunate french allow me to name to thee capitaine de vaisseau humbert griot of le gascon captain griot may i present to thee captain alan lewrie of his britannic majestys ship proteus captain griot lewrie said shifting his cider mug to his left hand and doffing his hat with his right making a formal leg to that grizzled unshaven worthy my regrets for your loss this day sir capitaine loo lewray griot grumbled back with a quick doff of his own hat but no bow he was an antiaristo republican to the soles of his shabby boots so you are ze devil i meet at las ze one oo obsess capitaine choundas to ze frantic but for a spy e vous nevair you find us i am thinking non tosh sir lewrie scoffed though tapping sagaciously at the side of his nose i was lucky was all spies what rot your old master choundas was born with spies on the brain sir and how is the poor old fellow might i enquire lewrie said with a lofty smirk why thou mayst ask him thyself captain lewrie capt goodell said his eyes merry with delight and his teeth bared neath his hedgelike beard and mustachios for here that fiend doth arrive even as we speak goodell chuckled waving a hand towards the sound of blocks squealing above the starboard side jerking foot by jerking foot a bosuns chair slung from a main yard rose up over the hancock bulwarks bearing a bedraggled figure who sat slumped defeatedly one palsied and liverspotted hand clinging to the canvas chairsling pastypale that longdespised face as it weakly swung its gaze inboard in the dullest curiosity or an attempt at proud disdain to regard its conquerors with that one good eye uniform tarstained and smutted with powder smoke and sailcloth dust rumpled and suddenly too big for his frame his hat gone and his thinning reddish hair wildly disarrayed capt guillaume choundas would have seemed a pathetic apparition he had also suffered a wound in his bad leg the redspotted bandages visible through the rent that a surgeon had made in the thigh of his trousers with a second gash high on his forehead right on his receding hair line and that in the end is thy wily implacable nemesis captain lewrie captain goodell sourly wondered aloud tsk tsk fou lewrie heard the sullen griot whisper under his breath quil aille au diable nom dun chien engoulevent which slurs made goodell stiffen in pious indignation and lewrie smile wickedly for griot had called choundas fool had damned him had accused him of being a goddamned goatsucker to boot vous choundas snarled soon as he clapped eyes on lewrie in a vitriolic snarl that conveyed nearly fifteen years of brooding anger and pain his undying lust for revenge since that bright tropic morn when hed fallen to lewries sword on the pristine beach at balabac in the spanish philippines why hallo willy lewrie gaily rejoined in a mocking drawl and tipping his hat with glee once hed gotten over his utter surprise havin a bad day are we ye foetid old bugger captain lewrie really goodell primly chid him such abuse for an honourably surrendered and nowhelpless foe thy longstanding personal animus notwithstanding ill not have it not aboard an american man o war sir the gentlemanly and honourable courtesies will be observed twixt foes who are in defeat foes no longer choundas was swung inboard and lowered to the deck landing on his good leg but instantly collapsing like a sack of clothes when his hamstrung leg tried to share the load with a hiss choundas summoned the reluctant griot to his side to help him stand to shake his uniform into better order and take a few steps msieur choundas said blatantly ignoring lewrie to concentrate on goodell you ave ze best of me capitaine an ave honourably defeated me to you is ze victoire an i umbly offer to you my sword he concluded knackily shamming nobility to play off lewries churlishness with griots help choundas freed his scabbard from his beltfrog and extended the costly and ornate blade hilt first oh no dont lewrie thought in a panic dreading what was coming sure enough le hideux s good eye darted at lewrie with his lips curled in a tiny smirk of triumph ahem lewrie began like a first attempt to call a waiter thy reputation precedes thee captain choundas goodell said looking down his raptors beak at the man and the temptation of that priceless smallsword that could grace goodells mantel for generations and i tell thee plain monsoor wert thou capable of offering an iota of resistance or deviltry what i know of thee tempts me to clap thee in irons regardless of thy rank and dignities thats the way man lewrie silently exulted take that sword and guard him close deep on your orlop among the rats nonetheless i feel it my duty as a christian gentleman and a fellow professional officer of my countrys navy on which i will allow no slur concerning the proper treatment of prisoners that might sully its glorious name to take thee as thou stands an officer and a gentleman of thy navy who may freely and honourably offer his parole on thy personal bond of honour bluck lewrie objected stupefied past real words strictly admitting that the betrayal of such personal word will redound to the greatest discredit upon thyself thy navy and thy republic goodell concluded casting a dubious look at lewrie wilt thou offer thy parole or wilt thou surrender sir he posed to such generosity of ze spirit ze christian spirit msieur naturellement i am mos appy to accept your offer of parole merci beaucoup bien choundas rasped back his cruel scarred lips forming a creditable facsimile of a lambinnocent and grateful smile mine arse on a bandbox lewrie said in a fretful whisper i fear i must protest captain goodell christian charity aside sir most creditable to you choundas simply cant be trusted he should be my prisoner his majestys government has the older and greater claim on him and did thy ship vanquish his captain lewrie goodell cooed back suddenly come over arctic ice his owleyes asquint as if focussed on prey did he strike his colours to thee he did not were he thine he would languish in chains and filth aboard a prisonhulk at english harbour for years as i languished in british captivity sir just to satisfy thy animus which is unbecoming in an officer and gentleman of thy repute sir though his soul be sold to the devil long ago and his sins the vilest scarlet yea even so i could never subject even him to such cruelty captain choundas is now mine taken in honourable battle unless and until he does anything to violate his sacred honour i am honourbound to take his parole at face value or defame my countrys trustworthiness captain choundas is an american prisoner sir the fruit of an american victory and i will brook no further dispute of the matter but france isnt at war with the united states hell be let go hell lewrie spluttered appalled thunderation goodell bellowed did i not say the matter is closed sir thou wouldst gainsay me on my own quarterdeck sir lewrie withered under goodells fury blushing furiously to be dresseddown before the american officers and sailors like an idiotic midshipman before choundass sly scorn hes dangerous he no longer captain lewrie goodell said seeming to relent at limited liberty ashore in the united states choundas will work no more deviltry and since no formal declaration of war exists there will be no prisoner exchanges possible captain lewrie neither do the french yet hold a single us navy officer of comparable rank to offer in exchange dost thou see sir goodell concluded in much calmer voice his beardshrouded lips curling in the faintest of grins and his owleyes for a brief moment twinkling with glee damme did the old stickleback just wink at me lewrie gawped captain choundas will be sent to an american seaport with my report of his capture and his nature made public knowledge to one and all captain lewrie he will work no further havoc nor return to france before the turn of the century in my estimation that is the most i may promise thee sir and thou must be satisfied with that lewrie realised that the game was blocked at both ends he had lost and must put the best face he could on his defeat he heaved a bitter sigh then said with passable good grace i spose i must at that sir please forgive my zeal to see such a dangerous foe placed where id know he could do no more mischief had i captured choundas i could do no less did he offer his parole no matter how galling my congratulations to you sir and i wish you all the notice and fame that pertains to such a triumph to yourself your officers and tars and to the glory of your navy and the united states of america nabbed him though lewrie grimly told himself id not have given him the chance to hand over his sword board his ship and shoot him down run him through not give choundas time to strike colours could i have in the heat of the moment or lose my command and my honour get courtmartialed for murderin a prisoner god please he looks so old and sick you could pluck him with a fever or something a bad batch of oysters any cause he has to die else ill never be able to rest easy hmmm there must be a way zealousness in the pursuit of ones duty is ever forgivable sir capt goodell was saying stroking his whiskers in glee to have a briton apologise to him for anything even though thy zeal might be adulterated by personal motives thank thy maker captain lewrie that in thy pursuit of just revenge upon such a monster personal zeal did not overcome the professional and that thine own hands and immortal soul remain unsullied great jehovahs justice will grind choundas be sure of that yea even unto chaff and powdered blighted seed so black and withered that his evil will be spurned even by the hungriest birds of the air or beasts of the field and shalt never take root in the fertilest soil amen sir lewrie replied with a fervor he could not really feel what he felt was oily and unctuous to sham piety but needs must well then sir i will take my leave you will sail back to english harbour captain goodell good please allow me to request that you bear my despatches about todays action to my superiors thou will not enter harbour sir goodell asked fear im bound away on another matter sir lewrie answered tipping him a conspiratorial wink as if a duty of even greater import awaited him one of a secret nature i shall say my goodbyes to captains mcgilliveray and randolph my congratulations again and do we have future occasion to work together to the confusion of the french or another mutual enemy please recall that i owe you a duty and a service and would move heaven and earth to fulfill it loath though i am to admit it captain lewrie goodell said as he tentatively offered his hand looking down at it for a moment as if he could not credit that he was doing so or that his hand moved of its own volition i find myself almost looking forward to such cooperation should my country and thine find common cause mind they shook on that informal bargain even though goodells paw felt much like a limp dead flounder they at least shook on it off again are ya capm lewrie mcgilliveray said frowning i was hoping you could dine aboard just one more time the lad fear i must sir lewrie said shrugging sadly promise me that if sumter bears choundas to america you watch him close parole be damned will you he urged and keep desmond away from him every minute if choundas learns who he is to me and he will im certain of it he has his ways hell find a way to take revenge on me and kill him if he can cripple him as bad as hes crippled at the least for gods sake i beg you captain mcgilliveray dont trust choundas with a rusty fork i will though i dont quite mcgilliveray quickly vowed before i depart ill send a letter aboard for the for my son telling him the same and that that hes that desmond is shapin mainwell to become a fine young man and i wouldnt want any harm to come to him which i hope youll say as well sir from me lewrie dug out his washleather coinpurse and clawed down for a few shillings til we meet again he might find need for some things at the chandleries and shops so no need o that capm lewrie mcgilliveray protested hes his navy pay such as it is and a modicum o private means as my adopted nephew desmond needs time with his real father more than money once youre back from your pursuit sir well make time for that to happen for the nonce count on me tkeep him safe and well twindward of that devil i could ask no better than that captain mcgilliveray thankee kindly lewrie responded somewhat eased in his mind but knowing his foe of old worries for the lads safety would not quite disperse that easily he put his purse away chiding himself for a callous bastard for feeling relief that fatherhood wouldnt cost too much that his newfound son desmond came with his own sustenance a lucky lad sir mcgilliveray commented with two families two fathers really so concerned for his wellbeing one who left it much too late sir but lewrie confessed but makin up for it in splendid fashion mcgilliveray told him warmly god speed your fine ship capm lewrie and your return epilogue you lead a charmed life lieutenant hainaut representativeonmission desfourneaux told jules over a convivial glass of wine at the end of his verbal report so desfourneaux said prissily setting his wineglass down on his appropriated marbletopped desk with a precise little click the redoubtable capitaine choundas was taken both corvettes and the arms convoy were taken by the americans you say not the british yet choundass bete noire lewrie discovered it and led them to it yet took little part hmmm a failure a regrettable failure and a great loss to france yes citizen assuredly hainaut replied not sure of what he could say in safety would he be blamed for surviving or did their representative from the directory imagine that he was the one who had alerted the british and the americans in the long run though your former master had outlived his usefulness desfourneaux went on with a wee moue of regret he was ill one could see that and as a result his faculties were diminished had this lewrie person not been present as a lure choundas might have put about and saved the convoy for another try later on might the british have planned to use lewrie as bait because your former master had become too predictable in his lust for revenge it is possible citizen desfourneaux hainaut allowed with an enigmatic shrug he was obsessed by lewrie for a certainty to the detriment of all else he was trusted to do alas the voice of central authority grumbled leaning back in his comfortably padded chair and sighing theatrically both hugues and choundas lost to the revolutions further service a clean sweep hah desfourneaux chirped as if secretly pleased both too brutal and direct useful in the early days and the terror but france is now in need of subtler cleverer men men of action naturally but those who understand when to employ wits or the sword men such as you i do believe lieutenant hainaut indeed citizen hainaut perked up warily indeed desfourneaux reiterated turning more businesslike with the loss of capitaines choundas griot and macpherson and the earlier loss of capitaine desplan and le bouclier our naval power in the caribbean is gone you and that lieutenant recamier whom choundas needlessly relieved of seaduties just to make him a scapegoat and object lesson some few others must make do until my reports to paris produce a reenforcing squadron choundas le hideux desfourneaux said with a simper as if emboldened by capt choundass enforced absence to damn him with his behindtheback slur recommended you highly his papers which i seized after his departure also absolved you of any suspicions of treachery or any hint of collusion with british agents i see citizen hainaut replied allowing himself the tiniest smirk of derision for his former employer as if sharing desfourneauxs disdain although i feel insulted that i was ever suspected after serving him so well though jules hainaut could not help worrying about what else the ogre had written about him recamier i appoint a capitaine de vaisseau desfourneaux intoned formally and will assign him the best remaining ship suitable for conversion and arming from what others here on guadeloupe say of him he is much too good to idle ashore and was treated most shabbily by that vicious old cripple he will command all our ships now an admirable choice citizen pardon me for saying related by marriage to a dead naval hero desfourneaux chuckled waving a hand in the air dismissively admiral de brueys fool that he was to lose his whole fleet to that nelson at aboukir bay as harmful as it was to the esprit of the revolutionary masses it wasnt all his fault that ambitious climber general bonaparte might just as well have staked him out for slaughter rest assured mon cher in our good time the directory will make that upstart pay too for you you hainaut ahem by the plenipotentiary power granted me by the directory as their represantantenmission you i make a capitaine de fregate to serve as recamiers strong right arm and secondin command i i dont know what to say hainaut exclaimed in wonder a small merci beaucoup will suffice desfourneaux simpered at him i confirm you in command of your schooner la mohican and will assign another into the uhm chippewa to pair with your vessel of course france expects great things from you capitaine hainaut he said turning serious when strong enough eventually this bloody capitaine alan lewrie you must eliminate do not take it as your sole task as your old master did but he must be cornered and defeated he must be seen by our people to pay for the loss of such a hero as guillaume choundas desfourneaux sardonically sneered i will do it someday citizen hainaut eagerly vowed bon for now though concentrate on british shipping the directory has disavowed our war on american trade as victor huguess doing desfourneaux paused to shrug perhaps in a few months they will again be good prize who knows the last packet that slipped through the blockade bore no news about an angloamerican alliance or an american declaration of war so for now we will not take actions that goad the rustics into taking hands with the bloodies nor declaring open war but some victories over the many small cutters and sloops of the british blockade would not go amiss nestce pas i am looking forward to them citizen desfourneaux and thank you again for your trust in me hainaut declared knocking back his glass of wine in celebration now that he knew for the moment where he stood in the directorys estimation and firmly vowing to himself that he would do nothing to lower that estimation would indeed wreak such havoc on the british that the directory raised their opinions of him paving the way for even higher rank and fame an intricate ormulu clock chimed on the marbletopped sideboard in desfourneauxs pleasant office in the upper levels of the grim fort fleur depee and the man slapped his leatherbound workbooks shut in a fussily pleased fashion desfourneaux rose and poured both of their wineglasses full again gave hainaut a playful little smile and then crooked a finger to command him out onto the stone balcony overlooking the courtyard of the fort now that our business is at an end capitaine hainaut we will witness the end of another less fortunate bit of business do bring the bottle this may take some time desfourneaux directed the forts massive gates had been flung open to allow the townspeople and islanders inside a battalion of the garrison stood rigid under arms as the tumbrils rolled into the large courtyard drawn by artillery horses the tall wooden wheels of the tumbrils groaned and clattered on the cobblestones wobbling on their hubs the ungreased axles keened dirgelike and the fairly openwoven wicker frames atop the tumbrils beds shook and trembled in tune with the men and women who rode them wideeyed and refusing to believe as the short line of big carts slowly rolled to the foot of the steps that led to the high wood platform and the waiting guillotine the crowd began to titter and jeer to catcall and curse those people in the carts the soldiers were allowed to raise their muskets and shake them in anger too as the taunts of the crowd built in rage and volume as the first of the condemned were led or dragged aloft to the executioners to answer for their crimes of treason treachery the betrayal of so many gallant officers warrants and beloved sailors lost with the convoy and that hero of the republic who had succumbed not to superior force but had been sold out to the despised british for bloodies gold the heavy slanted blade rose slowly foot by agonising foot as if to draw things out for the mobs screaming pleasure before the pincerlike release mechanism locked in place the names the crimes the sentences were screeched out over the crowd roar the lanyard was tautened and then the blade flashed down to slam its great weight and its razorsharp edge into the bottom of the blocks and the heads of the criminals and traitors flew off to land in the bushelbaskets teeth in those harvested heads still chattering lips still writhing with a final prayer or protest eyes rolling like a slaughtered heifers and a gout a fountain an eruption of blood gushing outward as the hearts in those shortened bodies continued to beat in thudding terror for a moment or two and members of the crowd howled and shrieked with glee rushing to catch droplets on scraps of cloth for souvenirs last came the archtraitor the one who had betrayed a paragon of the revolution his own master etienne de gougne was hauled down from his tumbril its last occupant with his shirt open and his neck bared his long republican locks had been shorn at the nape so nothing would impede the blade hands bound behind his back bound from chest to waist in old castoff naval ropes too de gougne tried to struggle even so thinly screaming his innocence damning choundas as a bitter overly suspicious fool which protests made the mob shout even louder booing and laughing at his ridiculous desperation there was a drumroll that went on and on for what seemed like a whole minute after etiennes head was locked in place the mob liked suspense those executioners knew finally shisshhthudhurrah and the entertainment was done thus perish all who would spurn the superiority of our glorious republic desfourneaux intoned one hand lifted over the balcony balustrade like a church noble bestowing his general blessings well so much for that hainaut he continued turning amicable this puts an end to most of our spies and traitors for now some few may have eluded us but there is nothing like wholesale executions to run the rest into hiding or ineffectiveness we will get the rest eventually i am nothing if not a patient man he said with a supremely satisfied sniff tossing off the rest of his glass of wine i still cant believe that de gougne that timid little mouse could have hainaut dared to say guillaume choundas was noted for his nose where spies and reactionaries were concerned desfourneaux interrupted if in little else of late i am utterly convinced his instincts were correct choundas gone de gougne and his suspected collaborators gone the end of a problem chop ha ha desfourneaux tittered hainaut resisted the urge to rub the back of his neck to assure himself that his head was still attached and would most likely remain where god intended it for the nonce you and capitaine recamier must dine with me tonight hainaut desfourneaux happily suggested shall we say at eight when the heat of the day is dissipated i have appropriated choundass town mansion so you know the way i also sleep in your old bedchamber what tales it could tell hein he said with a sly leer well hainaut smirked shrugging like a man of the world executions ah desfourneaux frowned lowering his voice to cordial intimacy for some reason they excite me much as they did the amatory humours of the masses in paris in the early days going at each other in the court balconies the doorways of place de bastille an affirmation of life in the face of death perhaps you are known as one familiar with this islands ah pleasures hainaut maybe you could recommend to me a lady or ladies amenable to an evening of dalliance clean mind no english pox he blushingly quibbled handsome it goes without saying young and pretty not too tawdry not as tender as those your old master preferred mon dieu non you understand completely citizen hainaut replied his smirk turning to a knowing leer just the one as a mistress or a new one each evening two three at a time frenchborn creole partwhite or a swart tigress for a change of pace on guadeloupe everything is for sale anything is possible and so willing to please ah but of course i can aid your search citizen hainaut had whoremongered for choundas when succulent prisoners or their tender daughters were unavailable pimping for a voice of the directory could prove equally favourable to his cause m desfourneaux at least had conventional tastes he suspected so the courtesans hed already sampled would suit admirably and as long as he pimped he might as well profit from it a pact with madames and bordel owners the girls themselves could fill his own purse he contemplated strumming them first then escorting them to desfourneaux prepared for battle so to speakwith what the british termed battered bunsserving to desfourneaux his freshserved seconds might prove to be the drollest kind of geste overcharge him for islandmade sheepgut cundums would this afternoon prove soon enough citizen capitaine de fregate jules hainaut lazily enquired i have in mind a delectably sweet octoroon just barely seventeen but already possessed of skills one could not find in paris itself petite playful as a matter of fact hainaut i think i will go home at once take my midday meal so many preparations for our supper tonight desfourneaux announced all but fingering his crotch in anticipation uhm by three this afternoon you might ah by half past one citizen hainaut promised him and may i wish you bon appetit late that evening and far out to sea to windward of guadeloupe uss hancock prowled a moondrenched sea hungry for prey like a wraith on allhallows eve while citizen desfourneaux improved his digestif with a second courtesan fetched as a housewarming present by his old aidedecamp capitaine guillaume choundas sat on the edge of the hard bunk in his tiny dealpartitioned cabin forward of the officers gunroom beset by american cuisine saltpork soup beans yams ships biscuit and greasy gravy griped his innards like smelting lumps of ore and bile surged up now and then to sear his throat as for that cornwhisky they had offered pah griot in the insubstantial nextdoor cabin snored away insensible to swinish victuals defeat and captivity alike making choundas despise his peasants dullness his own ears and face burned with the utter shame of loss of being outwitted of failing so completely of being so wrong his repute and career were utterly lost his place sure to be awarded to one of the handsome swaggering charmers and all he had done would be forgotten dismissed as ancient history if remembered at all the americans might hold him gallingly inactive months and months years of pennypinching miserly parole and that swaggering pig lewrie still lived as if his life was charmed as if the very heavens the fickle ancient gods conspired to preserve and reward him choundas fantasised that hed find a way to kill him slip into england as a crippled emigre beggar and murder his wife and children if nothing else but how all his fortune would be gone he would be penniless and choundas could feel that time for revenge was growing shorter his marvelous body his iron constitution was betraying him if lewrie were to die by his hand it might be with his last breath as he had always vowed never suspecting nonetheless guillaume choundas vowed that he would murder his nemesis find a way to delude the simpleminded americans and escape destroy griot for letting him down for being a dull shopkeeper fraud in bearskin slippers not a venetic conqueror he would take revenge on faithless jules hainaut for abandoning the battle like the cynical coward he really was he would win back his position and honours but he had to press a grimy towel to his lips to stem a flood of bile and vomit had to squeeze his buttocks together to prevent an even greater shame before he could stagger aft to the quartergallery with the aid of a crude loaned crutch his bowels screamed in stony rendings and shuddery looseness both while fiery stabbings in his stomach popped cold woozy sicksweat that flooded his body like an arctic dunking weak and faint his sphinctre failed him and for the first time in his life guillaume choundas succumbed to despair giving out a faint bleak whimper as he crammed the end of the towel into his mouth to deny the world the pleasure of hearing his helplessness hot galling tears trickled from his eyes searing his cheeks to make his humiliation complete i must not die before he does please choundas whispered to the groaning oaken darkness almost in prayer but to which gods the hilltop overlooking the vast encampment was bathed in moonlight as general toussaint louverture stood under the fly of a grand pavillion that once had sheltered a french general of brigade in splendour looking down at his sleeping army and its guttering cookfires and felt his own despair for his longsuffering but hopeful people for the future of st domingue which some had begun to call haiti in creole patois its reluctant leader short bandylegged and unremarkable plied a cane fan seeing not a ragtag army but an island beset on all sides by a brutal opportunistic outside world just as the encampment was girded by forbidding forests and jungle the americans threatened those blandfaced smiling slaveowners must be shown that they could never buy or steal part or all of haiti he must use them but keep them at armslength else their merchants would buy or raid for slaves close to home much cheaper than human chattel shipped from west africa sadly there were haitians whod be more than happy to profit in such an evil trade preying on their darkest and poorest just like the kings of faroff dahomey or guinea the aggressive and wily british whod sent that perfect fool to barter with him still lusted for st domingue though they ruled all the other sugar isles already their gifts and pledges would bring fresh chains for his people too and so must be beguiled and strung along yet ultimately spurned andheartbreakinglymother france plotted to restore the plantation system to fill her war coffers with gold and if that newcome general hedouvilles schemes bore fruit hordes of the grands blancs would flood back in with a huge army of occupation to enforce their will vast profitable plantations would rearise their workers only halfstarved this time paid nexttonothing if not reenslaved outright after the requisite bloodbaths and taming massacres hedouville craftily hoped to divide conquer and weaken play rivals off in another war of the skin then crush the feeble winner to stave him off to counter that brute there was only one course of action open though toussaint louverture dreaded the price his people would have to pay but st dominguehaitimust be one or it was doomed so the islands reluctant unschooled master of war could not shrink from it if he wished his peoples fragile freedom passed to their future generations so in the morning before first light his sleeping soldiers must march on south province make a preemptive war of the skin on those who would rule a breakaway part of the whole for the profit of a few armed succoured and beholden to the reenslaving outsiders and make all the blood fire and horror suffered so farenough for the entire world enough for a millenniumto have been in vain before first light toussaint louverture would march against the mulatto republic and faithless general andre rigaud under that same moonlight hms proteus snored her way sutherly under all plain sail to the west of guadeloupe her eerie ghostgrey sails spiralling metronomefashion against the starstrewn sky five bells of the evening watch were struck up forward slowly tolling half past tendongdong dongdong dongthat the ships boy at the belfry let echo brassily on as he turned the halfhour glass and went back to nodding captain alan lewrie rn lay nude under a sheet in his swaying wideenoughfortwo bedcot flat on his back with his hands enlaced under the musty down pillows striving for sleep hed dined on fresh red snapper that gideon the frigates talented cook had caught in a slackwind hour that morning hed washed it down with a whole bottle of tangy fruitsweet beaujolais from a mixed case that the georgian capt randolph of uss oglethorpe had presented to him off one of those rich prizes theyd taken he should have been snoring but he wasnt he should have been pleasedyet he wasnt lewrie could congratulate himself that he had his greatcabins to himself that hed rid himself of that callow idiot the honourable grenville pelham even mr james peel as if hed made them walk the plank or marooned them on infamous and desolate sombrero cay like the pirates of old he could happily savour too the fact that his part in their schemes the doable part of allbutimpossible orders from the crown was over and done with and he could not imagine a reason why theyd call on his services ever again sometimes surliness and truculence had their uses he could gleefully contemplate yet he still heaved frustrated sighs stretching and wriggling to wring wakefulness from his body his mind still stewing on his one failure for guillaume choundas though captured and defanged still lived damn his eyes the look on the bastards face when he at last tumbled to how confining a gaol his parole had committed him to was simply priceless yet choundas was still so very clever lewrie was mortalcertain hed find a way to delude his yankee captors then do something thatd prove to his masters in france that he was still useful and effective playact meek crippled and inoffensive spy on them then sneak his observations to the directory somehow or would choundas think that revenge against him mattered more did he discover that desmond was his so young and trusting he still could find a way even in ballandchain and and what am i doing with a halfgrown son lewrie groaned in the darkness havent known him a dogwatch so whys he so dear lewrie hoped that his hastily penned letters might bear fruit one to james peel boasting his victory yet suggesting that had he ever done hm government good service could he shepherd the lad when he stepped ashore on antigua if choundas was landed there as well that james peel should do what should be done with choundas s life if there was a way before that monster could get to his newfound son several letters copies of the same one really to christopher cashman to every seaport town hed mentioned before sailing away to a new life in americasavannah charleston georgetown or port royal in south carolina wilmington or new bern in north carolina beaufort however differently pronounced in both states letters which pleaded with him that should he ever have loved him as a friend kit might take time from establishing himself to ascertain in which naval port that ogre choundas would spend his parole hire a crew of bullybucks for which lewrie would gladly reimburse him and i implore you my dearest friend for my peace and the peace of the world slay him a letter to warn desmond though how fearfully onguard a bold callow tween would bear himself did not bear thinking about one to his adoptive uncle and captain too though no matter how careful that capt mcgilliveray had vowed to be he simply couldnt grasp just how dangerous choundas was and something heavy up forrud slid then went thump thence came a crashthud that roused lewrie to his elbows what the bloody hell he groused rolling out of bed and wrapping himself in the sheet then padding towards the sounds to see what was the matter even by moonlight streaming in through the overhead coachtop lewrie could see that his chartspace was a mess rolled charts were scattered several books from the fiddlerack shelves were now on the slanted desktop and brass dividers and rulers were underfoot along with several pencils and capt mcgilliverays parting gift of a brace of rare and costly steelnib pens he thought hed carefully stowed good god amighty he muttered padding aft again and there were his housebreakers two sets of eyes peeked over the rim of the hatbox reflecting moonlight like four green glimmers of foxfire wide and innocent twerent us yer honour sir honest eyes boys boys he said sighing as he knelt before their hatbox lair toulon taking up most of it i expect such from chalky hes a newcome but i thought you knew better toulon settle down to sleep like catsre supposed to cant you some eagerly received pets and strokes and they did curl up in a furry heap chalky the kitten swarming over toulon to cuddle and lick his elders head which prompted grooming licks in return from his partner in crimeand how theyd come to such a close mischievous companionship so quickly lewrie couldnt fathom though it beat the first few days slanging matches and hostilities all hollow he could gladly admit to himself as he clambered back into bed and settled his sheet thumps and grunts slaps and hightoned trills and deep meows then the hatbox was overset and a new romp was on paws thundering on the canvas deckcover from the transom settee to the gundeck door gawd lewrie implored the night and the overhead deck beams as he pummeled his pillows give me patience
