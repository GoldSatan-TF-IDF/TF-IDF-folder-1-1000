jack higgins on dangerous ground prologue chungking august thepilot flight lieutenant joe caine of raf transport command was tired frozen to the bone his hands clamped to the control column he eased it forward and took the plane down emerging from low cloud at three thousand feet into driving rain the aircraft ploughing its way through heavy cloud and thunderstorm was a douglas dc the famous dakota as much a workhorse for the american air force as the raf who together operated them out of the assam airfields of north india flying supplies to chiang kaisheks chinese army on their way they negotiated the infamous hump as it was known to allied aircrews the himalayan mountains trying to survive in some of the worst flying conditions in the world there she is skipper the second pilot said dead ahead three miles and the usual lousy blackout caine said which was true enough the inhabitants of chungking were notoriously lazy in that respect and there were lights all over the place well here we go he said message from control tower the wireless operator called from behind caine switched on to vhf and called the tower sugar nan here is there a problem priority traffic coming in please go round a neutral voice said for gods sake caine replied angrily ive just clocked miles over the hump were tired cold and almost out of fuel vip traffic to starboard and below you go round please acknowledge the voice was firm the second pilot looked out of the side then turned about five hundred feet below skipper another dakota a yank from the look of it all right caine said wearily and banked to port the man who stood on the porch of the station commanders office staring up into the rain listening to the sound of the first dakota coming in wore the uniform of a viceadmiral of the british navy a trenchcoat over his shoulders his name was lord louis mountbatten and he was cousin to the king of england a highly decorated war hero he was also supreme allied commander south east asia the burly american general in steelrimmed spectacles who emerged behind him pausing to light a cigarette was general vinegar joe stillwell his deputy and also chief of staff to chiang kaishek the greatest expert on china of anyone in the allied forces he was also fluent in cantonese he perched on the rail well here he comes the great chairman mao what happened to chiang kaishek mountbatten asked found an excuse to go upcountry its no use louis mao and chiang will never get together they both want the same thing china mountbatten said exactly yes well id like to remind you this isnt the pacific joe twentyfive jap divisions in china and since the start of their april offensive theyve been winning no one knows that better than you we need mao and his communist army its as simple as that they watched the dakota land stillwell said the washington viewpoint is simple weve given enough lendlease to chiang and what have we got for it mountbatten asked he sits on his backside doing nothing saving his ammunition and equipment for the civil war with the communists when the japs are beaten a civil war hell probably win stillwell said do you really think so mountbatten shook his head you know in the west mao and his people are looked upon as agrarian revolutionaries that all they want is land for the peasants and you dont agree frankly i think theyre more communist than the russians i think they could well drive chiang kaishek out of mainland china and take over after the war an interesting thought stillwell told him but if youre talking about making friends and influencing people thats up to you washington wont play fresh supplies of arms and ammunition must come from your people not american sources well have a big enough problem handling japan after the war china is your baby the dakota came toward them and stopped a couple of waitingground crew wheeled steps forward and waited for the door to open so you dont think im asking dear old chairman mao too much hell no stillwell laughed to be honest louis if he agrees i dont see how youll be getting very much in return for all that aid you intend to give him better than nothing old sport especially if he agrees the door swung open a young chinese officer emerged a moment later mao tsetung appeared he paused for a moment looking toward them wearing only a simple uniform and cap with the red star then he started down the steps mao tsetung chairman of the chinese communist party was at that time fiftyone a brilliant politician a master of guerilla warfare and a soldier of genius he was also the implacable foe of chiang kaishek and the two sides had been engaged in open warfare instead of taking on the japanese together in the office he sat behind the station commanders desk the young officer behind him to one side of mountbatten and stillwell stood a british army major his left eye was covered by a black eye patch and the badge in his cap was that of the highland light infantry a corporal wearing the bonnet of the same regiment stood against the wall behind him a cardboard office file under his left arm stillwell said in fluent cantonese ill be happy to translate for these proceedings chairman mao mao sat facing him face enigmatic then said in excellent english an ability he seldom advertised general my time is limited stillwell stared at him in astonishment and mao said to mountbatten who is this officer and the man with him mountbatten said major ian campbell chairman one of my aides the corporal is his batman their regiment is the highland light infantry batman mao enquired a soldier servant mountbatten explained ah i see mao nodded enigmatically and turned to campbell the highlands of scotland am i right a strange people the english put you to the sword turned your people off their land and yet you go to war for them ian campbell said i am a highlander flesh and bone a thousand years behind me laird of loch dhu castle and all around like my father and his before me and if the english need a helping hand now and then why not mao actually smiled and turned to mountbatten i like this man you should lend him to me not possible chairman mao shrugged then to business i have little time i must make the return journey in no more than thirty minutes what do you offer me mountbatten glanced at stillwell who shrugged and the admiral said to mao our american friends are not able to offer arms and ammunition to you and your forces but everything the generallisimo needs they will supply mao asked he stayed surprisingly calm and mountbatten said i believe i have a solution what if the raf flew in ten thousand tons a month over the hump to kunming assorted weapons ammunition and so forth mao selected a cigarette from an old silver case and the young officer lit it for him the chairman blew out a long plume of smoke and what would i have to do for such munificence something mountbatten said i mean we have to have something thats only fair and what would you have in mind mountbatten lit a cigarette himself walked to the open door and looked out at the rain he turned the hong kong treaty the lease to britain it expires july first nineteen ninetyseven so id like you to extend it by one hundred years there was a long silence mao leaned back and blew smoke to the ceiling my friend i think the rains have driven you a little crazy generallisimo chiang kaishek rules china the japanese permitting of course but the japanese will go mountbatten said and then the room was very quiet mountbatten turned and nodded the corporal clicked his heels and passed the file to major campbell who opened it and took out a document which he passed across the desk to the chairman this is not a treaty but a covenant mountbatten said the chungking covenant i call it if you will read it and approve it with your signature above mine you will agree to extend if you ever control china the hong kong treaty by a hundred years in exchange his majestys government will supply you with all your military needs mao tsetung examined the document then glanced up have you a pen lord mountbatten it was the corporal who supplied one moving in quickly mao signed the document major campbell produced three more copies and laid them on the table mao signed each one mountbatten countersigned he handed the pen back to the corporal and stood up a good nights work he said to mountbatten but now i must go he started for the door and mountbatten said a moment mr chairman youre forgetting your copy of the covenant mao turned later he said when it has been countersigned by churchill mountbatten stared at him churchill but of course naturally this should not delay the flow of arms but i do look forward to receiving my copy signed by the man himself is there a problem no mountbatten pulled himself together no of course not good and now i must go there is work to do gentlemen he went out and down the steps followed by the young officer crossed to the dakota and went in the door was closed the steps wheeled away the plane started to taxi and stillwell burst into laughter god help me thats the weirdest thing ive seen in years he certainly is a character what are you going to do send the damn thing to london for churchills signature of course mountbatten turned back in the entrance and said to major campbell ian im going to give you a chance to have dinner at the savoy i want you on your way to london as soon as possible with a dispatch from me for the prime minister did i hear another plane land yes sir a dakota from assam good give orders for it to be refueled and turned around mountbatten glanced at the corporal you can take tanner with you fine sir campbell shuffled the papers to put them in the file and mountbatten said three copies one for mao another for the prime minister and the third for president roosevelt didnt i sign four i took the liberty of making an extra copy sir just in case of accidents campbell said good man ian mountbatten nodded on your way then only one night out at the savoy then straight back of course sir campbell saluted and went out followed by tanner stillwell lit a cigarette hes a strange one campbell lost his eye at dunkirk mountbatten said got a wellearned military cross best aide i ever had whats all this laird of loch dhu crap stillwell said you english are really crazy ah but campbell isnt english hes scots and more than that hes a highlander as laird of loch dhu he heads a sect of clan campbell and that joe is a tradition that existed before the vikings sailed to america he walked to the door and stared out at the driving rain stillwell joined him are we going to win louis oh yes mountbatten nodded its what will come after that bothers me in campbells quarters tanner packed the majors holdall with military thoroughness while campbell shaved they had been together since boyhood for tanners father had been a gamekeeper on the loch dhu estate and together they endured the shattering experience of dunkirk when campbell had first worked for mountbatten at combined operations headquarters in london he had taken the corporal with him as his batman the move to south east asia command had followed that but to jack tanner good soldier with a military medal for bravery in the field to prove it campbell would never be anything else but the laird the major came out of the bathroom drying his hands he adjusted the black eye patch and smoothed his hair then pulled on his tunic got the briefcase jack tanner held it up the papers are inside laird he always gave campbell the title when they were alone campbell said open it take out the fourth copy the extra copy tanner did as he was told and passed it to him the single sheet of paper was headed supreme allied commander south east asia command mao had signed it not only in english but in chinese with mountbatten countersigning there you are jack campbell said as he folded it piece of history here if mao wins hong kong will stay british until july first twenty ninetyseven you think it will happen laird who knows weve got to win the war first pass me my bible will you tanner went to the dresser where the majors toilet articles were laid out the bible was about six inches by four with a cover of embossed silver a celtic cross standing out clearly it was very old a campbell had carried it to war for many centuries it had been found in the pocket of the majors ancestor who had died fighting for bonnie prince charlie at culloden it had been recovered from the body of his uncle killed on the somme in campbell took it everywhere tanner opened it the inside of the bibles cover was also silver he felt carefully with his nail it sprang open revealing a small hidden compartment campbell folded the sheet of paper to the appropriate size and fitted it in closing the lid top secret jack only you and i know its there your highland oath on it you have it laird shall i put it in the holdall laird no ill carry it in my map pocket there was a knock at the door tanner went to open it and flight lieutenant caine stepped in he was carrying heavy flying jackets and sheepskin boots youll need these sir well probably have to go as high as twenty thousand over part of the hump bloody freezing up there the young man looked tired dark circles under his eyes campbell said im sorry about this i know youve only just got in thats all right sir i carry a copilot pilot officer giffard we can spell each other we also have a navigator and wireless operator well make out he smiled one can hardly say no to lord mountbatten all the way to delhi on this one i see thats right then onwards to london wish i was doing that leg of the trip caine opened the door and looked out at the rain never stops does it what a bloody country ill see you at the plane sir he went out campbell said right jack lets get moving they pulled on the flying boots the heavy sheepskin jackets finally ready tanner picked up his holdall and the majors on your way jack tanner moved out campbell glanced around the room reached for his cap and put it on then he picked up the bible put it in the map pocket of his flying jacket and fastened the flap strange but he felt more than tired it was as if he had reached the end of something his highland blood speaking again he shrugged the feeling off turned and went out into the rain following tanner to the dakota to kunming from chungking was four hundred and fifty miles they took the opportunity to refuel and then pressed on to the most hazardous section of the trip the five hundred and fifty miles over the hump to the assam airfields conditions were appalling heavy rain and thunderstorms and the kind of turbulence that threatened to break the plane up several hundred aircrew had died making this run over the past couple of years campbell knew that it was probably the most hazardous flying duty in the raf or the usaf he wondered what persuaded men to volunteer for such work and while thinking about it actually managed some sleep only surfacing as they came into their assam destination to refuel the onward trip to delhi was another eleven hundred miles and a completely different proposition blue skies considerable heat and no wind to speak of the dakota coasted along at ten thousand feet and caine leaving the flying to giffard came back and tried to get a couple of hours sleep campbell dozed again and came awake to find the wireless operator shaking caine by the shoulder delhi in fifteen minutes skipper caine got up yawning he grinned at campbell piece of cake this leg isnt it as he turned away there was an explosion pieces of metal flew off the port engine there was thick black smoke and as the propeller stopped turning the dakota banked and dived steeply throwing caine off his feet campbell was hurled against the bulkhead behind with such force that he was almost knocked senseless the result was that he couldnt really take in what was happening there was a kind of nightmare as if the world was breaking up around him the impact of the crash the smell of burning and someone screaming he was aware of being in water managed to focus his eyes and found himself being dragged through a paddy field by a wildeyed tanner blood on his face the corporal heaved him onto a dyke then turned and hurried back kneedeep in water to the dakota which was burning fiercely now when he was halfway there it blew up with a tremendous explosion debris cascaded everywhere and tanner turned and came back wearily he eased the major higher on the dyke and found a tin of cigarettes his hand shook as he lit one are we hit campbell managed to croak so it would appear laird dear god campbells hands moved over his chest the bible he whispered dinna fash yourself laird ill hold it safe for you tanner took it from the map pocket and then all sounds faded for campbell all color nothing now but quiet darkness in chungking mountbatten and stillwell were examining on the map the relentless progress of the advancing japanese who had already overrun most of the allied airfields in eastern china i thought we were supposed to be winning the war stillwell said mountbatten smiled ruefully so did i behind him the door opened and an aide entered with a signal flimsy sorry to bother you sir but this is from delhimarked urgent mountbatten read it then swore softly all right you can go the aide went out stillwell said bad news the dakota campbell was traveling in lost an engine and crashed just outside delhi it fireballed after landing by all accounts the documents and my dispatches went with it is campbell dead no that corporal of his managed to get him out all the crew were killed it seems campbell received a serious head injury hes in a coma lets hope he hangs in there stillwell said anyway something of a setback for you your chungking covenant going up in flames what will you do try to get mao to sign another one i doubt if ill ever get close enough to him again it was always an anythingisbetterthannothing situation i didnt really expect much to come out of it anyway in my experience chinese seldom give you a second bite at the cherry i agree stillwell said in any case the wily old bastard is probably already regretting putting his signature to that thing but what about his supplies oh well see he gets those because i want him actively on our side taking on the japanese the hong kong business was never serious joe i thought we ought to get something out of the deal if we could and the hong kong thing was all that the prime minister and i could come up with not that it matters now weve got far more serious things to consider he walked back to the wall map now show me exactly where those japanese forward units are london one norah bell got out of the taxi close to st jamess stairs on wapping high street she paid off the cab driver and walked away a small hippy darkhaired girl in leather jacket tight black mini skirt and highheeled ankle boots she walked well with a sort of total movement of the whole body the cab driver watched her put up her umbrella against the heavy rain sighed deeply and drove away she paused on the first corner and bought an evening standard the front page was concerned with only one thing the arrival of the american president in london that day to meet with both the israeli and british prime ministers to discuss developments in the palestinian situation she folded the newspaper put it under her left arm and turned the corner of the next street walking down toward the thames the youth standing in a doorway opposite was perhaps eighteen and wore laceup boots jeans and shabby bomber jacket with the ring in his left nostril and the swastika tattooed on his forehead he was typical of a certain type of gang animal that roamed the city streets in search of prey she looked easy meat and he went after her quickly only running in at the last minute to grab her from behind one hand over her mouth she didnt struggle went completely still which should have told him something but by then he was beyond reason charged with the wrong kind of sexual excitement just do as youre told he said and i wont hurt you he urged her into the porch of a longdisused warehouse pushing against her she said no need to be rough to his amazement she kissed him her tongue flickering in his mouth he couldnt believe his luck and still clutching her umbrella she moved her other hand down between them brushing against his hardness jesus he moaned and kissed her again aware that her hand seemed to be easing up her skirt she found what she was looking for the flick knife tucked into the top of her right stocking it came up the blade jumped and she sliced open the left side of his face from the corner of the eye to the chin he screamed falling back she said calmly putting the point under his chin do you want some more he was more afraid than he had ever been in his life no for gods sake no she wiped the blade on his jacket then go away he moved out into the rain then turned holding a handkerchief to his face bitch ill get you for this no you wont her accent was unmistakably ulster irish youll find the nearest casualty department as fast as you can get yourself stitched up and put the whole thing down to experience she watched him go closed the knife slipping it back in the top of the stocking then she turned and continued down toward the thames moving along the waterfront finally pausing at an old warehouse there was a judas gate in the main entrance she opened it and went in it was a place of shadows but at the far end there was a glass office with a light in it it was reached by a flight of wooden stairs as she moved toward it a young darkskinned man moved out of the darkness a browning hipower in one hand and who might you be she asked the door of the office was opened and a small man with dark tousled hair wearing a reefer jacket appeared is that you norah and who else she replied whos your friend ali halabi meet norah bell come away up im sorry the arab said she ignored him and went up the stairs and he followed noting with approval the way her skirt tightened over her hips when she went into the office the man in the reefer coat put his hands on her shoulders god help me but you look good enough to eat and he kissed her lightly on the lips save the blarney she put her umbrella on the desk opened her handbag and took out a packet of cigarettes anything in a skirt michael ahern ive known you too long she put a cigarette in her mouth and the arab hurriedly took out a lighter and lit it for her he turned to ahern the lady is part of your organization well im not with the bloody ira she said were prods mister if you know what that means norah and i were in the ulster volunteer force together and then the red hand of ulster ahern said until we had to move on norah laughed harshly until they threw us out a bunch of old women that lot we were killing too many catholics for their liking i see ali halabi said is it catholics who are your target or the ira the same difference she said im from belfast mr halabi my father was an army sergeant killed in the falklands war my mother my kid sister my old granddad all the family i had in the world were killed in a street bomb planted by the ira back in eightysix you might say ive been taking my revenge ever since but we are open to offers ahern said amiably any revolutionary organization needs money the door banged below ali took the gun from his pocket and ahern moved to the door is that you billy as ever was would that be billy quigley norah asked who else ahern turned to ali another one the red hand threw out billy and i did some time together in the maze prison quigley was a small wiry man in an old raincoat he had faded blond hair and a careworn face that was old beyond his years jesus is that you norah hello billy you got my message ahern said yes i drop in to the william of orange in kilburn most nights ahern said to ali kilburn is what you might call the irish quarter of london plenty of good irish pubs there catholic and protestant this by the way is ali halabi from iran so whats it all about quigley demanded this ahern held up the evening standard with the headline about the american president ali here represents a group of fundamentalists in iran called the army of god they shall we say deeply deplore arafats deal with israel over the new status of palestine they are even more unhappy with the american president presiding over that meeting at the white house and giving it his blessing so quigley said theyd like me to blow him up for them while hes in london me having a certain reputation in that field for five million pounds ali halabi said dont let us forget that half of which is already on deposit in geneva ahern smiled by god billy couldnt we give the ira a run for their money with a million pounds to spend on arms quigleys face was pale the american president you wouldnt dare not even you norah laughed that distinctive harsh laugh oh yes he would ahern turned to her are you with me girl i wouldnt miss it for the world and you billy quigley licked dry lips and hesitated ahern put a hand on his shoulder in or out billy quigley smiled suddenly why not a man can only die once how do we do it come down below and ill show you ahern led the way down the steps and switched on a light at the bottom there was a vehicle parked in a corner covered by a dust sheet which he pulled away revealing a british telecom truck where in the hell did you get that quigley demanded someone knocked it off for me months ago i was going to leave it outside one of those catholic pubs in kilburn with five hundred pounds of semtex inside and blow the hell out of some sinn fein bastards but i decided to hang on to it until something really important turned up ahern smiled cheerfully and now it has but how do you intend to pull it off ali demanded hundreds of these things all over london they can park anywhere without being interfered with because they usually have a manhole cover up while the engineers do what they have to do so quigley said dont ask me how but i have access through sources to the presidents schedule tomorrow he leaves the american embassy in grosvenor square at ten oclock in the morning to go to number ten downing street they take the park lane route turning into constitution hill beside green park can you be sure of that norah asked they always do love believe me he turned to quigley and ali you two dressed in telecom overalls which are inside the van will park halfway along constitution hill theres a huge beech tree you cant miss it as i say you park lift the manhole cover put up your signs and so on youll be there at ninethirty at ninefortyfive you walk away through green park to piccadilly there are some mens toilets you can get rid of your overalls there and then what ali demanded ill be in a car waiting with norah for the golden moment as the presidents cavalcade reaches the telecom truck ill detonate by remote control he smiled itll work i promise you well probably kill everyone in the cavalcade there was silence a kind of awe on quigleys face and norah was excited face pale you bastard she said you think it will work oh yes he turned to ali and you youre willing to take part an honor mr ahern and you billy ahern turned to him theyll be singing about us for years quigley said good man yourself billy ahern looked at his watch seven oclock i could do with a bite to eat how about you norah fine she said good im taking the telecom van away now i shant be returning to this place ill pick you two up in the mall at nine oclock in the morning youll arrive separately and wait at the park gates across from marlborough road norah will be behind me in a car you two will take over and well follow any questions ali halabi was incredibly excited i cant wait good off you go now well leave separately the arab went out and ahern turned to quigley and held out his hand a big one this eh billy the biggest michael right norah and i will go now come and open the main gate for us ill leave you to put out the lights and follow on they went downstairs norah climbed into the passenger seat but ahern shook his head move into the rear out of sight and pass me one of those orange jackets weve got to look right if a copper sees you he might get curious it said british telecom across the back of the jacket itll never catch on she told him he laughed and drove out into the street waving at quigley who closed the gate behind them he traveled only a few yards then swung into a yard and switched off the engine what is it she demanded youll see follow me and keep your mouth shut he opened the judas gate gently and stepped in quigley was in the office they could hear his voice and when they reached the bottom of the stairs they could even hear what he was saying yes brigadier ferguson most urgent there was a pause then patch me through you silly bugger this is life or death ahern took a walther from his pocket and screwed on a silencer as he went up norah behind him the door was open and quigley sat on the edge of the desk brigadier ferguson he said suddenly its billy quigley you said only to call you when it was big well this couldnt be bigger michael ahern and that bitch norah bell and some iranian named ali halabi are going to try to blow up the american president tomorrow there was a pause yes im supposed to be in on it well this is the way of it billy boy ahern said thats really naughty of you as quigley turned he shot him between the eyes quigley went back over the desk and ahern picked up the phone are you there brigadier michael ahern here youll need a new man he replaced the receiver turned off the office light and turned to norah lets go my love you knew he was an informer she said oh yes i think thats why they let him out of the maze prison early he was serving life remember they must have offered him a deal the dirty bastard she said and now hes screwed everything up not at all ahern said you see norah its all worked out exactly as i planned he opened the van door and handed her in well go and get a bite to eat and then ill tell you how were really going to hit the president in aware of the growing problem of terrorism the british prime minister of the day ordered the setting up of a small elite intelligence unit which became known rather bitterly in intelligence circles as the prime ministers private army as it owed allegiance only to that office brigadier charles ferguson had headed the unit since its inception had served many prime ministers but had no political allegiance whatsoever his office was on the third floor of the ministry of defence overlooking horse guards avenue he had been working late when quigleys call was patched through he was a rather untidylooking man in a guards tie and tweed suit and was standing looking out of his window when there was a knock at the door the woman who entered was in her late twenties and wore a fawn trouser suit of excellent cut and black hornrimmed glasses that contrasted with closecropped red hair she could have been a top secretary or pa she was in fact a detective chief inspector of police from special branch at scotland yard borrowed by ferguson as his assistant after the untimely death in the line of duty of her predecessor her name was hannah bernstein was there something brigadier you could say so when you worked with antiterrorism at scotland yard did you ever come across a michael ahern irish terrorist orange protestant variety wasnt he red hand of ulster and norah bell oh yes hannah bernstein said a very bleak prospect that one i had an informer billy quigley in deep cover he just phoned me to say that ahern was masterminding a plot to blow up the american president tomorrow hed recruited quigley bell is involved and an iranian named ali halabi excuse me sir but i know who halabi is he belongs to the army of god thats an extreme fundamentalist group very much opposed to the israelipalestine accord really ferguson said that is interesting even more interesting is that quigley was shot dead while filling me in ahern actually had the cheek to pick up the phone and speak to me told me it was him said id need a new man a cool bastard sir oh hes that all right anyway notify everyone scotland yard antiterrorist unit mi five and security at the american embassy obviously the secret servicemen guarding the president will have a keen interest right sir she turned to the door and he said one more thing i need dillon on this she turned dillon sir sean dillon dont pretend you dont know who i mean the only sean dillon i know sir was the most feared enforcer the ira ever had and if im right he tried to blow up the prime minister and the war cabinet in february nineteen ninetyone during the gulf war and nearly succeeded ferguson said but he works for this department now chief inspector so get used to it he only recently completed a most difficult assignment on the prime ministers orders that saved the royal family considerable grief i need dillon so find him now on your way ahern had a studio flat in what had been a warehouse beside the canal in camden he parked the telecom van in the garage then took norah up in what had been the old freight hoist the studio was simply furnished the wooden floor sanded and varnished a rug here and there two or three large sofas the paintings on the wall were very modern nice she said but it doesnt seem you it isnt im on a six months lease he opened the drinks cabinet found a bottle of jameson irish whiskey and poured some into two glasses he offered her one then opened a window and stepped out onto a small platform overlooking the canal whats going on michael she said i mean we dont really stand much of a chance of blowing up the president on constitution hill not now i never thought for a moment that i could you should remember norah that i never let my left hand know what my right is doing explain she said because of quigleys phone call wherever the president goes tomorrow theyll be on tenterhooks now follow my reasoning if there is an abortive explosion on his intended route to number ten downing street everyone heaves a sigh of relief especially if they find whats left of halabi there go on they wont expect another attempt the same day in an entirely different context my god she said you planned this all along you used quigley poor sod ahern brushed past her and helped himself to more whiskey once they have their explosion theyll think thats it but it wont be you see tomorrow night at seventhirty the american president the prime minister and selected guests board the riverboat jersey lily at cadogan pier on the chelsea embankment for an evening of frivolity and cocktails cruising the thames past the houses of parliament ending up at westminster pier the catering is in the hands of orsini and co of whom you and i are employed as waiters he opened a drawer and took out two security cards my name is harry smith nice and innocuous youll note the false moustache and hornrimmed glasses ill add those later mary hunt norah said that does sound prim where did you get my photo an old one i had i got a photographer friend to touch it up and add the spectacles they intend a cocktail party on the forward deck weather permitting what about weapons how would we get through security taken care of an associate of mine was working as a crew member until yesterday hes left two silenced walthers wrapped in cling film at the bottom of the sand in a fire bucket in one of the mens restrooms and that was after the security people did their checks very clever im no kamikaze norah i intend to survive this we hit from the upper decks with silenced weapons hell go down as if hes having a heart attack and what happens to us the ship has an inflatable tender on a line at the stern my associate checked it out it has an outboard motor in the confusion well drop in and head for the other side of the river as long as the confusion is confusion enough nothings perfect in this life are you with me oh yes she said to the final end michael whatever comes good girl he put an arm round her and squeezed now could we go and get something to eat im starving two a strange man sean dillon ferguson said id say that was an understatement sir hannah bernstein told him they were sitting in the rear of fergusons daimler threading their way through the west end traffic he was born in belfast but his mother died in childbirth his father came to work in london so the boy went to school here incredible talent for acting he did a year at the royal academy of dramatic art and one or two roles at the national theatre he also has a flair for languages everything from irish to russian all very impressive sir but he still ended up shooting people for the provisional ira yes well that was because his father on a trip home to belfast got caught in some crossfire and was killed by a british army patrol dillon took the oath did a fast course on weaponry in libya and never looked back why the switch from the ira to the international scene disenchantment with the glorious cause dillon is a thoroughly ruthless man when he has to be hes killed many times in his career but the random bomb that kills women and children lets say thats not his style are you trying to tell me he actually has some notion of morality ferguson laughed well he certainly never played favorites worked for the plo but also as an underwater specialist for the israelis for money of course naturally our sean does like the good things in life the attempt to blow up downing street that was for money saddam hussein was behind that and yet eighteen months later he flies a light plane loaded with medical supplies for children into bosnia and no payment involved what happened did god speak down through the clouds to him or something does it matter the serbs had him and his prospects to put it mildly looked bleak i did a deal with them which saved him from a firing squad in return he came to work for me slate wiped clean excuse me sir but thats a slate that will never wipe clean my dear chief inspector there are many occasions in this line of work when its useful to be able to set a thief to catch one if you are to continue to work for me youll have to get used to the idea he peered out as they turned into grafton street are you sure hes at this place so they tell me sir his favorite restaurant excellent ferguson said i could do with a bite to eat myself sean dillon sat in the upstairs bar of mulligans irish restaurant and worked his way through a dozen oysters and half a bottle of krug champagne to help things along as he read the evening paper he was a small man no more than fivefeetfive with hair so fair that it was almost white he wore dark cord jeans an old black leather flying jacket a white scarf at his throat the eyes were his strangest feature like water over a stone clear no color and there was a permanent slight ironic quirk to the corner of his mouth the look of a man who no longer took life too seriously so there you are charles ferguson said and dillon glanced up and groaned no place to hide not tonight ill have a dozen of those and a pint of guinness a young waitress standing by had heard dillon said to her in irish a fine lordly englishman a colleen but his mother god rest her was irish so give him what he wants the girl gave him a smile of true devotion and went away ferguson sat down and dillon looked up at hannah bernstein and who might you be girl this is detective chief inspector hannah bernstein special branch my new assistant and i dont want you corrupting her now wheres my guinness it was then that she received her first shock for as dillon stood he smiled and it was like no smile she had ever seen before warm and immensely charming changing his personality completely she had come here wanting to dislike this man but now he took her hand and what would a nice jewish girl like you be doing in such bad company will you have a glass of champagne i dont think so im on duty she was slightly uncertain now and took a seat dillon went to the bar returned with another glass and poured krug into it when youre tired of champagne youre tired of life what a load of cobblers she said but took the glass ferguson roared with laughter beware this one dillon she ran across a hoodlum emerging from a supermarket with a sawedoff shotgun last year unfortunately for him she was working the american embassy detail that week and had a smith and wesson in her handbag so you convinced him of his wicked ways dillon said she nodded something like that fergusons guinness and oysters appeared weve got trouble dillon bad trouble tell him chief inspector which she did in a few brief sentences when she was finished dillon took a cigarette from a silver case and lit it with an oldfashioned zippo lighter so what do you think she asked well all we know for certain is that billy quigley is dead but he did manage to speak to the brigadier hannah said which surely means ahern will abort the mission why should he dillon said youve got nothing except the word that he intends to try and blow up the president sometime tomorrow where when have you even the slightest idea and ill bet his schedule is extensive it certainly is ferguson said downing street in the morning with the pm and the israeli prime minister cocktail party on a river steamer tomorrow night and most things in between none of which hes willing to cancel im afraid not ferguson shook his head ive already had a call from downing street the president refuses to change a thing hannah bernstein said do you know ahern personally oh yes dillon told her he tried to kill me a couple of times and then we met for facetoface negotiations during a truce in derry and his girlfriend dillon shook his head whatever else norah bell is she isnt that sex isnt her bag she was just an ordinary workingclass girl until her family was obliterated by an ira bomb these days shed kill the pope if she could and ahern hes a strange one its always been like a game to him hes a brilliant manipulator i recall his favorite saying that he didnt like his left hand to know what his right hand was doing and whats that supposed to mean ferguson demanded just that nothings ever what it seems with ahern there was a small silence then ferguson said everyone is on this case weve got them pumping out a not very good photo of the man himself and an even more inferior one of the girl hannah bernstein said ferguson swallowed an oyster any ideas on finding him as a matter of fact i have dillon said theres a protestant pub in kilburn the william of orange i could have words there then what are we waiting for ferguson swallowed his last oyster and stood up lets go the william of orange in kilburn had a surprising look of belfast about it with the fresco of king william victorious at the battle of the boyne on the whitewashed wall at one side it could have been any orange pub in the shankhill you wouldnt exactly fit in at the bar you two dillon said as he sat in the back of the daimler i need to speak to a man called paddy driscoll what is he uvf ferguson asked lets say hes a fundraiser wait here im going round the back go with him chief inspector ferguson ordered dillon sighed all right brigadier but im in charge ferguson nodded do as he says dillon got out and started along the pavement are you carrying he asked of course good you never know what will happen next in this wicked old world he paused in the entrance to a yard took a walther from his waistband at the rear produced a carswell silencer and screwed it into place then he slipped it inside his flying jacket they crossed the cobbled yard through the rain aware of music from the bar area where some loyalist band thumped out the sash my father wore through the rear window was a view of an extensive kitchen a small grayhaired man seated at a table doing accounts thats driscoll dillon whispered in we go driscoll at the table was aware of some of his papers fluttering in a sudden draft of wind looked up and found dillon entering the room hannah bernstein behind him god bless all here dillon said and the best of the night yet to come paddy me old son dear god sean dillon there was naked fear on driscolls face plus your very own detective chief inspector we are treating you well tonight what do you want hannah leaned against the door and dillon pulled a chair over and sat across the table from driscoll he took out a cigarette and lit it michael ahern where might he be jesus sean i havent seen that one in years billy quigley dont tell me you havent seen billy because i happen to know he drinks here regularly driscoll tried to tough it out sure billy comes in all the time but as for ahern he shrugged hes bad news that one sean yes but im worse in one swift movement dillon pulled the walther from inside his flying jacket leveled it and fired there was a dull thud the lower half of driscolls left ear disintegrated and he moaned a hand to the ear blood spurting dillon for gods sake hannah cried i dont think hes got much to do with it dillon raised the walther now the other one no ill tell you driscoll moaned ahern did phone here yesterday he left a message for billy i gave it to him around five oclock when he came in for a drink what was it he was to meet him at a place off wapping high street a warehouse called olivers brick wharf driscoll fumbled for a handkerchief sobbing with pain dillon slipped the gun inside his flying jacket and got up there you are he said that didnt take long youre a bastard dillon hannah bernstein said as she opened the door its been said before dillon turned in the doorway one more thing paddy michael ahern killed billy quigley earlier tonight we know that for a fact dear god driscoll said thats right id stay out of it if i were you dillon said and closed the door gently shall i call for backup sir hannah bernstein said as the daimler eased into brick wharf beside the thames ferguson put his window down and looked out i shouldnt think it matters chief inspector if he was here hes long gone lets go and see it was dillon who led the way in the walther ready in his left hand stepping through the judas gate feeling for the switch on the wall flooding the place with light at the bottom of the steps he found the office switch and led the way up billy quigley lay on his back on the other side of the desk dillon stood to one side shoving the walther back inside his flying jacket and ferguson and hannah bernstein moved forward is that him sir she asked im afraid so ferguson sighed take care of it chief inspector she started to call in on her mobile phone and he turned and went down the stairs followed by dillon he went out into the street and stood by a rail overlooking the thames as dillon joined him hannah bernstein appeared ferguson said well what do you think i cant believe he didnt know that billy was an informer dillon said ferguson turned to hannah which means if dillons right sir ahern is playing some sort of game with us but what ferguson demanded there are times for waiting brigadier and this is one of them dillon said if you want my thoughts on the matter its simple were in aherns hands there will be a move tomorrow sooner rather than later based on that i might have some thoughts but not before dillon lit a cigarette with his old zippo turned and walked back to the daimler it was just before nine the following morning when ahern drove the telecom van along the mall stopping at the park gates opposite marlborough road norah followed him in a toyota sedan ali halabi was standing by the gates dressed in a green anorak and jeans he hurried forward no sign of quigley get in the arab did as he was told and ahern passed him one of the orange telecom jackets hes ill suffers from chronic asthma and the stress has brought on an attack he shrugged not that it matters all you have to do is drive the van norah and i will lead you to your position just get out lift the manhole cover then walk away through the park are you still on absolutely halabi said good then follow us and everything will be all right ahern got out halabi slid behind the wheel god is great he certainly is my old son ahern said and he turned and walked back to norah parked at the curb in the toyota norah went all the way round passing buckingham palace turning up grosvenor place and back along constitution hill by the park on aherns instructions she pulled in at the curb opposite the beech tree and paused ahern put his arm out of the window and raised a thumb as they moved away the telecom van eased into the curb there was a steady flow of traffic ahern let her drive about fifty yards then told her to pull in they could see halabi get out he went round to the back of the van and opened the doors he returned with a clamp leaned down and prised up the manhole cover hes working well is the boy ahern said he took a small plastic remote control unit from his pocket and pressed a button behind them the van fireballed and two cars passing it caught in the blast were blown across the road thats what dedication gets for you ahern tapped norah on the shoulder right girl dear billy told them theyd get an explosion and theyve got one an expensive gesture with halabi gone we wont get the other half of the money two and a half million pounds on deposit in switzerland norah not a bad pay day so dont be greedy now lets get out of here it was late in the afternoon with ferguson still at his desk at the ministry of defence when hannah bernstein came in anything new he asked not a thing sir improbable though it sounds there was enough of halabi left to identify his fingerprints anyway it seems he must have been on the pavement not in the van and the others two cars caught in the blast driver of the front one was a woman doctor killed instantly the man and woman in the other were going to a sales conference theyre both in intensive care she put the report on his desk quigley was right but at least aherns shot his bolt you think so sir youve seen the presidents schedule he was due to pass along constitution hill at about ten oclock on the way to downing street ahern must have known that and the explosion premature that kind of thing happens all the time you know that sir halabi was just an amateur ive looked at his file in depth he had an accountancy degree from the london school of economics yes it all makes senseat least to me but not to dillon where is he out and about nosing around he wouldnt trust his own grandmother that one i suppose thats why hes still alive ferguson told her help yourself to coffee chief inspector at the studio flat in camden ahern stood in front of the bathroom mirror and rubbed brilliantine into his hair he combed it back leaving a center parting then carefully glued a dark moustache and fixed it in place he picked up a pair of hornrimmed spectacles and put them on then compared himself with the face on the security pass as he turned norah came in the room she wore a neat black skirt and white blouse her hair was drawn back in a tight bun like him she wore spectacles rather large ones with black rims she looked totally different how do i look she said bloody marvelous he told her what about me great michael first class good he led the way out of the bathroom and crossed to a drinks cabinet he produced a bottle of bushmills and two glasses its not champagne norah bell but its good irish whiskey he poured and raised his glass our country too our country too she replied giving him that most ancient of loyalist toasts he emptied his glass good all i need is our box of cutlery and well be on our way it was around sixthirty when ferguson left the ministry of defence with hannah bernstein and told his driver to take him to his flat in cavendish square the door was opened by kim the exghurka corporal who had been his manservant for years mr dillon has been waiting for you brigadier thanks ferguson said when they went into the living room dillon was standing by the open french window a glass in his hand he turned helped myself hope you dont mind where have you been ferguson demanded checking my usual sources you can discount the ira on this one it really is ahern and thats what bothers me can i ask why hannah bernstein said dillon said michael ahern is one of the most brilliant organizers i ever knew very clever very subtle and very very devious as i told you he doesnt let his left hand know what his right is doing so you dont think hes simply shot his bolt on this one ferguson said too easy it may sound complicated to you but i think everything from quigleys betrayal and death to the socalled accidental explosion of the telecom van on the presidents route was meant to happen are you serious hannah demanded oh yes the attempt failed so we can all take it easy let me look at the presidents schedule hannah passed a copy across and ferguson poured himself a drink for once i really do hope youre wrong dillon here it is dillon said cocktail party on the thames riverboat jersey lily the prime minister the president and the prime minister of israel thats where hell strike thats where he always intended the rest was a smokescreen youre mad dillon ferguson said you must be and then he turned and saw hannah bernsteins face oh my god he said she glanced at her watch sixthirty sir right he said lets get moving we dont have much time at the same moment ahern and norah were parking the toyota in a side street off cheyne walk they got out and walked down toward cadogan pier there were police cars by the dozen uniformed men all over the place and at the boarding point a portable electronic arch that everyone had to pass through beside it were two large young men in blue suits ahern said secret service the presidents bodyguard i think they get their suits from the same shop he and norah wore their identity cards on their lapels and he grinned and passed a plastic box to one of the secret servicemen as they reached the arch sorry to be a nuisance but theres two hundred knives spoons and forks in there it might blow a fuse on that thing give it to me and you go through the secret serviceman said they negotiated the arch and he opened the plastic box and riffled the cutlery with his hand at that moment several limousines drew up for christs sake man its the israeli prime minister his colleague called the secret serviceman said to ahern youll have to leave this box on your way suit yourself ahern went up the gangplank followed by norah at the top he simply slipped through a door and following a plan of the ship he had memorized led the way to a toilet area wait here he told norah and went into the mens restroom marked number four there was a man washing his hands ahern started to wash his hands also the moment the man left he went to the red fire bucket in the corner scrabbled in the sand and found two walthers wrapped in cling film each with a silencer on the end he slipped one into the waistband of his trousers at the rear and concealed the other inside his uniform blazer when he went outside he checked that no one was around for the moment and passed the second walther to norah who slipped it into the inside breast pocket of her blazer under the left armpit here we go he said at that moment a voice with a heavy italian accent called you two what are you doing when they turned a grayhaired man in black coat and striped trousers was coming along the corridor who sent you ahern already sure of his facts said signor orsini we were supposed to be at the buffet at the french embassy but he told us to come here at the last minute he thought you might be shorthanded and hes right the head waiter turned to norah canapes for you and wine for you he added to ahern up the stairs on the left now get moving and he turned and hurried away the prime minister and the president had already boarded and the crew were about to slip the gangway when ferguson dillon and hannah drew up in the daimler ferguson led the way hurrying up the gangway and two secret servicemen moved to intercept him brigadier ferguson is colonel candy here a large grayhaired man in a black suit and striped tie hurried along the deck its all right is there a problem brigadier these are aides of mine dillon and chief inspector bernstein behind him the gangway went down as the crew cast off and the jersey lily started to edge out into the thames im afraid there could be the explosion this morning we now believe it to be a subterfuge youve had a photo of this man ahern please alert all your men he could well be on the boat right candy didnt argue and turned to the two secret servicemen jack you take the stern george go up front ill handle the president alert everybody they all turned and hurried away ferguson said right lets try to be useful in our own small way shall we there was music on the night air provided by a jazz quartet up in the prow people crowding around mainly politicians and staff from the london embassies the president the prime minister and the israeli prime minister moving among them waiters and waitresses offering wine and canapes to everyone its a nightmare ferguson said candy appeared running down a companionway the big three will all say a few words in about ten minutes after that we continue down past the houses of parliament and disembark at westminster pier fine ferguson turned to dillon as the american hurried away this is hopeless maybe hes not here hannah said perhaps youre wrong dillon it was as if he wasnt listening to her hed have to have a way out he turned to ferguson the stern lets look at the stern he led the way to the rear of the ship quickly pushing people out of the way and leaned over the stern rail after a moment he turned hes here how do you know ferguson demanded dillon reached over and hauled in a line and an inflatable with an outboard motor came into view thats his way out he said or it was he reached over opened the snap link that held the line and the inflatable vanished into the darkness now what hannah demanded at that moment a voice over the tannoy system said ladies and gentlemen the prime minister dillon said he isnt the kind to commit suicide so he wouldnt walk up to him in the crowd he looked up at the wheelhouse perched on top of the ship three levels of decks below it thats it it has to be he ran for the steps leading up hannah at his heels ferguson struggling behind he looked along the first deck which was deserted and started up the steps to the next as he reached it the prime minister said over the tannoy im proud to present to you the president of the united states at the same moment as dillon reached the deck he saw a waiter open the saloon door at the far end and enter followed by a waitress carrying a tray covered by a white napkin the saloon was deserted ahern moved forward and looked down through the windows to the forward deck where the president stood at the microphone the british and israeli prime ministers beside him ahern eased one of the windows open and took out his gun the door opened gently behind him and dillon moved in his walther ready jesus michael but you never give up do you ahern turned the gun against his thigh sean dillon you old bastard and then his hand swung up dillon shot him twice in the heart a double thud of the silenced pistol that drove him back against the bulkhead norah bell stood there frozen clutching the tray dillon said now if there was a pistol under that napkin and you were thinking about reaching for it id have to kill you norah and neither of us would like that you being a decent irish girl just put the tray down very slowly norah bell did as she was told and placed the tray on the nearest table dillon turned the walther swinging from his right hand and said to ferguson and hannah there you go alls well that ends well behind him norah hitched up her skirt pulled the flick knife from her stocking and sprang the blade plunging it into his back dillon reared up in agony and dropped his walther bastard norah cried pulled out the knife and thrust it into him again dillon lurched against the table and hung there for a moment norah raised the knife to strike a third blow and hannah bernstein dropped to one knee picked up dillons walther and shot her in the center of the forehead at the same moment dillon slipped from the table and rolled onto his back it was around midnight at the london clinic one of the worlds greatest hospitals and hannah bernstein sat in the first floor reception area close to dillons room she was tired which under the circumstances was hardly surprising but a diet of black coffee and cigarettes had kept her going the door at the end of the corridor swung open and to her astonishment ferguson entered followed by the president and colonel candy the president was returning to the american embassy ferguson told her but under the circumstances i felt i should look in youre chief inspector bernstein i understand the president took her hand im eternally grateful you owe more to dillon sir he was the one who thought it through he was the one who knew they were on board the president moved to the window and peered in dillon festooned with wires lay on a hospital bed a nurse beside him how is he intensive care sir she said a fourhour operation she stabbed him twice i brought in professor henry bellamy of guys hospital mr president ferguson said the best surgeon in london good the president nodded i owe you and your people for this brigadier ill never forget he walked away and colonel candy said thank god it worked out the way it did that way we can keep it under wraps i know ferguson said it never happened candy walked away and hannah bernstein said i saw professor bellamy half an hour ago he came to check on him and what did he say ferguson frowned hes going to be all right isnt he oh hell live sir if thats what you mean the trouble is bellamy doesnt think hell ever be the same again she almost gutted him ferguson put an arm around her shoulder are you all right my dear you mean am i upset because i killed someone tonight not at all brigadier im really not the nice jewish girl dillon imagines im a rather old testament jewish girl she was a murderous bitch she deserved to die she took out a cigarette and lit it no its dillon im sorry for he did a good job he deserved better i thought you didnt like him ferguson said then you were wrong brigadier she looked in through the window at dillon the trouble is i liked him too much and that never pays in our line of work she turned and walked away ferguson hesitated glanced once more at dillon then went after her three and two months later in another hospital our lady of mercy in new york on the other side of the atlantic young tony jackson clocked in for night duty as darkness fell he was a tall handsome man of twentythree who had qualified as a doctor at harvard medical school the year before our lady of mercy a charity hospital mainly staffed by nuns was not many young doctors idea of the ideal place to be an intern but tony jackson was an idealist he wanted to practice real medicine and he could certainly do that at our lady of mercy which could not believe their luck at getting their hands on such a brilliant young man he loved the nuns found the vast range of patients fascinating the money was poor but in his case money was no object his father a successful manhattan attorney had died far too early from cancer but he had left the family well provided for in any case his mother rosa was from the little italy district of new york with a doting father big in the construction business tony liked the night shift that atmosphere peculiar to hospitals all over the world and it gave him the opportunity to be in charge for the first part of the evening he worked on the casualty shift dealing with a variety of patients stitching slashed faces handling as best he could junkies who were coming apart because they couldnt afford a fix it was all pretty demanding but slackened off after midnight he was alone in the small canteen having coffee and a sandwich when the door opened and a young priest looked in im father obrien from st marks i had a call to come and see a mr tanner a scottish gentleman i understand he needs the last rites sorry father i only came on tonight i wouldnt know let me look at the schedule he checked it briefly then nodded jack tanner that must be him admitted this afternoon age seventyfive british citizen collapsed at his daughters house in queens hes in a private room on level three number eight thank you the priest said and disappeared jackson finished his coffee and idly glanced through the new york times there wasnt much news an ira bomb in london in the citys financial center an item about hong kong the british colony in china which was to revert to chinese control on the first of july nineteen ninetyseven it seemed that the british governor of the colony was introducing a thoroughly democratic voting system while he had the chance and the chinese government in peking was annoyed which didnt look good for hong kong when the change took place he threw the paper down bored and restless got up and went outside the elevator doors opened and father obrien emerged ah there you are doctor ive done what i could for the poor man but hes not long for this world hes from the highlands of scotland would you believe his daughter is married to an american thats interesting said jackson i always imagined the scots as protestant my dear lad not in the highlands father obrien told him the catholic tradition is very strong he smiled well ill be on my way good night to you jackson watched him go then got in the elevator and rose to the third level as he emerged he saw sister agnes the night duty nurse come out of room eight and go to her desk jackson said ive just seen father obrien he tells me this mr tanner doesnt look good theres his chart doctor chronic bronchitis and severe emphysema jackson examined the notes lung capacity only twelve percent and the blood pressure is unbelievable i just checked his heart doctor very irregular lets take a look at him jack tanners face was drawn and wasted the sparse hair snowwhite his eyes were closed as he breathed in short gasps a rattling sound in his throat at intervals oxygen jackson asked administered an hour ago i gave it to him myself aye but she wouldnt give me a cigarette jack tanner opened his eyes is that no the terrible thing doctor now mr tanner sister agnes reproved him gently you know thats not allowed jackson leaned over to check the tube connections and noticed the scar on the right side of the chest would that have been a bullet wound he asked aye it was so shot in the lung while i was serving in the highland light infantry that was before dunkirk in nineteenforty id have died if the laird hadnt got me out and him wounded so bad he lost an eye the laird you say jackson was suddenly interested but tanner started to cough so harshly that he almost had a convulsion jackson grabbed for the oxygen mask breathe nice and slowly thats it he removed it after a while and tanner smiled weakly ill be back jackson told him and went out you said the daughter lives in queens thats right doctor dont lets waste time send a cab for her now and put it on my account i dont think hes got long ill go back and sit with him jackson pulled a chair forward now what were you saying about the laird that was major ian campbell military cross and bar the bravest man i ever knew laird of loch dhu castle in the western highlands of scotland as his ancestors had been for centuries before him loch dhu thats gaelic the black loch to us who grew up there it was always the place of dark waters so you knew the laird as a boy we were boys together learned to shoot grouse deer and the fishing was the best in the world and then the war came wed both served in the reserve before it all started so we went out to france straight away that must have been exciting stuff nearly the end of us but afterwards they gave the laird the staff job working for mountbatten youve heard of him earl mountbatten the one the ira blew up the bastards and after all he did in the war he was supreme commander in south east asia with the laird as one of his aides and he took me with him that must have been interesting tanner managed a smile isnt it customary to offer a condemned man a cigarette thats true and i am condemned arent i jackson hesitated then took out a pack of cigarettes just as we all are mr tanner ill tell you what tanner said give me one of those and ill tell you about the chungking covenant all those years ago i gave the laird my oath but it doesnt seem to matter now the what jackson asked just one doc its a good story jackson turned off the oxygen lit a cigarette and held it to his lips the old man inhaled coughed then inhaled again christ thats wonderful he lay back now lets see when did it all start tanner lay with his eyes closed very weak now what happened after the crash jackson asked the old man opened his eyes the laird was hurt bad the brain you see he was in a coma in a delhi hospital for three months and i stayed with him as his batman they sent us back to london by sea and by then the end of the war was in sight he spent months in the braindamage unit for servicemen at guys hospital but he never really recovered and he had burns from the crash as well and almost total loss of memory he came so close to death early in fortysix that i packed his things and sent them home to castle dhu and did he die not for another twenty years back home we went to the estate he wandered the place like a child i tended his every want what about family oh he never married he was engaged to a lassie who was killed in the london blitz in forty there was his sister lady rose although everybody calls her lady katherine her husband was a baronet killed in the desert campaign she ran the estate then and still does though shes eighty now she lives in the gate lodge sometimes rents the big house for the shooting season to rich yanks or arabs and the chungking covenant nothing came of that lord louis and mao never managed to get together again but the fourth copy in the lairds bible you saved that wasnt it handed over to the authorities it stayed where it was in his bible the lairds affair after all and he not up to telling anyone much of anything he shrugged and then the years had rolled by and it didnt seem to matter did lady katherine ever come to know of it i never told her i never spoke of it to anyone and he was not capable and as i said it didnt seem to matter any longer but youve told me tanner smiled weakly thats because youre a nice boy who talked to me and gave me a cigarette a long time ago chungking in the rain and mountbatten and your general stillwell and the bible jackson asked like i told you i sent all his belongings home when i thought he was going to die so the bible went back to loch dhu you could say that for some reason tanner started to laugh and that led to him choking again jackson got the oxygen mask and the door opened and sister agnes ushered in a middleaged couple mr and mrs grant the woman hurried forward to take tanners hand he managed a smile breathing deeply and she started to talk to him in a low voice and in a language totally unfamiliar to jackson he turned to her husband a large amiablelooking man its gaelic doctor they always spoke gaelic together he was on a visit his wife died of cancer last year back in scotland at that moment tanner stopped breathing his daughter cried out and jackson passed her gently to her husband and bent over the patient after a while he turned to face them im sorry but hes gone he said simply there it might have ended except for the fact that having read the article in the new york times on hong kong and its relations with china tony jackson was struck by the coincidence of tanners story this became doubly important because tanner had died in the early hours of sunday morning and jackson always had sunday lunch his hospital shifts permitting at his grandfathers home in little italy where his mother since the death of his grandmother kept house for her father in some style jacksons grandfather after whom he had been named was called antonio mori and he had been born by only a whisker in america because his pregnant mother had arrived from palermo in sicily just in time to produce her baby at ellis island twentyfour hours only but good enough and little antonio was american born his father had friends of the right sort friends in the mafia antonio had worked briefly as a laborer until these friends had put him into first the olive oil and then the restaurant business he had kept his mouth shut and always done as he was told finally achieving wealth and prominence in the construction industry his daughter hadnt married a sicilian he accepted that just as he accepted the death of his wife from leukemia his soninlaw a rich anglosaxon attorney gave the family respectability his death was a convenience it brought mori and his beloved daughter together again plus his fine grandson so brilliant that he had gone to harvard no matter that he was a saint and chose medicine mori could make enough money for all of them because he was mafia an important member of the luca family whose leader don giovanni luca in spite of having returned to sicily was capo di tutti capi boss of all the bosses in the whole of the mafia the respect that earned for mori couldnt be paid for when jackson arrived at his grandfathers house his mother rosa was in the kitchen supervising the meal with the maid maria she turned still handsome in spite of gray in her dark hair kissed him on both cheeks then held him off you look terrible shadows under the eyes mamma i did the night shift i lay on my bed three hours then i showered and came here because i didnt want to disappoint you youre a good boy go and see your grandfather jackson went into the sitting room where he found mori reading the sunday paper he leaned down to kiss his grandfather on the cheek and mori said i heard your mother and shes right you do good and kill yourself at the same time here have a glass of red wine jackson accepted it and drank some with pleasure thats good you had an interesting night mori was genuinely interested in his grandsons doings in fact he bored his friends with his praises of the young man jackson aware that his grandfather indulged him went to the french window opened it and lit a cigarette he turned remember the solazzo wedding last month yes you were talking with carl morgan youd just introduced me mr morgan was impressed by you he said so there was pride in moris voice yes well you and he were talking business nonsense what business could we have in common for gods sake grandfather im not a fool and i love you but do you think i could have reached this stage in my life and not realized the business you were in mori nodded slowly and picked up the bottle more wine now tell me where this is leading you and mr morgan were talking about hong kong he mentioned huge investments in skyscrapers hotels and so on and the worry about what would happen when the chinese communists take over thats simple billions of dollars down the toilet mori said there was an article in the times yesterday about peking being angry because the british are introducing a democratic political system before they go in ninetyseven so where is this leading mori asked so i am right in assuming that you and your associates have business interests in hong kong his grandfather stared at him thoughtfully you could say that but where is this leading jackson said what if i told you that in nineteen fortyfour mao tsetung signed a thing called the chungking covenant with lord louis mountbatten under the terms of which he agreed that if he ever came to power in china he would extend the hong kong treaty by one hundred years in return for aid from the british to fight the japanese his grandfather sat there staring at him then got up closed the door and returned to his seat explain he said jackson did and when he was finished his grandfather sat thinking about it he got up and went to his desk and came back with a small tape recorder go through it again he said everything he told you omit nothing at that moment rosa opened the door lunch is almost ready fifteen minutes cara her father said this is important believe me she frowned but went out closing the door he turned to his grandson as i said everything and he switched on the recorder when mori reached the glendale polo ground later that afternoon it was raining there was still a reasonable crowd huddled beneath umbrellas or the trees because carl morgan was playing and morgan was good a handicap of ten goals indicating that he was a player of the first rank he was fifty years of age a magnificentlooking man six feet in height with broad shoulders and hair swept back over his ears his hair was jet black a legacy of his mother niece of don giovanni who had married his father a young army officer during the second world war his father had served gallantly and well in both the korean and vietnam wars retiring as a brigadier general to florida where they enjoyed a comfortable retirement thanks to their son all very respectable all a very proper front for the son who had walked out of yale in nineteen sixtyfive and volunteered as a paratrooper during the vietnam war emerging with two purple hearts a silver star and a vietnamese cross of valour a war hero whose credentials had taken him to wall street and then the hotel industry and the construction business a billionaire at the end of things accepted at every social level from london to new york there are six chukkas in a polo game lasting seven minutes each four players on each side morgan played forward because it gave the most opportunity for total aggression and that was what he liked the game was into the final chukka as mori got out of the car and his chauffeur came round to hold an umbrella over him some yards away a vividly pretty young woman stood beside an estate car a burberry trenchcoat hanging from her shoulders she was about fivefootseven with long blond hair to her shoulders high cheekbones green eyes she sure is a beautiful young lady mr morgans daughter the chauffeur said stepdaughter johnny mori reminded him sure i was forgetting but with her taking his name and all that was a real bad thing her mother dying like that asta thats kind of a funny name its swedish mori told him asta morgan jumped up and down excitedly come on carl murder them carl morgan glanced sideways as he went by his teeth flashed and he went barreling into the young forward for the opposing team slamming his left foot under the boys stirrup and lifting him quite illegally out of the saddle a second later he had thundered through and scored the game was won he cantered across to asta through the rain and stepped out of the saddle a groom took his pony asta handed him a towel then lit a cigarette and passed it to him she looked up smiling an intimacy between them that excluded everyone around he sure likes that girl johnny said mori nodded so it would appear morgan turned and saw him and waved and mori went forward carl nice to see you and you asta he touched his hat what can i do for you morgan asked business carl something came up last night that might interest you morgan said nothing you cant talk about in front of asta surely mori hesitated no of course not he took the small tape recorder from his pocket my grandson tony had a man die on him at our lady of mercy hospital last night he told tony a hell of a story carl i think you could be interested okay lets get in out of the rain morgan handed asta into the estate car and followed her mori joined them here we go he switched on the tape recorder morgan sat there after it had finished a cigarette drooping from the corner of his mouth his face set asta said what a truly astonishing story her voice was low and pleasant more english than american you can say that again morgan turned to mori ill keep this ill have my secretary transcribe it and send it to don giovanni in palermo by coded fax i did the right thing you did well antonio morgan took his hand no it was tony carl not me what am i going to do with him harvard medical school the mayo clinic a brilliant student yet he works with the nuns at our lady of mercy for peanuts you leave him morgan said hell find his way i went to vietnam antonio no one can take that away from me you cant argue with it the rich boy going into hell when he didnt need to it says something he wont be there forever but the fact that he was will make people see him as someone to look up to for the rest of his life hes a fine boy he put a hand on moris shoulder heh i hope i dont sound too calculating no mori protested not at all hes someone to be proud of thank you carl thank you ill leave you now asta he nodded to her and walked away that was nice asta told morgan what you said about tony its true hes brilliant that boy hell end up in park avenue only unlike the other brilliant doctors there hell always be the one who worked downtown for the nuns of our lady of mercy and that you cant pay for youre such a cynic she said no sweetheart a realist now lets get going im famished ill take you out to dinner they had finished their meal at the four seasons were at the coffee stage when one of the waiters brought a phone over an overseas call for you sir sicily the gentleman said it was urgent the voice over the phone was harsh and unmistakable carl this is giovanni morgan straightened in his seat uncle he dropped into italian what a marvelous surprise hows business everything looks good particularly after reading your fax i was right to let you know about this business then so right that i want you out of there on the next plane this is serious business carl very serious fine uncle ill be there tomorrow astas with me do you want to say hello id rather look at her so youd better bring her with you i look forward to it carl the phone clicked off the waiter came forward and took it from him what was all that about asta said business apparently giovanni takes this chungking covenant thing very seriously indeed he wants me in palermo tomorrow you too my love its time you visited sicily and he waved for the head waiter they took a direct flight to rome the following morning where morgan had a citation private jet standing by for the flight to punta raisi airport twenty miles outside palermo there was a mercedes limousine waiting with a chauffeur and a hardlooking individual in a blue nylon raincoat with heavy cheekbones and the flattened nose of the prize fighter there was a feeling of real power there although he looked more slav than italian my uncles top enforcer morgan whispered to asta marco russo he smiled and held out his hand marco its been a long time my daughter asta marco managed a fractional smile a pleasure welcome to sicily signorina and nice to see you again signore the don isnt at the town house hes at the villa good lets get moving then lucas villa was outside a village at the foot of monte pellegrino which towers into the sky three miles north of palermo during the punic wars the carthaginians held out against the romans on that mountain for three years morgan told asta it looks a fascinating place she said soaked in blood for generations he held up the local paper which marco had given him three soldiers blown up by a car bomb last night a priest shot in the back of the neck this morning because he was suspected of being an informer at least youre on the right side he took her hand everything i do is strictly legitimate asta thats the whole point my business interests and those of my associates are pure as driven snow i know darling she said you must be the greatest front man ever granddad morgan a general you a war hero billionaire philanthropist and one of the best polo players in the world why last time we were in london prince charles asked you to play for him he wants me next month she laughed and he added but never forget one thing asta the true power doesnt come from new york it lies in the hands of the old man were going to see now at that moment they turned in through electronic gates set in ancient fifteenfoot walls and drove through a semitropical garden toward the great moorish villa the main reception room was enormous blackandwhitetiled floor scattered with rugs seventeenthcentury furniture from italy in dark oak a log fire blazing in the open hearth and french windows open to the garden luca sat in a highbacked sofa a cigar in his mouth hands clasped over the silver handle of a walking stick he was large at least sixteen stone his gray beard trimmed the air of a roman emperor about him come here child he said to asta and when she went to him kissed her on both cheeks youre more beautiful than ever eighteen months since i saw you in new york i was desolated by your mothers unfortunate death last year these things happen she said i know jack kennedy once said anyone who believes there is fairness in this life is seriously misinformed here sit beside me she did as she was told and he looked up at morgan you seem well carlo hed always insisted on calling him that and you uncle look wonderful luca held out his hand and morgan kissed it i like it when your sicilian half floats to the surface you were wise to contact me on this chungking business and mori showed good judgment in speaking to you we owe it to his grandson morgan said yes of course young tony is a good boy an idealist and thats good we need our saints carlo they make us rather more acceptable to the rest of the world he snapped a finger and a whitecoated houseboy came forward zibibbo alfredo at once don giovanni you will like this asta a wine from the island pantelleria flavored with anise he turned to morgan marco took me for a run into the country the other day to that farmhouse of yours at valdini how was it the caretaker and his wife seemed to be behaving themselves very peaceful you should do something with it grandfather was born there uncle its a piece of the real sicily how could i change that youre a good boy carlo you may be half american but you have a sicilian heart as alfredo opened the bottle morgan said so to the chungking covenant what do you think we have billions invested in hong kong in hotels and casinos and our holdings will be severely damaged when the communists take over in ninetyseven anything that could delay that would be marvelous but would the production of such a document really have an effect asta asked he accepted one of the glasses of zibibbo from alfredo the chinese have taken great care to handle the proposed changes in the status of hong kong through the united nations these days they want everything from international respectability to the olympic games if the document surfaced with the holy name of mao tsetung attached to it who knows what the outcome would be thats true morgan agreed all right theyd scream forgery yes asta put in but there is one important point it isnt a forgery its the real thing we know that and any experts brought in will have to agree shes smart this girl luca patted her knee weve nothing to lose carlo with that document on show we can at least hold the whole proceedings up if nothing else even if we still lose millions id like to mess it up for the chinese and particularly for the brits its their fault they didnt sort the whole mess out years ago strange you should say that asta told him id have thought that was exactly what mountbatten was trying to do back in fortyfour he roared with laughter and raised his glass more wine alfredo what do you suggest morgan asked find this silver bible when you have that you have the covenant and that must be somewhere at the castle at loch dhu according to what tanner said asta put in exactly theres a problem i had my london lawyer check on the situation at the house the moment i received your fax its rented out at the moment to a sheik from trucial oman a prince of the royal family so theres nothing to be done there hes in residence and he wont be leaving for another month my lawyer has leased it in your name for three months from then fine morgan said that gives me plenty of time to clear the decks where business is concerned that bible must be there somewhere i instructed my lawyer to get straight up there and see this lady katherine rose the sister to do the lease personally he raised the question of the bible told her hed heard the legend of how all the lairds carried it into battle when he phoned me he said shes old and a bit confused and told him she hadnt seen the thing in years there is one thing asta said according to tony jackson he said to tanner so the bible went back to loch dhu morgan cut in and tanner replied you could say that asta nodded and then tony said he started to laugh id say thats rather strange strange or not that bible must be there somewhere luca said youll find it carlo he stood up now we eat marco russo was standing by the door in the hall and as they passed him luca said you can take marco with you in case you need a little muscle he patted marcos face the highlands of scotland marco youll have to wrap up whatever you say capo marco opened the dining room door where two waiters were in attendance back in the reception room alfredo cleared the wine bottle and glasses and took them into the kitchen putting them beside the sink for the maid to wash later he said to the cook im going now went out lit a cigarette and walked down through the gardens to the staff quarters alfredo ponti was an excellent waiter but an even better policeman one of the new dedicated breed imported from mainland italy hed managed to obtain the job with luca three months previously usually he phoned from outside when he wanted to contact his superiors but the other two houseboys the cook and the maid were working so for the moment he was alone in any case what he had overheard seemed important so he decided to take a chance lifted the receiver on the wall phone at the end of the corridor and dialed a number in palermo it was answered at once gagini its me ponti ive got something carl morgan appeared tonight with his stepdaughter i overheard them tell a most curious story to luca have you ever heard of the chungking covenant paolo gagini who was a major in the italian secret intelligence service from rome posing as a business man in palermo said thats a new one let me put the tape recorder on thank god for that photographic memory of yours right start talking tell me everything which alfredo did in some detail when he had finished gagini said good work though i cant see it helping us much ill be in touch take care alfredo replaced the receiver and went to bed gagini in his apartment in palermo sat thinking he could let them know in rome not that anyone would be very interested everyone knew what carl morgan was but he was also very legitimate in any case anything he did in scotland was the responsibility of the british authorities which made him think of his oldest friend in british intelligence gagini smiled he loved this one he got out his code book and found the number of the ministry of defence in london when the operator answered he said give me brigadier charles ferguson priority one please it was perhaps two hours later when morgan and asta had retired that alfredo was shaken awake to find marco bending over him the capo wants you what is it marco shrugged search me hes on the terrace he went out and alfredo dressed quickly and went after him he was aware of no particular apprehension things had gone so well for three months now and hed always been so careful but as a precaution he placed a small automatic in his waistband he found luca sitting in a cane chair marco leaning against a pillar the old man said you made a phone call earlier alfredos mouth went dry yes my cousin in palermo youre lying marco said we have an electronic tracking machine it registered the no return bar code so the number cant be traced and that only applies to the security services luca said alfredo turned and ran through the garden for the fence and marco drew a silenced pistol dont kill him luca cried marco shot him in the leg and the young man went down but turned on the ground pulling the automatic from his waistband marco with little choice in the matter shot him between the eyes luca went forward leaning on his cane poor boy so young they will keep trying get rid of him marco he turned and walked away four ferguson was at his desk when hannah bernstein came in and put a file on his desk everything there is on carl morgan ferguson sat back tell me his father is a retired brigadier general but his mother is the niece of giovanni luca which means that in spite of yale and all the war hero stuff in vietnam and his hotels and construction business hes fronting for the mafia some people would say he was the new legitimate face of the mafia with the greatest respect brigadier thats a load of crap why chief inspector you said a rude word how encouraging a thug is a thug even if he does wear suits by brioni and plays polo with prince charles i couldnt agree more have you checked on loch dhu castle and the situation there yes sir its at present leased to prince ali ben yusef from the oman hell be there for another month not much joy there arab royal families are always the very devil to deal with something else sir carl morgan has already taken a lease on the place for three months when the prince leaves now why would he do that ferguson frowned and then nodded the bible its got to be you mean he needs to search for it sir something like that what else can you tell me about the estate its owned by a lady rose campbells sister he was never married she lives in the gate lodge shes eighty years of age and in poor health hannah looked in the file i see theres also a small hunting lodge to rent ardmurchan lodge its called about ten miles from the main house in the deer forest ferguson nodded look lets try the simple approach book the lear out of gatwick as soon as you like and fly up there and descend on lady katherine express an interest in this shooting lodge on my behalf tell her youve always had an interest in the area because your grandfather served with campbell in the war then raise the question of the bible for all we know it could be lying on a coffee table all right sir ill do as you say the phone went on his desk and she picked it up listened and put it down again dillon is having his final check at the hospital i know ferguson said about the bible sir do you really think it could be just lying around somehow i dont think so luca and morgan would have thought of that the fact that they are going ahead with a lease on the place would seem to indicate that they know damn well it isnt thats logical she put another file on his desk dillons medical report not good yes professor bellamy spoke to me about it thats why hes giving him a final examination this morning then dillon is coming round to see me is he finished sir looks like it but thats not your worry its mine so off you go to scotland and see what you can find in the meantime ill speak to the prime minister a phone call at this stage will be enough but i do think he should know whats going on sooner rather than later you can dress now sean bellamy told him ill see you in my office dillon got off the operating table on which the professor had examined him the flesh seemed to have shrunk on his bones there were what appeared to be bruises under his eyes when he glanced over his shoulder he could see in the mirror the angry raised weal of the scars left by the two operations that had saved his life after norah bell had gutted him he dressed slowly feeling unaccountably weak and when he put on his jacket the walther in the special left pocket seemed to weigh a ton he went out to the office where bellamy sat behind his desk how do you feel generally dillon slumped down bloody awful weak no energy and then theres the pain he shook his head how long does this go on it takes time bellamy said she chipped your spine damaged the stomach kidneys bladder have you any idea how close to death you were i know i know dillon said but what do i do a holiday a long one preferably in the sun ferguson will take care of it as for the painhe pushed a pill bottle forwardive increased your morphine dose to a quarter grain thanks very much ill be a junkie before you know it dillon got up slowly ill be on my way better see ferguson and get it over with as he got to the door bellamy said im always here sean hannah due at gatwick in an hour was checking the final details of her trip in the outer office loch dhu was situated in a place called moidart on the northwest coast of scotland and not far from the sea about a hundred and twenty square miles of mountain and moorland with few inhabitants one good thing only five miles from loch dhu was an old abandoned airstrip called ardmurchan used by the raf as an airsea rescue base during the war it could comfortably accommodate the lear four hundred and fifty miles so the trip would take say an hour and a half then she would need transport to the castle she found the telephone number of the gate lodge and called lady katherine rose the first person to answer was a woman with a robust scottish voice but after a while her mistress replaced her her voice was different tired somehow and a slight quaver in it katherine rose here lady rose i wonder if i could come and see you on behalf of a client of mine and she went on to explain certainly my dear ill send my gardener angus to pick you up i look forward to seeing you by the way just call me lady katherine its customary here hannah put down the receiver and pulled on her coat the door opened and dillon entered he looked dreadful and her heart sank why dillon its good to see you i doubt that girl dear on the other hand i must say you look good enough to eat is the great man in hes expecting you listen ill have to dash the lears waiting for me at gatwick and ive a fast trip to make to scotland then i wont detain you happy landings and he knocked on fergusons door and went in god save all here dillon said ferguson glanced up you look bloody awful god save you kindly was the reply to that one dillon told him and as i see the brandy over there ill help myself he did taking it down in one swallow then lit a cigarette ferguson said remarkably bad habits for a sick man dont lets waste time are you putting me out to grass im afraid so your appointment was never exactly official you see that makes things awkward ah well all good things come to an end he helped himself to more brandy and ferguson said normally there would have been a pension but in your circumstances im afraid not dillon smiled remember michael aroun the bastard i did away with in brittany in ninetyone after the downing street affair he was supposed to put two million into my bank account and screwed me i remember ferguson said i cleaned out his safe before i left assorted currencies but it came to around six hundred thousand pounds ill be all right he finished the brandy well working with you has been a sincere sensation ill say that but id better be on my way as he put his hand to the door ferguson said formally one more thing dillon i presume youre carrying the usual walther id be obliged if youd leave it on my desk screw you brigadier sean dillon said and went out the flight to moidart was spectacular straight over the english lake district at thirty thousand feet then scotland and the firth of forth the grampian mountains on the right and soon the islands eigg and rhum and the isle of skye to the north the lear turned east toward the great shining expanse of loch shiel but before it was the deer forest loch dhu castle and the loch itself black and forbidding the copilot was navigating and he pointed as they descended and there was the airfield decaying nissan huts two hangars and an old control tower ardmurchan field airsea rescue during the big war it was on the far side of the loch from the castle and as they turned to land hannah saw an old station wagon approaching the lear rolled to a halt both the pilots who were raf on secondment got out with her to stretch their legs the skipper a flight lieutenant lacey said back of beyond this chief inspector and no mistake better get used to it flight lieutenant i suspect well be up here again she said and walked toward the station wagon the driver was a man in tweed cap and jacket with a red face blotched from too much whiskey drinking angus miss her ladyship sent me to find you my names bernstein she said and got into the passenger seat as they drove away she said youve no idea how excited i am to be here why would that be miss he inquired oh my grandfather knew the old laird during the war major campbell they served in the far east together with lord mountbatten ah well i wouldnt know about that miss im only sixtyfour so all i did was national service and that was in nineteen fortyeight i see i remember my grandfather saying the laird had a batman from the estate a corporal tanner did you know him indeed i did miss he was estate manager here for years went on a visit to his daughter in new york and died there only the other day that happened what a shame death comes to us all he intoned it was like a line from a bad play especially when delivered in that highland scots accent and she lapsed into silence as he turned the station wagon into huge oldfashioned iron gates and stopped beside the lodge lady katherine rose was old and tired and it showed on her wizened face as she sat there in the wingbacked chair a rug over her knees the drawing room in which she greeted hannah was pleasantly furnished most of the stuff obviously antique there was a fire in the hearth but she had a french window open i hope you dont mind my dear she said to hannah i need the air you see my chest isnt what it used to be a pleasant rather overweight woman in her fifties bustled in with tea and scones on a tray which she placed on a mahogany table shall i pour she said and like angus her accent was highland dont fuss jean im sure miss bernstein is quite capable off you go jean smiled picked up a shawl which had slipped to the floor and put it around the old womans shoulders hannah went and poured the tea so lady katherine said your employer is brigadier charles ferguson is that what you said yes he was wondering whether there might be a chance of renting ardmurchan lodge for the shooting i did contact your agents in london but was given to understand that the big house was leased indeed it is an arab prince no less a dear man with several children who keep descending on me far too generous he sends me food i cant eat and bottles of dom perignon i cant drink hannah put her cup of tea on a side table yes i heard he was in residence for another month and after that an american gentleman yes a mr morgan scandalously wealthy ive seen his picture in the tatler magazine playing polo with prince charles his lawyer flew up to see me just like you in a jet plane hes taken the place for three months she didnt bother with the tea there are some cigarettes in the silver box get one for me theres a dear and help yourself if you indulge she held it in a hand that shook slightly thats better she said as she inhaled clears my chest anyway to business ardmurchan lodge is free and has full sporting rights deer grouse next month then fishing there are two bathrooms five bedrooms i could arrange servants no need for that the brigadier has a manservant who also cooks how very convenient and youd come too some of the time at least the brigadier must be as wealthy as this american what with private airplanes and so forth what does he do various things on the international scene hannah hurried on i was telling your gardener what a thrill it was for me to be here i first heard of loch dhu when i was a young girl from my mothers father he was an army officer during the second world war and served on lord louis mountbattens staff in the far east she was making it up as she went along gort was his name colonel edward gort perhaps your brother spoke of him im afraid not my dear you see ian was involved in a dreadful air crash in india in fortyfour he was only saved by the courage of his batman jack tanner a man whod grown up with him on the estate here my brother was hospitalized on and off for years brain damage you see he was never the same he never talked about the war to be frank the poor dear never talked much about anything he wasnt capable how tragic hannah said my grandfather never mentioned that i believe the last time he saw him was in china that must have been before the crash hannah got up and poured more tea into her cup can i get you anything another cigarette my dear my only vice and at my age what does it matter hannah did as she was told then walked to the french window and looked out from the terrace at the great house in the distance it looks wonderful battlements and turrets just as i imagined it would be she turned im a hopeless romantic it was the idea of the laird of the clan as my grandfather described it that intrigued me bagpipes and kilts and all that sort of thing she came back oh and there was another rather romantic side to it he told me that major campbell always carried a silver bible with him that was a family heirloom hed had it at dunkirk but the story was that all the campbells had carried it into battle for centuries youre right she said it was certainly in rory campbells pocket when he died at the battle of culloden fighting for bonnie prince charlie its interesting that you should mention it i havent thought about that bible in years i suppose it must have been lost in the plane crash i see hannah said carefully certainly nothing survived except poor ian and jack tanner of course she sighed i just heard the other day that jack died in new york on a visit to see his daughter a good man he ran things on the estate for me for years the new man murdoch is a pain you know the kind college degree in estate management so he thinks he knows everything hannah nodded and got up so we can have ardmurchan lodge whenever you like leave me the details and ill have murdoch send you a contract hannah was already prepared for that and took an envelope from her handbag which she placed on the table there you are the brigadiers office is in cavendish square ill find angus shall i and get him to run me back to the plane youll find him in the garden hannah went and took her hand which was cool and weightless goodbye lady katherine goodbye my dear youre a very lovely young woman thank you she turned to the french window and lady katherine said a strange coincidence when that lawyer was here he asked about the bible too said mr morgan had mentioned reading about it in an article on highland legends in some american magazine isnt that extraordinary it certainly is hannah said he must have been disappointed it wasnt on show that was the impression i received the old woman smiled goodbye my dear hannah found angus digging in the garden ready to go miss thats right she said as they walked round to the front a range rover drew up and a tall saturnine young man in a hunting jacket and a deerstalker cap got out he looked at her inquiringly this is miss bernstein angus told him shes been seeing the mistress on behalf of my employer brigadier charles ferguson she said lady katherine has agreed to rent the ardmurchan lodge to us he frowned she didnt mention anything to me about it he hesitated then put out his hand stewart murdoch im the estate factor i only spoke to her this morning then that explains it ive been at fort william for two days ive left her full details and look forward to receiving the contract she smiled and got into the station wagon i must rush theres a lear waiting for me at ardmurchan well meet again im sure angus got behind the wheel and drove away murdoch watched them go frowning then went inside the lear took off climbing steeply rising to thirty thousand feet rapidly hannah checked her watch it was only just after two with luck shed be at gatwick by threethirty sooner with a tailwind another hour to reach the ministry of defence she picked up the phone and told the copilot to patch her in to ferguson his voice was clear and sharp had a good trip excellent sir and the lease on ardmurchan lodge is in the bag no luck with the bible the lady hasnt seen it in years always presumed it was lost in the plane crash yes well we know it wasnt dont we looks like were in for a sort of country house weekend treasure hunt sir you mean morgan is chief inspector so how do we handle it i dont know ill think of something come home chief inspector ill look for you at the office she put down the phone made herself a cup of instant coffee and settled back to read a magazine when she reached the ministry she found ferguson pacing up and down in his office ah there you are i was beginning to despair he said unreasonably and dont bother to take your coat off we cant keep the prime minister waiting he took down his coat from the stand picked up his malacca cane and went out and she hurried after him slightly bewildered but whats going on sir i spoke to the prime minister earlier and he told me he wished to see us the moment you got back so lets get cracking the daimler was admitted at the security gates at the end of downing street with no delay in fact the most famous door in the world opened the second they got out of the car and an aide took their coats and ushered them up the stairs past all the portraits of previous prime ministers and along the corridor knocking gently on the door of the great mans study they went in the door closed behind them the prime minister looked up from his desk brigadier may i introduce detective chief inspector hannah bernstein prime minister my assistant chief inspector the prime minister nodded i was naturally more than intrigued by your telephone call this morning now tell me everything youve discovered about this affair so far so ferguson told him leaving nothing out when he was finished the prime minister turned to hannah tell me about your visit to this place of course prime minister as she ended he said no question that lady katherine could be wrong absolutely not prime minister she was adamant that she hadnt seen it the bible i mean in years there was silence while the prime minister brooded ferguson said what would you like us to do find the damn thing before they do brigadier weve had enough trouble with hong kong its over were coming out and thats it so if this thing exists you find it and burn it and i dont want the chinese involved there would be hell to pay and keep our american cousins out of it too it was hannah who had the temerity to cut in you really think all this is true prime minister that it exists im afraid i do after the brigadier phoned me this morning i spoke with a certain very distinguished gentleman now in his nineties who was once a power at the colonial office during the war he tells me that many years ago he recalls rumours about this chungking covenant apparently it was always dismissed as a myth so what do you wish us to do prime minister we can hardly ask prince ali ben yusef for permission to ransack the house and we can hardly send the burglars in he leaves in four weeks and morgan moves straight in hannah said well he would wouldnt he once hes in he can take his time and do anything he wants the prime minister looked up at ferguson but youll be there at this ardmurchan lodge to keep an eye on things what do you intend to do improvise sir ferguson smiled the prime minister smiled back youre usually rather good at that see to it brigadier dont let me down now you must excuse me as they settled in the back of the daimler hannah said what now well go up to ardmurchan lodge just before morgan in three to four weeks in the meantime i want a check on him use all international police contacts i want to know where he goes and what he does fine good now let me give you dinner blooms i think in whitechapel you cant say no to that chief inspector the finest jewish restaurant in london after leaving the ministry of defence dillon had simply caught a taxi to stable mews not far from fergusons flat in cavendish square he had a twobedroom cottage there at the end of the cobbled yard by the time he reached it the pain had come again quite badly so he took one of the morphine capsules bellamy had prescribed and went and lay down on the bed it obviously knocked him out and when he came awake quite suddenly it was dark he got up visited the toilet and splashed water over his face in the mirror he looked truly awful and he shuddered and went downstairs he checked his watch it was seventhirty he really needed something to eat he knew that and yet the prospect of food was repugnant to him perhaps a walk would clear his head and then he could find a cafe he opened the front door rain fell gently in a fine mist through the light of the street lamp on the corner he pulled on his jacket aware of the weight of the walther and paused wondering whether to leave it but the damn thing had been a part of him for so long he found an old burberry trenchcoat and a black umbrella and ventured out he walked from street to street pausing only once to go into a corner pub where he had a large brandy and a pork pie which was so disgusting that just one bite made him want to throw up he continued to walk aimlessly there was a certain amount of fog now crouching at the end of the street and it gave a closedin feeling to things as if he was in his own private world he felt a vague sense of alarm probably drug paranoia and somewhere in the distance big ben struck eleven the sound curiously muffled by the fog there was silence now and then the unmistakable sound of a ships foghorn as it moved down river and he realized the thames was close at hand he turned into another street and found himself beside the river there was a corner shop still open he went in and bought a packet of cigarettes and was served by a young pakistani youth would there be a cafe anywhere near at hand dillon asked plenty up on high street but if you like chinese theres the red dragon round the corner on china wharf an interesting name dillon said lighting a cigarette hand shaking the tea clippers used to dock there in the old days of the china run the youth hesitated are you all right nothing to worry about just out of hospital dillon said but its kind of you to ask he walked along the street past towering warehouses it was raining heavily now and then he turned the corner and saw a tenfoot dragon in red neon shining through the rain he put down his umbrella opened the door and went in it was a long narrow room with dark paneled walls a bar of polished mahogany and a couple of dozen tables each covered with a neat white linen cloth there were a number of artifacts on display and chinese watercolors on the wall there was only one customer a chinese of at least sixty with a bald head and round enigmatic face he was no more than five feet tall and very fat and in spite of his tan gabardine suit bore a striking resemblance to a bronze statue of buddha which stood in one corner he was eating a dish of cuttlefish and chopped vegetables with a very western fork and ignored dillon completely there was a chinese girl behind the bar she had a flower in her hair and wore a cheongsam in black silk embroidered with a red dragon which was twin to the one outside im sorry she said in perfect english weve just closed any chance of a quick drink dillon asked im afraid we only have a table license she was very beautiful with her black hair and pale skin dark watchful eyes and high cheekbones and dillon felt like reaching out to touch her and then the red dragon on her dark dress seemed to come alive undulating and he closed his eyes and clutched at the bar once in the mediterranean on a diving job for the israelis that had involved taking out two plo highspeed boats that had been involved in landing terrorists by night in israel he had run out of air at fifty feet surfacing halfdead hed had the same sensation as now of drifting up from the dark places into light the fat man had him in a grip of surprising strength and put him into a chair dillon took several deep breaths and smiled sorry about this ive been ill for some time and i probably walked too far tonight the expression on the fat mans face did not alter and the girl said in cantonese ill handle this uncle finish your meal dillon who spoke cantonese rather well listened with interest as the man replied do you think they will still come niece who knows the worst kind of foreign devils pus from an infected wound still ill leave the door open a little longer she smiled at dillon please excuse us my uncle speaks very little english thats fine if i could just sit here for a moment coffee the girl said very black and with a large brandy god save us the brandy is fine but would you happen to have a cup of tea love its what i was raised on something we have in common she smiled and went behind the bar and took down a bottle of brandy and a glass at that moment a car drew up outside she paused then moved to the end of the bar and peered out through the window they are here uncle as she came round the end of the bar the door opened and four men entered the leader was six feet tall with a hard rawboned face he wore a cavalry twill car coat that looked very expensive he smiled quite pleasantly here we are again then he said have you got it for me the accent was unmistakably belfast the girl said a waste of your time mr mcguire there is nothing for you here two of his companions were black the fourth an albino with lashes so fair they were almost transparent he said dont give us any trouble darlin weve been good to you a grand a week for a place like this id say you were getting off lightly she shook her head not a penny mcguire sighed plucked the bottle of brandy from her hand and threw it into the bar mirror splintering the glass thats just for openers now you terry the albino moved fast his right hand finding the high neck of the silk dress ripping it to the waist baring one of her breasts he pulled her close cupping the breast in one hand now then what have we here the fat man was on his feet and dillon kicked a chair across to block his way stay out of this uncle ill handle it he called in cantonese the four men turned quickly to face dillon and mcguire was still smiling what have we got here then a hero let her go dillon said terry smiled and pulled the girl closer no i like it too much all the frustration the anger and the pain of the last few weeks rose like bile in dillons mouth and he pulled out the walther and fired blindly finishing off the bar mirror terry sent the girl staggering look at his hand he whispered hes shaking all over the place mcguire showed no sign of fear the accent makes me feel at home he said i mind yours too old son dillon told him the shankhill or the falls road its no difference to me now toss your wallet across mcguire didnt even hesitate and threw it on the table it was stuffed with notes i see youve been on your rounds dillon said it should take care of the damage here theres nearly two grand there terry said anything over can go to the widows and orphans dillon glanced at the girl no police right no police behind her the kitchen door opened and two waiters and a chef emerged the waiters carried butchers knives the chef a meat cleaver id go if i were you dillon said these people have rather violent ways when roused mcguire smiled ill remember you friend come on boys and he turned and went out they heard the car start up and drive away what little strength dillon had left him he sagged back in the chair and replaced the walther i could do with that brandy now and she was angry that was the strange thing she turned on her heel and pushed past the waiters into the kitchen what did i do wrong dillon asked as the staff followed her through it is nothing the fat man said she is upset let me get you your brandy he went to the bar got a fresh bottle and two glasses came back and sat down you spoke to me in cantonese you have visited china often a few times but not often hong kong mainly fascinating i am from hong kong and so is my niece my name is yuan tao sean dillon youre irish and visit hong kong only now and then and yet your cantonese is excellent how can this be well its like this some people can do complicated mathematics in their head quicker than a computer so im like that with languages i just soak them up dillon drank a little brandy i presume that lot have been here before i understand so i only flew in yesterday i believe they have been pressing their demands here and elsewhere for some weeks the girl returned wearing slacks and a sweater she was still angry and ignored her uncle glaring at dillon what do you want here yuan tao cut in we owe mr dillon a great deal we owe him nothing and he has ruined everything is it just coincidence that he walks in here strangely enough it was dillon said girl dear lifes full of them and what kind of man carries a gun in london another criminal jesus dillon told yuan tao the logic on her i could be a copper or the last of the vigilantes doing a charles bronson eradicating the evildoers the brandy had gone to his head and he got up ill be on my way its been fun and he got up and was out of the door before they could stop him five dillon was tired very tired and the pavement seemed to move beneath his feet he followed the road and it brought him alongside the thames he stood at some railings staring into the fog aware of another ship moving out there he was confused things happening in slow motion not aware that someone was behind him until an arm slipped around his neck cutting off his air a hand slipped inside his jacket and found the walther dillon was shoved into the railings stayed there for a moment then turned and moved forward the albino terry stood there holding the walther here we are again then a black limousine pulled into the curb dillon was aware of someone else at his back took a deep breath and brought up all his resources he swung his right foot up caught terrys hand and the walther soared over the railings into the thames he jerked his head back crunching the nose of the man behind then ran along the pavement he turned the corner and found himself on a deserted wharf blocked by high gates securely padlocked as he turned the limousine arrived and they all seemed to come at him together the first man with an iron bar which clanged against the gate as dillon lost his footing and fell rolling desperately to avoid the swinging kicks and then they had him up pinning him against the gates mcguire lighting a cigarette stood by the limousine he said you asked for this friend you really did okay terry slice him up terrys hand came out of his pocket holding an oldfashioned cutthroat razor which he opened as he came forward he was quite calm and the blade of the razor flashed dully in the light of a street lamp and somewhere a cry echoed flatly on the damp air terry and mcguire swung round and yuan tao came walking out of the rain the jacket of his gabardine suit was soaked and somehow he was different moving with a kind of strange relentlessness as if nothing could ever stop him and mcguire said for gods sake put him out of his misery the man with the iron bar darted round the limousine and ran at yuan tao the bar swinging and the chinese actually took the blow on his left forearm with no apparent effect in the same moment his right fist jabbed in a short screwing motion that landed under the mans breast bone he went down like a stone without a sound yuan tao leaned over him for a second and mcguire ran round the limousine and kicked out at him the older man caught the foot with effortless ease and twisted so that dillon could have sworn he heard bone crack then he lifted hurling mcguire across the bonnet of the car he lay on the pavement moaning yuan tao came round the limousine his face very calm and the man holding dillon from the rear released him and ran away terry held up the razor all right fatty lets be having you what about me then you bastard dillon said and as terry turned gave him a punch in the mouth summoning all his remaining strength terry lay on the pavement cursing blood on his mouth and yuan tao stamped on his hand and kicked the razor away a van turned into the street and braked to a halt as the chef got out the two waiters came round the corner holding the man who had run away id tell them to leave him in one piece dillon said in cantonese youll need him to drive this lot away an excellent point yuan tao said at least you are still in one piece only just im beginning to see why your niece was annoyed presumably you were actually hoping mcguire would show up i flew in especially from hong kong for the pleasure su yin my niece cabled for my help a matter of family it was difficult for me to get away i was at a retreat at one of our monasteries monasteries dillon asked i should explain mr dillon i am a shaolin monk if you know what that is dillon laughed shakily i certainly do if only mcguire had it means i suspect that youre an expert in kung fu darkmaster mr dillon our most extreme grade i have studied all my life i think i shall stay for two or three weeks to make sure there is no more trouble i shouldnt worry i think theyll have got the point mcguire terry and one of the blacks still lay on the pavement and the chef and two waiters brought the fourth man forward yuan tao went and spoke to them in cantonese and then returned theyll deal with things here su yin is waiting in her car at the restaurant they walked back turned the corner and found a dark sedan parked under the red dragon as they approached she got out and ignoring her uncle said to dillon in cantonese are you all right i am now i am sorry for my behavior she bowed i deserve punishment as my honorable uncle pointed out please forgive me theres nothing to forgive dillon told her and from the direction of the river a scream sounded she turned to her uncle what was that the little worm with the white hair the one who shamed you before us i told them to cut off his right ear su yins face didnt alter i thank you uncle she bowed again then turned to dillon you will come with us now mr dillon and this time she spoke in english girl dear i wouldnt miss it for the world he said and got in the back of the car if you have studied judo or karate you will have heard of kiai the power that makes a man perform miracles of strength and force only the greatest of masters acquire this and only after years of training and discipline both mental and physical well you certainly have it dillon said i can still see that steel bar bounce off your arm he was immersed to his neck in a bath of water so hot that sweat ran down his face yuan tao squatted against the wall in an old robe and peered at him through the steam dillon carried on once in japan i was taken to see an old man of eighty a zen priest with arms like sticks i think he might have weighed seven stone he remained seated while two karate black belts repeatedly attacked him and he threw them effortlessly i was told later that his power sprang from what they called the tanden or second brain which can only be developed by years of meditation all this is a development of the ancient chinese art of shaolin temple boxing it came from india in the sixth century with zen buddhism and was developed by the monks of shaolin temple in hohan province isnt that a rough game for priests i mean i had an uncle a catholic priest who taught me bareknuckle boxing as a boy and him a prize fighter as a younger man but this we have a saying a man avoids warfare only by being prepared for it the monks learned that lesson centuries ago members of my family learned the art and passed it down over the centuries my ancestors fought evildoers on behalf of the poor even the forces of the emperor when necessary we served our society are you talking of the triad society here dillon asked i thought they were simply a kind of chinese version of the mafia like the mafia they started as secret societies to protect the poor against the rich landowners and like the mafia they have become corrupted over the years but not all ive read something about this dillon said are you telling me you are a triad like my forefathers before me i am a member of the secret breath the oldest of all founded in hohan in the sixteenth century unlike others my society has not been corrupted i am a shaolin monk i also have business interests there is nothing wrong in that but i will stand aside for no man so all this and your fighting ability has been handed down of course there are many methods many schools but without chi they are nothing and what would that be a special energy when accumulated just below the navel it has an elemental force which is infinitely greater than physical force alone it means that a fist is simply a focusing agent there is no need for the tremendous punches used by western boxers i strike from only a few inches away screwing my fist on impact the result may be a ruptured spleen or broken bones i can believe that but deflecting that steel bar with your arm how do you do that practice mr dillon fifty years of practice i havent got that long dillon stood up and yuan tao passed him a towel one may accomplish miracles in a matter of weeks with discipline and application and with a man like you i doubt whether one would be starting from scratch there are scars from knife wounds in your back and that is an old bullet wound in the left shoulder and then there was the gun he shrugged no ordinary man i was stabbed in the back fairly recently dillon told him they saved me with two operations but it poisoned my system and your occupation i worked for british intelligence they threw me out this morning said i wasnt up to it anymore then they are wrong there was a pause and dillon said are you saying youll take me on i owe you a debt mr dillon come off it you didnt need me i interfered but you didnt know you were interfering and that makes a difference it is a mans intentions which are important yuan tao smiled wouldnt you like to prove your people wrong by god and i would so dillon said and then he hesitated as yuan tao handed him a robe id prefer honesty between us from the beginning so dillon stood up and pulled on the robe i was for years a member of the provisional ira and high on the most wanted list of the royal ulster constabulary and british intelligence and yet worked for the british yes well i didnt have much choice at first but now something has changed inside your head dillon grinned is there nothing you dont know anyway does it make a difference why should it from the way you struck one of those men tonight i think you have studied karate some but no big deal brown belt and working for black then i ran out of time this is good i think we can accomplish a great deal but now we will eat flesh on your bones again he led the way along a corridor to a sitting room furnished in a mixture of european and chinese styles su yin sat by the fire reading a book and wearing a black silk trouser suit i have news niece yuan tao said as she got up mr dillon is to spend three weeks as our guest this will not inconvenience you of course not uncle i will get the supper now she moved to the door opened it and glanced back at dillon over her shoulder and for the first time since they had met she smiled it was the morning of the fourth of july that morgan and asta flew into london they were picked up at heathrow by a rolls laid on by his london head office the berkeley she said where else the best hotel in town ive got us the wellington suite up on the roof with the two bedrooms and that wonderful conservatory and so convenient for harrods she said he squeezed her hand when did i ever tell you not to spend my money ill just drop you off ive business at the office but ill be back dont forget we have the fourth of july party at the american embassy tonight wear something really nice ill knock their eyes out you always do sweetheart your mother would have been real proud of you and he took her hand as the rolls moved away hannah bernstein knocked and went into fergusons office and found him working hard at his desk paper and even more paper he sat back what is it ive had a phone call from kim at ardmurchan lodge he arrived there safely last night in the range rover you appropriated he said the journey was very strenuous that the mountains reminded him of nepal but that the lodge is very nice apparently lady katherines cook jeannie appeared with a meat and potato pie to make sure he was all right kim once a corporal in the ghurkas had been fergusons body servant cook and general manaboutthehouse since army days good and morgan the prince moves out on sunday morning he has slots arranged from air traffic control from ardmurchan airfield ive checked and morgan has booked a slot to fly in that lunchtime in his company citation no time for breaking and entering im afraid and where is he now arrived at heathrow an hour ago with his stepdaughter booked into the wellington suite at the berkeley good god the duke must be turning in his grave appearance at the american embassy tonight sir which means ill have to skip that fourth of july junket never mind is the other business in hand yes sir excellent ill see you later then he returned to his work and she went out dillon came awake early from a deep sleep aware at once of pale evening light filtering in through the curtained window he was alone he turned to look at the pillow beside him at the indentation where her head had been and then he got up walked to the window and looked out through the halfdrawn curtains to the cobbled street of stable mews it was a fine evening and he turned and went to the wardrobe feeling relaxed and alive but more important whole again his eyes were calm his head clear and the ache in his stomach was honest hunger he stood in front of the mirror and examined himself he looked younger fitter in every way when he turned to examine his back in the mirror the angry weal of the operation scars from the knife wounds were already fading into white lines it was extraordinary barely four weeks since that night in wapping what yuan tao had achieved was a miracle he pulled on a track suit then followed the sound of running water to the bathroom when he opened the door su yin was in the shower its me he called are we having dinner tonight i have a business to run she called you keep forgetting we could eat late all right well see now go and do your exercises he closed the door and returned to the bedroom it was cool in there and quiet only the faint traffic sounds in the distance he could almost hear the silence and he stood there relaxing completely remembering the lines of the ancient taoist verse that yuan tao had taught him in motion be like water at rest like a mirror respond like the echo be subtle as though nonexistent the ability to relax completely the most important gift of all a faculty retained by all other animals except man cultivated it could provide a power that could be positively superhuman created by vigorous discipline and a system of training at least a thousand years old out of it sprang the intrinsic energy chi the life force which in repose gave a man the pliability of a child and in action the power of the tiger he sat on the floor crosslegged relaxing totally breathing in through his nose and out through his mouth he closed his eyes and covered his left ear with his right hand he varied this after five minutes by covering his right ear with his left hand still breathing deeply and steadily then he covered both ears arms crossed darkness enfolded him and when he finally opened his eyes his mouth was sharply cool he took a long shuddering breath and when he got to his feet his limbs seemed to be filled with power he wondered how bellamy would react and yet the results were there for all to see a hand that no longer trembled a clear eye and a strength he would never have believed possible su yin came in at that moment wearing cream slacks and a spanish shirt in vivid orange she was combing her hair you look pleased with yourself and why wouldnt i ive spent the afternoon in bed with a supremely beautiful woman and i still feel like samson she laughed youre hopeless sean get me a taxi he phoned the usual number then turned what about tonight we could eat late at the ritz and catch the cabaret its not possible she put a hand to her face i know how good you feel these days but you cant have everything in this life she hesitated you miss yuan tao dont you very much which is strange considering he only left five days ago would you miss me as much of course why do you ask im going home sean my sister and her husband are opening a new night club in hong kong my uncle phoned me last night they need me and the red dragon will continue quite happily with my head waiter promoted to manager and me he said what about me are you trying to say you love me he hesitated before replying and it was enough no sean weve had as good a time together as any two people could hope for in this life but everything passes and its time for me to go home how soon probably the weekend as the doorbell went she picked up her briefcase theres my taxi i must go ive lots to do he went with her to the door and opened it the taxi was waiting engine running she paused on the step this isnt the end sean youll call me he kissed her lightly on both cheeks of course but he wouldnt he knew that and she knew it too he could tell that by the way she paused before getting into the taxi glancing back as if aware that it was the last time and then the door slammed and she was gone he was in the shower for a good fifteen minutes thinking about it when the front door bell rang perhaps shed come back he found a bathrobe and went out drying his hair with a towel when he opened the door a man in brown overalls stood there a clipboard in his hand a british telecom van parked behind him sorry to bother you sir weve had four telephone breakdowns already this morning in the mews could i check your box he held up a british telecom identity pass with his photo on it above the name j smith sure and why not dillon turned and led the way along the corridor the junction box is under the stairs ill just go and change he went upstairs finished drying his hair combed it and pulled on an old track suit and trainers then went downstairs the telephone engineer was under the stairs everything all right dillon asked i think so sir dillon turned to go through the living room to the kitchen and saw a large laundry basket in the middle of the room what in the hell is this he demanded oh thats for you a second telephone engineer in the same uniform overalls stepped from behind the door holding an italian beretta automatic pistol he was getting on a little and had a wrinkled and kindly face jesus son theres no need for that thing just tell me what you want dillon said and moved to the wide victorian fireplace and stood with his hand on the mantelpiece i wouldnt try to grab for the walther you keep hanging from a nail just into the chimney sir weve already removed it the older man said so just lie on the floor hands behind your neck dillon did as he was told as smith joined them steady does it mr dillon he said and dillon was aware of a needle jabbing into his right buttock whatever it was it was good one moment he was there the next he was gone it was as simple as that he came back to life as quickly as he had left it it was night now and the only illumination in the room was from a kind of night light on the locker beside the single bed on which he lay he still wore his track suit they hadnt even taken off his trainers he swung his legs to the floor took a couple of deep breaths then heard voices and a key rattled in the lock he hurriedly lay back and closed his eyes still out is that all right doc it was smith speaking dillon recognized his voice someone else said let me see a finger checked his pulse on the right wrist and then his track suit top was unzipped and a stethoscope applied pulse fine heart fine the doctor said and rolled back dillons eyelids one after the other and probed with a light he was a tall cadaverous indian in a white coat and dillon by an act of supreme will stayed rigid staring no hell be awake soon one cannot be certain of the time element with these drug dosages there are individual variations in response well come back in an hour the door closed the key turned two bolts were also rammed home dillon was on his feet now moved to the door and stood there listening there was little point in wasting time on the door that was obvious he moved to the window and drew the curtain and was immediately presented with solid bars he peered out rain fell steadily dripping through a leak from the gutter which was just above his head there was a garden outside a high wall about fifty yards away if the gutter was where it was that meant there was only roof space above him it could be an attic but there was only one way to find out there was a small wooden table and a chair against the wall he dragged the table into the corner by the window and climbed into it the plaster of the ceiling was so old and soft that when he put his elbow into it it broke at once shards of plaster crumbling dropping into the room he enlarged the hole quickly tearing wooden lathing away with his bare hands when it was large enough he got down placed the chair on the table then clambered up on it pulling himself up to find a dark echoing roof space a chink of light drifting through a crack here and there he moved cautiously walking on beams the roof space was extensive and obviously covered the whole house a rabbit warren of halfwalls and eaves he finally came to a trapdoor which he opened cautiously below was a small landing in darkness stairs leading down to where there was diffused light dillon dropped to the landing paused to listen and then went down the stairs he found himself at one end of a long corridor which was fully lit he hesitated and at that moment a door opened on his left and smith and the indian doctor walked out and smith was fast dillon had to give him that pulling a walther from his pocket even as dillon moved in smashing a fist into his stomach and raising a knee into the mans face as he keeled over smith dropped the walther as he fell and dillon picked it up all right old son he said to the doctor answers where am i the indian was hugely alarmed st marks nursing home holland park mr dillon please his hands fluttered i loathe guns youll loathe them even more when ive finished with you whats going on here who am i up against please mr dillon the man was pleading now i just work here there was a sudden shout and dillon turned to see the second of his kidnappers standing at the end of the corridor he drew his beretta dillon took a quick snapshot with the walther the man went over backwards dillon shoved the indian into the room turned and went headlong down the stairs before he reached the bottom a shrill alarm bell sounded monotonously over and over again dillon didnt hesitate reaching the corridor on the ground floor in seconds running straight for the door at the far end he unlocked it hurriedly and plunged out into the garden it was raining hard he seemed to be at the rear of the house and somewhere on the other side he heard voices calling and the bark of a dog he ran across a piece of lawn and carried on through bushes a hand raised to protect his face from flailing branches until he reached the wall it was about fifteen feet high festooned with barbed wire possible to climb a nearby tree perhaps and leap across but the black wire strung at that level looked ominous he picked up a large branch lying on the ground and reached up when he touched the wire there was an immediate flash he turned and ran on parallel to the wall there was more than one dog barking now but the rain would help kill his scent and then he came to the edge of trees and the drive to the gates leading to the outside world they were closed and two men stood there wearing berets and camouflage uniforms and holding assault rifles a landrover drew up and someone got out to speak to them a man in civilian clothes dillon turned and hurried back toward the house the alarm stopped abruptly he paused by the rear entrance he had exited from earlier then opened it the corridor was silent and he moved along it cautiously and stood at the bottom of the stairs there were voices in the distance he listened for a moment then went cautiously back up the stairs the last place theyd look for him or so he hoped he reached the corridor on the top floor smith and the other man had gone but as dillon paused there considering his next move the door opened on his right and for the second time that night the indian doctor emerged his distress was almost comical oh my god mr dillon i thought you well away by now ive returned to haunt you dillon told him you didnt tell me your name chowdraydr emas chowdray good ill tell you what were going to do somewhere in this place is the person in charge youre going to take me to where he is if you donthe tucked chowdray under the chin with the waltheryoull loathe guns even more no need for this violence i assure you mr dillon i will comply he led the way down the stairs turning along a corridor on the first floor reaching a carpeted landing a curving regency staircase led to a magnificent hall the dogs were still barking in the garden outside but it was so quiet in the hall they could hear the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner where are we going dillon whispered down there the mahogany door chowdray told him down we go then they descended the carpeted stairs moved across the hall to the door the library mr dillon nice and easy dillon said open it chowdray did so and dillon pushed him inside the walls were lined with books a fire burned brightly in an adam fireplace detective chief inspector hannah bernstein stood by the fire talking to the two fake telephone engineers she turned and smiled come in mr dillon do youve just won me five pounds i told these two this is exactly where you would end up six the car which dropped dillon at his cottage in stable mews waited while he went in he changed into gray slacks a silk navy blue polo neck sweater and a donegal tweed jacket he got his wallet cigarette case and lighter and was outside and into the car again in a matter of minutes it was not long afterwards that they reached cavendish square and he rang the bell of fergusons flat it was hannah bernstein who answered do you handle the domestic chores as well now he asked wheres kim in scotland she told him youll find out why hes waiting she led the way along the corridor into the sitting room where they found ferguson sitting beside the fire reading the evening paper he looked up calmly there you are dillon i must say you look remarkably fit more bloody games dillon said a practical test which i thought would save me a great deal of time and indicate just how true the reports ive been getting on you were he looked at hannah youve got it all on video yes sir he returned to dillon you certainly gave poor old smith a working over and as for his colleague its a good job you only had blanks in that walther he shook his head my god dillon you really are a bastard when you get going god bless your honor for the pat on the head dillon said and is there just the slightest chance you could be telling me what in the hell this is all about certainly ferguson said theres a bottle of bushmills on the sideboard you get the file out chief inspector thank you dillon said with irony and went and helped himself ferguson said if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes i wouldnt have believed it remarkable fellow this yuan tao wish he could work for me i suppose you could always try to buy him dillon said not really ferguson said he owns three factories in hong kong and one of the largest shipping lines in the far east besides a number of minor interests restaurants that sort of thing didnt he tell you no dillon said and then he smiled he wouldnt have hes not that sort of bloke brigadier his niece seems an attractive girl she is shes also returning to hong kong this weekend i bet you didnt know that what a pity well have to find another way of filling your time im sure you wont have the slightest difficulty dillon told him as usual youve hit the nail on the head i obviously wanted you back anyway but as it happens something special has come up something that i think requires the dillon touch for one thing theres a rather attractive young lady involved but well come to that later chief inspector the file here sir she said and handed it to him have you heard of a man called carl morgan billionaire hotel owner financier amongst other things dillon said never out of the society pages in the magazines hes also closely linked with the mafia his uncle is a man called don giovanni luca in sicily hes capo di tutti capi boss of all the bosses ferguson was genuinely impressed how on earth do you know all this oh about a thousand years ago when i worked with a certain illegal organization called the ira the sicilian mafia was one of the sources from which we obtained arms really hannah bernstein said dryly it might be useful to have you sit down and commit everything you remember about how that worked to paper its a thought dillon told her she handed him a file have a look at that delighted ill make some tea sir she went out and dillon sat on the windowseat smoking a cigarette as he finished she returned with a tray and he joined them by the fire fascinating stuff this chungking covenant business there were some photos clipped to the back of the file one of them of morgan in polo kit the man himself looks like an advert for some manly aftershaves hes a dangerous man hannah said as she poured tea dont kid yourself i know girl dear he said there were other photos some showing morgan with the great and good and a couple with luca he certainly knows everybody you could say that and this dillon asked the last photo showed morgan on his yacht at cannes harbor reclining in a deck chair a glass of champagne in hand gazing up at a young girl who leaned on the rail she looked about sixteen and wore a bikini blond hair to her shoulders his stepdaughter asta though she uses his name hannah told him swedish yes taken more than four years ago shes twentyone in three weeks or so we have a photo of her in tatler somewhere taken with morgan at goodwood races very very attractive id say morgan would agree with you to judge from the way hes looking at her in that picture why do you say that particularly ferguson asked he smiles a lot usually hes smiling on all the other photos but not on this one its as if hes saying i take you seriously where does the mother fit in you havent indicated her on any photos she was drowned a year ago while diving off a greek island called hydra an accident faulty air tank thats what the autopsy said but theres a copy of an investigation mounted by the athens police here hannah produced it from the file the brigadier tells me youre an expert diver youll find it interesting dillon read it quickly then looked up frowning no accident this that valve must have been tampered with did it end at that the police didnt even raise the matter with morgan i got this from their dead file courtesy of a friend in greek intelligence ferguson told him morgan has huge interests in greek shipping casinos hotels there was an order from the top to kill the investigation theyd never have got anywhere hannah said not with the kind of money he has and all that power and influence but what were saying is he killed his wife or arranged to have it done dillon said why would he do that was she wealthy yes but nothing like as rich as he is ferguson said my hunch is that perhaps shed got to know too much and thats your opinion dillon asked hannah bernstein possibly she picked up the photo taken on the yacht but maybe it was something else perhaps he wanted asta dillon nodded thats what i was thinking he turned to ferguson so what are we going to do on this one ferguson nodded to hannah who took charge the house at loch dhu morgan goes in this coming monday the brigadier and i are going up on friday flying to this old raf station at ardmurchan and we move into ardmurchan lodge where kim is already in residence and what about me youre my nephew ferguson said my mother was irish remember youll join us a few days later why our information is that asta isnt going with morgan shes attending a ball at the dorchester which is being given by the brazilian embassy on monday night morgan was supposed to go and shes standing in for him hannah said weve discovered that she flies to glasgow on tuesday and then intends to take the train to fort william and from there to arisaig where shell be picked up by car how do you know this dillon asked oh lets say we have a friend on the staff at the berkeley she said why take the train from glasgow when she could fly direct to ardmurchan on morgans citation god knows ferguson said perhaps she fancies the scenic route that train goes through some of the most spectacular scenery in europe so what am i supposed to do the chief inspector has a goldedged invitation for one sean dillon to attend the brazilian embassy ball on monday night ferguson told him its black tie for you dillon you do have one sure and dont i need it for those spare nights im a waiter at the savoy and what do i do when im there for the first time hannah bernstein looked unsure well try and get to know her pick her up you mean wont that look something of a coincidence when i turn up at ardmurchan lodge later quite deliberate on my part dear boy remember our little adventure in the american virgins ferguson turned to hannah im sure youve read the file chief inspector the late lamented senor santiago and his motley crew knew who we were just as we knew who they were and what they were up to it was what i call a we know that you know that you know that we know situation so dillon said morgan at loch dhu for nefarious purposes an isolated estate miles from anywhere in the highlands of scotland discovers hes got neighbors up for the shooting staying on the other side of the loch at ardmurchan lodge hell be checking us out the minute he knows were there dear boy and dont tell me we could all use false names with the kind of company he keeps especially his mafia contacts in london hell not have the slightest difficulty in sorting us out all right point taken but i know you you old bugger and theres more to it hasnt he an elegant turn of phrase chief inspector ferguson smiled yes of course there is as ive indicated i want him to know were there i want him to know were breathing down his bloody neck of course ill also see that the story morgan taking loch dhu and asta standing in for him at the brazilian embassy affair is leaked to the daily mails gossip column you could always say later that you read that were intrigued because you were going to the same spot so you went out of your way to meet her it wont make the slightest difference morgan will still smell stinking fish wont that be dangerous brigadier hannah bernstein commented yes it will chief inspector thats why we have dillon he smiled and stood up its getting late and dinner is indicated you must be famished both of you ill take you to the river room at the savoy excellent dance band chief inspector you can have a turn round the floor with the desperado here he may surprise you when monday night came dillon arrived early at the dorchester he wore a dark blue burberry trenchcoat which he left at the cloakroom his dinner jacket was a totally conventional piece of immaculate tailoring by armani single breasted with lapels of raw silk black studs vivid against the white shirt he was really rather pleased with his general appearance and hoped that asta morgan would feel the same he fortified himself with a glass of champagne in the piano bar and went down to the grand ballroom where he presented his card and was admitted to discover the brazilian ambassador and his wife greeting their guests his name was called and he went forward mr dillon the ambassador said a slight query in his voice ministry of defence dillon said so good of you to invite me he turned to the ambassadors wife and kissed her hand gallantly my compliments on the dress most becoming she flushed with pleasure and as he walked away he heard her say in portuguese to her husband what a charming man the ballroom was already busy a dance band playing exquisitely gowned women most men in black tie although there was a sprinkling of military dress uniforms and here and there a church dignitary with the crystal chandeliers the mirrors it was really quite a splendid scene and he took a glass of champagne from a passing waiter and worked his way through the crowd looking for asta morgan and seeing no sign of her finally he went back to the entrance lit a cigarette and waited it was almost an hour later that he heard her name called she wore her hair up revealing the entire face the high scandinavian cheek bones and the kind of arrogance that seemed to say that she didnt give a damn about anyone or anything for that matter she wore an absurdly simple dress of black silk banded at the waist the hem well above the knee black stockings and carried an evening purse in a sort of black chain mail heads turned to watch as she stood talking to the ambassador and his wife for quite some time probably making morgans excuses dillon said softly finally she came down the stairs pausing to open her purse she took out a gold cigarette case selected one then searched for a lighter damn she said dillon stepped forward the zippo flaring in his right hand sure and nothings ever there when you want it isnt that the truth she looked him over calmly then held his wrist and took the light thank you as she turned to go dillon said cheerfully six inches at least those heels mind how you go dear girl a plaster cast wouldnt go well with that slip of a dress her eyes widened in astonishment then she laughed and walked away she seemed to know a vast number of people working her way from group to group occasionally posing for society photographers and she was certainly popular dillon stayed close enough to observe her and simply waited to see what the night would bring she danced on a number of occasions with a variety of men including the ambassador himself and two government ministers and an actor or two dillons opportunity came about an hour later when he saw her dancing with a member of parliament notorious for his womanizing as the dance finished he kept his arm round her waist as they left the floor they were standing by the buffet and she was trying to get away but he had her by the wrist now dillon moved in fast jesus asta im sorry im so late business the other man released her frowning and dillon kissed her on the mouth sean dillon he murmured she pushed him away and said petulantly you really are a swine sean nothing but excuses business is that the best you can do dillon took her hand totally ignoring the mp well ill think of something lets take a turn round the floor the band played a foxtrot and she was light in his arms by god girl but you do this well he said i learned at boarding school twice a week we had ballroom dancing in the hall girls dancing together of course always a row over who was to lead i can imagine you know when i was a boy back home in belfast we used to club together so one of the crowd could pay to get in at the dancehall then hed open a fire door so the rest got in for free you dogs she said well at sixteen you didnt have the cash but once in it was fantasy time all those girls in cotton frocks smelling of talcum powder she grinned we lived in a very working class area perfume was far too expensive and thats where you perfected your performance and what performance would that be oh come off it she said the smooth act you pulled back there now im supposed to be grateful isnt that how it goes you mean we vanish into the night so that i can have my wicked way with you he smiled im sorry my love but ive other things planned and im sure you do he stopped on the edge of the floor and kissed her hand its been fun but try and keep better company he turned and walked away and asta morgan watched him go a look of astonishment on her face the pianist in the piano bar at the dorchester was dillons personal favorite in the whole of london when the irishman appeared he waved and dillon joined him leaning on the piano heh you look great man something special tonight ball for the brazilian embassy the great and the good sometimes making fools of themselves takes all sorts you want to fill in i could do with a visit to the mens room my pleasure dillon slipped behind the piano and sat down as the pianist stood a waitress approached smiling the usual mr dillon krug my love nonvintage dillon took a cigarette from his old silver case lit it and moved into a foggy day in london town a personal favorite he sat there the cigarette dangling from the side of his mouth smoke drifting up immersed in the music and yet still perfectly aware of asta morgans approach a man of talent i see as an old enemy of mine once said a passable barroom piano thats all fruits of a misspent youth enemy you say we supported the same cause but had different attitudes on how to go about it lets put it that way a cause mr dillon that sounds serious a heavy burden the waitress arrived with the krug in a bucket and he nodded a glass for the lady well sit in the booth over there i was a stranger in the city she said giving him some of the verse out of town were the people i knew he replied thank the gershwins for it george and ira they must have loved this old town wrote it for a movie called a damsel in distress fred astaire sang it i hear he could dance a little too she said the black pianist returned at that moment heh man thats nice but not as good as you take over dillon got out of the way as the pianist sat beside him they sat in the booth and dillon lit a cigarette for her and gave her a glass of champagne id judge you to be a man of accomplishment and high standards and yet you drink nonvintage she said as she sampled the krug the greatest champagne of all the nonvintage he said its quite unique its the grape mix and not many people know that they go by whats printed on the label the surface of things a philosopher too what do you do mr dillon as little as possible dont we all you spoke of a cause not a job or a profession a cause now that i do find interesting jesus asta morgan here we are in the best bar in london drinking krug champagne and youre turning serious on me how do you know my name well the tatler knows it and hello and all those other society magazines you keep appearing in hardly a secret you and your father keeping such highclass company why they even had you in the royal enclosure at ascot last month with the queen mother god save her and me just a poor irish peasant boy with his nose to the window i was in the enclosure because my father had a horse running and i doubt whether youve ever put your nose to a window in your life mr dillon ive a strong suspicion youd be much more likely to kick it in she stood up my turn to leave now its been nice and im grateful for you intervening back there hamish hunt is a pig when hes been drinking a girl like you my love would tempt a cardinal from rome and no drink taken dillon told her for a moment she changed the hard edge gone flushed looking slightly uncertain why mr dillon compliments and at this time of night whatever next dillon watched her go then got up and followed he paid his check quickly retrieved his burberry and pulled it on walking out into the magnificent foyer of the dorchester there was no sign of her at the entrance and the doorman approached cab sir i was looking for miss asta morgan dillon told him but i seem to have missed her i know miss morgan well sir shes been at the ball tonight id say her driver will be picking her up at the side entrance thanks dillon walked round and followed the pavement the park lane traffic flashing by there were a number of limousines parked waiting for their passengers and as he approached asta morgan emerged wearing a rather dramatic black cloak the hood pulled up she paused looking up and down the line of limousines obviously not finding what she was looking for and started along the pavement at the same moment the mp hamish hunt emerged from the hotel and went after her dillon moved in fast but hunt had her by the arm and up against the wall his hands under her cloak his voice was loud slurred with the drink come on asta just a kiss she turned her face away and dillon tapped him on the shoulder hunt turned in surprise and dillon ran a foot down his shin stamping hard on hunts instep then headbutted him sharply and savagely and with total economy hunt staggered back and slid down the wall drunk again dillon said i wonder what the voters will say and he took astas hand and pulled her away a mercedes limousine slid up to the curb and a uniformed chauffeur jumped out i hope i havent kept you waiting miss asta the police were moving us on earlier i had to go round thats all right henry a uniformed police officer moved along the pavement toward hunt who was sitting against the wall and asta opened the rear door of the mercedes and pulled dillon by the hand come on wed better get out of here he followed her in the chauffeur got behind the wheel and eased into the traffic jesus maam the grand car youve got here and me just a poor irish boy up from the country and hoping to make a pound or two she laughed out loud poor irish boy mr dillon ive never heard such rot if you are its the first one ive heard of who wears clothes by armani ah you noticed if theres one thing im an expert on its fashion thats my fruits of a misspent youth sure and its the terrible old woman you are already asta morgan all right she said where can we take you anywhere the least i can do he pressed the button that lowered the glass window separating them from the chauffeur take us to the embankment driver he said and raised the window again the embankment she said what for he offered her a cigarette didnt you ever see those old movies where the fella and his girl walked along the pavement by the embankment overlooking the thames before my time mr dillon she said and leaned forward for a light but im willing to try anything once when they reached the embankment it was raining would you look at that now dillon said she put the partition window down were going to walk henry pick us up at lambeth bridge have you an umbrella certainly miss asta he got out to open the doors and put up a large black umbrella which dillon took asta slipped a hand in his arm and they started to walk is this romantic enough for you he demanded i wouldnt have thought you the romantic type she said but if you mean do i like it yes i love the rain the city by night the feeling that anything could be waiting just up around the next corner probably a mugger these days now i know youre not a romantic he paused to get out his cigarettes and gave her one no i take your point when i was young and foolish a thousand years ago life seemed to have an infinite possibility to things and what happened life he laughed you dont mess about do you i mean back there with that creep hamish hunt you went in hard and what does that tell you that you can take care of yourself and thats unusual in a man who wears an evening suit that cost at least fifteen hundred pounds what do you do well now lets see i went to the royal academy of dramatic art but that was a long time ago i played lyngstrand in ibsens lady from the sea at the national theatre he was the one who coughed a lot and afterwards i mean you obviously gave up acting or id have heard of you not entirely you might say i took a considerable interest in what might be termed the theater of the street back home in the old country strange she said if i had to guess id say youd been a soldier and whos the clever girl then damn you dillon she said mystery piles on mystery with you youll just have to unpeel me layer by layer like an onion but that would take time and thats exactly what i dont have she said im going up to scotland tomorrow i know dillon said there was a mention in nigel dempsters gossip column in the mail this morning carl morgan takes the lease on a highland estate for the shooting that was the byline it also said you were standing in for him tonight at the brazilian embassy ball you are well informed they had reached lambeth bridge by now and found the mercedes waiting dillon handed her in i enjoyed that ill drop you off she said no need dont be silly im curious to see where you live anything to oblige he got in beside her stable mews henry thats close to cavendish square ill show you where when we get there when they turned into the cobbled street it was still raining he got out and closed the door asta put the window down and looked out at the cottage all in darkness no lady friend dillon alas no but you can come in for a cup of tea if you like she laughed oh no ive had enough excitement for one night another time perhaps i dont think so in fact i doubt whether well ever see each other again ships that pass in the night something like that home henry and as she put up the window the mercedes pulled away dillon watched it go and as he turned to open the door he was smiling seven it was peaceful in the small railway station by the lochside and dillon peered out of the rear compartment keeping out of sight following her had been easy the lear had taken him to glasgow airport at breakfast time and he had waited until asta had arrived on the morning shuttle from london had followed her down to the central railway station keeping out of the way from glasgow to fort william had been easy for the train was busy with many tourists here to see loch lomond and afterwards the spectacular mountain scenery of the highlands the smaller local train from fort william to arisaig had been more difficult for there were only a handful of passengers and hed kept out of sight only leaping into the rear compartment at the last moment the station they had stopped at now was named shiel according to the board at one side of the ticket office they seemed to be standing there for quite some time it was very pleasant a mountain above them rearing three thousand feet into the clear blue sky sunlight glinting on a waterfall that spilled over granite into birch trees asta morgan suddenly stepped onto the platform she wore a leather jacket and linen slacks and leather brogues she made an attractive sight in the quiet setting she moved across to the ticket collector who stood at the barrier there was some conversation a burst of laughter and she went through the barrier the ticket collector moved to join the guard who was standing by the open door beside dillon youve lost a passenger tom do you tell me a bonny lass a miss morgan hair of corn and a face to thank god for her father is yon fella morgan thats just leased loch dhu castle shes away over the mountain youll put her luggage down at arisaig and leave a message dillon grabbed his burberry trenchcoat and brushed past the guard do you mean theres a shortcut over the mountain well that would depend where you want to be ardmurchan lodge the guard nodded over the top of ben breac and a twelvemile walk to the other side youll be staying with brigadier ferguson the new tenant my uncle hell be waiting at arisaig perhaps you could tell him where i am and give him my luggage dillon slipped a fivepound note into his hand leave it to me sir the guard blew his whistle and boarded the train dillon turned to the ticket collector where do i go through the village and over the bridge theres a path through the birches hard going but you cant miss the cairns that mark the way once over the top the track is plain to the glen below will the weather hold the man looked up at the mountain a touch of mist and rain in the evening id keep going dont waste time on top he smiled id tell the young lady that sir no place for a lassie to be on her own dillon smiled ill do that a pity to see her get wet a thousand pities sir at the small village store he purchased two packs of cigarettes and two halfpound bars of milk chocolate for sustenance twelve miles on the other side of the mountain and that didnt count the miles that stood up on end something told him he could be hungry before he reached ardmurchan he marched down the street and crossed the bridge the track snaked up through the birch trees lifting steeply bracken pressing in on either side it was cool and dark and remote from the world and dillon thanks to his renewed energy was enjoying every moment of it there was no sign of asta which suited him for now the trees grew sparser and he emerged onto a brackencovered slope occasionally grouse or plover lifted out of the heather disturbed by his presence and finally he came to a boulderstrewn plain that stretched to the lower slopes of ben breac he saw asta then six or seven hundred feet up on the shoulder of the mountain she turned to look down and he dropped into the bracken when he glanced up a few moments later she had disappeared round the shoulder of the mountain she was certainly moving fast but then she was young and healthy and the track was plainly visible there was another way of course though only a fool would try that which was straight up the breast of the mountain and the granite cliffs beyond to the summit he took out an ordnance survey map of moidart and had a look at the situation dillon glanced up what the hell strong nerves were all that was needed here and with luck he might actually get ahead of her he tied his burberry around his waist and started up the lower slopes were easy going with his newfound strength but after a half hour he came to a great cascading bank of scree and loose stones that moved beneath his feet alarmingly he went to his left found the waterfall hed noted from the station and followed its trail upwards moving from boulder to boulder finally he reached the plateau and the final cliffs were before him and they were not quite as intimidating as theyd looked from the station fissured with gullies and channels reaching to the top he looked checking his route ate half a bar of chocolate then made sure his raincoat was secure and started up climbing strongly testing each handhold he looked down once and saw the railway station in the valley below like a childs toy the next time he looked it had disappeared blanked out by mist and a sudden breeze touched him coldly he came over the granite edge to the summit a few minutes later to find himself cocooned in mist and hed spent enough time in hill country in the past to know that there was only one thing to do in such conditions stay put he did just that lighting a cigarette wondering how asta morgan was getting on it was a good hour later when a sudden current of air dissolved the curtain of the mist and down there the valleys lay dark and quiet in the evening sunlight in the distance was a cairn of stones marking the ultimate peak but there was no asta he cut across the track and followed it back until he reached a point where he could look down almost three thousand feet to the railway line and there was no sign of her so she had beaten him to the summit hardly surprising for with the track to follow the mist would have been no problem he turned back following the track to descend on the other side and paused suddenly as he stared down at the incredible sight before him the sea in the distance was calm the islands of rum and eigg like cardboard cutouts and on the dark horizon the isle of skye the final barrier to the atlantic it was one of the most beautiful sights he had ever seen and he started down asta was tired and her right ankle was beginning to ache legacy of an old skiing accident it had been harder crossing ben breac than she had imagined and now she was faced with a twelvemile hike what had originally started as an amusing idea was now becoming rather a bore the track along the glen was dry and dusty and hard on her feet and after a while she came to a fivebarred gate with a sign that said loch dhu estatekeep out it was padlocked and she pulled herself over and limped on and then she rounded a curve and saw a small hunting lodge by the burn the door was locked but when she went round to the rear a window stood ajar she hauled herself through and found herself in a small kitchen area it was gloomy now darkness falling but there was an oil lamp and kitchen matches she lit the lamp and went into the other room it was adequately furnished with whitewashed walls and a wooden floor and a fire was laid in the hearth she put a match to it and sat in one of the wingbacked chairs suddenly tired the warmth from the fire felt good and her ankle didnt hurt now she added pine logs to the fire and heard a vehicle drive up outside a key rattled in the lock and the front door opened the man who stood there was of medium height with a weak sullen face and badly needed a shave he wore a shabby tweed suit and cap his yellow hair shoulderlength and he carried a doublebarreled shotgun would you look at that now he said asta said calmly what do you want thats a good one he said and you trespassing how in the hell did you get in here through the kitchen window i dont think my boss would like that hes new just took over the estate yesterday did mr morgan but i know a hard man when i see one i mean if he knew about this he might make it a police matter dont be stupid i turned my ankle coming over ben breac i needed a rest thats all now that youre here you can give me a lift he moved closer and his hand was shaking as he put it on her shoulder that depends doesnt it his blotched face the stink of whiskey on his breath was suddenly repulsive to her whats your name thats more friendly its fergusfergus munro she pulled away and sent him staggering with a vigorous push then dont be stupid fergus munro he reached angrily dropping the shotgun you bitch ill teach you he grabbed at her catching the blouse beneath the leather coat the thin material ripping from her left shoulder to the breast she gave a cry of rage striking out at him her nails gouging his right cheek and then beyond him she saw a man materialize from the darkness into the doorway dillon punched him in the kidneys very hard and hauled him back by the scruff of the neck and hurled him across the room munro hit the wall and fell to one knee he reached for the shotgun which dillon kicked out of the way grabbing for his right wrist twisting it up taut and straight ramming munro headfirst into the wall he scrambled up blood on his face and plunged through the open door as dillon went after him asta cried let him go dillon paused a hand on each side of the door frame then he closed it and turned are you all right outside an engine burst into life yes fine what was that he had a shogun she eased herself back in the chair i was really beginning to despair dillon i thought you were never going to catch up with me what on earth are you doing here confession time he said ive an uncle brigadier charles ferguson who rented a place called ardmurchan lodge not far from here for the shooting which it shares with the loch dhu estate really my father will be surprised he never likes to share anything with anyone yes well when i read that item in the gossip column in the daily mail saw your photo i couldnt resist wangling myself an invitation to the brazilian embassy to meet you just like that im terribly well connected youd be surprised nothing would surprise me about you and for what its worth i dont believe a word of it she put down her right foot and winced damn trouble an old injury thats all she pulled up the right leg of her slacks and he eased off the shoe and sock id have thought you would have caught up with me i tried the short route straight up and it proved longer i had to sit down in the mist i just kept on walking i noticed you at the station in glasgow i was coming out of the toilets and saw you buying a map at the bookstall i waited till you boarded the train before getting on board myself most intriguing especially when you changed trains as i did at fort william so you left the train to draw me on of course damn you asta i should put you over my knee is that a promise we swedes are reputed to be terribly oversexed he laughed out loud id better get on with this foot while fergus munro hotfoots it to loch dhu castle with his tale of woe i should think we can expect company soon i should hope so i havent the slightest intention of walking any further dillon raised her foot there was a faint puffiness at the ankle and a jagged scar how did you get that skiing there was a time when i was an olympic possibility too bad ill take the lamp for a minute he went into the kitchen checked the drawers and found some kitchen towels he soaked one in cold water and returned to the living room a cold compress will help he bandaged the ankle expertly tired not too much hungry though he got one of the halfpound blocks of chocolate from his burberry pocket bad for your figure but sustaining youre a magician dillon she ate the chocolate greedily and he lit a cigarette and sat by the fire she suddenly paused what about you i had some he stretched the grand place this fish in the burn deer in the forest a roof over your head and a fine strong girl like yourself to help on the land thanks very much an arid sort of life i should have thought havent you heard the old italian saying one can live well on bread and kisses or chocolate she held up what was left of the bar and they both laughed dillon got up went and opened the door there was a full moon and the only sound was the burn as its waters ran by we could be the last two people left on earth she said not for long theres a vehicle coming he moved out of the porch and stood there waiting two shoguns braked to a halt fergus munro was driving the first one and murdoch was sitting next to him as munro got out the factor came round from the other side clutching a shotgun carl morgan was at the wheel of the second one and got out an enormously powerfullooking figure in his sheepskin coat murdoch said something to munro and clicked back the hammers on the shotgun munro opened the door of the shogun and murdoch whistled softly there was a sudden scramble inside and a black shadow materialized from the darkness to stand beside him flush him out boy as the dog came forward with a rush dillon saw that it was a doberman pinscher one of the most deadly fighting dogs in the world he went forward to meet it good boy he said and extended a hand the dog froze a growl starting somewhere at the back of the throat and munro said thats him mr morgan thats the bastard who attacked me and his fancy woman still inside no doubt morgan said private property my friend you should have stayed out the dog growled again full of menace and dillon whistled softly an eerie sound that set the teeth on edge the dogs ears went back and dillon fondled his muzzle and stroked him good god murdoch said easy when you know how dillon told him i learned that from a man who was once my friend he smiled later he regretted teaching me anything but thats life morgan said calmly who in the hell are you it was then that asta joined the scene carl is that you thank god youre here she stumbled from the doorway and morgan astonishment on his face moved fast to catch her in his arms asta for gods sake what is this he helped her inside and fergus munro said to murdoch asta who in the hell is asta something tells me youre in for a very unpleasant surprise my old son dillon told him and he turned and followed them in the doberman at his heels asta was back in the chair and morgan knelt beside her holding a hand it was horrible carl i left the train at lochailort and came over the mountain turned my ankle and was feeling absolutely foul when i found the lodge and got in through the kitchen window and then this man came the man out there he was horrible morgan stood up the man out there he said and his face was very pale yes carl he threatened me her hand went to the torn blouse in fact he was thoroughly unpleasant and then mr dillon here came and there was a struggle and he threw him out morgan had murder in his eyes he turned to murdoch who stood in the doorway do you realize who this is my daughter asta wheres that bastard who brought us here fergus the roar of an engine breaking into life answered him and he pushed murdoch to one side and ran out to see one of the shoguns drive away shall i go after him murdoch said no morgan shook his head hands unclenching well deal with him later he turned to dillon and held out a hand im carl morgan and i would seem to be considerably in your debt dillonsean dillon morgan turned to asta are you trying to tell me you walked over that damn mountain this afternoon it seemed like a good idea at the time i thought id just walk in on you surprise you morgan turned to dillon who lighting a cigarette forestalled him im on my way to join my uncle brigadier charles ferguson for the shooting hes leased a place called ardmurchan lodge there was something in morgans eyes straight away but he simply said that makes us neighbors then i presume you also thought it was a good idea to walk over the mountain not at all i thought it was a lousy idea and so did the ticket collector when she left the train to be frank id noticed her destination from her luggage labels i got out to stretch my legs and saw her make off when i asked the ticket collector what was going on he told me she was going to walk over the mountain as i said he didnt think much of the idea and neither did i so i decided to follow unfortunately i chose another route and was delayed by the mist so i didnt catch up with her until she reached the lodge asta said weakly im afraid ive made something of a fool of myself could we go now carl she was acting up to the hilt and dillon an actor himself saw that but not morgan who put an arm round her instant concern there of course we will he glanced at dillon well drop you off on the way that would be fine dillon said murdoch took the wheel on the way down the glen and dillon and morgan sat on the large bench seat asta between them the doberman on the floor at their feet dillon fondled its ears guard dog they said morgan shook his head with you hes more like a big pussy cat an emotional thing between me and him mr morgan he likes me loves you more like asta said ive never seen anything like it i still wouldnt like to be the intruder who comes over the wall and finds him there so brigadier ferguson is your uncle morgan said i havent had the pleasure yet but then i only arrived at loch dhu castle myself yesterday yes dillon said so i understand is the brigadier retired or in business or what oh he was in the army for years but now hes a consultant to a number of businesses worldwide and you i help out a sort of middleman you might say ive got this thing for languages so he finds me useful im sure he does murdoch changed down and swung in through gates following a narrow drive to the house beyond lights at the window he braked to a halt ardmurchan lodge it was raining again rattling against the windscreen morgan said it does that a lot six days out of seven driving in from the atlantic just think asta said we could be in barbados oh it has its points im sure dillon said she took his hand i hope to get a chance to thank you properly perhaps tomorrow morgan said plenty of time for that ill fix something up you both need a chance to settle in as dillon got out morgan followed him ill see you to the door at that moment it opened and ferguson appeared good god sean is that you we got your message at arisaig but i was beginning to get worried what happened a long story ill tell you later can i introduce our neighbor carl morgan what a pleasure ferguson took morgans hand your reputation precedes you will you have a drink before you go no i must get my daughter home morgan said another time i believe well be sharing the shooting ferguson said genially yes they didnt tell me that when i took the lease morgan told him dear me i trust there wont be a problem oh i dont see why there should be as long as were not shooting from opposite sides morgan smiled good night he got back in the shogun and it drove away he knows dillon said of course he does ferguson told him now come in out of this appalling rain and tell me what youve been up to when the shogun arrived at loch dhu castle morgan helped asta out and said to murdoch you come too we need to talk very well mr morgan the great ironbanded oak door was opened by marco russo wearing a black alpaca jacket and striped trousers my god marco asta said i cant believe it a butler now she was probably the only human being he ever smiled for and he did now a short engagement only miss asta tell the maid to run a bath morgan said and turned to murdoch you wait in the study he took asta through the magnificent baronial hall and placed her in the great oak chair beside the log fire that crackled in the open hearth right he said dillon he followed you over the mountain why he told you thats a load of tripe well he knew who i was and where i was going but not because of my luggage labels explain which she didthe brazilian embassy ball the writeup in the daily mails social column everything i might have known morgan said when she finished why do you say that as soon as i heard about the new tenant at ardmurchan lodge i had him checked brigadier charles ferguson asta is head of a very elite section of british intelligence usually involved with antiterrorism and responsible to the prime minister only but i dont understand they know he said the chungking covenant my god she said and dillon works for him she nodded it makes sense now what does well i told you dillon saved me from that beast hamish hunt at the ball what i didnt tell you was that hunt grabbed me in park lane afterwards he was terribly drunk carl and pretty foul his face was pale again and dillon appeared and beat him up ive never seen anything like it he was so economical he would be a real pro i thought so morgan smiled so i owe him not once but twice he helped her up off you go and get your bath well have some supper later as he walked away he called marco the sicilian appeared from the shadows signore listen to this very quickly morgan gave him a resume of events in italian when he was finished marco said he sounds hot stuff this dillon get on to london now i want answers and theyve only got an hour make that clear as you say signore he walked away and morgan went and opened the study door it was a pleasant room lined with books french windows to a terrace and as in the hall a fire burned on the hearth murdoch was standing staring down into it and smoking a cigarette morgan sat at the desk opened a drawer and took out a check book over here yes mr morgan murdoch crossed the room and morgan wrote a check and handed it to him the factor looked at it in astonishment twentyfive thousand pounds but whats this for mr morgan loyalty murdoch i like greedy people and ive formed the opinion that thats what you are murdoch was stunned if you say so sir oh but i do and heres the good news murdoch when i leave you get the same amount for services rendered naturally murdoch had control of himself now a slight smile on his face of course sir anything you say morgan said for several hundred years the lairds of loch dhu took a silver bible into battle it was always recovered even when they died it was with the old laird when his plane crashed in india in nineteen fortyfour ive reason to believe it was returned to the castle but where is it murdoch thats the thing lady katherine sir knows nothing hasnt seen it in years its here murdoch tucked away somewhere and were going to find it understand yes sir discuss it with the servants just tell them its a valuable family heirloom and theres a reward for whoever finds it i will sir you can go now murdoch had the door open when morgan called and murdoch yes sir brigadier ferguson and dillon theyre not on our side i understand sir good and dont forget i want to know where that bastard fergus munro is to be found preferably tonight yes sir one more thing is there anyone on the estate staff who works at ardmurchan lodge ferguson has his own man sir this ghurka body servant theres lady katherines gardener angus he sees to the garden and the daily wood supply can he be bought murdoch nodded id say so good eyes and ears is what i want see to it and find fergus i will sir murdoch went out closing the door morgan sat there for a while then noticed a library ladder on impulse he got up pushed it to one end of the shelves on one of the walls and mounted he climbed to the top and started to remove the books a few at a time peering behind eight dillonhaving bathed and changed into a comfortable track suit sprawled in front of the fire hannah bernstein in the chair opposite he had just finished his account of the days events and ferguson was pouring drinks at the cabinet in the corner anything for you chief inspector no thank you sir well the boy here could do with a brandy im sure it was rather a long walk dillon said and accepted the glass what do you think about morgan oh he knows that was totally apparent from our little exchange so what will his next move be hannah asked im not sure well see what tomorrow brings ferguson sat down its an interesting situation by the way the shooting rights and the fishing kim tells me he was fishing in loch dhu on the day before we arrived when some damn rascals who work for this murdoch fellow as keepers turned up and suggested he leave and not too pleasantly who are they ive made inquiries tinkersthe last remnants of a broken clan you know a touch of all that scottish romantic nonsense theyve wandered the highlands since culloden and all that sort of tosh old hector munro and his brood i saw them in ardmurchan village yesterday and theres nothing romantic about them bunch of ragged foulsmelling rogues theres old hector fergus hell be the one i had the runin with then theres the other brother rory big roughlooking lout hair tied in a pony tail i mean why do they do that dillon earrings as well after all its not the seventeenth century hannah burst out laughing and dillon said they broke the mould with you brigadier and you say they ran kim off the place yes i sent him round to the castle with a stiff letter of complaint to this murdoch chap the factor told him i was considering laying a complaint with the chief constable of the county what happened murdoch was round like a shot full of apologies said hed keep them in line gave me some cockandbull story about arctic tern nesting near loch dhu and not wanting to disturb them apologized for the munros said hed kick their backsides and so on dillon went and helped himself to another brandy he came back to the fire were entitled to be here to shoot deer in the forest to fish in the loch of course we are ferguson said mind you morgan doesnt like it i mean he made that clear on the doorstep didnt he lets draw his teeth then ill put my head in the jaws of the tiger tomorrow youve got all we need for the fishing and the shooting good ill try loch dhu in the morning plenty of trout i suppose masses dear boy quarterpoundersor occasional pounders good ill take a rod down there after breakfast hannah said the munros could prove unpleasant if they catch you especially after your bout with fergus i was with the brigadier when we saw them in ardmurchan village they really are a fearsomelooking clan id say they are the sort who dont take kindly to being beaten and neither do i dillon finished his drink ill see you at breakfast and he went up to bed at the same moment asta was sitting opposite morgan by the fire in the great hall at the castle when marco came in a piece of paper in his hand fax from london signore morgan read it quickly then laughed out loud dear god listen to this the bernstein woman is a detective chief inspector special branch at scotland yard but its dillon who takes the biscuit sean dillon once an actor rada and the national theatre superb linguist speaks many languages firstclass pilot expert diver good god he worked for the israelis in beirut but what was he doing there sinking plo boats apparently not choosy our mr dillon hes worked for just about everyone youve ever heard of and that includes the kgb in the old days you mean hes some kind of mercenary asta asked thats one way of putting it but before that he was for some years with the provisional ira one of their most feared enforcers theres even a suggestion he was behind the attack on downing street during the gulf war then why would he be working for ferguson i suppose the brits were the only people he hadnt worked for and you know how unscrupulous they are theyd use anybody to suit their purposes a thoroughly dangerous man asta said how exciting morgan handed the fax to marco oh weve handled thoroughly dangerous men before havent we marco many times signore will there be anything else yes bring me some coffee and tell murdoch ill see him now asta got up im for bed can we ride tomorrow why not he took her hand sleep well she kissed him on the forehead and went away up the great staircase morgan reached for a cigar clipped it and lit it and murdoch entered his oilskin coat wet well morgan asked no luck im afraid that old bastard hector munro was immovable he said fergus had gone off on his evening rounds and they hadnt seen him since hes lying of course what did you do searched their stinking caravans which he didnt like but i insisted i want fergus morgan said i want him where i can deal with him personally he put his filthy hands on my daughter and no man does that and gets away with it try again tomorrow yes mr morgan good night sir murdoch went out and marco came in with the coffee as he poured it morgan said in italian what do you think of him murdoch a piece of dung signore no honor only money counts there thats what i thought keep an eye on him you can go to bed now marco went out and morgan sat there brooding drinking his coffee and gazing into the fire he was sitting in the study at the desk at eight the following morning working his way through various business papers when there was a knock at the door and murdoch looked in i have angus here sir bring him in angus entered took off his tweed cap and rolled it between his hands mr morgan sir morgan looked him over you look like a practical man to me would i be right i hope so sir morgan opened a drawer and took out a bundle of notes which he tossed across angus picked it up five hundred pounds anything unusual happens at ardmurchan lodge you phone murdoch i will sir he was sweating slightly have you been there this morning to do the wood supply sir and whats happening mr dillon was having an early breakfast before going for the fishing on loch dhu he asked my advice morgan nodded good on your way angus left and murdoch said if the munros come across him he could be in trouble exactly what i was thinking morgan smiled and at that moment asta came in wearing a hacking jacket and jodhpurs there you are she told him you said we could go riding and why not he glanced at murdoch get the horses ready you can come with us he smiled we could have a look at the loch the waters of loch dhu were darker than even the name suggested still and calm in the gray morning and yet dappled by falling rain dillon wore waders an old rainhat and an australian drovers waterproof with caped shoulders both of which he had found at the lodge he lit a cigarette and took his time over putting his rod together behind him the heather was waist deep a line of trees above and a plover lifted into the morning a wind stirred the surface of the loch and suddenly a trout came out of the water beyond the sandbar a good foot in the air and disappeared again suddenly dillon forgot everything remembering only his uncles sheep farm in county down and the lessons hed given his young nephew in the great art he tied the fly ferguson had recommended apparently one of his own manufacture and went to work his first dozen casts were poor and inexpert but gradually as some of the old skill returned he had better luck and hooked two quarterpounders the rain still fell relentlessly he let out another couple of yards of line lifted his tip and cast out beyond the sandbar to where a black fin sliced through the water his cast was the most accurate hed ever made the fly skimming the surface the rod bent over and his line went taut two pounds if it was an ounce his reel whined as the hooked trout made for deep water and he moved along the sandbank playing it carefully the line went slack and he thought hed lost it but the trout was only resting and a moment later the line tightened again he played it for a good ten minutes before turning to reach for his net he lifted the floundering fish removed the hook and turned back to shore a harsh voice said well and good me bucko a fine dinner for us the man who had spoken was old at least seventy he wore a tweed suit that had seen better days and white hair showed beneath his glengarry bonnet his face was weatherbeaten and wrinkled and covered with a heavy stubble and he had a shotgun crooked in his right arm behind him two men stood up in the heather one was large and rawboned with a perpetual smile and that would be rory dillon told himself the other was fergus a livid bruise down one side of his face his mouth swollen thats him da thats the bastard who attacked me and he raised his shotgun waist high rory knocked it to one side and it discharged into the ground try not to play the fool as usual little brother he said in gaelic dillon an irish speaker had no difficulty in understanding especially when hector said he doesnt look much to me and swung a punch dillon ducked avoiding it but his foot slipped and he fell into the shallows he scrambled up and the old man raised his shotgun not now my brave wee man he said in english youll get your chance slow and easy walk on as dillon moved forward fergus said wait till ive done with you and swung the butt of his shotgun dillon avoided it easily and fergus went down on one knee rory lifted him by the scruff of his neck will you listen or must i kick your arse he demanded in gaelic and pushed him ahead god help him but he never will learn that one dillon told him in irish some men stay children all their lives rorys mouth went slack with astonishment by god da did you hear that the strangest gaelic i ever heard thats because its irish the language of kings dillon said but close enough that we can understand each other and he walked on ahead of them there was smoke beyond the trees the sound of childrens voices so they were not taking him to morgan and he realized he had made something of a miscalculation they moved down into a hollow containing the camp the three wagons were old with canvas tilts and patched many times far removed from the romantic idea of a caravan there was an air of poverty to everything from the shabby clothes worn by the women who squatted by the fire drinking tea to the bare feet of the children who played in the grass beside several bony horses fergus gave dillon a push that sent him staggering forward and the women scattered the children paused in their play and came to watch hector munro sat himself on an old box vacated by one of the women placed his shotgun across his knees and took out a pipe fergus and rory stood slightly behind dillon an attack on one of us is an attack on all mr dillon or whatever your name is the great pity you werent knowing that he stuffed tobacco into his pipe rory rory moved fast pulling dillons arms behind him and the old man said enjoy yourself fergus fergus moved in fast and punched dillon in the stomach right and left handed dillon made no move except to tense his muscles and fergus drove a fist into his ribs on the right side now for that pretty face of yours he said hold his head up rory in taking a handful of dillons hair rory had to release one of his arms dillon flicked a foot forward catching fergus in the crutch halfturned delivering a reverse elbow strike to the edge of rorys jaw the big man released him staggering back and dillon ran for it and stumbled headlong as one of the women stuck out a foot he rolled desperately as they all kicked at him even the children and then there was the drumming of horses and a voice called stop that damn you and a shotgun was fired the women and children broke and ran and dillon got up to find murdoch on horseback a shotgun braced against his thigh behind him carl morgan and asta rode down into the hollow dillon was aware of fergus slipping under one of the wagons stay there you silly bastard rory hissed in gaelic then glanced at dillon in alarm realizing he had heard carl morgan urged his mount down into the hollow the hooves of his horse scattered the fire and he pulled on the right rein so that the animal turned its hind quarters catching hector munro a blow that sent him staggering he reined in tell them who i am he ordered this is mr carl morgan new tenant of loch dhu castle murdoch said and your employer is that so hector munro said so bare your head you mannerless dog murdoch told him leaned down from his horse and plucked the old mans bonnet from his head and threw it down rory took a step forward and dillon said in irish easy boy theres a time and a place for everything rory turned frowning and his father said the man dillon was fishing in the loch we were only doing our duty dont lie to me munro murdoch told him mr dillon is nephew to brigadier ferguson tenant at ardmurchan lodge and dont tell me you didnt know that you scoundrels know everything that goes on in the district before it bloody well happens enough of this morgan said and looked down at munro you wish to continue to work for the estate why yes sir the old man said then you know how to behave in future yes sir munro picked up his bonnet and put it on and now that son of yours fergus he assaulted my daughter i want him and we have not seen him sir as i told mr murdoch if he gave offense to the young lady im sorry but the great one for wandering is fergus away for days sometimes rory said who could be knowing where he might be he glanced at dillon briefly but dillon said nothing morgan said i can wait well go now mr dillon ill be fine dillon said i want to get my fishing tackle i can walk back he moved to astas stirrup and looked up at her are you all right she asked just fine dillon said i do this kind of thing most mornings it gives me an appetite for lunch morgan said ill be in touch dillon come on asta and he cantered away dillon turned to look down into the hollow at the munros fergus crawled out from under the wagon and dillon called in irish so there you are you little rascal id take care if i were you he went down to the shore and retrieved his rod and fishing basket as he turned to go rory munro moved out of the trees now why would you do a thing like that for fergus and you and he bad friends he asked in gaelic true but then i dislike morgan even more mind you the girl is different if fergus touches her again ill break both his arms rory laughed oh the hard one are you small man you could always try me dillon told him rory stared at him frowning and then a slow smile appeared and perhaps that time will come he said turned and walked back into the trees dillon drank tea by the fire at ardmurchan lodge while he detailed the events of the morning to ferguson and hannah bernstein so the plot thickens ferguson said lucky for you that morgan turned up when he did hannah said you might have been a hospital case by now yes a useful coincidence ferguson said and you know how much i believe in those dillon told him hannah frowned you think morgan was behind the whole thing im not sure about that but i believe he expected it thats why he turned up very possibly ferguson nodded which raises the question of how he knew you were going to go fishing this morning i know lifes just one big mystery dillon said what happens now lunch dear boy i thought we might venture into ardmurchan village and sample the delights of the local pub they must offer food of some sort pub grub brigadier you hannah bernstein said and you chief inspector although i hardly expect it will be kosher ill find out she said i think that chap angus is working in the garden she opened the french windows and went out returning a few moments later he says the campbell arms does do food shepherds pie things like that real food ferguson said how wonderful lets get going then morgan was standing on the terrace at the top of the steps with asta when murdoch joined them ive just had a phone call from angus our friends are going to the campbell arms for lunch really morgan said it could lead to an interesting situation the day after tomorrow is the local fair and highland games there are tinkers around horse traders and so on the munros will probably be there is that so morgan smiled and turned to asta we couldnt possibly miss that could we he raised his voice and called marco russo appeared in the open windows bring the estate car round were going to the village for a drink and you drive ive a feeling we might need you the campbell arms was very old built of gray granite but the sign that hung above the door was freshly painted dillon parked across the street and he and hannah and ferguson got out and crossed pausing as a young gypsy rode by bareback on a pony leading three others behind there was a poster on the wall advertising the ardmurchan fair and games that looks like fun ferguson said and opened the door and led the way in there was an oldfashioned snug bar the type that in the old days was for women only this was empty but a further door gave access to a large saloon beams in the ceiling there was a long bar with a marble top scores of bottles behind ranged against a great mirror there was a peat fire on an open hearth tables chairs booths with highbacked wooden settles it was not exactly shouldertoshoulder but perhaps a crowd of thirty or more some obviously gypsies to do with the fair others more local old men wearing cloth caps and leggings or in some cases highland bonnets and plaids like hector munro who stood at one end of the bar with rory and fergus there was a buzz of conversation that stopped abruptly as ferguson stepped in the others at his shoulder the woman behind the bar came round wiping her hands on a cloth she wore an old handknitted jumper and slacks you are welcome in this place brigadier she said in a highland accent and took his hand my name is molly good to be here my dear he said i hear your food is excellent over here she led them to one of the booths by the fire and turned to the room get on with your drinking while i handle the damned english she told them in gaelic sean dillon said in irish a bad mistake you make in my case woman of the house but ill forgive you if you can find me a bushmills whiskey she turned her mouth open in surprise then put a hand to his face irish is it good lad yourself and i might surprise you they settled down and she added in english fish pie is what there is today if you have a mind to eat fresh cod onions and potatoes which sounds incredible to me ferguson told her ill have a guinness lager beer for the lady and whatever you and my friend here have decided a man after my own heart and a good scots name to you she went off and as the conversation flowed again dillon lit a cigarette the old man with the granite face and the bonnet at the end of the bar is hector munro the damaged one is fergus and the bit of rough with the good shoulders thats looking at you so admiringly hannah my love is rory she flushed not my type dillon turned and nodded to the munros oh i dont know with a couple of drinks in you at the shank of the night who knows you are a bastard dillon i know its been said before hector munro wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and came over shouldering men aside mr dillon you did my son a service he said in english and for that i thank you maybe we got off on the wrong foot this is my uncle brigadier ferguson dillon said i ken the name ferguson munro said there are a few not many miles from here tomentoul way they were on our left flank at culloden fighting king georges bloody germans you do have a lengthy memory ferguson said almost two hundred and fifty years long yes my ancestors did fight at culloden for prince charles good man yourself munro pumped his hand and went back to the bar my goodness we are trapped in memory lane ferguson said as molly brought the drinks she put them on the table and the door opened and morgan and asta walked in murdoch and marco behind them there was another silence morgan surveying the room and then he came forward with asta behind him marco stayed at the bar and murdoch approached molly morgan and asta sat on the settle opposite ferguson and his party brigadier what a pleasure i didnt have a chance to introduce you to my daughter last night astabrigadier ferguson a pleasure my dear ferguson told her you know my nephew this charming lady by the way is my secretary miss hannah bernstein murdoch came from the bar with glasses and a bottle of white wine not much choice sir its a chablis as long as they didnt make it in the back yard it will be fine morgan said what about the food fish and potato pie old boy ferguson said they only have one dish a day then fish and potato pie it is morgan told him were hardly having lunch at the caprice indeed not ferguson said very different waters exactly murdoch poured the wine and morgan raised his glass what shall we drink to confusion to our enemies dillon said a good irish toast how very apt asta drank a little wine and said how nice to meet you miss bernstein strange but in the time we were together dillon never mentioned you having met you of course i understand why try and behave yourself why dont you dillon told her her eyes widened in outrage and morgan frowned and then murdoch leaned over and whispered in his ear and morgan turned and looked toward the bar at that moment fergus was sliding toward the door morgan called in italian stop him marco thats the one i want marco put a hand to ferguss chest and pushed him back and hector munro and rory took a step forward leave my son be or you answer to me the old man said morgan called munro i asked for your son earlier and you claimed no knowledge as to his whereabouts as your employer i expected better my son is my business what touches him touches us all please spare me that kind of peasant claptrap he assaulted my daughter and for that he must pay and fergus was frightened now his face white and desperate he tried to dodge around marco who caught him with ease grabbing him by the neck turning him sending him to his knees before morgan the bar was totally silent now then you animal morgan said rory came in on the run heres for you he cried and swung a punch into the base of marcos spine the sicilian shrugged it off turned blocking rorys next punch and gave him a right that landed high on the left cheek sending rory staggering back against the bar fergus cowering in fear on the floor saw his chance got up to make for the door marco turning was already moving to block him off when hannah bernstein stuck out a foot and tripped him marco went sprawling and fergus was out of the door like a weasel dreadful isnt it ferguson said to morgan i cant take her anywhere as marco got up rory moved in from the bar and dillon jumped in between them this dog is mine he said in irish to rory now drink your beer like a good lad and let be rory stared at him rage in his eyes then took a deep breath as you say irishman but if he lays a hand on me again he is my meat and he turned and went back to the bar strange ferguson said to morgan but since meeting you lifes taken on an entirely new meaning hasnt it morgan said amiably and at that moment molly arrived with a huge tray containing plates of her fish and potato pie my word that does smell good ferguson beamed lets tuck in im sure were going to need all our strength afterwards standing in the street outside morgan said i wondered about dinner tomorrow night perhaps i thought it might be nice to invite lady katherine excellent thought ferguson said delighted to accept asta said do you ride dillon its been known perhaps you could join us tomorrow morning we could mount you with no trouble ah well there you have me he said my uncle promised to take me deer stalking tomorrow have you ever tried it deer stalking that sounds absolutely wonderful she turned carl id love to go not my style and ive business to take care of tomorrow ferguson said amiably wed be delighted to have you join us my dear that is if you have no objection morgan why should i an excellent idea well pick you up ferguson said ninethirty he raised his tweed hat goodbye for now and turned and led the way back to the range rover right lets go morgan said and asta led the way to the parked station wagon murdoch murmured a word sir ive an idea where fergus might have gone is that so morgan said all right well take miss asta home and then you can show me at ardmurchan lodge ferguson shrugged off his coat and went and stood with his back to the fire and what do you make of that the heavy blocking the door sir is his present minder one marco russo hannah bernstein said i checked with immigration he came in with morgan information from the italian police indicates hes a known mafia enforcer and member of the luca family a thoroughly nasty bit of work if you ask me ferguson said and turned to dillon whats all this deer stalking nonsense then youve never stalked deer brigadier dillon shook his head youve never lived and you a member of the upper classes of course ive stalked deer ferguson told him and kindly keep your fatuous comments to yourself what i want to know is why are we taking the girl tomorrow you obviously wanted it which is why i asked her im not sure dillon said id like to get to know her a little better it might lead somewhere hannah bernstein said dillon get one thing straight that is one tough capable and intelligent young lady if you think she doesnt know exactly how morgan makes his money youre fooling yourself observe them use your eyes theyre a very intimate couple id give you odds she knows exactly what theyre doing up here dillon said which is exactly why i want to cultivate her i agree ferguson said so we go as planned in the morning kim can be a gun bearer youll stay here and hold the fort chief inspector as you say sir ferguson turned to dillon anything else yes ive decided to pay a visit to the castle tonight check things out see whats going on any objections not at all come to think of it its rather a good idea ferguson smiled strange but morgans actually quite civilized when you meet him dont you agree not really sir hannah bernstein said as far as im concerned hes just another gangster in a good suit nine fergussquatted on a truckle bed in the old hunting bothy at the west end of loch dhu and drank from a bottle of whiskey he was no longer afraid now the events at the pub behind him but he was angry particularly when he thought of asta you bitch he said to himself all your fault he drank some more whiskey just wait if i ever get my hands on you again there was a sudden creak the door swung open and murdoch slipped in here he is sir he said and morgan moved through the door behind him a riding crop in his hand marco at his side now then you piece of dirt morgan said fergus was terrified he got up the bottle of whiskey in one hand now look theres no need for this it was a mistake i didnt know who she was mistake morgan said oh yes your mistake you little swine he turned marco marco was pulling on a pair of leather gloves fergus suddenly smashed the whiskey bottle spraying the bed with its contents and held up the jagged glass threateningly ill do for you i swear i will as marco advanced fergus swung the bottle the sicilian blocked his arm to one side and punched him with sickening force under the ribs fergus dropped the bottle and staggered back on the bed morgan said leave him marco stood back and morgan went forward you put your filthy hands on my daughter he slashed fergus across the face with his riding crop again and again and fergus screaming tried to protect himself with his raised arms morgan rained blow after blow then stood back and marco moved in again punching fergus in the face sending him to the floor kicking him with brutal efficiency enough marco stepped back and fergus lay moaning on the floor morgan turned and found murdoch in the doorway looking as frightened as fergus had done do you have a problem morgan asked no mr morgan good lets get going then he led the way outside and they got in the station wagon marco behind the wheel and drove away it was some time later evening falling when fergus appeared in the doorway he looked dreadful blood on his face he stood there swaying a little and then staggered down the slope to the loch he waded into the shallows and dropped to his knees scooping water over his face and head the pain in his head was terrible the worst thing hed ever known it was really a merciful release when everything went dark and he fell forward into the water it was eleven oclock and raining hard as hannah bernstein turned the range rover in beside the wall of loch dhu castle my god she said its a miracle when it does stop raining here thats bonny scotland for you dillon said he was all in black sweater jeans running shoes and now he pulled a black ski mask over his head only his eyes and mouth showing you certainly look the part she said thats the idea he pulled on thin black leather gloves and took a walther from the glove compartment and fitted the new short harley silencer to it for gods sake dillon you arent going to war thats what you think my lovely he slipped the gun into his waistband and his teeth flashed in the opening of the ski mask as he smiled here we go then give me an hour and he opened the door and was away the wall was only twelve feet high and simple enough to negotiate a crumbling edge or two for footholds and he was over and dropping into damp grass he moved through trees came out into an area of open grass and jogged toward the castle finally halting in another clump of trees looking across smooth lawn toward the lighted windows of the castle the rain fell relentlessly he stood there sheltered slightly by a tree and the great oaken front door opened and marco russo appeared there the doberman at his side marco gave the dog a shove with his foot obviously putting it out for the purposes of nature then went inside the dog stood there sniffing the rain then lifted a leg dillon gave the low curious whistle he had used at the hunting lodge the dobermans ears went up then it came bounding toward him he crouched stroking its ears allowing it to lick his hands good boy he said softly now do as youre told and keep quiet he moved across the lawn and peered in through french windows and found asta in the study reading a book by the fire she made an appealing figure in a pair of black silk lounging pajamas he moved away the dog at his heels looked in through a long narrow window and saw the empty hall he moved round to the far side and heard voices and noticed a french window standing ajar curtains were partly drawn and when he peered cautiously inside he saw morgan and murdoch in a large drawing room there were several bookcases against the wall and morgan was replacing books in one of them ive been through every inch in this room taken down every book searched every drawer every cupboard and the same in the study not a bloody sign what about the staff theyve all got their instructions sir every one of them is eager to win the thousandpound reward you promised but nothing as yet its got to be here somewhere tell them to renew their efforts the doberman whined slipped in through the window and rushed up to morgan who rather surprisingly greeted it with some pleasure you big lump where have you been he leaned down to pat the animal my god hes soaking he could catch pneumonia take him to the kitchen murdoch and towel him off im going to bed murdoch went out his hand on the dobermans collar and morgan turned and walked to the window he stood there looking at the night for a moment then crossed to the door and went out switching off the light dillon slipped in through the window went to the door and stood listening for a moment then he opened the door a crack aware of voices astas and morgans the study door was open and he heard morgan say im for bed what about you i suppose so asta said if im out on the moors tomorrow stalking deer ill need all my energy and wits he said listen to everything ferguson and dillon say store it up and remember it yes oh master she laughed and when they came out morgan had an arm about her waist youre a great girl asta one of a kind strange but watching them go up the great staircase together was something of a surprise to dillon no suggestion of the wrong kind of intimacy at all and at the top of the stairs morgan only kissed her on the forehead good night my love he said and he went one way and she the other well ill be damned dillon said softly he stayed there for a while thinking there was little point in going any further hed picked up one useful piece of intelligence that they hadnt got anywhere as regards finding the bible that was a good enough nights work and the truth was what hed done had been more for the hell of it than anything else on the other hand again just for the hell of it he could do with a drink and hed noticed through the french windows the drinks cabinet in the study he opened the door and hurried across the great hall to the study door as he got it open the doberman arrived skidding on the tiles as it tried to brake sliding past him into the study dillon closed the door and switched on a lamp on one of the tables you great eejit he said to the dog and fondled its ears he went to the drinks cabinet and found no irish whiskey so made do with scotch he went and stood looking down into the fire taking his time and behind him the door opened as he turned drawing the walther asta came in she didnt notice him at first closed the door and turned and she didnt show any sign of fear stood there looking at him calmly and then said that couldnt be you could it dillon dillon laughed softly jesus girl you really are on morgans side arent you he slipped the walther back in his waistband at the rear and pulled off his ski mask why shouldnt i be hes my father isnt he stepfather dillon helped himself to a cigarette from a silver box on a coffee table and lit it with his everpresent zippo mafia stepfather father as far as im concerned the only decent one ive ever known the first version was a rat the kind of man who sniffed around everything in a skirt he made my mothers life hell it was a blessing when his car ran off the road one day and he was burned to death in the crash that must have been rough a blessing dillon and then after a year or two my mother met carl the best man in the world really she took a cigarette from the box look dillon i know all about you all about the ira all that stuff and i know who decent old ferguson really is carl told me i bet he tells you everything i suppose you could give me chapter and verse on the chungking covenant of course i could carl tells me everything i wonder i mean theres the carl morgan of the social pages the polo player man of the year billionaire and then back there in the shadows is the same old mafia sources of cash flow drugs prostitution gambling extortion she moved to the french windows opened one and looked out at the rain dont be tiresome dillon after all you can talk what about all those years with the provisional ira how many soldiers did you kill how many women and kids did you blow up i hate to disappoint you but i never blew up a woman or a child in my life soldiers yes ive killed a few of those but as far as im concerned that was war come to think of it i did blow up a couple of plo boats in beirut harbor but they were due to land terrorists on the israeli coast with the deliberate intention of blowing up women and kids all right point taken what are you doing here anyway just curious thats all i wondered if you were getting anywhere but i overheard morgan discussing things with murdoch and of the bible there is no sign it must be here she said tanner said it came back she frowned im not giving anything away am i i mean you and ferguson wouldnt be here if you didnt know thats right he said lord louis mountbatten the laird ian campbell the dakota crash in india you neednt go on carl would love to know how you found out but i dont suppose youll tell me classified information he finished his drink and there was a noise in the hall on my way he pulled on his ski mask and as he slipped out of the french window said see you in the morning the door opened and morgan came in he looked surprised good god asta you startled me i thought youd gone to bed i decided to come down for my book and guess what dillon was here morgans eyes narrowed really he looked terribly dramatic all in black with a ski mask looked like carlos the jackal on a bad saturday night in beirut hes just gone what was he after just prowling around to see what was happening apparently he overheard you and murdoch discussing your lack of success at finding the bible morgan poured a brandy and came over to stand beside her at the french windows they know everything carl mountbatten corporal tanner the laird everything she said you got that much out of him easy carl he likes me and he wasnt giving anything away he wouldnt tell me how they found out and you said yourself it was obvious they knew otherwise why would a man like ferguson be here he nodded and they dont care that we know interesting tactics he swallowed some brandy are they still picking you up in the morning yes good he emptied his glass and closed the window bed then and this time lets mean it so the decks really are cleared for action now ferguson said you did say you wanted him to know we were breathing down his neck dillon reminded him yes its a good tactic dont you agree chief inspector he turned to hannah bernstein who was leaning against his desk i suppose so sir if were playing games that is so thats what you think were doing im sorry sir its just that i dont feel were really getting to grips with this thing we know what morgan is up to and he knows what we are im not sure it makes sense it will my dear when that bible turns up will it lets say he suddenly found it at the back of a drawer tonight brigadier they could be into his citation and flying out of the country in the morning and nothing we could do about it well well just have to see wont we kim came in with tea on a tray ferguson shook his head its bed for me ill see you in the morning he went out and kim poured the tea and retired hannah said to dillon what do you think you could be right but ive a hunch it isnt so he moved to the window opened it and looked at the rain bouncing on the flagged terrace i dont think that bible is tucked away in some casual spot so that a maid might find it while shes dusting he turned remember what tanner said when the doctor asked him if the bible had been returned to loch dhu yes his answer was you could say that and then he laughed now why would he do that hannah shrugged some private joke exactly quite a mystery and i came across another tonight what was that dillon said when i was snooping around earlier at the castle i saw morgan and asta going up to bed so it wasnt what i expected not a hint of a sexual relationship at the top of the stairs he kissed her forehead and they went their separate ways now that is interesting hannah bernstein told him it is if you consider any theory that says his motive for killing the mother was because he had designs on asta dillon finished his tea and grinned you can put that fine special branch mind to work on that one my love but as for me im for bed and he left her there the following morning it had stopped raining for the first time in two days as the range rover drove up to loch dhu castle kim at the wheel asta and morgan came out and stood waiting she wore a glengarry bonnet leather jacket and a plaid skirt very ethnic dillon said as he got out morning ferguson boomed a good days sport with any luck im glad this damn rains stopped so am i morgan said did you have a good night brigadier certainly slept like a top its the highland air morgan turned to dillon and you im like a cat i only nap that must be useful morgan turned back to the brigadier dinner tonight seven oclock suit you excellent ferguson said black tie of course and bring that secretary of yours and ill try and persuade lady katherine to join us couldnt look forward to it more well see you this evening then and morgan ushered asta down the steps into the shogun as the sun came up and the morning advanced dillon almost forgot why he had come to this wild and lonely place as they proceeded on foot climbing up and away from the glen he and asta forged ahead leaving ferguson and kim to follow at their own pace dillon was aware of a kind of lazy content the truth was that he was enjoying the girls company hed never had much time for women the exigencies of his calling he used to say and no time for relationships but there was something elemental about this one that touched him deep inside they didnt talk much simply concentrated on climbing and finally came up over an edge of rock and stood there the glen below purple with heather and the sea in the distance calm islands scattered across it i dont think ive ever seen anything more beautiful asta said i have dillon told her the wind folded her skirt about her legs outlining her thighs and when she pulled off her glengarry and shook her head her nearwhite hair shimmered in the sun she fitted the scene perfectly a golden girl on a golden day your hair and mine are almost the same color dillon she sat down on a rock we could be related jesus girl dont wish that on me he lit two cigarettes hands cupped against the wind gave her one then lay on the ground beside her lots of fair hair in ireland a thousand years ago dublin was a viking capital i didnt know that did you tell morgan about my visit last night of course i did in fact you almost came facetoface the noise you heard in the hall was carl and what did he have to say my goodness dillon you do expect a lot for your cigarette she laughed all right i told him everything you told me the chungking covenant and so on but that was because you wanted me to didnt you thats right carl said he didnt mind he checked on ferguson the moment he discovered he was at the lodge knew who he was in a matter of hours and you he knew you must have been aware of what was going on otherwise why would you be here hes no fool dillon he would hardly be where he is today if he was that you really think a great deal of him dont you as i said last night i know all about you dillon so dont waste time telling me what a bad man carl is it would be the pot calling the kettle black dont you agree a nice turn of phrase you have i had an excellent education she said a good church of england boarding school for young ladies st michaels and st hughs college oxford afterwards is that so i bet you didnt get calluses on your knees from praying you are a bastard she said amiably and at that moment ferguson came over the rise kim following with the gun case a pair of oldfashioned zeiss binoculars around his neck there you are ferguson slumped down getting old coffee kim the ghurka put down the gun case opened the haversack that hung at his side took out a thermos flask and several paper cups which he filled and passed round this is nice asta said i havent been on a picnic in years you can forget that notion young lady ferguson told her this is a serious expedition the object of which is to expose you to the finer points of deer stalking now drink up and well get on and so tramping through the heather in the sunshine he kept up a running commentary stressing first a deers incredible sense of smell so that any successful approach could only be made downwind you can shoot i suppose he asked her of course carl trained me clay pigeon shooting mostly ive been out with him after grouse during the season many times well thats something they had been on the go for a good hour when kim suddenly pointed there sahib down everybody ferguson told them and kim passed him the binoculars excellent ferguson handed them to dillon three hundred yards two hinds and a royal stag quite magnificent antlers dillon had a look my god yes he said and passed the binoculars to asta when she focused them the stag and the hinds jumped clearly into view how marvelous she breathed and turned to ferguson we couldnt possibly shoot such wonderful creatures could we just like a bloody woman ferguson said i might have known dillon said the fun is in the stalking asta its like a game theyre well able to look after themselves believe me well be lucky to get within a hundred yards kim wet a finger and raised it downwind sahib okay now he looked up at the sky where clouds were forming i think wind change direction soon then we move fast ferguson said pass me the rifle it was an old jackson and whitney bolt action he loaded it carefully and said theyre downhill from us remember i know dillon said shoot low lets get going asta found the next hour one of the most exhilarating shed ever known they moved through gulleys crouching low kim leading the way he certainly knows his stuff she said to dillon at one point he should do ferguson told her the best tracker on a tiger shoot i ever knew in india in the old days finally they took to the heather and crawled in single file until kim called a halt and paused in a small hollow he peered over the top cautiously the deer browsed contentedly no more than seventyfive yards away no closer sahib he glanced up wind changing already right ferguson moved the bolt and rammed a round into the breech your honor my dear really asta was flushed with excitement took the rifle from him gingerly then settled herself on her elbows the stock firmly into her shoulder dont pull just squeeze gently dillon told her i know that and aim low ferguson added all right what seemed like rather a long time passed and suddenly she rolled over and thrust the rifle at him i cant do it brigadier that stag is too beautiful to die well we all bloodywell die sometime ferguson said and at that moment the stag raised its head wind change sahib he has our scent kim said and in an instant the stag and the two hinds were leaping away through the bracken at an incredible speed dillon rolled over laughing and ferguson said damn and then he scowled not funny dillon not funny at all he handed the rifle to kim all right put it away and break out the sandwiches on the way back some time later they paused for a rest on a crest that gave an excellent view of the glen below the castle above loch dhu and ardmurchan lodge on the other side dillon noticed something he hadnt appreciated before there was a landing stage below the castle a boat moored beside it give me the binoculars he said to kim and focused them closing in on a twentyfivefoot motor launch with a deckhouse i didnt know that was there he said passing the binoculars to ferguson the boat you mean asta said it goes with the castle its called the katrina have you been out in it yet dillon asked no reason carl isnt interested in fishing better than ours ferguson swung the binoculars to the rickety pier below ardmurchan lodge on the other side of the loch and the boat tied up there an old whaler with an outboard motor and a rowboat beside it he handed the binoculars to kim all right lets move on frankly im getting bored with this track asta said cant we just go straight down dillon he turned to ferguson who shrugged rather you than me but if thats what you want come on kim and he continued along the track dillon took asta by the hand here we go and watch yourself we dont want you turning that ankle again and they started down the slope it was reasonably strenuous going for most of the way the whole side of the mountain flowing down to the loch below he led the way picking his way carefully for something like a thousand feet and then as things became easier he took her hand and they scrambled on down together until suddenly she lost her balance laughing out loud and fell dragging dillon with her they rolled over a couple of times and came to rest in a soft cushion of heather in a hollow she lay on her back breathless and dillon pushed himself up on one elbow to look at her her laughter faded she reached up and touched his face and for a moment he forgot everything except the color of her hair the scent of her perfume when they kissed her body was soft and yielding everything a man could hope for in this world he rolled onto his back and she sat up i wondered when you would dillon very satisfactory he got a couple of cigarettes from his case lit them and passed one to her put it down to the altitude im sorry im not you should be ive got twenty years on you that must be some irish thing she said all that rain is it supposed to have a dampening effect on love whats love got to do with it she blew out cigarette smoke and lay back a hand behind her head now theres romantic for you he sat up stop indulging in flights of fantasy asta you arent in love with me she turned to look at him you said it yourself whats love got to do with it morgan wouldnt think very much of the idea she sat up and shrugged he doesnt control my life really id have thought thats exactly what he does do damn you dillon she was angry and stubbed her cigarette out on a rock youve just ruined a lovely day can we go now she got up and started down the hill and after a while he stood himself and followed her they reached the edge of the loch about thirty minutes later and started to follow the shoreline they hadnt spoken since the incident in the hollow and now dillon said are we speaking again or what she laughed and took his arm youre a pig dillon but i like you all part of my irresistible charm he said and paused suddenly they were close to the west end of the loch the old hunting bothy where morgan and marco had dealt with fergus on their left he was still lying down on the shoreline face in the shallows asta said my god isnt that a body thats what it looks like they hurried down the slope and reached the sandbar she stood there while dillon waded in and turned fergus over asta gave a sudden exclamation fergus yes dillon waded back id say he was given a thorough beating wait here he went up to the hunting bothy she watched him go in a moment later he returned from the state of things thats where the fight was after theyd gone he must have come down to the shore to revive himself and fell in something like that an accident she said and there was a strange calmness on her face that was it you could describe it that way dillon said im sure carl morgan would leave it dillon she reached out and grabbed his lapel do this for me just leave it ill handle it there was a fierceness to her that was something new he said im beginning to wonder if i really know you at all asta all right ill leave morgan to stew in it she nodded thank you ill get back now she walked away paused and turned ill see you tonight he nodded i wouldnt miss it for anything she hurried away he looked out again at the body by the sandbar then climbed up the slope and reached the road he had walked along it for perhaps five minutes when a horn sounded and he turned and found the range rover bearing down on him ferguson opened the door wheres the girl shes cut across to the castle on her own dillon climbed in and kim drove on i must say you look thoughtful dear boy so would you dillon said lit a cigarette and brought him up to date morgan was in the study when she went in sitting at his desk and talking to marco he turned and smiled had a nice day it was until things went sour he stopped smiling and said to marco you can go no let him stay you found fergus didnt you you beat him up morgan reached for a cigar and clipped it he had it coming asta anyway how do you know dillon and i just found his body he was lying in the shallows down there in the loch just below that old hunting lodge he must have fallen in and drowned morgan glanced at marco then put the cigar down what did dillon do nothing i begged him to leave it to me and he agreed she nodded he said hed leave you to stew in it yes thats exactly how he would play it morgan nodded and so would ferguson it wouldnt suit the dear old brigadier to have a police investigation not at the moment he glanced at marco and it wouldnt get anywhere without a body would it no signore morgan stood up all right lets take care of it you stay here asta and he went out followed by marco in the trees that fringed the loch below ardmurchan lodge just above the small jetty ferguson and dillon waited the irishman holding the zeiss binoculars the light was fading but visibility was still good enough for him to see the motor launch katrina moving along the shoreline on the other side there they go he said and focused the binoculars morgan was in the wheelhouse and he reversed the launch toward the shore marco in the stern marco jumped over into the water and morgan went to help him a moment later fergus came over the rail morgan went back into the wheelhouse and turned out toward the middle of the loch dillon passed the binoculars to ferguson the brigadier said it looks to me as if marco is wrapping a length of chain around the body he shook his head how very naughty he passed the binoculars back to dillon who focused them again in time to see marco slide the body over the side it went straight under and a moment later the katrina got under way and turned back toward the castle so thats it dillon said and turned to ferguson youre happy to leave it that way i think so a crime has undoubtedly been committed but thats a police matter and frankly i dont want the local constabulary swarming all over loch dhu castle weve bigger fish to fry here dillon i doubt whether the good chief inspector bernstein would agree dillon said a great one for the letter of the law that lady which is why we dont say a word about this to her dillon lit another cigarette one thing we can count on he wont be missed ould fergus not for a few days the munros will think hes just keeping out of the way which will be what morgan is counting on i would imagine hes hoping to be out of here quite quickly ferguson stood up lets get moving weve got dinner to look forward to it should prove an interesting evening ten they arrived at the castle only a few minutes after seven dillon at the wheel of the old estate car that went with ardmurchan lodge he and ferguson were in dinner jackets and hannah bernstein wore a cream trouser suit in silk crepe the door was opened by marco wearing his alpaca jacket and striped trousers and he ushered them in his face expressionless to where morgan stood by the fire in the hall asta in a green silk dress on the sofa beside lady katherine rose ah there you are morgan said genially come in i think youve met brigadier ferguson lady katherine indeed yes he called and took tea with me he and this charming young gel hannah looked amused and ferguson took her hand lovely to see you again i dont think youve met my nephew sean dillon mr dillon dillon took the cool dry hand liking her immediately a great pleasure irish she said i like the irish charming rogues the lot of them but nice do you smoke young man my one vice what a liar you are give me one will you lady katherine im so sorry morgan picked up a silver cigarette box and came forward id no idea she took one and accepted a light from dillon ive been smoking all my life mr morgan no point in stopping now marco appeared with a bottle of crystal in a bucket and six glasses on a tray he placed it on a side table and said in heavily accented english shall i open the champagne sir not for me lady katherine said it doesnt go down well these days a vodka martini very dry would be just the ticket thats what got me through the war that and cigarettes ill get it asta said and went to the drinks cabinet as marco uncorked the champagne bottle you served in the war then lady katherine ferguson asked her by god i did all this nonsense about young gels being allowed to fly in the raf these days she snorted all old hat i was a pilot from nineteenforty with the old air transport auxiliary they used to call us the attagirls asta brought the martini and sat beside her fascinated but what did you do the old lady sampled the drink excellent my dear we ferried warplanes between factories and raf stations to free pilots for combat i flew everything we all did spitfires and hurricanes and once a lancaster bomber the ground crew at the raf station i delivered it to couldnt believe it when i took off my flying helmet and they saw my hair but all in all it must have been extremely dangerous hannah said i crashlanded once in a hurricane wheels up not my fault engine failure another time an old gloucester gladiator they were biplanes started to fall apart on me in midair so i had to bail out good god morgan said thats amazing oh it was hard going she said out of the women in my unit sixteen were killed but then we had to win the war didnt we brigadier we certainly did lady katherine she held up her empty glass another one somebody and then ill love you and leave you asta went to get it and morgan said lady katherine doesnt feel up to dinner im afraid only eat enough for a sparrow these days she accepted the drink asta brought and looked up at morgan well have you found the bible yet he was momentarily thrown the bible oh come on mr morgan i know youve had the servants turning the place upside down why is it so important he was in command again now a legend lady katherine of great importance to your family i just thought it would be nice to find it and give it to you indeed she turned to hannah and there was something in her eyes amazing the interest in the bible all of a sudden and i cant help havent seen it in years i still think it was lost in the air crash that injured my brother so badly morgan glanced at ferguson who was smiling and made a determined effort to change the subject tell me just how old is the castle lady katherine asta got up and moved to the french windows at the end of the hall and opened them and dillon went to join her moving out onto the terrace as she did the murmur of voices behind them the beech trees above the loch were cut out of black cardboard against a sky that was streaked with vivid orange above the mountains she took his arm and they strolled across the lawn dillon lighting a cigarette do you want one no ill share yours which she did handing it back to him after a moment its peaceful here and old the roots go deep everyone needs roots dont you agree dillon maybe its people not places he said take you for instance perhaps your roots are morgan its a thought but you dillon what about you where are your roots maybe nowhere love nowhere at all oh theres the odd aunt or uncle and a few cousins here and there in ulster but no one whod dare come near the price of fame infamy more like i know im the original bad guy thats why ferguson recruited me you know i like you dillon i feel as if ive known you a long time but what am i going to do with you take your time girl dear im sure something will occur to you morgan appeared on the terrace and called asta are you there here we are carl they walked back and went up the steps to the terrace what is it lady katherines ready to leave what a pity i wish she would stay shes wonderful one of a kind morgan said but there it is ill run her down to the lodge no you wont asta told him ill see to it youve got guests carl we mustnt forget our manners shall i come with you dillon asked its only three hundred yards down the drive for heavens sake she said ill be back in no time they went inside and lady katherine said there you are thought wed lost you she pushed herself up on her stick and asta put an arm around her no chance im taking you home now what a lovely girl lady katherine turned to them all such a delight do come and see me any time good night all morgan had a hand on her elbow and he and asta took her out of the front door a moment later the castles station wagon engine started up and morgan returned he snapped his fingers at marco more champagne marco replenished the glasses and ferguson looked around the great hall the weapons on the wall the trophies the armour quite an amazing collection all this fascinating i agree hannah said if youre into death that is arent you being a little harsh morgan said she sipped some of her champagne if it was a museum exhibition theyd probably call it in praise of war i mean look at those great swords crossed under the shields their only purpose was to slice somebodys arm off youre wrong dillon said amiably the backstroke was intended to remove heads those swords are highland claymores and the shield was called a targ thats where the word target comes from actually the particular one youre looking at up there was carried at the battle of culloden by the campbell of the day morgan said he died fighting for bonnie prince charlie well i dont consider that much of an ambition havent you any sense of history ferguson demanded i cant afford one im jewish remember brigadier my people have always had enough on to simply survive in the present there was a silence and dillon said well thats a showstopper if ever ive heard one as he spoke the door opened and asta came in thats done ive left her in the hands of the redoubtable jeannie can we eat now im starving only waiting for you my love morgan said and he gave her his arm and led the way in the dining room was quite splendid the walls lined with oak paneling the table decorated with the finest crystal and silver candles in great silver sticks flaring marco served the meal aided by two young housemaids in black dresses and white aprons weve kept the meal relatively simple as i wasnt sure what everyone would like morgan said his idea of simplicity was extraordinary beluga caviar and smoked salmon followed by roast pheasant with the usual trimmings all washed down with vintage chateau palmer absolutely wonderful ferguson said as he tucked into his pheasant you must have an extraordinary cook here oh shes all right for the simple things but its marco who roasted the pheasant a man of many talents ferguson glanced up as marco face imperturbable refilled the glasses yes you could say that morgan agreed marco disappeared shortly afterwards dillon noticed that as the two maids cleared the plates asta said and what delight do you have for the climax hard act to follow with a simple pudding ferguson observed nothing simple about this brigadier something marco specializes in morgan told him marco entered the room at that moment with a large silver chafing dish the maids behind him he removed the lid and a most delicious smell became apparent cannolo asta said in delight yes the most famous sweet in sicily and so simple morgan said a tube of flour and egg filled with cream ferguson tried a spoonful and shook his head nothing simple about this the mans a genius where on earth did he learn to do such cooking his father had a small restaurant in palermo as a boy he was raised to it amongst other things dillon said yes my friend morgan told him calmly i suspect you and marco would have a great deal in common now then dillon lets concentrate on the meal ferguson said theres a good chap which they did returning to sit round the great fireplace in the hall for the coffee which was yemeni mocha the finest in the world ferguson accepted a cigar well i must tell you this morgan that was the best simple meal ive ever had in my life we aim to please a most pleasant evening the brigadier replied dillon felt like laughing out loud at the insanity of it the pretense of this amazing game they were all playing the urbanity of the brigadiers exchanges with a man who only a few hours earlier he had seen dispose of fergus munros body well now he said if were going to play patty fingers here ill use mine on the piano if you dont mind be my guest morgan told him dillon moved to the grand piano and raised the lid it was very old a schiedmayer but the tone wasnt too bad when he tried a few chords he lit a cigarette and sat there with it drooping from the corner of his mouth and started to work his way through a few standards hannah came and leaned on the piano sipping her coffee you consistently surprise me dillon the secret of my fatal charm any requests asta was watching a slight frown on her face and hannah murmured now thats interesting i do believe shes jealous what have you been up to dillon you should be ashamed you and your bad thoughts dillon told her behind them morgan said asta tells me you had an excellent day with the deer yes ferguson said only when we got close enough to a king stag to see the damned eyes and i lined her up with my gun she wouldnt pull the trigger she said she couldnt kill such a magnificent creature hannah turned good for you she said to asta well it was magnificent asta said still a damn silly attitude ferguson told her no i think the chief inspector has a point morgan told him the deer cant fight back at least in the ring the bull has a chance of sticking his horn in there was silence and dillon said sure and you put your foot in it there old son dear me so i did morgan smiled at hannah so sorry chief inspector i wasnt supposed to know was i oh i wouldnt say that ferguson told him all out in the open so we all know where we are dillon said and on that note well say goodnight ferguson stood up whatever else youre an excellent host morgan you must allow me to do the same for you sometime ill look forward to it marco opened the door and they moved out onto the steps the sky was dotted with clouds and yet undulated with strange shimmering lights whats that hannah demanded the aurora borealis dillon told her the northern lights its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen asta said what a night for a drive can we carl asta be reasonable its late oh youre no fun you she turned to ferguson can i come with you brigadier you could have that wonderful ghurka of yours bring me back of course my dear if youd like that its settled then she ran indoors dillon said to morgan dont worry ill bring her back myself now that i am worried about morgan said and asta reappeared wearing a blue mink coat im ready when you are she kissed morgan on the cheek i wont be long then she got in the rear of the estate car with hannah dillon got behind the wheel ferguson joined him in front and they drove away the drive along the side of the loch was pleasantly eerie the northern lights reflected in the dark water so that they seemed to sparkle with a kind of strange silver fire wonderful asta said im so glad i came dillon changed down to climb the hill up through the trees as they rounded the eastern end of the loch the old estate car responded well they went over the crest and started down it was very steep with a bend or two below as their speed increased dillon put his foot on the brake pedal there was no response and the pedal went right down to the floor damn he said what is it ferguson demanded the brakes have failed good god man how they worked perfectly well on the way here since when weve been parked outside loch dhu castle dillon told him and desperately tried to change down they were going very fast indeed now there was a grinding of gears as he wrestled with the stick and then he did manage to force it into third as they came to the first bend hang on ferguson called as dillon worked the wheel and just managed to scrape round for gods sake stop it dillon asta cried not that he had any choice and the estate car hurtled down the straight another considerable bend waiting for them again he worked the wheel hard trying the old racing drivers technique of driving into the bend and almost made it and then they scraped against a granite wall on the left and bounced away and it was that which saved them for dillon got control again as they went down another slope into a hollow and started up a gentle incline gradually the speed slowed he changed down to bottom gear and applied the handbrake there was silence and ferguson said now that could have been very nasty indeed lets take a look dillon said he found a torch in the dashboard locker and went and raised the estate cars bonnet ferguson at his side a moment later hannah and asta joined them dillon peered into the engine and nodded there you are what is it hannah asked see that kind of canister there it holds brake fluid only it doesnt any longer the valves been ripped off at the top probably with a screwdriver no fluid no brakes its a hydraulic system we could have been killed hannah said all of us but why i think asta knows why dillon said asta pulled the collar of her mink around her throat and shivered but why would carl do that more important why would he do it to you my dear ferguson asked her after all he made no attempt to stop you coming with us and to that she had no reply he turned to dillon will it still work oh yes its a straight road to the lodge on the other side of this hill and ill stay in bottom gear good lets get moving then and ferguson ushered the two women back into the estate car i think you could probably do with this ferguson said to asta who was sitting by the fire in the sitting room at the lodge still hugging her mink around her it was brandy he was holding out and she took the large crystal tumbler in both hands staring into it then swallowed the brandy down she sat there still holding the glass and dillon took it from her gently and turned to ferguson shes a little in shock he said she stood up then took off her mink and tossed it over a chair shock be damned im angry dillon bloody angry at that moment hannah came in from the kitchen with kim who started pouring coffee the chief inspector took a cup to asta just sit down asta and take it easy asta took the cup of coffee and did as she was told the rest of you would make some kind of sense but why me i dont understand i think you will if you pause and think about it asta dillon said his connection with mafia and all that stuff you mean i know too much but i always have yes but something more important than that has cropped up you know that hannah bernstein looked puzzled and ferguson said you signed the official secrets act when you joined me which means anything which takes place during your duties with me is sacrosanct am i correct of course sir dillon he said i found fergus munros body earlier today in the shallows by loch dhu asta was with me by my observation hed been given a severe beating id say hed collapsed in the water afterwards and drowned my god hannah said dillon turned to asta who said i asked dillon to let it go why hannah said because in a way it was my fault it was because of me carl wanted to teach him a lesson i see hannah turned to ferguson on the face of it youve condoned a criminal offense sir manslaughter at the very least absolutely right chief inspector if you want the sordid details dillon and i observed morgan and the man marco recover the body in the motor launch katrina they then disposed of it wrapped in a length of chain in the middle of the loch she said youve stood by and let him get away with it youve got it wrong girl dear dillon said retribution can come later exactly ferguson told her more important things to consider he took her hand sat on the couch and pulled her down beside him i chose you to assist me in my work because youre one of the most astute brains at scotland yard now its flattery brigadier nonsense look at your background your grandfather is a highly respected rabbi your father a brilliant professor of medicine you have a cambridge ma in psychology you could have been anything you chose to be a policewoman on the beat in brixton and have risen because of your own abilities i need you and i want you but this isnt normal police work this is a rather complicated game our kind of work we only have the end in view because the end justifies the means it was dillon who leaned down took her hands and pulled her up god save us girl but hes right sometimes it does its called the greater good he actually put an arm round her and she leaned against him then she straightened and managed a faint smile they must have loved you at the national theatre dillon youd have ended up with a knighthood instead you chose the ira she turned to ferguson no problem sir anything i can do he inclined his head toward asta and hannah sat beside her and took her hand when you told morgan you wanted to come with us he didnt say no am i right i suppose so asta said lets be logical he was after us hadnt counted on you being involved but when the chance came when you said what you did he didnt say no asta sat there staring at her mutely she moistened her lips why he loves me his account with you was full asta oh you knew all about the mafia background and so on and what you dont realize is that was always a liability but fergus hannah bernstein shook her head even if he drowned because of the beating the charge would be manslaughter that would get carl morgan seven years at the old bailey and mafia lawyers dont enjoy the same kind of success in court in england as they do in america seven years asta seven years for a billionaire polo player used to the good things of life there was no way he could take that chance you knew too much asta jumped up and paced across the room and turned hes always been so good to me i cant believe this ferguson turned to dillon would you say its time i think so ferguson said to hannah the greek file chief inspector hannah went to the desk and he carried on you take over dillon dillon took astas hand and brought her back to the sofa by the fire and sat down with her what weve got to show you now is bad asta as bad as anything could be its to do with hydra and your mothers accident scuba diving she frowned i dont understand you will my dear ferguson took the file from hannah bernstein and passed it to her read that asta put the file to one side and sat there her hands clenched it doesnt seem possible youve seen the file ferguson told her the technical details are beyond dispute someone interfered with your mothers equipment an accident she said desperately no accident dillon sat down beside her and took her hand im an expert diver asta believe me what was done to your mothers gear was deliberate now you tell me who was responsible can you think of anyone who wished your mother harm he shook his head only carl asta we think she knew too much and thats the truth of it she closed her eyes and took a deep breath and when she opened them again she was remarkably in control i cant let him get away with thatnot that what can i do you could help us ferguson said keep us informed of the situation up there at the castle most important thing of all you could let us know the moment he finds the bible she nodded right ill do it she took another deep breath could i have another brandy of course my dear ferguson nodded to dillon who got up and went to the drinks cabinet he returned with the brandy and asta took it from him hannah sat beside her look asta are you sure you can go through with this i mean youve got to go back and smile in his face and act as if nothings changed asta said we buried my mother back home in sweden flew her body there from athens and do you know something he stood at the side of my mothers grave and he cried she emptied the brandy glass with a single swallow ill see him pay for that if its the last thing i do she placed the brandy glass on the coffee table and got up i think i should go back now ill take you dillon said she walked toward the door picking up her mink and pulling it on she turned all right so far the search for the bible isnt getting very far in spite of the fact that carl has offered a substantial reward for anyone who finds it thank you for that ferguson said as regards future moves were supposed to put in an appearance at the ardmurchan fair and games tomorrow i dont think theres anything else dillon said ill take you now asta she turned at the door ive just remembered angus the gardener hes on carls payroll now well bear that in mind ferguson said she went out and dillon followed her on the way back to the castle in the range rover she sat beside him clutching the collar of her mink coat around her neck saying nothing are you all right he asked as they neared the gates oh yes she nodded dont worry about me dillon ill play my part they drove along the drive and he braked to a halt at the steps before they could get out the front door opened and morgan appeared i was beginning to get worried he said as dillon went round and opened the door for asta sorry carl she said as she went up the steps but we nearly had a nasty accident he was immediately all concern what happened the brakes failed on the estate car dillon said some sort of rupture in the canister so we lost the hydraulic fluid its been around a few years that car dillon was wonderful she said drove like nigel mansell going down the hill i really thought wed had it my god he gave her a squeeze how can i thank you dillon selfpreservation dillon told him i always struggle to survive mr morgan asta said ill go in carl i think ill go to bed she went inside and morgan turned as dillon got in the range rover thanks again will you be at the fair tomorrow i should imagine so good well see you then he went in and closed the door and ill see you you bastard dillon said as he drove away eleven the following day was a local holiday ardmurchan village awash with people from the surrounding district and others who had driven many miles to see the fair and take part in the games and there were the tinkers and the gypsies with their ponies and horses to trade ferguson dillon and hannah arrived just before lunch parked the range rover at the church and walked down to the campbell arms a little bracer i think then all the fun of the fair ferguson said ten minutes short of noon brigadier hannah reminded him that counts as morning drinking if the booze was going to get me chief inspector it would have done so long ago the korean war to be exact as a twentyyearold subaltern i sat in a trench in the snow twenty degrees below with the chinese attacking ten thousand at a time only the rum kept me going he pushed open the door and led the way in the saloon bar was packed nowhere to sit but he shouldered his way through cheerfully to the bar where molly worked feverishly with four local women to aid her guinness ferguson called three he turned to hannah extremely nourishing molly served them herself were you hoping to eat brigadier its an idea he said nothing fancy today just hot cornish pasties a unique thought as were in scotland but why not well have one each right theres someone moving from the settle by the fire right now you sit yourselves down and ill bring them she was right three men getting up at that moment and moving off and ferguson pushed through the crowd to secure the places he sat down and rubbed his hands nothing like a day out in the country shouldnt we have more important things to do sir hannah asked nonsense chief inspector everyone needs a break now and then molly brought the guinness and the three pasties which were enormous if that isnt enough for you theres the refreshment tent she said as ferguson paid her up at the fair well bear it in mind my dear ferguson sampled his drink and then tried the pasty my goodness this is good hannah said all right sir but what happens now what would you like to happen dillon asked her i dont know in fact all i do know is that morgan took care of fergus rather permanently and then tried to kill the lot of us last night id say that amounts to open warfare yes but now weve got asta on our side ferguson told her and at that moment asta came in followed by morgan and marco she saw them at once and came straight over she was wearing the bonnet she had worn when deer stalking and the plaid skirt and there wasnt a man in the room who didnt look her way she smiled there you are dillon stood up to let her sit youre looking particularly fragrant this morning well thats how i feel fighting fit dillon it seems to me thats the way i need to be behind her morgan spoke to marco who went to the bar and morgan crossed to join them how are you asta was describing what happened last night thats terrible exciting to say the least ferguson told him but the boy here kept his head and drove like stirling moss in his prime he smiled a long time ago but still the only british racing driver worth his salt as far as im concerned marco brought two lagers gave one to morgan and the other to asta and retired to the door asta said all the fun of the fair im looking forward to it the door opened again and hector munro entered with rory on seeing them by the fire he paused and put a finger to his forehead ladies he said courteously and started to the bar no sign of that son of yours i suppose morgan said ah well fergus is away to see relatives mr morgan hector told him i doubt hell be back for a while he moved off to the bar and ferguson finished his drink right lets get moving he stood up see you later morgan and he led the way out there was a refreshment tent two or three roundabouts for children and a primitive boxing ring which for the moment was empty the main event taking place when they arrived was the horse sale and they stood on the edge of the crowd and watched the gypsy boys running up and down clutching the horses bridles as they showed their paces dillon noticed hector munro and rory at one point inspecting a couple of ponies he strolled over lighting a cigarette and said in irish dog meat only those two do i need telling hector replied in gaelic rory grinned expert are you i spent enough time on my uncles farm in county down as a boy to know rubbish when i see it dillon smiled amiably and returned to the others games just starting ferguson said come on there were fiftyyard dashes and sack races for the younger children but the adult sports were more interesting large men tossed the caber an object resembling a telegraph pole there was hammer throwing and the long jump even scottish reels danced to the skirl of the bagpipes morgan and asta marco behind them appeared on the other side of the crowd she saw dillon and waved he waved back and then turned to watch as the wrestling began brawny men in kilts with thighs like tree trunks grappled with the power and striking force of sumo wrestlers the crowd urging them on rather jolly all this ferguson produced a hip flask he unscrewed the top and took a swallow just like samson didnt he smite the philistines hip and thigh chief inspector i believe he did sir but frankly it isnt my cup of tea no i dont suppose it would be and then the crowd moved away toward the boxing ring carrying them with it dillon said now this looks more like it what is it hannah demanded old style prize fighting id say lets see what happens a middleaged man in boxing boots and shorts slipped under the ropes into the ring he had the flattened nose of the professional fighter scar tissue around his eyes on the back of his old nylon robe was the legend tiger grant by god hes seen a few fights ferguson said a hard one dillon nodded in agreement at that moment asta joined them marco forcing a way through for her and morgan the sicilian looked up at tiger grant his expression enigmatic dillon said from the look of his face marco here has done a bit himself light heavyweight champion of sicily in his day morgan said twentytwo fights how many did he win all of them three decisions on points twelve knockouts seven where the referee stopped the fight is that a fact dillon said i must remember to avoid him on a dark night marco turned to look at him something in his eyes but at that moment a small man in tweed suit and cap climbed through the ropes clutching a pair of boxing gloves and turned waving for silence now there must be a few sporting gentlemen here so ill give you a chance of some real money he took a wad of bank notes from his inside pocket fifty pounds my friends to any man who can last three rounds with tiger grant fifty pounds he didnt have to wait long dillon saw two burly young men on the other side of the ring talking to the munros one took off his jacket and gave it to rory and slipped between the ropes im on he said and the crowd cheered the small man helped him into the boxing gloves while tiger grant tossed his robe to someone acting as his second in the corner the small man got out of the ring took a stopwatch from one pocket and a handbell from the other each round three minutes let battle commence the young man moved in on grant aggressively the crowd cheering and asta clutching dillons arm this is exciting butchery would be a better description hannah bernstein observed and she was right for grant easily evading the wild punches moved in fast and gave his opponent a short and powerful punch in the stomach that put him down writhing in agony the crowd roared as the second and the small man helped the unfortunate youth from the ring the small man returned any more takers but already the other one who had been standing with the munros was climbing into the ring ill have you that was my brother grant remained imperturbable and when the bell went and the youth rushed him stepped from sidetoside blocking wild punches eventually putting him down as he had the brother the crowd groaned and hannah said this is terrible it could be worse dillon said grant could have made mincemeat of those two and didnt hes all right he was suddenly aware of morgan saying something to marco he couldnt hear what it was because of the noise of the crowd but the sicilian stripped off his jacket and was under the ropes and into the ring beating rory munro by a second another sportsman the small man called although his smile slipped a little as he tied marcos boxing gloves on oh dear hes not so sure now ferguson observed care to have a side bet brigadier morgan asked lets say a hundred pounds youll lose your money dillon said to ferguson i dont need you to tell me that dear boy sorry morgan the bell jangled marco stood arms at his side and for some reason the crowd went silent grant crouched feinted then moved in fast marco swayed with amazing speed to one side pivoted and punched him in the ribs twice the sound echoing over the crowd grants head went up in agony and marco punched him on the jaw the blow traveling hardly any distance at all grant went down like a sack of coal and lay there and there was a gasp of astonishment from the crowd the small man was on one knee trying to revive him helped by the second and marco paced about like a nervous animal my money wheres my money he demanded and pulled off his right glove and lifted the small man up he in his turn looked terrified took the notes from his pocket and passed them over marco moved round each side of the ring waving the money over his head anyone else he called there were boos and catcalls as the small man and the second got grant out of the ring and then a voice called im for you you bastard and rory munro climbed into the ring marco kicked the spare gloves over to him and dillon said a good lad in a pub brawl but this could be the death of him rory went in hard and actually took marcos first punch slipping one in himself that landed high on the sicilians right cheek marco feinted then punched him again in the side but again rory rode the punch and hit him again on the right cheek splitting the skin marco stepped back touched his glove to his cheek and saw the blood there was rage in his eyes now as he came on head down and punched rory in the ribs once twice and then a third time hell break bones before hes through dillon said ferguson nodded and that young fool wont lie down rory swayed obviously in real pain and marco punched him in the face several times holding his head with one gloved hand the crowd roared their disapproval at such illegality and marco contemptuous of them stepped back and measured rory for a final punch as he stood there swaying and defenseless oh god no hannah cried dillon slipped through the ropes stepped between marco and rory and held his hand out palm first to the sicilian hes had enough he turned took rorys weight and helped him to his corner taking off his gloves and easing him down through the ropes to his father and willing hands if i was thirty years younger id do for that bastard myself munro said in gaelic well youre not dillon turned and found marco standing looking at him gloved hands on hips you fancy some too you irish dog he said in italian that could be arranged dillon replied in the same language then get your gloves on who needs them dillon kicked them out of the ring with gloves i cant hurt you it was deliberate baiting and marco fell for it delighted to oblige no dillon no asta called hell kill you in motion be like water thats what yuan tao had taught him total calm complete control this was no longer a boxing match and marco had made a bad error the sicilian came in fast and swung a punch dillon swayed to one side stamping at the left kneecap pivoted and struck marco in the side screwing the punch as yuan tao had shown him marco cried out in agony and dillon struck him again in the same manner and then turned his back delivering a reverse elbow strike smashing marcos mouth the crowd roared and dillon walked away and marco with amazing resilience went after him like a wild man and as dillon turned punched him under the left cheek dillon was flung back by the assault bounced off the ropes and fell over and marco kicked him in the ribs the crowd was going wild now and dillon rolled away rapidly and got to his feet jesus son this is getting to be a bore he said and as marco swung another punch he grabbed the sicilians right wrist swung it round until the elbow locked and ran him headfirst through the ropes and out of the ring to fall on his face in front of ferguson morgan and the two women as marco rolled onto his back dillon vaulted the ropes and put a foot on his neck you lie still now like a good dog or ill break it morgan said in italian leave it marco i order you he held out the mans jacket and turned to dillon you are a remarkable man my friend a hero asta clutched his arm no hes not hes a bloody fool ferguson said now lets go to the refreshment tent dillon i really think weve earned a drink after that little lot and he turned and led the way through the crowd of wellwishers all eager to pat dillon on the back it was reasonably quiet in the marquee most people preferring to take advantage of the good weather ferguson went to the bar which was laid out on a large trestle table dillon and hannah sat at another of the tables and she took out her handkerchief and soaked it in the jug of water on the table dillon its split i think youre going to need stitches well see i cant feel a thing at the moment well hold that handkerchief to it for a while better to let it dry up he lit a cigarette and youre slowly killing yourself with those things a fascist thats what you are itll be booze youre banning next then sex he grinned nothing left i always thought you had a death wish she told him but she was smiling ferguson came back with drinks on a tray scotch for us gin and tonic for you chief inspector id rather have tea sir and it wouldnt do dillon any harm either and she got up and went to the refreshment bar i knew it ferguson said when that girl marries shell be one of those jewish mothers you read about the kind who rules her husband with a rod of iron and tells everybody what to do jesus brigadier but you must be getting old ive news for you theres many a man would happily join the queue to be ruled with a rod of iron by hannah bernstein at that moment asta appeared in the entrance looked around saw them and came over there you are she sat down and dillon said wheres morgan taking marco down to the local hospital at arisaig he thinks you may have broken a rib i said id make my own way back to the castle what perfectly splendid news ferguson said hannah joined them with a tray piled with cups and two teapots i saw you coming she told asta help yourself asta laid the cups and saucers out on the table as hannah poured wasnt dillon wonderful i suppose it depends on your point of view oh come now chief inspector that wretched man had it coming deserved every minute of it hector munro came in and went to the bar as they watched he purchased half a bottle of whiskey and turned to leave he saw them sitting there hesitated and came over ladies he said politely and then to dillon in gaelic youll be expecting my thanks im thinking not really dillon said in irish how is he the hard head that one but that bastard hurt him he grinned suddenly mind you youre a bit of a bastard yourself mr dillon he walked away and asta said was that gaelic thats right and i used irish theyre very similar was he thanking you for saving his son hannah asked dillon smiled he never thanked anyone in his life that one someone called there you are and as they turned lady katherine came through the crowd leaning on her stick jeannie holding her other arm my dear lady ferguson got up im amazed to see you and in all this crowd of people jeannie helped her into a seat and lady katherine said i have to put in an appearance they expect it you know she turned to dillon i saw you from a distance over the heads of the crowd rather a nasty business and hardly sporting my goodness he made a mess of your face true maam but he looks worse dillon said she smiled and turned to ferguson i really must go cant afford to overdo it but ive been thinking thinking lady katherine yes the bible ive had a thought why dont you drop in on your way home ill discuss it with you she pushed herself up come on jeannie lets make a move goodbye all she moved away through the crowd leaning on jeannies arm and hannah said now theres a turnup for the book it certainly is ferguson said frankly i cant wait to hear what shes got to say what do you think dillon dillon lit a cigarette frowning whatever it is its going to be special i dont think shes going to say look at the back of the third drawer down in the writing desk in the study or anything like that he nodded slowly no something we havent even thought of and neither has carl asta turned to ferguson can i come too brigadier id love to see you steal a march on him ferguson smiled of course my dear why not after all you are on our side now dillon drove the range rover on the way to loch dhu castle before leaving the fair hed visited the firstaid tent and now sticking plaster adorned his right cheek although the lady on duty from the st johns ambulance brigade had advised him to seek proper medical attention are you all right my boy ferguson asked as they got out in front of the gate lodge im fine just forget it dillon grinned its all in the mind ferguson knocked on the door and jeannie opened it after a few moments her ladyship is in the drawing room ferguson led the way in lady katherine sat in a chair by the fire a rug over her knees ah there you are come in sit down tea and biscuits jeannie and open the french windows its far too close in here certainly your ladyship jeannie did as she was told everyone settled down dillon leaned on the piano and lit a cigarette this is nice he said you can give me one of those cancer sticks young man and pass around that photo in the silver frame on the end of the piano certainly maam he did as he was told lit the cigarette and went and got the photo it showed a young woman in an raf flying jacket and helmet of second world war vintage standing beside a spitfire it was quite obviously lady katherine you look like some film star in one of those old war films he said and passed it to ferguson the brigadier smiled amazing lady katherine truly amazing and he handed it to hannah and asta who were sitting together on the couch yes those were the days they gave me the mbe you know telling you about it at dinner last night brought it all back i started thinking about it all in the early hours today couldnt sleep you see so many amazing incidents all those brave women who died and i suddenly recalled a rather strange affair a wonderful flier called betty keithjopp was piloting a barracuda over scotland when she ran into bad weather landed in the firth of forth and sank forty feet she got out and made the surface all right was picked up by a fishing boat amazing ferguson said but what has that to do with the bible she said patiently because thinking of that reminded me of the lysander that crashed into loch dhu while trying to land at ardmurchan raf base you see ive remembered now that was the plane carrying my brothers belongings it was nineteen fortysix march as i recall i should tell you that besides the injury to his brain in that terrible crash in india my brother sustained some quite severe burns to his right arm and hand so when he was thought fit enough he was transferred to a place called east grinstead now that i do know about ferguson said it was the unit pioneered by archibald mcindoe he specialized in plastic surgery for aircrew whod suffered severe burns a wonderful man she said his patients werent always raf my brother for instance what happened dillon asked her ian suffered a serious relapse that needed further brain surgery jack tanner was with him still acting as his batman anyway they gave up on him expecting him to die at any time so ferguson said at that time he had a visitor an raf officer whod been a fellow patient for some months but was now returned to duty a wing commander smithkeith smith i believe he rose to some very senior rank later it turned out that he had been given command of the raf station on the island of stornaway in the outer hebrides and was due to fly up there in a lysander piloting himself a lysander asta asked what kind of plane was that it was a high wingbraced monoplane a wheelsdown job flew them myself many times room for a pilot and a couple of passengers they could take off or land on quite a small field ferguson managed to restrain his impatience i see but where does wing commander smith fit in well if he was flying to stornaway his course would take him right over here you see and ardmurchan raf base was still operational as it seemed as if my brother was about to die he told jack tanner that if he gathered all ians belongings together hed take them with him land at ardmurchan and drop them off he would then refuel and fly on to stornaway my god hannah bernstein sighed i see it all now lady katherine carried on i was at home at the time on leave the weather was very bad a thunderstorm and low cloud i didnt see it happen i mean it was all so quick he lost his engine on the final approach across the loch and ditched it went down like a stone but he just managed to get out with his dinghy there was silence and it was asta who spoke it makes sense now when tanner was talking to tony jackson at our lady of mercy hospital he told jackson that he sent all the lairds belongings home because he thought he was going to die and jackson asked him if the bible had gone back to loch dhu dillon put in and tanner said you could say that and then according to jackson he started to laugh hannah nodded slowly i always did wonder about that well all is certainly revealed now ferguson turned to lady katherine no attempt at recovery they didnt have the equipment keith smith came to see me of course lovely man strange thing about him he hadnt been in fighters or bombers he joked about being a transport pilot but he had a dso and two dfcs i often wondered about that no as i say they left the lysander down there checked out its position and so forth or so he told me she smiled so there you go poor old ians bible is down there at the bottom of the loch in one of his suitcases if theres anything left of course now lets have some more tea weve taken up enough of your time dear lady ferguson told her nonsense i insist she rang the bell for jeannie ferguson nodded to dillon and walked to the french windows and dillon followed him as they moved out onto the terrace ferguson said weve got to move fast now ill call in the lear and i want you and the chief inspector to get down to london and check this out with raf records dillon put a hand on his arm frowning and ferguson turned to find angus close to the wall ivy on the ground at his feet pruning shears in his hand why angus its you ferguson said have you been there long just doing some pruning sir im finished now he hurriedly bundled the clippings up dumped them in his barrow and wheeled it away hannah appeared in the open window asta at her shoulder do you think we were overheard hannah asked of course we were dillon told her thats what the bastard was doing there hell go straight to morgan undoubtedly ferguson turned to asta when you see morgan you must cover yourself by telling him everything it will strengthen your position do you understand yes she nodded good he looked at his watch three oclock if i contact the office now theyll have the standby lear take off at once priority with air traffic control so no delays he shrugged should be here by five at the latest immediate turnaround and back to london and then dillon said check raf records and try to establish details of the lysanders position and procure the right equipment for a search he smiled it looks as if youre going diving again dillon so it would seem dillon said ferguson turned and went inside and they heard him say i was wondering dear lady if i might use your telephone twelve it was a good two hours later that asta saw the shogun draw up in front of the house and morgan and marco got out one side of the sicilians face was covered by a dressing and tape angus was lurking near the house and he hurried forward as morgan and marco started up the steps they talked for quite a long time and then morgan took out his wallet and passed several notes across he started up the steps again with marco and asta eased back into the study and sat by the fire the moment the door opened and morgan entered she jumped up and ran to him thank god youre back is marco all right they took an x ray a couple of cracked ribs but theyre only hairline and hes had stitches in his face dillon needs stitches too she said you saw him all of them carl lady katherine invited us back for tea and came up with some sensational news really he said and reached for a cigar tell me when she was finished he paced across to the window and back again thats it its got to be so what are you going to do wait my love let them do all the work dillons a master diver remember if they can position that plane hell go down and bring up whats inside and then well take it from there ill have the citation standing by at ardmurchan so we can get out of here fast and you think dillon and ferguson will just stand by and let you take it ill handle it asta there was the sound of a plane taking off on the other side of the loch and they went to the terrace in time to see the lear in the distance lifting into the early evening sky there they go he smiled and put an arm about her shoulders i feel good about this asta its going to work of course the document could have rotted away by now she said down there in the water true he said but hidden in that bible i dont think so he smiled trust me in the lear dillon sat on one side of the aisle facing hannah who sat on the other exciting isnt it he said never a moments peace its worse than scotland yard she said he reached for the bar box and found a miniature of whiskey which he poured into a plastic cup and added water all the comforts of home the water on its own would be better for you especially at this height in an airplane dillon isnt it terrible he said i never could do the right thing she settled back so what happens now we find out what we can about the crash of that lysander and so on raf records from those days may be hard to uncover yes well it was air ministry in those days and now its ministry of defence where you work yourself so if you cant trace them who can he grinned power hannah bernstein thats what its all about better get on the phone and start them moving at the information centre no that comes second she said and reached for the phone first we get your face fixed god help me dillon said the mother i never had and he folded his arms and closed his eyes they had a tailwind so strong that they made gatwick in an hour and twenty minutes and it was only an hour after that at approximately seventhirty that dillon found himself lying on his back in a small theater at the london clinic while professor henry bellamy sat beside him and stitched the split in the left cheek doesnt hurt he asked cant feel a thing dillon said well you damn well ought to bellamy dropped the needles into the pan the nurse held out to him major surgery at the highest level i do some of my best work even wrote a paper on your case they published it in the lancet marvelous dillon said im immortalized for posterity dont be silly bellamy swabbed the line of stitches then put a length of plaster along them i put you together again and then you go off and try to commit suicide dillon swung his legs to the floor stood and reached for his jacket im fine now youre a bloody medical genius so you are flattery will get you nowhere just pay your bill and if you feel like telling me the secret of your remarkable recovery sometime id love to know they went out into the corridor where hannah bernstein waited six stitches chief inspector thatll spoil his beauty you think that would bother this one dillon asked hannah pulled down the collar of his jacket which was standing up he drinks whiskey of the irish variety and smokes far too many cigarettes professor what am i to do with him she didnt tell you i also play cards dillon said bellamy laughed out loud go on get out of here you rogue i have work to do and he walked away the night duty clerk at the information centre at the ministry of defence usually had little to do she was a widow called tina gaunt a motherlylooking lady of fifty whose husband an army sergeant had died in the gulf war she was rather sweet on dillon had seen his confidential report and while horrified at his ira background had also been secretly rather thrilled second world war raf records and the national service period after the war are still available in the hurlingham cellars as we call them but theyre out in sussex we do have a microfiche availability on the computer of course but its usually more of an outline than anything else i may not be able to help sure and i cant believe that of a darling woman like yourself dillon told her isnt he terrible chief inspector tina gaunt said the worst man in the world hannah told her lets start with this service record wing commander keith smith right here goes her fingers went to work nimbly on the keys and she watched the screen then paused frowning wing commander smith dso dfc and bar legion of honour my goodness a real ace she shook her head i dont understand my father was a lancaster bomber pilot during the war its always been a bit of a hobby of mine all those battle of britain pilots the great aces but ive never heard of this one isnt that strange hannah said tina gaunt tried again she sat back a moment later even stranger theres a security block just his rank and his decoration but no service record hannah glanced at dillon what do you think youre the copper do something about it she sighed all right ill telephone the brigadier and she went out tina gaunt stood with the phone to her ear and nodded all right brigadier ill do it but you see my backs covered she put the phone down the brigadiers assured me that hell have a gradeone warrant on my desk signed by the secretary of state for defence tomorrow under the circumstances ive agreed to cut corners fine dillon said lets get moving then she started on the keyboard again and once again sat back frowning im now crossreferenced to soe soe whats that hannah demanded special operations executive dillon told her set up by british intelligence on churchills orders to coordinate resistance and the underground movement in europe set europe ablaze thats what he said tina gaunt told them and tapped the keys again ah its all explained tell us dillon said there was a squadron at tempsford onethreeeight special duties it was known as the moonlight squadron all highly secret even the pilots wives thought their husbands just flew transports and what did they do hannah asked well they used to fly halifax bombers painted black to france and drop agents by parachute they also flew them in in lysanders you mean landed and took off again in occupied territory hannah said oh yes real heroes so now we know how wing commander keith smith won all those medals dillon said when did he die she checked her screen again theres no date for that here he was born in nineteentwenty entered the raf in nineteen thirtyeight aged eighteen retired as an air marshal in nineteen seventytwo knighted jesus dillon said have you an address for him she tried again and sat back no home address and as i said the information on the fiche is limited if you wanted more youd have to try the hurlingham cellars tomorrow damn dillon said more time to waste he smiled never mind youve done well my love god bless you he turned to the door and hannah said ive had a thought tina do you know about this place they had in east grinstead during the war for burns patients but they still do chief inspector the queen victoria hospital some of their wartime patients go back every year for checkups and further treatment why smith was a patient there burned hands well i can certainly give you the number tina checked the computer then wrote a number on her notepad tore it off and passed it across bless you hannah said and followed dillon out in fergusons office it was quiet and she sat on the edge of his desk the phone to her ear and waited finally she got her answer i see air marshal sir keith smith an anonymous voice said yes the air marshal was here for his annual check in june good and you have his home address hannah started to write many thanks she turned to dillon hampstead village would you believe that everything comes full circle dillon glanced at his watch nearly halften we cant bother the ould lad tonight well catch him in the morning lets go and get a snack they sat in the piano bar at the dorchester drinking champagne and a waitress brought scrambled eggs and smoked salmon this is your idea of a snack hannah said whats wrong with having the best if you can afford it that thought used to sustain me when i was being chased through side streets and the sewers of the bogside in belfast by british paratroopers dont start all that again dillon i dont want to know she ate some of her smoked salmon how do you think well fare with the good air marshal i would imagine rather well anyone who could win all those medals and rise to the rank he did has got to be hot stuff my bet is hes never forgotten a thing well well find out in the morning the waitress brought coffee and hannah took out her notebook youd better give me a list of the diving equipment youre going to need and ill get them started on it at the office first thing all right here goes the suppliers will know what everything is a mask nylon diving suit medium with a hood because itll be cold gloves fins four weight belts with twelve pounds in the pockets a regulator buoyancy control device and half a dozen empty air tanks empty she said yes were flying rather high youll also get a portable jackson compressor the electric type ill fill the tanks using that and an orca dive computer anything else three hundred feet of nylon rope snap links a couple of underwater lamps and a big knife that should take care of it oh and a couple of sterling submachine guns the silenced variety he smiled to repel boarders she put the notebook in her handbag good can i go now weve got a big day tomorrow of course they moved to the door and he paused to pay the bill as they went out into the foyer he said you wouldnt consider stopping at stable mews on the way no dillon what id really like to do is surprise my mother fergusons driver eased the daimler into the curb the head porter opening the door for her i think thats marvelous dillon said it shows such an affectionate nature stuff you dillon she said and the daimler drew away taxi sir the porter asked no thanks ill walk dillon said and he lit a cigarette and strode away the house was in a quiet backwater not far from hampstead heath it was just ninethirty the following morning when dillon and hannah arrived in fergusons daimler the chauffeur parked it in the street and they went in through a small gate in a high wall and walked through a small garden to the front door of a victorian cottage it was raining slightly this is nice hannah said as she rang the bell after a while it was opened by a middleaged black woman yes what can i do for you she asked in a west indian accent were from the ministry of defence hannah told her i know its early but wed very much like to see sir keith if thats possible not too early for him she smiled hes been in the garden an hour already in this rain dillon asked nothing keeps him out of that garden here ill show you she took them along a flagged path and round the corner to the back garden sir keith youve got visitors she left them there and hannah and dillon walked to a small terrace with open french windows to the house on the other side of the lawn they saw a small man in a rainproof anorak and an old panama hat he was pruning roses he turned to look at them his eyes sharp and blue in a tanned face that was still handsome he came forward good morning what can i do for you hannah got her id out and showed it to him im detective chief inspector hannah bernstein assistant to brigadier charles ferguson of the ministry of defence and my name is dillon sean dillon the irishman held out his hand i work for the same department i see the air marshal nodded im familiar with brigadier fergusons work i served on the three services joint security committee for five years after i retired am i to assume this is a security matter it is indeed sir keith she said but it goes back a long way dillon told him to when you crashed a lysander into loch dhu in the scottish highlands back in nineteen fortysix the old man said in astonishment that is going back a bit youd better come inside and ill get mary to make some tea and we can talk about it and he led the way in through the french windows that was so long ago sir keith said his housekeeper brought tea in on a tray thats all right mary he told her well manage ill pour if i may hannah said of course my dear now what is it you want exactly you met a major ian campbell at the east grinstead burns unit dillon said i certainly did sir keith held up his hands the skin was light and shiny and the middle finger was missing on the left one that was from a runin with an me that was the jet fighter the germans did so well with at the end of things february nineteen fortyfive blew me out of the sky over northern france i was in a lysander you see no contest yes we checked your records at the ministry of defence dillon said found out about your work for soe we had to pull strings for that youre still classified am i by god he took the cup of tea hannah offered and laughed we got onto you through ian campbells sister hannah said lady katherine rose good lord is she still alive was an ata pilot in the war wonderful woman yes she still lives up there on the loch dhu estate dillon said it was she who told us about you coming down in the loch in a lysander thats right march of fortysix i was on my way to a new command at stornaway tried to land in damn bad weather at ardmurchan and lost my engine on the approach i was lucky to get out the plane sank almost at once he spooned sugar into his tea but why are you interested in that do you remember calling in at east grinstead and finding ian campbell on the point of death hannah asked thats right though i heard he recovered later you told his batman you were flying to stornaway and offered to take his lairds belongings and drop in at ardmurchan thats right two suitcases that was the reason i was going to land there anyway he looked slightly bewildered but whats that got to do with it there was something of vital importance in one of those suitcases she said something of national importance good heavens what on earth could it be she hesitated well actually sir keith the matter is classified were acting on the prime ministers instructions well you would be if fergusons involved dillon turned to her jesus girl he was decorated from here to christmas knighted by the queen and ended up an air marshal if he cant keep a secret who can yes youre right she said of course you are she turned back to sir keith strictly in confidence my word on it so she told him about the chungking covenant everything sir keith searched in the bottom drawer of a bureau found an old cardboard file and a folded map which he brought across to the dining table the file is a copy of the original accident report there had to be a hearing always is but i was completely exonerated he held up his hands the state of these never stopped me flying and the map dillon asked see for yourself ordnance survey map of the area large scale as you can see he unfolded it there was loch dhu the castle and ardmurchan lodge i was meticulous in noting my exact position when the lysander went down see the red line from the little jetty at ardmurchan lodge thats where i landed dillon ran a finger along the line that seems clear enough one hundred and twenty yards south from the jetty x marks the spot and i know im right because the boys from the base dragged for her with a grappling hook on a line and brought up a piece of fuselage how deep dillon asked about ninety feet the air ministry decided it wasnt worth trying to recover her it would have meant sending up special equipment and the war after all was over they were scrapping aircraft so why bother different thing if there had been something of value down there which there was only nobody knew about it hannah said yes theres irony for you he turned to dillon you intend some sort of recovery i presume yes im an experienced diver ill go down and see what i can find i shouldnt expect too much not after all these years would you like the map i certainly would ill see you get it back hannah said weve taken up enough of your time youve really been more than helpful i certainly hope i have ill see you out he took them to the front door and opened it forgive an old buffer like me my dear but i must say the police have improved since my day on impulse she kissed him on the cheek its been an honor to meet you good luck the both of you with this morgan fellow make sure he goes down dillon and give ferguson my regards i will dillon said and they went down the path oh and dillon sir keith called as they reached the gate they turned and dillon said what is it if theyre still there you wont find two suitcases down there there should be three and one of thems mine cant expect much after fortyseven years but it would be fun to have it back ill see that you do dillon said and they went out they got in the back of the daimler and hannah said what an absolutely smashing man yes they dont make them like that anymore dillon said now what a place called underseas supplies located in lambeth theyve got the order for those things you wanted the manager said hed have them ready by noon hed like you to check them out before he rushes them to gatwick and the two sterlings i asked for in the boot i got them from the armourer at the ministry before i picked you up this morning what a girl dillon said lets get moving then the warehouse in lambeth was crammed with diving equipment of every kind the manager a man called speke handled things himself and he and dillon went through the list checking each item off as they did so there seems an awful lot hannah said do you really need all this i mean whats this thing she held up a yellow colored orca and dillon said thats my lifeline girl dear a diving computer that tells me how deep it is how long ive been down there how long ive got to go it even warns me if im coming up too fast i see i need it just like i need this he picked up the heavy nylon diving suit in orange and green its going to be very cold down there and very dark it isnt the caribbean about the visibility mr dillon speke said the two lamps you asked for ive given you the new royal navy halogen type twice the power excellent dillon said thats it then get this lot up to gatwick as soon as you can itll take at least two hours sir maybe three just do your best hannah said as they got into the daimler dillon said what kind of time do you think well get off three oclock she said good he took her hand you and i can take a little time off what about mulligans for oysters and guinness after all tomorrow ill be diving down to god knows what dammit dillon why not she laughed weve earned it oysters and guinness at mulligans it is thirteen theflight from london gatwick was reasonably smooth until the final stages when the weather deteriorated into low cloud and heavy rain as they made their approach over the loch flight lieutenant lacey said over the loud speaker headquarters have notified the brigadier of our arrival time hes on his way they dropped in for the touchdown and as they rolled along the runway they saw the citation standing inside one of the hangars now whats that doing here hannah said id say it was on standby for a quick move out dillon said it makes sense thats what id do as he opened the door for them flight lieutenant lacey said youve got company chief inspector thats the personal plane of mr carl morgan presently of loch dhu castle dillon told him the polo player jesus son dillon laughed and isnt that the grand way to describe him the range rover was crossing the decaying tarmac toward them kim at the wheel ferguson beside him it stopped and the brigadier got out everything go well couldnt be better dillon told him ive got a map of the loch with the exact location by the way guess who the pilot of that lysander turned out to be surprise me air marshal sir keith smith hannah told him ferguson looked genuinely astonished of course i didnt make the connection when lady katherine told us his name i mean nineteen fortysix a wing commander lacey said well get all this stuff in the back of the range rover brigadier if your man could lend a hand of course ferguson nodded to kim then took a large golfing umbrella from inside the range rover and put it up against the rain morgans plane seems to have taken up permanent residence hannah said yes the bastards there himself keeping an eye on us i saw their shogun parked in the hangar beside the citation probably got their field glasses turned our way right now lets give them something to see then dillon said pass me those two sterling submachine guns flight lieutenant lacey handed them over and ferguson smiled what a happy thought hold the umbrella for me chief inspector he checked one of the sterlings expertly and then said right lets move out into the open so they can see what weve got which he and dillon did standing in the rain for a few moments and then turning back to the range rover that should do it dillon said and put the sterlings on the backseat you looked like a couple of little boys then playing gangsters in the school yard hannah said ah if it were only so chief inspector but the time approaches when this whole thing becomes serious business ive just in a manner of speaking given morgan fair warning but lets make certain well take a walk he moved directly toward the hangar and the citation and they moved with him all three sheltered by the huge golfing umbrella as they got close they saw the shogun marco and morgan leaning against it two men in flying overalls were hanging around on the other side of the plane hannah slipped her right hand inside her handbag which hung from a shoulder strap low on her thigh no need for that chief inspector ferguson murmured he isnt about to declare war just yet he raised his voice ah there you are morgan good day to you and a good day to you brigadier morgan came forward followed by marco with his battered face who stood there glaring at dillon successful trip chief inspector morgan asked couldnt have been better she told him who would have thought it he turned and looked out across the loch quiet in the rain down there on the bottom for all these years place of dark waters isnt that what the locals call it in gaelic aptly named dillon i should think youll have problems down there who knows dillon told him i see youve got your plane on standby ferguson said yes leaving at the crack of dawn weve got an eight oclock start lets face it brigadier youve won and ive certainly had enough of the delights of loch dhu castle and this eternal bloody rain really ferguson said carl morgan giving up i find that difficult to believe oh hes just being a good sport arent you morgan dillon said but of course morgan said calmly well give our best to asta as we probably shant be seeing her again ferguson told him i will good well be off now as they walked back to the plane hannah said i dont believe a word of it he isnt going anywhere or if he is he intends to come back dillon said im not sure how but thats what hell do of course he will ferguson said were back with the kind of game playing thats characterized this affair from the beginning we know that he intends to return and he knows that we know he shook his head inconceivable that hed give up now its against his nature have you ever seen him boot an opponent out of the saddle in a polo match well thats carl morgan hes always got to win whatever it costs id say this is a situation asta could help with sir hannah said yes well well see they reached the lear and lacey said all in brigadier is there anything else we can do not at the moment flight lieutenant except return to gatwick as usual i require a twentyfourhour standby ill see to it brigadier good on your way then he turned come on you lot lets move out they got into the range rover kim behind the wheel and as they drove away the lear was already starting up behind them morgan went into the study and poured himself a brandy then moved to the fire he sipped the brandy slowly savouring it and the door opened and asta came in they arrived back then i heard the plane he nodded they unloaded a quantity of diving equipment and ferguson and dillon rather ostentatiously displayed a couple of sterling submachine guns all for my benefit we had a nice chat and i told ferguson i was retiring from the fray flying out at eight in the morning and they believed you he smiled of course not ferguson knows damn well ill return in some way of course the important thing is that i know that he expects that so its all a question of timing how do you mean he smiled theres a bottle of champagne over there in the bucket my love go and open it and ill tell you at ardmurchan lodge the light was on in the garage the diving equipment arranged neatly on the floor there was a steady hum from the compressor as dillon showed kim how to fill the first air tank hannah came in and stood watching arms folded does he know what hes doing kim dillon laughed ive just shown him havent i and you only show a ghurka something once he said to kim all six yes sahib ill take care of it dillon followed hannah in through the side door and through the kitchen to the sitting room where they found ferguson sitting at the desk he glanced up all in order so far dillon said good so the plan is simple as soon as morgan leaves in the citation we get to work you hold the fort in the house chief inspector while kim and myself go out with dillon in the whale boat dillon im totally ignorant about diving she said so forgive my questions that seem stupid just how difficult will it be and just how long will it take well to start with ill go down very fast my weight belt helps with that if sir keiths positioning is accurate i could be onto the plane in minutes but its going to be dark down there and theres no way of knowing what the bottoms like there could be ten feet of sludge another thing the depth is important the deeper you go the more air you use its astonishing how much ten or fifteen feet reduces your bottom line ideally id like to do this dive within sportdiving limits because if i cant ill have to decompress on the way up and that takes time why exactly the deeper you go and the longer youre there the more nitrogen you get in your bloodstream its like fizz in a bottle of champagne wanting to burst out it can give you the bends cripple you and sometimes kill you he smiled here endeth the lesson i must say it all sounds rather heavy to me ill be all right he went and helped himself to a bushmills ive had a thought though brigadier whats that have kim up at the airstrip in the morning with a pair of field glasses i mean well hear that plane leave but lets make sure it just doesnt have the pilots on board good idea ferguson said he glanced at his watch eleven oclock ive had an even better idea dillon another of your little night forays up at the castle see if you can have a word with asta im surprised we havent heard from her hannah said im not too damn dangerous for the girl to use the phone unless shes absolutely certain morgan isnt around ferguson told her no you take dillon up there like you did the other night chief inspector and well see what happens it was still raining as hannah turned in at the side of loch dhu castle and switched off the engine as on the previous occasion dillon wore black he took out his walther and tested it then put it back into his waistband at the rear seems to me weve done this before i know hannah smiled youll have to think of a variation he pulled the sinister ski mask on leaving only his eyes and lips visible i could always give you a kiss while youre wearing that thing dont be disgusting dillon go on on your way the door closed gently and he disappeared into the darkness in a second he negotiated the wall in the same way as before and made his way through the grounds to the lawn and paused in the trees looking across at the lights of the castle after a while the french windows to the study opened and morgan appeared smoking a cigar followed by asta wearing a sweater and slacks an umbrella in her hand what are you going to do morgan demanded walk the dog you can come too carl in this rain you must be crazy dont be too long he told her and turned back inside she put the umbrella up and moved down the steps of the terrace come on boy she called and the doberman came out of the study in a flash and hurried across the lawn there was a small summer house and dillon moved to stand to one side of it the dog stopped dead and whined dillon gave that peculiar low whistle and the dog bounded to his side and licked his hand gently where are you boy asta said over here dillon said softly its you dillon she hurried forward and stood there clutching the umbrella what are you up to this time oh i didnt want to let you go without a word he said you are leaving in the morning thats right isnt it he pulled off his ski mask eight oclock she said yes thats what morgan told us at the airfield so graceful in defeat he was so bloody graceful that we didnt believe a word of it hes coming back isnt he asta she nodded he didnt expect you to believe him thats what he told me he said youd expect him to return so the only thing to get right was the timing all right tell me we leave at eight in the citation carl said he would anticipate you making the dive the moment were on our way then what you know how far arisaig is about twenty miles exactly theres another exraf airstrip there like ardmurchan he and marco took the estate car down there and came back in the shogun the citation will land there after leaving ardmurchan well come back by road in the estate car the pilots will give it an hour then fly back to ardmurchan where well have been caught with our pants down dillon said exactly oh well well have to see what we can come up with he put a hand on her shoulder youre managing are you yes she said im managing just fine good for you he pulled on the ski mask keep the faith and he disappeared into the darkness carl morgan appeared on the terrace are you there asta yes carl im coming she said and went across the lawn the umbrella raised her hand in the dogs collar kim was at the airstrip by eleventhirty he hadnt taken the car in case he was seen and lay on the edge of a small copse with a pair of field glasses and observed the citation in the hangar he could see the two pilots walking around doing their checks and after a while the shogun appeared it stopped just outside the hangar and morgan and asta got out the two pilots came forward there was a brief conversation and they got the luggage out as morgan and asta went into the hangar marco drove the shogun inside kim waited after a while the engines fired and the citation moved out into the open and taxied to the end of the runway turning into the wind he watched it race to the end of the runway and lift into the gray sky then got up and ran back to the lodge dillon had his diving suit on and was already pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with four air tanks down to the little jetty where hannah and ferguson waited in the whaler it was raining unmercifully and yet in spite of it there was a cloud of mist ten or twelve feet high rolling across the water reducing visibility considerably ferguson wore an anorak and a rain hat hannah was wearing an old raincoat and trilby she had found in the cloakroom there was a smaller rowing boat several inches of water swishing around inside it as hannah got out of the whaler to meet him he said pull that one out of the way she did as he said and as he started to pass the air tanks down to ferguson there was the sound of the plane taking off there they go ferguson said right dillon told him ill make do with the four tanks with any kind of luck i wont need all of them ill get the rest of my gear he pushed the wheelbarrow back up to the lodge loaded it with everything else including the two sterlings as he started back down to the jetty kim came out of the trees on the run he caught up with dillon just before he reached the whaler you saw them go ferguson demanded yes sahib they arrived in the shogun i saw morgan and the lady get out and go inside to the plane the man marco was there too he drove the shogun into the hangar the plane came out and took off very quickly you mean they got on inside the hangar dillon said yes sahib dillon frowned pausing as he handed the rest of the gear down and ferguson said youre worried for some reason yes i cant see why he himself told us he was going we expected him to try and work a flanker on us and asta told us exactly what he planned and kim did see them leave he saw the plane leave dillon said but what the hell lets get moving kim jumped down into the whaler and dillon passed everything down ferguson put the two sterlings on the stern seat one thing is certain dear boy anyone who tried to take us on when weve got those things to repel boarders would have to be crazy lets hope so dillon handed hannah up now you take care she took a walther from her pocket dont worry ive got this well i do worry thats how ive lasted as long as i have he dropped into the boat went to the stern and started the outboard motor hannah unfastened the line and tossed it into the boat good luck she called as they eased away like i said take care the foolish one you can be on occasions though lovable with it dillon called and took the whaler round in a broad curve hannah watched them go then turned and walked back up to the lodge she went in the front door took off the raincoat and the old trilby hat she was cold and her feet were damp she shivered and decided to make a cup of coffee and went into the kitchen she started to fill the kettle at the sink there was a slight eerie creaking behind her the larder door swung open and hector munro stepped out a sawedoff shotgun in his hands and her walther was in the raincoat ah god dillon she thought youre right i am a fool she turned and darted to the open kitchen door straight into rory munro like his father he carried a sawedoff and he held her easily in one arm his face looked terrible raw and bruised but he smiled for all that and where would you be going darling he pushed her gently back into the room where hector sat on the edge of the table filling his pipe now be a good lassie and youll come to no harm theres a nice dry cellar for you weve already checked no windows to break out of mind you rory said and an oak door with double bolts that youd need a fire axe to break through aye munro told her youll do well enough not even a need to tie your wrists see how lucky you are rory said she stepped away from him and went to the other side of the kitchen to face them youre working for morgan arent you but why she gestured to rory remember what happened in the boxing ring look at what that animal marco did to your sons face but mr morgan wasnt responsible for that a bit of sport surely my lad can take his knocks the old man put a match to his pipe and then there is the question of the ten thousand pounds were getting for helping him what does he intend to do ah well youll have to wait and see wont you hector munro told her she took a deep breath im a police officer did you know that rory laughed out loud and munro said what bloody nonsense are you trying now girl everybody knows youre secretary to the brigadier i can show you my id let me get it im a detective chief inspector at scotland yard detective chief inspector munro shook his head sadly events have turned her wits rory he got up walked to the cellar door and opened it down with her rory shoved her through the door closed the bolts rammed home she lost her balance and slipped several steps banging a knee painfully and then she remembered the one thing she should have said the one thing that might have had an effect fergus she went up the steps found the switch and turned it on and light came on down in the cellar she hammered on the door with clenched fists let me out she called ive got something to tell you he killed your son he killed fergus but by that time there was no one there to answer her hector munro and his son walked down toward the jetty in the rain they could hear the whalers outboard but couldnt see the boat itself because of the mist they went along the jetty and paused beside the rowing boat dammit theres nine inches of water in the bottom rory said and a bucket under the seat for you to bale her out with so get on with it hector took out an old silver watch on a chain and consulted it not that were in a hurry weve got thirty minutes to wait by my reckoning rory had laid down the shotgun and got into the rowing boat cursing as water slopped over his boots he looked up into the rain by god its to be hoped fergus has a roof of some sort over his head wherever he is never mind he wont need to keep out of the way much longer theyll all be away out of it hector munro told him now get on with it boy rory picked up the bucket and started to bale ferguson took over the tiller while dillon consulted the map after a while the irishman said its got to be about here he turned and could just see the chimneys of the lodge above the mist the wood behind yes thats the line according to sir keiths notation on this map kill the engine they almost stopped drifting slowly and he turned to kim to find the ghurka already putting the anchor over dillon had cut the great coil of nylon rope into two lengths of one hundred feet with snap links on the ends he tied a weight belt to each of them and turned to kim who was securing them round the center seat over we go dillon said and the ghurka slipped them over dillon pulled up the cowl of his diving suit strapped the knife in its orange sheath to his leg then he assembled his equipment clamping a tank to his inflatable the orca computer went out on the line of his air pressure gauge then kim helped him into the jacket taking the weight of the tank until dillon had strapped the velcro wrappers across his chest he fastened the weight belt around his waist then pulled on his gloves he sat down to get his fins on it was all very awkward because of the size and shape of the boat but that couldnt be helped he got one of the lamps and looped it around his left wrist he spat in his mask leaned over and swilled it in the water and pulled it on then he sat on the thwart checked that the air was flowing freely through his mouth piece waved at ferguson and went over backwards he swam under the keel of the boat until he found the anchor line which adopting the usual procedure he followed down pausing a couple of times to equalize the pressure in his ears by swallowing hard to his surprise the water was quite clear dark but rather like black glass he went feet first hauling himself down the anchor line aware of the other two lines they had put down close at hand he checked his orca computer forty then suddenly sixty seventy seventyfive it was darker there and he switched on the powerful lamp and there was the bottom it wasnt as he had expected nothing like the silt he had looked for instead large patches of sand in between a kind of seagrass great fronds waving to and fro in the current at least six feet in length he hovered checking the computer to see how long he had then moved away from the anchor line the beam of the halogen light splayed out in front of him and there it was a dark shadow at first tilted up on its nose tail high the bristol perseus engine was quite visible due to fuselage corrosion and the triple propeller was still there the canopy had been pushed back obviously when sir keith had got out fast after hitting the surface of the loch there was a corrugated metal ladder leading up to the passenger section and beside it the outline of raf roundels dillon went into the pilots section headfirst it was all still intact in a kind of skeleton form the instrument panel the control column he turned and pressed into the passenger section there were two seats only the tubular construction remaining leather and cloth long since rotted away the suitcases were there as for some strange reason he had always known they would be one was metal the other two leather and when he touched one of those it started to crumble he ran his hand across the metal one and the faint etching of a name appeared there were three words the first two were hopelessly faded but when he rubbed with his gloved hand the lamp held close the name campbell was plain he backed out pulling the metal case out first depositing it on the sand beside the lysander then he went back for the other two the first one stayed reasonably intact but the second seemed to come apart in his hand when it burst open he caught a brief glimpse of decaying clothes some corroded toilet articles what was left of an raf sidecap and the remnants of a tunic with raf pilots wings above medal ribbons keith smiths case obviously dillon scrabbled in the detritus and came up with a blackened silver cigarette case something to take back to the old boy at least he stuffed it into one of the pockets in his inflatable then swam back to where the two down lines from the whaler dangled to the bottom he fastened the case to one of the lines snap links then returned to the metal case brought it back with him and fastened it to the end of the other line he paused making sure that everything was in order then started up one foot a second ferguson and kim waiting in the heavy rain suddenly became aware of the sound of an engine quickly ferguson picked up one of the sterlings handed it to kim and reached for the other himself he cocked it quickly dont hesitate he said to kim if its morgan and the man marco theyll kill us without the slightest hesitation have no fear sahib i have killed many times as the sahib well knows a voice called high and clear is that you brigadier its asta ferguson hesitated and said to kim stay ready the loch dhu castle boat the katrina drifted out of the mist asta at the wheel in the deck house she wore rubber boots a white sweater and jeans its only me brigadier can i come alongside what on earths going on ferguson said kim saw you leaving in the citation oh no she said that was carl and marco he told me to go back to the castle in the shogun and wait for him did you see me go into the hangar kim oh yes memsahib it was morgan and marco who boarded the plane i drove back in the shogun afterwards kim turned to ferguson and said awkwardly i am sorry brigadier sahib i left as the plane took off i did not see the memsahib drive away never mind that now ferguson put down the sterling take the line from the memsahib and tie her boat alongside she switched off the engine and came to the rail is dillon down there now yes dropped in about fifteen minutes ago how very convenient the door to the saloon opened and carl morgan emerged a browning hipower in his hand and marco behind him holding an israeli uzi submachine gun fourteen at that precise moment dillon broke through to the surface and floated there looking up at them all he raised his mask asta what is this it means weve been had im afraid ferguson said dillon looked straight up at her youre on his side in spite of what he did to your mother morgans face turned dark with anger ill take pleasure in making you pay for that filthy lie asta told me all about it i loved my wife dillon more than anything in this life she gave me the daughter id never had and you think i could have killed her there was silence only the sound of the rain hissing into the loch dillon said id say youre well suited to each other morgan put an arm around her she did her work well telling you about my plan to fly to arisaig omitting the fact that we didnt actually intend to get on the plane i knew one of you would be waiting probably that man of yours ferguson so we just stayed in the hangar until hed gone i saw him running off through the trees through my field glasses then all that was needed was asta to pilot the boat while marco and i stayed below and the poor old brigadier fell for it dillon strange how i always get my way isnt it yes ferguson said i must say you have excellent connections probably with the devil but of course morgan raised his voice are you there munro on our way in munro called and the rowboat appeared rory at the oars what about the woman locked her in the cellar they bumped against the hull of the motor cruiser and climbed on board morgan looked down at dillon so here we are at the final end of things did you find the plane dillon just floated there staring up at him and morgan said dont fuck with me dillon if you do ill blow the brigadiers head off and that would be a pity because ive got plans for him really ferguson said yes youre going to love this ill take you back to palermo with me and then well sell you to one of the more extreme arab fundamentalist groups in iran you should fetch a rather high price theyd love to get their hands on a british intelligence officer as senior as you and you know what those people are like ferguson theyll take the skin off you inch by inch before theyve finished youll be singing like a bird what a vivid imagination you have ferguson said morgan nodded to marco who fired a burst from the uzi into the water close to dillon now dont mess with me dillon or i swear the next burst takes your boss apart all right i get the picture dillon put in his mouthpiece pulled down his mask and let himself sink he didnt bother with the anchor line simply jackknifed halfway down and continued headfirst reaching the bottom to the left of the lysander above a forest of waving fronds when he turned on his lamp the first thing he saw was fergus munro on his back a length of chain wrapped around his body his face was swollen and bloated the eyes staring but he was completely recognizable dillon hovered looking down at him then pulled out his knife and cut the rope that held the chain the body bounced from the bottom and he got a grip on ferguss jacket and towed the corpse back to the downlines he left it on the sandy bottom untied the flimsier case and went and clipped it beside the metal case on the other line then he went back to the body towed it across to the second downline and tied it on winding the rope round the waist and fastening it with the snap link then he pulled on the line that secured the cases and started up kim and ferguson were still hauling the line in when dillon surfaced he floated beside the cases untied the leather one and passed it up to kim it was already falling apart and broke in the ghurkas hands spilling a mass of rotting clothes onto the deck thats no bloody good morgan said leaning over the rail and looking down into the whaler the other one dillon the other dillon pushed the metal suitcase against the hull and ferguson and kim reached over to get it dillon murmured if you get a chance to jump i can give you air under the surface but only one of you in a minute ill be going down again and i want you to haul in the other line kim its vital thanks for the offer ferguson whispered but ive never even liked swimming what you suggest is a quite appalling prospect kim might feel differently hurry it up morgan called they got the suitcase over and into the bottom of the whaler the metal was blackened and streaked with green seaweed get it open morgan ordered ferguson tried the clasps on the locks but they were rigid damn things corroded wont budge well try harder dillon pulled the knife from his leg sheath and handed it up to kim who forced it behind the two clasps in turn and ripped them off then he worked the point of the knife under the edge of the lid and prised quite suddenly the lid lifted there were clothes inside mildewed but in surprisingly good condition there was a uniform tunic on top still recognizable with majors crowns on the epaulettes come on damn you morgan was intensely excited as he leaned over the rail empty it out kim turned the case over spilling its contents into the bottom of the whaler and found it at once a booksize package wrapped in yellow oilskin open it man open it morgan ordered it was ferguson who unwrapped the oilskin layer by layer until he held in his hand the bible its silver blackened by the years it would seem to be what weve all been looking for he said go on get it open see if its still there ferguson took the knife from kim and ran its point along the inside of the front cover the secret compartment flicked open the folded document inside immediately apparent ferguson unfolded it read it then he looked up face calm yes this would appear to be the fourth copy of the chungking covenant give it to me and morgan reached down ferguson hesitated and marco raised the uzi threateningly you can die now morgan said its your choice very well ferguson passed up the document now get up here yourself morgan told him and turned as for you dillon but dillon had gone dropping under the surface marco fired a futile burst into the water and kim ducked and kept hauling on the line and suddenly fergus munros body surfaced a totally macabre sight god help me its fergus hector munro called leaning over the rail rory joined him staring down into the water what happened to him da ask your friend morgan he and his henchman here beat him to death ferguson said you bastards hector munro cried and he and rory turned their shotguns coming up too late as marco raked both of them with a long burst from the uzi driving them over the rail into the water get out of it kim ferguson cried and the ghurka dived headfirst from the whaler into the dark water pulling himself down with powerful strokes as marco sprayed the water behind him there is a technique known as buddy breathing to any experienced diver by which if there is no alternate source of air available it is possible to share your air supply with a companion by passing the regulator back and forth between you dillon at twelve feet reached up and caught kim by the foot pulled him close took out his mouthpiece and passed it across the hardy little warrior a veteran of thirty years of campaigning understood at once took in a supply of air then passed it back dillon started to kick with his fins making for the shore pulling kim along beside him and sharing the air supply as they went after a while he raised his thumb and started up surfacing into a cocoon of mist no sign of the boats at all a moment later kim came up beside him coughing dillon said what happened after i dived when the body surfaced the munros went crazy marco shot both of them with the uzi and the brigadier cried to me to jump sahib dillon could hear the motor cruiser moving away at high speed but not across the loch in the direction of the castle where in the hell are they going he said there is that old concrete jetty the raf used just below the airstrip sahib kim told him perhaps theyre making for that and a quick departure dillon said and at that moment there was a thunder of engines overhead as morgans citation made its approaches dillon said right we cant be far from the jetty so lets get moving and he made for the shore they landed ten minutes later dillon stripped off his equipment and ran toward the house still wearing his diving suit kim jogging at his heels the irishman flung open the front door ran into the study and opened the top drawer in the desk there was a browning in there as he checked it kim came in sahib im going up to the airstrip you get the memsahib from the cellar and tell her whats happened he ran outside and cut across the back lawn no point in taking the range rover hed be quicker on foot and the rubber and nylon diving socks he wore protected his feet he ran into the wood weaving in and out amongst the trees aware that the engines of the citation hadnt stopped as he emerged from the wood he could see it taxiing to the end of the runway and turning into the wind at the same moment morgan and asta marco holding the uzi against fergusons back came round the corner of the main hangar and started toward the citation dillon stopped running and watched helplessly as they boarded a moment later the citation roared along the runway and lifted into the sky when dillon arrived back at ardmurchan lodge and went in the door hannah rushed to meet him what happened i heard the plane taking off exactly morgan had it all worked out he didnt even go back to the castle not a minute wasted i arrived in time to see them boarding he and asta marco and the brigadier they took off straight away ive been onto headquarters ive asked them to check the flight plan they filed good get straight onto them again and order lacey to get up here in the lear like it was yesterday ive ordered that too dillon she said nothing like scotland yard training im going to change when he returned he was wearing black jeans a white polo neck sweater and his old black flying jacket hannah was in the sitting room at fergusons desk the telephone at her ear kim came in with a jug of coffee and two cups she put the phone down they were routed to oslo that makes sense he wanted to be out of our air space fast then what refueling then onwards to palermo well thats what he said his intended destination was hes taking the covenant to luca and the brigadier didnt kim tell you hes going to sell him to some arab fanatics or other in iran cant we stop him in oslo dillon looked at his watch the rate that thing goes hell be just about landing can you imagine how long it would take to go through foreign office channels to the norwegian government no chance hannah hes long gone then that leaves the italian government palermo dillon lit a cigarette the best joke ive heard in a long time this is don giovanni luca were talking about the most powerful man in sicily he has judges killed to order she was upset now and it showed her face very pale we cant let them get away with it dillon morgan and that conniving little bitch yes she was good wasnt she he smiled bleakly she certainly fooled me oh to hell with your damned male ego its the brigadier im thinking of and so am i girl dear you get back to headquarters and tell them you want to contact major paolo gagini of the italian secret intelligence service in palermo he should be more than interested after all hes the one who brought the story of the covenant to ferguson in the first place hes also the expert on luca according to the file you showed me lets see what he can come up with right good thinking she picked up the phone and got to work and dillon walked out to the terrace lit a cigarette and looked out into the rain wondering about it he was aware of hannahs voice on the phone but was somewhere else thinking of ferguson and what would happen to him in iran and that was too awful to contemplate strange but it was only now in a situation like this that he realized he actually had a certain affection for the brigadier he also thought about morgan with a kind of cold killing rage and as for asta hannah came to the open french windows ive got gagini on the phone from palermo ive filled him in on the situation and he wants to speak to you dillon went in and picked up the phone gagini ive heard good things about you he said in italian what can we do in this thing ive heard of you too dillon look you know what the situation is like here mafia everywhere if i get a court order which would be difficult it would take time what about immigration and customs at the airport half of them have mafia connections just like the police any move i make at an official level luca will know about within fifteen minutes there must be something you can do leave it with me ill phone back in an hour dillon put the phone down and turned to hannah hes calling back in an hour hes going to see what he can do this is nonsense she said all they have to do is meet the damn plane with a police squad have you ever been to sicily no i have its another world the minute gagini makes an official request for the police to meet that plane someone will reach for a phone to inform luca even from police headquarters especially from police headquarters the mafias fingers reach everywhere scotland yard its not hannah if luca thought there was a problem hed contact morgan and tell him to go elsewhere perhaps even tell him to fly direct to teheran and thats the last thing we want so what do we do we wait for gagini to phone back he said turned and went outside again and when gagini did phone just under an hour later he sounded excited my sources tell me the citation isnt booked to land at palermo they must have a flight plan even in sicily dillon said of course my friend just listen carl morgan has an old farmhouse inland from palermo at a place called valdini he doesnt use it much theres just a caretaker and his wife in residence its an old family property so dillon glanced at hannah who was listening on the extension the thing is morgan had an airstrip laid out there the other year probably to be used for drug deliveries its grass but open meadow about a mile long so its perfectly adequate for the citation to land are you saying thats what he intends to do thats what the flight plan says but what about customs and immigration hannah broke in all taken care of by luca chief inspector dillon said can we get in i doubt it thats real mafia country you couldnt pass through a village without being noted every shepherd boy on a hill with his flock is like a sentry troop movements as with the police are an impossibility i see dillon said there was a sudden roar as the lear from gatwick passed overhead to make its landing what do you want me to do my friend let me think about it our plane has just arrived ill let you know the only certain thing is that well be coming to palermo he replaced the phone as did hannah it doesnt sound too good does it she said well see now lets get out of here lacey came along from the cockpit and crouched down an hour to gatwick well refuel and get straight off to palermo good dillon said speed is of the essence on this one flight lieutenant kim lay back in one of the rear seats eyes closed hannah glanced back at the little ghurka what about him well drop him at gatwick nothing for him to do where im going and where would that be valdini obviously but gagini has just told us that would be impossible nothings impossible in this life hannah theres always a way he reached for the bar box found a half bottle of scotch poured himself a shot into a plastic cup and sat there brooding about twenty minutes before they reached gatwick lacey patched a call through which dillon took it was gagini an interesting development ive got one of my undercover men working at the local garage near lucas place his driver came in to fill up the tank told the owner they were taking a run out to valdini that makes sense dillon said everything coming together so my friend have you had any thoughts on how to handle this yes what about flying in but they would be alerted the moment you tried to land im thinking of something different a story ferguson told me once he had a fella called egan working for him and he needed to get down fast in a similar sort of situation that was in sicily too about ten years ago of course i remember the case he parachuted in thats right but he was an expert at that kind of thing he jumped at eight hundred feet my friend well he would wouldnt he but i can do that ive jumped before i know my stuff believe me can you lay on a plane parachute weapons and so on that shouldnt be a problem well see you at the airport then dillon said and put the phone down what was all that about hannah demanded but at that moment the seat belt signs went on and they started to descend toward gatwick ill tell you later dillon told her now be a good girl and fasten your belt the stopover at gatwick took only an hour hannah took kim across to the small office the special flying unit used and arranged a taxi i would rather come with you memsahib no kim you go back to cavendish square and make things nice for the brigadier he will come back memsahib you swear it she took a deep breath and against every conviction lied to him hell be back kim i promise you he smiled blessings on you memsahib and he crossed to his taxi she found dillon in the waiting room feeding coins into a sandwich machine plastic food but what can you do would you like something personally im starving i suppose so anything there is well you wont want the ham so well make it tomato and boiled egg theres tea and coffee on board come on as they walked out to the lear the fuel truck was just moving away lacey stood waiting the copilot already on board ready when you are the flight lieutenant said well get moving then dillon told him and went up the steps behind hannah they settled in their seats and a few minutes later the lear started to taxi dillon waited until they leveled off at thirty thousand feet then made tea in the plastic cups he sat there eating the sandwiches without saying anything finally hannah said you were going to tell me what you were going to do there was a fella called egan worked for ferguson a few years back exsas he had a similar problem about getting somewhere fast and that was in sicily too how did he solve it parachuted in from eight hundred feet from a small aircraft at that height you hit the ground in thirty seconds there was genuine horror on her face you must be mad not at all as far as theyre concerned it will be just a plane passing overhead a bit low perhaps but they wont be expecting what i have in mind and it will be dark by then and major gagini has agreed to this oh yes hes arranging a suitable plane equipment weapons everything all i have to do is jump out of the plane you can follow on and land in the lear say thirty minutes later he drank some of his tea and she sat there staring at him and then a curious expression appeared on her face when you were talking to gagini i heard you say youd jumped before i wondered what you were talking about it makes sense now well it would wouldnt it except that for some strange reason i think you were lying to him i dont think youve ever made a parachute jump in your life dillon he gave her his best smile and lit a cigarette true but theres always a first time for everything and you be a good girl now and dont speak a word about this to gagini i wouldnt want him changing his mind its madness dillon anything might happen you could break your bloody neck for one thing would you listen to the language and you the decent girl he shook his head can you think of an alternative you have all the facts she sat there quiet for a moment then sighed when you come right down to it no its simple my love forget the chungking covenant and just think of ferguson never tell him this but i actually like the old sod and i wont stand by and see him go to hell if i can prevent it he leaned across and put a hand on hers and smiled that special smile nothing but warmth there and immense charm now then could you do with another cup of tea they came in over the sea palermo on the port side evening falling fast and already lights twinkled in the city there were a few cumulus clouds in a sky that was otherwise clear and a half moon they landed at punta raisi a few minutes later and lacey obeying orders from the tower taxied to a remote area at the far end of the airport where a number of private planes were parked the truck which had shown them the way drove off and lacey killed the engines there was a small man in a cloth cap and old flying jacket standing in front of the hangar and as dillon and hannah went down the steps he came forward chief inspector bernstein paolo gagini he held out his hand mr dillon its a real pleasure come this way we believe morgan landed at valdini two hours ago by the way his citation put down here a little while ago its over there being refueled but it isnt going anywhere tonight i saw the pilots leave the airport dillon turned as lacey and the copilot came down the ladder youd better come too they went into the hangar and gagini led them to a large glasswalled office here you are my friend everything i could think of there was a parachute a celeste silenced machine pistol a beretta pistol in a shoulder holster a walther and a bulletproof vest in dark blue and a pair of infrared night glasses everything but the kitchen sink lacey said are you going to war mr dillon you could say that theres a camouflaged suit for you over here gagini told him and some army jump boots i hope to god theyre the right size fine ill go and get changed dillon said if youll point me to the mens room he turned to hannah you fill in the flight lieutenant and his friend while im gone and he followed gagini out and at that same moment at valdini lucas mercedes sedan turned in through the gates in the wall and went up the gravel drive to park at the bottom of the steps leading up to the front door as the driver helped luca out the front door opened and morgan appeared and hurried down the steps don giovanni they embraced the old man said so you got it carlo against all the odds im proud of you i cant wait to see it come lets go in uncle morgan said and turned to the driver you stay here ill have them bring you something from the kitchen he helped luca up the steps and into the house asta came out of the living room and put her arms around luca at once and he kissed both her cheeks carl did it don giovanni isnt he clever dont listen to her morgan said she played more than her part this time believe me good you must tell me about it he led the way into the living room where ferguson sat by the log fire marco standing behind him uzi in hand so this is the redoubtable brigadier ferguson luca said leaning on his stick a great pleasure for you perhaps but not for me ferguson told him yes thats understandable luca eased himself down into a large chair opposite ferguson and held out his hand where is it carlo morgan took the document from his inside pocket unfolded it and passed it over the chungking covenant uncle luca read it slowly then looked up and laughed incredible isnt it he looked at ferguson think of the mischief ill be able to make with this brigadier actually id rather not ferguson told him come brigadier luca folded the covenant and put it in his inside pocket dont be a spoilsport youve lost and weve won i know you face an uncertain future but surely we can be civilized about it he smiled up at morgan a nice dinner and a bottle of wine carlo im sure we can make the brigadier a happier man dillon returned in the camouflage uniform and jump boots picked up the bulletproof vest and pulled it on he checked the walther and slipped it under the waistband at the back under the tunic then tried the celeste gagini had some large blowup photos on the table which he was showing to the two raf pilots and hannah whats this dillon asked pictures of the farmhouse at valdini taken from the air i got them from drug squad files would you anticipate any problems landing there dillon asked lacey not really that strip across the meadow is one hell of a length and that halfmoon will help good dillon turned to gagini what about a plane navajo chieftain waiting outside ready to go and a good pilot who knows what hes doing the best gagini spread his arms wide me dillon didnt i tell you i was in the air force before i transferred to intelligence work well thats convenient how long to get there with the navajos speed no more than fifteen minutes dillon nodded right i need half an hour on the ground understood gagini nodded ill come straight back here and join the others in the lear by the time were landing at valdini it should be just about right ill go and get the engines fired up dillon said to lacey ill leave you that beretta in the shoulder holster just in case he picked up the parachute now show me how to put this on lacey looked shocked you mean you dont know dont lets argue about it flight lieutenant just show me lacey helped him buckle the straps pulling them tight are you really sure about this just show me what to pull dillon said the ring there and dont mess about not at eight hundred feet the navajo has an airstair door just go down it fall off and pull on that ring straight away if you say so dillon picked up the celeste machine pistol and slung it across his chest and hung the night glasses around his neck he turned to hannah well are you going to kiss me goodbye get out of here dillon she said yes maam he gave her a mock salute turned and went out and across the tarmac to the navajo where gagini sat in the cockpit propellers turning dillon went up the steps and turned hannah had a last glimpse of him pulling up the airstair door and then the navajo moved away fifteen thenight sky was clear to the horizon and alive with stars and in the light of the half moon the countryside below was perfectly visible they were flying at two thousand feet along a deep valley mountains rising on either side and when dillon looked out of one of the windows he could see the white line of a road winding along the valley bottom it was all very quick gagini climbed to two and a half thousand to negotiate a kind of hump at the end of the valley and beyond was a great sloping plateau and he started down five minutes later he leveled off at eight hundred turned and called over his shoulder drop the airstair door its any minute now and i dont want to have to go round again it could alert them go when i tell you and good luck my friend dillon moved back to the door awkwardly because of the parachute he rotated the handle the door fell out into space the steps unfolded there was a roar of air and he held onto the fuselage buffeted by the wind and looked down and way over on his left was the farmhouse looking just like the photo now gagini cried dillon took two steps down holding the handrail and then allowed himself to fall headfirst turning over once in the planes slipstream pulling the ring of the rip cord at the same moment he looked up saw the plane climbing steeply over on his left the noise of the engine already fading in the dining room of the farmhouse they had just finished the first course of the dinner and marco acting as butler again was clearing them away when they heard the plane what in the hell is that morgan demanded and he got up and moved out on the terrace marco behind him the noise of the plane was fading over to the right asta came out at that moment are you worried about something the plane it seemed so low that for a wild moment i thought it might intend to land dillon she shook her head even he wouldnt be crazy enough to try that no of course not he smiled and they went back inside just a passing plane he said to luca and he turned to the brigadier and shrugged no cavalry riding to the rescue this time what a pity ferguson said yes isnt it well continue with the meal shall we ill be back in a moment he nodded to marco and went out into the hall with him what is it marco demanded i dont know that plane made no attempt to land but it was certainly low when it made its pass someone sniffing out the lay of the land perhaps marco suggested exactly then if someone was approaching by road they could let them know how the situation looked by radio marco shook his head no one could get within twenty miles of here by road without us being informed believe me yes perhaps im being overcautious but who have we got theres the caretaker guido i put him on the gate and the two shepherds the tognolis franco and vito theyve both killed for the society theyre good men get them out in the garden and you see to things i just want to be sure he laughed and put a hand on marcos shoulder its my sicilian half talking he returned to the dining room and marco went to the kitchen where he found rosa the caretakers wife busy at the stove and the tognoli brothers seated at one end of the table eating stew you can finish that later he said right now you get out into the garden just in case signore morgan was unhappy about the plane that passed over at your orders franco togloni said wiping his mouth with the back of a hand and he unslung from the back of his chair his lupara the sawedoff shotgun that was the traditional weapon of the mafia since time immemorial come on he told his brother weve got work to do and they went out marco picked up a glass of red wine that stood on the table youll have to serve the food yourself rosa he said emptied the glass at a single swallow then took a beretta from his shoulder holster and checked it as he went out the silence was extraordinary dillon felt no particular exhilaration it was a strange blackandwhite world in the moonlight rather like one of those dreams in which you dreamed you were flying and time seemed to stand still and then suddenly the ground was rushing up at him and he hit with a thump and rolled over in long meadow grass he lay there for a moment to get his breath then punched the quick release clip and stepped out of the parachute harness the farmhouse was two hundred yards to the left beyond an olive grove on a slight rise he started to run quite fast until he reached the grove got down in the shelter of trees on the other side and found himself approximately seventyfive yards from the crumbling white wall of the farmhouse he focused the night glasses on the gate which stood open and saw guido the caretaker at the gate straight away in cloth cap and shooting jacket a shotgun over his shoulder and yet he wasnt the problem what was was the large oldfashioned bell hanging above the gate rope dangling one pull on that and the whole place would be roused there was a break on the ground to his right a gully stretching toward the wall perhaps two feet deep he crawled along it cautiously and finally reached the wall the grass was long and overgrown at that point and he unslung the silenced celeste machine pistol and moved cautiously along the wall keeping to the grass but it petered out when he was still twenty yards away guido was smoking a cigarette his back to dillon looking up at the stars and dillon stood up and moved quickly out in the open now when he was ten yards away guido turned saw him at once his mouth opening in dismay he reached up for the bellrope and dillon fired a short burst that lifted him off his feet killing him instantly it was amazing how little noise the celeste had made but there was no time to lose dillon dragged guidos body into the shelter of the wall and dashed through the gate he immediately left the drive and moved into the shelter of the lush overgrown semitropical garden here too the grass badly needed cutting he moved cautiously through it between the olive trees toward the house quite suddenly it started to rain one of those sudden showers common to the region at that time of year and he crouched there aware of the terrace the open windows and the sound of voices marco on his way down the drive cursed as the rain started to fall pulled up his collar and continued to the gate it was apparent at once that guido wasnt there marco pulled out his beretta moved outside and saw the body lying at the foot of the wall he reached for the rope rang the bell furiously for a few moments then ran inside the gate someones here he called watch yourselves then he moved into the bushes crouching in the dining room there was immediate upheaval whats happening luca demanded the alarm bell morgan said somethings up well now who would have thought it ferguson said you shut your mouth morgan went to a bureau opened a drawer to reveal several handguns he selected a browning and handed asta a walther just in case he said and at that moment a shotgun blasted outside it was vito togloni who panicking made the mistake of calling to his brother franco where are you whats happening dillon fired a long burst in the direction of the voice vito gave a strangled cry and pitched out of the bushes on his face dillon crouched in the rain waiting and after a while heard a rustle in the bushes and francos voice low hey vito im here a second later he moved out of the bushes and paused under an olive tree dillon didnt hesitate driving him back against the tree with another burst from the celeste franco fell discharging his shotgun and lay very still dillon moved forward looking down at him and behind there was the click of a hammer going back marco said ive got you now you bastard put that thing down and turn around dillon laid the celeste on the ground and turned calmly ah so its you marco my old son i wondered where youd be hiding god knows how you got here but that doesnt matter now the only important thing is youre here and i get the pleasure of killing you myself he picked up francos shotgun with one hand and holstered the beretta then he called out its dillon signore morgan ive got him here have you now dillon said this is the lupara always used by mafia for a ritual killing yes i had heard that dillon said the only trouble is old son its only doublebarreled and it discharged when franco went down there was one single second when marco took in what he had said and realized it was true he dropped the shotgun his hand went inside his coat to the holstered beretta dillon said goodbye me old son his hand found the silenced walther in his waistband under the tunic at his back it swung up and he fired twice each bullet striking marco in the heart and driving him back dillon stood there looking down at him then he replaced the walther in his waistband reached down and picked up the celeste he took a step forward looking out through the bushes at the terrace then fired a long burst raking the wall beside the window its dillon he called im here morgan morgan in the drawing room stood by the dining table luca on one side asta on the other holding the walther in her hand dillon he called can you hear me dillon called back yes morgan went round the table and got ferguson by the collar on your feet he said or ill kill you now he pushed the brigadier around the table toward the open windows and the terrace listen to me dillon ive got your boss here ill blow his brains all over the room unless you do as i say after all hes what youve come for there was a marked silence only the rain falling and then incredibly dillon appeared coming up the steps to the terrace the celeste in his hands he reached the terrace himself and stood there the rain beating down now what he said morgan the muzzle of his browning against fergusons temple pulled him back stepbystep until he stood at the end of the table luca still sitting on one side of him asta on the other her right hand clutching the walther against her thigh dillon moved into the entrance a supremely menacing figure in the camouflaged uniform his hair plastered to his skull he spoke in irish and then smiled that means god bless all here morgan said dont make the wrong move now why would i dillon moved to one side of the table and nodded to asta is that a gun in your hand girl i hope you know how to use it i know she said and her eyes were like dark holes her face very pale then move to one side she hesitated and he said his voice harsh do it asta she stepped back and morgan said dont worry if he fires that thing he takes all of us and that includes the brigadier isnt that so dillon true dillon said i presume the overweight gentleman is your uncle giovanni luca it would include him too a great loss to this honoured society of yours there is a time for all things dillon the old man said im not afraid dillon nodded i respect that but youre living in the past capo youve been lord of life and death too long everything comes to an end sometime mr dillon luca said and there was a strange look in his eyes morgan said to hell with this put the machine pistol on the table dillon or ill spread fergusons brains over the cutlery i swear it dillon stood there holding the celeste comfortably and ferguson said i abhor bad language dear boy but you have my permission to shoot the fucking lot of them dillon smiled suddenly that deeply personal smile of total charm god save you brigadier but i came to take you home and i didnt intend in a coffin he moved to the table placed the celeste down and pushed it along to the end where it came to a halt in front of luca there was a kind of relief on morgans face and he pushed ferguson away from him so here we are dillon youre a remarkable man ill give you that oh dont flatter me old son marco morgan asked hes gone the way of all flesh plus two fellas in cloth caps i found prowling in the garden dillon smiled sure and i was forgetting the one at the gate that makes four morgan im nearly as good as that tailor in the fairy tale by the brothers grimm he boasted six at one blow but they were flies on the jam and bread you bastard morgan said im going to enjoy killing you dillon turned to asta are you taking all this in its fun isnt it right up your street she said talk all you want dillon youre finished not yet asta things to be said he smiled at morgan a strange one the girl here she looks like shes off page fiftytwo in vogue magazine but theres another side to her she likes the violence gets off on it shut your mouth asta said in a low voice and why should i do that girl especially if hes going to blow me away a few words only the condemned mans entitled to that morgan said youre talking yourself into the grave yes well thats waiting for all of us the one sure thing the only difference is how you get there now take your wife for instance a strange business that the browning seemed suddenly heavy in morgans hand it came down and he held it against his thigh what are you talking about dillon she died scuba diving off hydra in the aegean sea am i right an unfortunate accident thats right ferguson got a copy of the report compiled by the athens police there were you and your wife asta and a divemaster on board so she ran out of air and the police report indicates that was no accident the valve system in her equipment had been interfered with difficult to prove anything especially with a man as powerful as the great carl morgan so they put that report on file youre lying morgan said no ive seen the report now who would want to kill her hardly the divemaster so we can eliminate him we thought it was you and told asta as much but you said on the boat it was a filthy lie and seemed to mean it dillon shrugged that only seems to leave one person asta screamed you bastard dillon morgan stilled her with one raised hand thats nonsense it cant be all right so youre going to kill me so just answer one question the night of the dinner party the brakes were interfered with on our estate car now if that was you it would imply you wanted asta dead because you let her take a ride back to the lodge with us but thats nonsense morgan said id never do anything to harm asta it was an accident there was a silence and dillon turned to asta when she smiled it was the most terrible thing hed ever seen in his life you really are a clever one arent you she said and her hand came up with the walther you screwed up the braking system and yet you came with us he said oh i had every confidence in you dillon it seemed likely wed survive with you at the wheel but i knew youd blame carl and that would strengthen my position with you she turned to morgan it was all for you carl so i could find out every move they were likely to make and your mother ferguson said was that also for morgan my mother she stared at them a strangely blank look on her face and she turned to morgan again that was different she was in the way trying to take you away from me and she shouldnt have done that i saved her saved her from my father she smiled he interfered with our lives once too often she smiled again he liked fast women and he liked fast cars so i made sure he ran off the road in one morgan looked at her horror on his face asta what are you saying please carl you must understand i love you i always have no one else has ever loved you as i have just like you love me the look on her face was that of the truly mad and morgan seemed to come apart love you there was only one woman i loved and you killed her the browning swung up but already dillons hand was on the butt of the walther in his waistband at the rear he shot morgan twice in the heart morgan went down and luca reached for the celeste dillon turned his arm extended and shot him between the eyes and the capo went back over the chair in the same moment asta screamed no she shot dillon twice in the back driving him facedown across the table then she turned and ran out through the french windows dillon having difficulty breathing almost unconscious was aware of ferguson calling his name distress in his voice his hands found the edge of the table he levered himself up and lurched to the nearest chair he sat there gasping for breath then reached for the velcro tabs on the bulletproof waistcoat opened them and took it off when he examined it the two bullets she had fired were embedded in the material would you look at that now he said to ferguson thank god for modern technology dillon i thought id lost you here have a drink ferguson poured red wine into one of the glasses on the table i could do with one myself dillon took it down jesus thats better are you all right you old sod never better how in the hell did you get here gagini flew me in and i parachuted ferguson looked shocked i didnt know you could do that theres always a first time dillon reached for the bottle and poured another glass ferguson toasted him youre a remarkable man to be honest with you brigadier theres those who might think me a bit of a bloody genius but that could be a subject for debate what happened to the covenant ferguson went to luca dropped to one knee and felt in his inside pocket he stood up turned and unfolded the document the chungking covenant thats what it was all about and this is how it ends dillon said do you have a match and well burn the damn thing no i dont think so ferguson folded it carefully took out his wallet and put it inside i think well leave that to the prime minister you old bastard dillon said its a knighthood youre after so it is he got up lit a cigarette and went out to the terrace and ferguson joined him i wonder where she is i heard some sort of car leave when i was trying to revive you long gone brigadier dillon said there was a roar of engines overhead a dark shadow swooping down to the meadow good god whats that ferguson said hannah bernstein coming to pick up the pieces plus the good major gagini hes been more than helpful on this you owe him one i shant forget ferguson said hannah bernstein stood just inside the dining room gagini at her side and surveyed the scene oh my god she said a butchers shop do you have a problem with this chief inspector ferguson asked let me tell you what happened here which he did she took a deep breath when he was finished and on impulse went and kissed him on the cheek im glad to see you in one piece thanks to dillon yes she looked again at morgan and luca he doesnt take prisoners does he four more in the grounds my dear she shuddered and dillon came in through the french windows with gagini the italian stood looking down at luca and shook his head i never thought to see the day they wont believe hes gone in palermo you should put him in an open coffin in a shop window like they used to do with outlaws in the wild west dillon told him dillon for gods sake hannah said you think i was bad hannah dillon shrugged an animal this one who grew fat not only off gambling but on drugs and prostitution he was responsible for the corruption of thousands to hell with him and he turned and walked out at punta raisi it was raining as they waited in the office lacey looked in the door ready when you are gagini came through the hangar with them and walked across the apron strange how it all worked out brigadier i thought i was doing you a favor when i got in touch with you about the chungking covenant and in the end you do me the biggest favor of all you got rid of luca for me ah but that was dillons doing not mine dillon said sourly dont get too worked up major therell be someone to take his place by tomorrow morning true gagini said but some sort of victory he held out his hand thank you my friend anything i can ever do you only have to ask ill remember that dillon shook hands went up the steps into the lear and settled in one of the rear seats ferguson sat opposite him on the other side and hannah took the seat behind him they strapped themselves in and the engines turned over a few moments later they were moving along the runway and lifting into the air they climbed steadily until they reached thirty thousand and started to cruise hannah sat there face grave and dillon said belligerently whats wrong with you im tired its been a long day and i can still smell the cordite and the blood dillon is that so strange i dont like it she exploded suddenly my god you just killed six people six dillon doesnt that bother you what am i hearing he said some sort of fine interpretation on this the kind of morality that says let your enemy do it unto you but dont do it unto him all right so i dont know what i mean there was no doubt that she was genuinely upset dillon said then maybe youre in the wrong job id think about that if i were you and how do you see yourself as some sort of public executioner enough both of you ferguson opened the bar box took out a half bottle of scotch poured some into a plastic cup and handed it to her drink that its an order she took a deep breath and reached for it thank you sir ferguson poured a generous measure into another cup and passed it to dillon try that dillon nodded and drank deep and the brigadier poured himself one its the business were in chief inspector try to remember that of course if youre unhappy and wish to return to normal duty no sir she said that wont be necessary dillon reached for the bottle and poured another and ferguson said i wonder what happened to that wretched young woman god knows dillon said mad as a hatter ferguson said so much is obvious but that isnt our problem and he closed his eyes and lay back in the seat it was at about the same time that asta arrived at the gate of lucas villa she kept her hand on the horn and the guard appeared on the other side he took one look and hurriedly opened the gate and she drove through and up to the house when she got out of the station wagon the door opened at the top of the steps and lucas houseboy giorgio appeared signorina you are alone the capo and signore morgan come later she could have told him the truth yet for some reason hesitated and at the same time realized why if luca was still alive she could still use his power and she wanted that power yes she said the capo and signore morgan are staying at valdini on business you will get in touch with the chief pilot of the lear what is his name ruffolo signorina yes thats right find where he is and tell him to get out here as fast as possible and get in touch with our contact at the airport there is a lear from england there it may have already left but get all the information you can of course signorina he bowed ushering her into the house closed the door and went to the phone she went and poured herself a drink and stood sipping it staring out across the terrace and was surprised at how quickly giorgio returned ive found ruffolo he is on his way and you were right signorina the english lear has departed there were two pilots and three passengers she stared at him three are you sure yes a woman a stout ageing man and a small man with very fair hair our contact didnt get the names but saw them boarding i see good work giorgio call me when ruffolo gets here asta stripped and stood under a hot shower it was like a bad dream so difficult to believe that dillon was still alive carl her beloved carl and luca and it was all dillons fault how could she have ever liked him dillon and ferguson but especially dillon theyd ruined everything and for that they had to pay she got out of the shower toweled herself down then oiled her body thinking about it finally she pulled on a robe and started to comb her hair the phone rang when she lifted it up it was giorgio signorina captain ruffolo is here good ill be right down ruffolo was in an opennecked shirt blazer and slacks when she went in the sitting room he came to greet her kissing her hand forgive me signorina id gone out for a meal but giorgio managed to trace me how can i serve you please sit down she waved him to a chair went and started to open a bottle of bollinger champagne giorgio had left in an ice bucket youll take a glass captain my pleasure signorina his eyes fastened on the ripe curves of her young body and he sat up straight asta poured champagne into two crystal glasses and handed one to him this is a delicate matter captain the capo has given me a special task i am to go to england tomorrow but not officially if you understand me ruffolo sampled a little of the champagne excellent signorina what you mean is you would like to land in england illegally no trace that you are there am i right exactly captain there is no problem on this there is a private airfield in sussex we can use ive done this before there is so much traffic in the london approaches that if i go in from the sea at six hundred feet there is no trace is it london you wish to go to yes she said only thirty miles away by road no problem wonderful she said got up and went back to the champagne bucket the capo will be pleased now let me give you another glass of champagne sixteen it was just before six the following evening when the daimler was admitted through the security gates at downing street dillon ferguson and hannah bernstein sat in the back and when the chauffeur opened the door for them it was only ferguson and hannah who got out ferguson turned sorry about this but youll have to wait for us dillon i dont expect well be long i know dillon smiled i embarrass the man they went to the door where the duty policeman recognizing ferguson saluted it opened at once and they passed inside where an aide took their coats and fergusons malacca cane they followed him upstairs and along the corridor a second later and he was admitting them to the study where they found the prime minister sitting behind his desk working his way through a mass of papers he glanced up and sat back brigadier chief inspector do sit down thank you prime minister ferguson said and they pulled chairs forward the prime minister reached for a file and opened it ive read your report an absolutely firstclass job dillon seems to have acted with his usual rather ruthless efficiency yes prime minister on the other hand without him wed have lost you brigadier and i wouldnt have liked that at all a disaster for all of us wouldnt you agree chief inspector absolutely prime minister where is dillon now by the way waiting outside in my daimler prime minister ferguson told him i feel it the sensible thing to do considering dillons rather unusual background of course the prime minister nodded and then smiled which leaves us with the chungking covenant he took it from the file remarkable document it raises such infinite possibilities but as i said at the first meeting we had about this affair weve had enough trouble with hong kong were getting out and thats it which is why i told you to find the damn thing and burn it i rather thought youd like to do that yourself prime minister the prime minister smiled very thoughtful of you brigadier there was a fire burning brightly in the grate of the victorian fireplace he got up went to it and placed the document on top the edges curled in the heat then it burst into flame a moment later it was simply gray ash already dissolving the prime minister turned came round his desk id like to thank you both he shook hands with them and thank dillon for me brigadier i will prime minister and now you must excuse me im due at the house of commons an extra prime ministers question time we must let members have their moment of fun i understand prime minister ferguson said behind them by the usual mysterious alchemy the door opened and the aide reappeared to show them out it went well then dillon said as the daimler turned out through the security gates into whitehall you could say that he enjoyed the pleasure of putting the chungking covenant on the fire himself well that was nice for the man he did ask the brigadier to thank you dillon hannah said did he now dillon turned to ferguson who sat with his hands folded over the silver handle of his malacca cane you didnt mention that didnt want it to go to your head dear boy he opened the partition window cavendish square he sat back i thought wed all have a drink at my place oh jesus your honor dillon said its so kind of you to ask us the grand man like yourself stop playing the stage irishman dillon it doesnt suit you terribly sorry sir dillon was all public school english now but the fact is id take it as a real honor if you and the chief inspector would have a drink with me at my place he opened the partition window again change of venue driver make it stable mews as dillon closed the window ferguson sighed and said to hannah youll have to excuse him he used to be an actor you see the daimler turned into the cobbled yard of stable mews and stopped outside dillons cottage wait for us ferguson told his driver as the irishman unlocked the front door and hannah followed him in ferguson joined them closing the door this is really rather nice he said come in the sitting room dillon led the way in feeling for the switch and when the light came on asta morgan was sitting in the wingbacked chair by the fireplace she wore a jump suit in black crushed velvet and a black beret more important she held a walther in her lap a silencer screwed to the end of the barrel well this is nice here i was waiting for you dillon and i get all three her eyes glittered her face was very pale dark shadows under her eyes now dont be a silly girl ferguson told her oh but ive been a very clever girl brigadier im not even supposed to be in the country and when ive finished here my planes waiting on a quiet little airstrip in sussex to fly me out again what do you want asta dillon said turn round and lean on the table as i remember you favor a gun in the waistband at the back thats how you killed carl there was nothing there she checked his armpits no gun dillon thats rather careless weve been to downing street you see ferguson said most sophisticated alarm system in the world there try passing through the security gates with any kind of gun and all hell would break loose yes well you can bend over too ferguson did as he was told and when she was finished she turned to hannah empty your handbag on the floor hannah did as she was told and a compact gold lipstick wallet comb and car keys scattered on the floor see no gun the brigadier was telling the truth stand over there asta ordered and you move to the right brigadier dillon still had his back to her i thought id killed you back there at the farm dillon id like to know how i failed bulletproof vest he said theyre all the rage these days oh youre good with the oneliners she said but you ruined everything for me dillon took carl from me and for that you pay and what would you suggest dillon said easing his feet apart ever so slightly two in the stomach that should make you squirm hannah bernstein reached for a small greek statue that stood on the coffee table next to her and threw it at her asta ducked and fired wildly catching hannah in the left shoulder and knocking her back across the sofa dillon made his move but she turned the barrel of the walther pushing out toward him goodbye dillon behind her there was a click as charles ferguson turned the silver handle of his malacca cane to one side the nineinch poniard it contained flashed out and he plunged it into her back penetrating her heart the point emerging through the front of the jump suit she didnt even have time to cry out the walther falling from a nerveless hand and she lurched forward dillons hands catching each arm ferguson withdrew the poniard she glanced down at her chest in a kind of amazement looked at dillon once more as if she didnt believe what was happening and then her knees gave way and she went down rolling on her back dillon let her go and crossed to hannah who lay back against the sofa a hand to her shoulder blood oozing between her fingers he got his handkerchief out and put it in her hand hold this against it hard youll be all right i promise you he turned to find ferguson on the telephone yes professor henry bellamy for brigadier charles ferguson an emergency he stood there waiting the bloodstained poniard in his hand the cane on the floor henry charles here gunshot wound in the left shoulder chief inspector bernstein ill have dillon bring her round to the london clinic now ill see you later he put the phone down and turned right dillon into the daimler and round to the clinic fast bellamy will be there as soon as you are dillon helped hannah up and glanced at asta what about her quite dead but ill see to it now get moving he followed them along the hall opened the door and saw them into the daimler then he went back he had laid the poniard on the desk and now he picked it up took his handkerchief from his breast pocket and wiped the blade carefully he replaced it in the malacca cane stood looking down at her then picked up the phone and dialed a number a calm detached voice said yes ferguson i have a disposal for you absolutely top priority im at stable mews round the corner from cavendish square dillons place thats right ill wait for you twenty minutes brigadier ferguson replaced the receiver stepped over astas body went to dillons drinks cabinet and poured a scotch dillon was sitting in the corridor outside the operating theater an hour later when ferguson joined him how are things the brigadier said as he sat down well know soon bellamy said a simple extraction job he didnt anticipate any problems dillon lit a cigarette you moved fast back there brigadier i really thought i was on the way out well you werent what have you done about it called in the disposal unit i waited for them shell be processed through a certain crematorium in north london that we find rather useful six pounds of gray ash by tomorrow morning and as far as im concerned they can do what they like with it we wont tell the chief inspector until shes back on her feet i know dillon said that fine hassidic conscience of hers the theater door opened and bellamy emerged mask down they got up how is she ferguson demanded fine nice clean wound a week in the hospital thats all shell be on the mend in no time here she comes now a nurse pushed out hannah bernstein on a trolley her face was drawn and pale under a white skullcap the nurse paused for them to look down and hannahs eyelids flickered then opened dillon is that you as ever was girl dear im glad youre all right you are a bastard but for some strange reason i like you her eyes closed again take her away nurse bellamy said and turned to ferguson ill get off now charles see you tomorrow and he walked away ferguson put a hand on dillons shoulder i think we should go too dear boy its been a hell of a day i think a drink is in order now where shall we go ferguson said as the daimler pulled away dillon slid back the glass partition the embankment lambeth bridge end will do fine ferguson said any particular reason the night of the brazilian embassy ball asta morgan and i walked along the embankment in the rain i see ferguson said and sat back without another word ten minutes later the daimler pulled in by the bridge it was raining hard and dillon got out and walked to the parapet beside the river ferguson joined him a moment later holding an umbrella as i said she was as mad as a hatter not your problem dear boy dont worry brigadier just exorcising the ghost dillon took out a cigarette and lit it actually she can rot in hell as far as im concerned now lets go and get that drink and he turned and went back to the car
