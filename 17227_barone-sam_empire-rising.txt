sam barone empire rising prologue bce at the eastern edge of the great southern desert in mesopotamia head sagging his face inches above the heated rubble of rockhard dirt korthac struggled against the escarpment the long ascent had scraped the skin from his hands and knees and now every contact with the sunseared stones burned his fl esh as he struggled another step up the slope close your eyes just for a moment the inner voices grew more insistent seductive as another wave of dizziness swept over him rest let another lead the way clenching his teeth he crawled on fighting against the voices as much as the steep hillside and the pitiless sun korthac could not show weakness in front of his men the desert might kill him but it would not defeat him hed find water at the top and live clinging to the thought he dragged himself upward water most of all he fought against the need for water forced himself to ignore his swollen tongue and parched throat water korthac pictured streams of clear bubbling water nestled under shady sycamore and willow trees he forced the image from his thoughts and concentrated on wrenching himself up another arms length the vision and the voices kept returning he must find water or the desert would prevail over him claim him and all his followers that could not be the top of the ridge beckoned just a few paces above he moved with caution making sure his trembling legs did not betray him twice in the last hour korthac heard the death screams of men who had fallen back to the desert floor if he lost his grip started to slide back down he didnt know if he had the strength to stop his fall his thirst drove him on fortune had saved him and his minions time and again in the last two months but even the gods couldnt keep a man alive in the desert with no water he refused to believe his destiny meant for him to die like this hunted and herded into this barren wasteland like some wretched slave driven mad by thirst before the death gods claimed his body last night a few hours past sunset korthac and his men reached the base of the plateau theyd first glimpsed three days ago the remnants of his oncemighty army fell on their faces and slept until dawn when they awoke this morning two men could not get to their feet korthac ignored their pleading kill them hed given the same order almost every morning for the last two weeks those closest drew their knives and thrust them deep into the chests of the helpless men the rest needed no further urging they crowded around the two dying men and cut their victims to pieces every man shoving and pushing his way to seize a piece of moist flesh valued as much for its thirstquenching blood as for its nourishment when the gory ritual ended only the splintered bones their marrow sucked dry remained on the redsoaked sand even the skulls were cracked and the brains scooped out afterward fewer than eighty men started the climb up the sheer and treacherous slope korthac ate with the rest on his knees and pushing the bloody flesh into his mouth as fast as he could the act no longer shocked him or any of his men the strong fed upon the weak to gain sustenance for another day but even a freshkilled body didnt hold enough water to keep so many men going through the desert theyd had no water for three days not since a brief rainstorm sprinkled the sands and fi lled a few hollows in the rocks with its precious liquid if they didnt find water atop this plateau theyd all be dead by sunset his outstretched hand grabbed on to nothing and korthac realized hed reached the end of his climb pulling himself over the crest he rolled onto his back breathing hard oblivious of the blinding sun when he heard the scraping of those following he forced himself first to his knees then to his feet his men would not see him crawling about on the dirt shading his eyes he looked around the landscape had changed for the first time in weeks he saw the endless sands replaced by a stony mixture of earth and clay with scattered shrubs and bushes dotting the terrain to the east his eyes picked out what hed hoped to find a line of green about two miles away that could only be trees where trees grew water flowed the gods had favored him once again he would survive to find his destiny korthac turned back to the cliff s edge and in a hoarse voice called out the news to his men as he did so he looked down at the desert floor surprised at how distant it seemed theyd climbed more than two thousand feet to reach the top of this elevation hand on his knife he made sure the first four men to reach the crest still carried their burdens small sacks tied to their backs only then did he relax counting and appraising each of his fighters to see if any looked too weak to carry on but the sight of the distant tree line gave every man renewed vigor dirty crusted with blood and sand their skin burned nearly black from weeks under the unrelenting sun they looked more like demons than men when the last one reached the top korthac finished his count seventyfour men had survived the desert passage less than half the number who survived the battle and fled with their leader into the wasteland nothing could stop them now he led the way his men stumbling along behind him they headed east the same direction theyd run walked and crawled for the last two months halfway to the trees korthac caught sight of a village and changed his course as they reached the outskirts of the small cluster of mud huts the ground gave way to a barley field that offered its heady scent to the wind forcing a path through the waisthigh crops his eyes picked out the mudridged channel carrying water to the growing plants korthac lurched into a run his men staggering behind as best they could he reached the edge of the irrigation ditch and flung himself down to gulp mouthfuls of the muddy stream his men splashed about on either side crawling and pushing until they too shoved their faces into the water korthac drank until he needed to draw a breath then let his face fall again into the muddy water only when his stomach protested did he stop disgusted at showing such weakness korthac pushed himself to his feet noted the flow of the water and moved away from his men until he reached a part of the ditch still unsoiled by his followers he knelt and drank again but only a few mouthfuls able to restrain himself once more then he washed his face and hands and scooped the cool water over his body rinsing away most of the dirt and blood that had crusted over him for days when korthac stood up he felt refreshed even his hunger driven away by the fullness in his belly he and his men would take what they needed from the village and rest there until they regained their strength he walked down the line of the canal giving orders to his subcommanders getting everyone out of the water before some fool drank himself to death splashing through the ditch korthac walked toward the huts it seemed strange that no one had noticed their approach that no farmers worked the field just before he reached the first of the mud structures he heard a scream a piercing cry of agony that rose above a background of laughter the mixture of sounds close ahead passing into the village he counted the dozen or so scattered huts and tents likely less than fifty people all struggling to stay alive in this rocky place at the edge of the great desert the screams increased in intensity as they guided his steps in the center of the huts he found a crowd gathered their attention focused on something he could not see a young boy dancing with excitement noticed korthacs approach and gave a shout pointing with his arm everyone turned and korthac saw fear and surprise on their faces as they saw his grim followers walking into their midst hands on their weapons a babble of sound arose at the sight of the ragged band and the crowd parted korthac strode through until he reached the center and halted his men bunching up behind him five men lay on the ground staked out naked in the dirt two had died blood pooled around their necks their agony ended with slit throats half a dozen men and women knelt around the three who lived sticks rocks or knives in their hands korthac noticed that one captive a big man with dark hair and a grayflecked beard had only scrapes and bruises on his face and chest he would be the leader korthac decided saved for last so that he could watch his followers die and better appreciate his coming torment what is this place korthacs hoarse words silenced the crowd hed scarcely raised his voice but everyone recognized the authority in his tone what is this place one of the kneeling men stood and replied but korthac could make no sense of his gibberish korthac tried again using all the tongues he knew but with the same effect its called magabad korthac could barely comprehend the words and he glanced around to find the speaker to his surprise the words came from the bearded man spreadeagled on the ground the captives leader lifting his bloody sweatsoaked head from the ground the man struggled to meet korthacs eyes you understand the language of egypt a few words lord learned from men i commanded and you are korthac strained to discern the mans words my name is ariamus i was the mans voice broke and he couldnt get the words out korthac turned to his subcommanders cut that one loose with none of them understanding the foreign tongue the villagers stood speechless during this exchange but when korthacs men pushed forward and started to free ariamus the crowd protested with a jabber of incomprehensible sounds that meant nothing to korthac one of the farmers stepped in front of korthac raising his voice and gesturing anger showed on the villagers face as he waved his hands in excitement and the rest joined in to support their leader everyone shouting at the same time the knife flashed from korthacs belt and buried itself in the villagers stomach almost as quickly korthac withdrew it then pushed the man to the ground with his other hand the dying man clutched his belly and bled into the dirt his face showing as much surprise as pain korthacs fighters moved among the nowsilent crowd shoving them back with their hands the dozen or so adult men surrounded by their women and children had no chance against korthacs seventy even weakened by their ordeal in the arid wasteland the few knives his followers still possessed made the crowd step back none of korthacs men possessed a sword even he had discarded his fine blade weeks ago its weight magnified by the desert heat a handful of villagers turned and fled korthac frowned at the sight if they kept running they would get away his men had no stamina to pursue the subcommander finished cutting ariamus free then pushed him to his knees at korthacs feet water lord ariamus gasped lowering his forehead to the ground why should i give you water are you the leader of these captives yes lord please lord weve had no food or water since yesterday korthac thought of his own hunger and the harsh passage just completed you will serve me ariamus if i give you your life you and your men will swear to obey my commands his voice rang out over the village and korthac felt his power and purpose returning serve me faithfully or you die whatever you say lord just give me water korthac gazed at those surrounding him only fear or obedience showed on their faces the first of those in this new land to submit to his rule he turned to his subcommanders round up the villagers have them bring food and water he walked toward the largest of the nearby huts unable to resist the shady interior any longer and bring that one to me he pointed to ariamus still crouching in the dirt we have much to discuss fifteen days later the horror of the desert trek had almost faded from memory korthac had gained back much of the weight hed lost and almost all of his strength the bloody scabs on his hands and knees had closed then healed belted around his waist hung a wellmade bronze sword taken from one of the villagers who had in turn captured it from ariamus korthacs dark hair hung neatly around his shoulders trimmed and combed by one of the village women a slight man with the wiry muscles and the endurance of a runner korthac knew he had to stay fi t had to be stronger and more skillful with every weapon than the men he commanded they must fear his anger as much as they respected his cunning it must always be so the day after they reached the village korthac set up a regimen for himself each morning he trained with the wooden swords the sullen villagers carved for him and his men then he spent three hours with ariamus learning the main dialects of the land between the rivers as the inhabitants called the farmlands they occupied afterward korthac rode for two hours hardening his thighs and back as he forced the villages only horse up and down the steep and rocky hills until his mastery of the animal had returned while he rode his subcommanders kept ariamus busy they took charge of their newest recruit forcing him to learn the dialect of northern egypt their wooden swords served another function to make sure their pupil applied himself diligently when darkness approached korthac returned to his language lessons with ariamus they talked long into the night korthac learned not only the language and its nuances but also the customs and beliefs of the people in this new land this night an hour before sunset korthac relaxed on a small mat under a poplar tree his back leaning against the slim trunk six feet away ariamus sat crosslegged in the dirt two of korthacs men squatted a few paces behind ariamus korthac had learned much from ariamus far more than the man intended to reveal it hadnt taken long to discover his weaknesseshis lust for gold women and power but korthac trusted no one and so his men remained nearby he didnt want ariamus to have any sudden change of heart at least not until the man had given up every bit of useful information he possessed so ariamus tell me again about this great village of orak ive already told you everything i know lord my head aches trying to remember more to tell you he looked up at korthac noted the frown that had suddenly formed and quickly went on lord orak is about two hundred miles from this place across both the euphrates and the tigris rivers a few weeks ago they drove off a mighty barbarian horde now orak is the most powerful village in the land they say that soon all villages in the countryside will defer to orak and their leader this eskkar an ignorant barbarian lord a stupid lout driven out by his own kind no doubt for good reason he could barely speak our language when he came to orak and he drank his pay as soon as he earned it he was my least subcommander when i led oraks guard if it wasnt for his skill with a horse hed have been nothing more than a common soldier yet now you say he commands three thousand people in orak while you nearly died here in the dirt doesnt that seem strange to you ariamus squirmed and clenched his fist uncomfortable at being reminded how far hed fallen eskkar took a witch for a wife some slave girl from the south who belonged to one of oraks ruling families she bewitched him they say she rules orak through him korthac didnt believe in enchantments but most of his men did so he let the comment pass the superstitions of egypt had helped him there and whatever foolish beliefs held sway in this land would do the same did she also put a spell on the men of orak to turn them into warriors or perhaps these barbarians you feared so much were such puny fighters they let a village of farmers and shopkeepers defeat them the barbarians are ferocious fighters lord and none can stand against them but the villagers built a mud wall around orak and the barbarians could not overwhelm it the wall saved them not eskkar korthac noted the flush that came over ariamuss face at the mention of barbarians apparently wild tribes of nomadic horsemen from the distant steppes though korthac had coaxed the whole story out of him more than a week ago he kept probing ariamuss memory searching for more details or any hint of deception each retelling yielded some new fact for korthac to ponder once again ariamus related how a small raiding party of these wandering horsemen had ambushed him and his band of rogues killing most of them and seizing all their accumulated loot and horses ariamus and a handful of men managed to escape on foot driven to the west theyd run and walked for over a week until they reached this miserable collection of huts called magabad ariamus had taken over the village but he didnt have enough men and after two days of indignities the villagers rose up in the night they killed two of their oppressors as they slept and captured the rest to put them to the torture if korthac had arrived an hour later ariamus would have died under the knife along with all his men you say this eskkar was once one of these fierce barbarians so hated by the people of orak yet despite that though you say he did nothing oraks inhabitants made him their ruler your customs for selecting leaders are very different from those of egypt ariamus bit his lip at the sarcasm no doubt tempted to say something rash no lord not nothing eskkar can fight and he has some skill with a sword korthac wondered what other skills this eskkar possessed not that it mattered since you knew him so well describe him again ariamus let me see him through your words before i meet him putting down his empty wine cup ariamus licked his lips hes a common barbarian lord one of the horse people they tend to be taller and stronger than those of us who grew up in these lands riding a horse all day keeps any man fit and hard eskkar is taller even than most of his kind taller than me by at least a hands breadth and nearly as strong his egyptians considered the powerfully built ariamus tall so eskkar must be of considerable size which might make him a formidable fighter at least to these people go on show me his face ariamus closed his eyes for a moment he has straggly dark brown hair almost black that he usually forgets to tie back hides most of his face half the time brown eyes and hardly any beard a thin scar probably from a knife slants down his left cheek from just below the eye still has all his teeth or at least he did when i last saw him speaks slowly and with a strong accent i thought he was dullwitted when i first met him ariamus shrugged just an ordinary barbarian lord i still cant believe he survived the barbarians attack despite ariamuss dismissive words korthac knew better it took more than a sword to command and ordinary men dont rule mighty villages but now these barbarians are gone the fields are ravaged and bandits such as you roam the countryside korthac smiled at ariamus once the man learned his place ariamus would make an excellent servant more important his brutish skills and crude desires matched korthacs needs perfectly the time had come to tell the man of his role in korthacs plan you are an experienced fighter ariamus and i require one such as yourself who knows the land and its people you can help me and at the same time take your revenge on orak and you can earn much gold and a place of honor in my city korthac noted the gleam of interest that widened ariamuss eyes at the mention of gold then a puzzled look came over ariamuss face your city lord yes my city orak will be my city when i take charge of it my men are powerful and experienced soldiers they have fought many battles and survived passage through the great desert i intend first to rule this orak and then all these lands as i reigned over the cities and villages of egypt you will help me and as my servant you will have more power than youve ever dreamed of or have you already forgotten your oath to me ariamus glanced toward the two men standing nearby watching and listening in silence you do not have enough men to conquer orak do not underestimate my desert fighters they are the strongest of those who fought for me in egypt and each one of them is worth two or three of your kind even so orak has hundreds of men to defend it lord ariamus said shaking his head you do not have enough men no not yet but you will find them for me and you will command them such men will prefer to follow one of their own kind at least in the beginning that is why i need someone from this land who knows how to fight and how to lead men the treasure i carried across the desert will pay my new followers until all of oraks wealth is mine if this land is as troubled and unsettled as you claim we will soon have more than enough men in the desert korthacs followers had taken turns carrying the four sturdy bags containing amethyst cornelian jasper onyx quartz crystal emeralds and other sacred stones stolen from rich merchants or looted from the temples of the egyptian gods his men had thrown away their weapons their gold even their clothing but korthac refused to let them abandon the last part of the wealth hed captured they begged him to bury it but korthac killed one who refused the burden and after that they obeyed he knew it would be needed if they made it across the desert korthac recognized the doubt on ariamuss face dont think i will ride against the walls of orak like those ignorant barbarians no i will take orak from within one night of blood will establish my rule and you will help me what can i do lord ariamus leaned forward greed and the desire for revenge on orak struggling with his usual caution i mean lord how can i you can and will do as i command ariamus you will help me fulfi ll my destiny which is to rule this land if the village is as rich and prosperous as you claim its resources will supply me and my men with all that we need soon all the other villages up and down the two rivers will succumb to my will i will build a mighty empire starting with orak sufficient light remained for korthac to see the lingering doubt in the mans eyes he smiled at his newest follower and you ariamus you will have more wealth and power as my subcommander than you could ever attain on your own in my name you will command hundreds of fighters and enjoy the choicest women in orak and the surrounding countryside or are you not interested in what i offer i am interested lord ariamus said i will be your subcommander korthac smiled as he expected ariamuss greed had overcome any misgivings for wealth and power the man would do anything unlike most men korthac had no interest in gold and gemstones mere tools to bind men to him only power the power to rule everyone to command their lives or their deaths meant anything to korthac that destiny had guided him even before he grew to manhood and he would not turn away from it now tomorrow we will leave this place and begin our journey east well take a few villagers with us as slaves to carry food and water i will allow you and your men to kill the rest as revenge for capturing you besides its best that no one know from whence we came as we travel i will tell you how i will capture this orak korthac changed the subject with a wave of his hand but now tell me more about eskkar this wanderer turned mighty ruler i must learn the ways of my enemy lord ive told you everything i can remember i am sure you can remember much more ariamus or do you need some encouragement korthac smiled once again and leaned back against the tree take your time and start at the beginning tell me of when you came to orak what you did how you became captain of the guard korthac had heard the story several times already but each reiteration added some new insight some further detail that helped him better understand this land and its people he called out for ale all this miserable village could provide in the way of strong spirits a woman appeared with a jar and two wooden cups kneeling she filled his cup then did the same for ariamus before returning to the shadows he watched ariamus staring into his ale cup the man wanted to drink but hed learned his place and his manners in the last few weeks only after his new master had taken a sip would the man drink from his own cup korthac drank a mouthful of the bitter barley brew then waited until ariamus drank gulping loudly until he lowered his empty cup now ariamus tell me again of this barbarian and the slave girl who bewitched him they stand in my way our way now so tell me everything every little story you can remember about eskkar and his witchwife bcethe city of akkad orak on the eastern bank of the tigris river lord eskkar of akkad pulled down hard on the restive horse as impatient as its master to begin the longawaited campaign he had planned to be on his way soon after sunup instead a missing horse then a broken pack strap and finally two soldiers still befuddled from too much drinking the night before prevented the early departure at last his embarrassed subcommanders signaled their readiness eskkar gritted his teeth as he yanked on the halter turned the horse around and took the first steps to reclaim the countryside from roving bands of marauders a few cheers came from the small crowd of akkadians who bothered to watch his departure but most just stared in silence less than two months ago every one of them had praised his name to the gods acclaiming him ruler of akkad for saving their lives and their homes but already many chaffed at the very restrictions he established to protect them as he led his soldiers through the citys gates and out onto the plain eskkar knew that at this moment he cared more about getting out of akkad than pacifying the surrounding farmlands with each step away from the city he felt his responsibilities lessen and he longed to put his horse to the gallop that would have been unfair to the seventy soldiers only twenty of them mounted who marched behind him eskkar restrained both himself and the eager horse until he reached the first of the low hills about a mile away from akkad he turned his mount aside from the trail and urged the animal up the steepest part of the slope at the crest the horse snorted from the climb then restlessly pawed the earth as if to say it wanted to race across the soft grassland not scramble up rocky and slippery inclines eskkar first studied the ragged column of soldiers moving beneath him a small force for what needed to be done but all that could be spared to drive off the marauders and bandits who had plagued the land for almost a year thriving in the chaos caused by the barbarian invasion the dreaded alur meriki horsemen had passed on but turmoil and anarchy marked their passage throughout the land eskkar shifted his gaze to the river only a few hundred paces away the midmorning sun reflected off the slowmoving waters of the tigris giving the wide waterway a rare pale blue tint he took a deep breath filling his lungs with the clean air that blew across the water glad to be rid of the citysmell of too many men and animals living too close together eskkar looked back toward akkad nestling against the great curve of the river the tall wooden gates remained open and rising from one of the towers that guarded them a large banner floated in the breeze eskkar could just make out the stalking lion embroidered on it the lion spirit now protected the new city the city that had changed him from a mere soldier to captain of the guard to a fighting leader and nearly killed him in the process another horse scampered up to the hilltop and his bodyguard halted beside him do you miss it already captain grond used the old title for his commander akkad do i miss the stink and the noise or the whining and scheming no the place can fall to the ground for all i care but i havent gone a mile yet and already im worrying about trella lady trella will be well protected by the soldiers grond said patiently i suppose shell be safe enough for a month or so all this had been discussed many times in the last few days gatus eskkars second in command and the oldest of the soldiers doted on trella as if she were his own daughter offi cially gatus would command during eskkars absence but everyone knew the real ruler of akkad would be lady trella gatus busy as ever with the training of new recruits would do nothing without her approval nevertheless eskkar stared at the city with its hastily built walls that had withstood brutal attacks and still showed scars from the recent confl ict this very hilltop had served as a watching post for the fi ve thousand barbarians who laid siege to akkad for almost two months a few hundred paces behind him lay the remains of the besiegers camp he and his men would pass through it as they journeyed northward a tug on the halter and eskkars horse shifted to face northward hed seen the remnants of the onslaught still visible everywhere around him often enough in the last few weeks blackened circles of firesplit stones still contained scattered ashes marking the residue of hundreds of campfires animal bones lay everywhere moved and displaced by dogs birds and carrion eaters the scavengers had gorged themselves for many weeks on the battledead by now the easy pickings had disappeared the bones gnawed clean human and animal waste would provide less tasty tidbits for several more weeks or until the rains came the citys inhabitants had gathered anything of value weeks ago theyd searched through whatever the barbarians left behind looking for whatever they could use or sell more than a dozen large mounds marked the burial places of the enemy dead the common burial pits contained those who had survived the battles but died from their wounds or the dead deemed important enough to be carried back to the barbarian camp and interred in a mass grave before being covered over those barbarians who died assaulting the wall suffered the final indignityabandoned by their clan and dumped in the river by their enemies to be carried wherever by the whim of the gods assigned a bitter fate in the afterlife everyone knew that without a proper burial the spirits of the unburied dead would wander beneath the earth for eternity prey for the shades and demons who would live off their tormented souls how many years before all this disappears grond said before the grass covers everything his bodyguards question echoed eskkars own thoughts probably two maybe three years he said farmers will be unearthing debris longer than that you dont fight battles like that and not leave traces everywhere eskkar turned his gaze back toward the city his city he could make out the scars on the walls from the thousands of arrows launched against them even today almost two months after the barbarians had departed men still labored on akkads repairs so much had been destroyed but the city and its people had survived most of them eskkar remembered soberly many good and brave men had died in its defense he took comfort in knowing that the bodies of his soldiers had received the proper rites and their phantoms would not be condemned to wander in the darkness eskkar shook the black thoughts from his head better to think of the future than the past wed best be on our way grond half the days passed and weve a long way to travel they wheeled their horses away from akkad and rode down the slope the horses wanted to stretch their legs as much as their masters and the two men soon caught up to the rear of the soldiers once there however eskkar slowed his mount to ride behind the column instead of at its head as was the usual custom from the rear he could observe the men see how they marched even encourage them if need be one lesson eskkar had grasped very well in the last years training and fighting was that he needed his soldiers loyalty as much as their skill aware of his gaze the soldiers at the rear of the column straightened up and quickened their pace eskkar knew the new men thought him a legend the fierce warrior who had defeated the mighty alur meriki the more experienced veterans knew better they understood exactly how close theyd come to being overwhelmed by the barbarians these recent recruits needed to master the trade of soldiering theyd better learn quickly eskkar thought they might be fighting for their lives in a week or two what do you think of the men eskkar said glancing at his companion grond had been a slave in a distant land to the west before coming to akkad hed fought well during the siege and earned the rank of subcommander but now he filled the role of eskkars bodyguard and friend a big man nearly as tall as his captain grond stood even wider across the shoulders with massive arms that not too long ago had carried eskkar to safety as easily as one might carry a child in the last few months the former slave had saved eskkars life more than once grond took his time before replying theyll do i suppose but you should have brought more veterans captain seventy isnt going to be enough to reclaim a hundred and fifty miles of rough country not with almost half of the men newly trained eskkar didnt want to start that argument again especially when hed insisted enough seasoned men must stay behind to guard the walls and patrol the land to the south he didnt think the barbarian horde that attacked akkad would return but eskkar had too much respect for their fighting abilities and their hatred of defeat to take any chances all well be doing is chasing after stray bandits and looters grond its not as if well be facing hardened warriors in a pitched battle besides the recruits need battle experience and this is the best way to get it in addition to the soldiers the column included a dozen camp boys to act as servants to those who could afford to feed them five liverymen looked after the fifteen pack animals and the twenty horses and three younger sons from akkads leading merchants represented their fathers trading interests they would help reestablish local trade wherever possible akkads ruling council had also assigned two scribes to help eskkar they would record anything of interest and keep track of any goods or loot eskkar and his men might acquire he hadnt wanted to take the scribes but the elders had insisted how else they had asked could everything be accounted for eskkar had looked across the table at trella saw her nod her head and gave in now he wondered if he had enough soldiers it seemed such a small force to establish control of all the villages and farms north of akkad did you hear anything more about dilgarth grond said changing the subject another trader arrived just before sunset yesterday eskkar said he claimed he saw other wayfarers being robbed near the village there may be several bands of thieves attacking and robbing travelers on the road between here and dilgarth the small village of dilgarth lay more than forty miles north of akkad eskkar planned to pass through the place on their way to bisitun a much larger village that was his main destination he intended to sweep the land clear of bandits and marauders between akkad and bisitun to protect the hundreds of farmers and herders who produced the food that akkad and its busy traders depended upon well we should be able to finish off a handful of robbers easily enough grond said yes after fighting the barbarians a few bandits shouldnt present any problems eskkar said and once weve taken control of the land around bisitun the countryside should start settling down i hope they brew some decent ale in bisitun grond said im thirsty already they do eskkar said with a laugh just dont try and drink it all the soldiers made good time that first day the men glad to stretch their legs out of the city and into the fresh air that already bore a hint of the autumns coming coolness by the time they made their first camp eskkar relaxed enough to smile and joke with his men enjoying the freedom of the trail and putting all thoughts of akkad and its intrigues behind him in his heart he felt glad to be away free to be himself without worrying about what some merchant or tradesman would think about him for the last few months hed struggled with his changing role no longer merely a soldier defending the village eskkar now had to rule nearly three thousand people all of them demanding immediate attention to their particular problem nothing in his years of wandering had prepared him for such responsibility even with trellas help the weight of constant decisionmaking strained his patience unlike the preparation for the siege when he could just make military decisions now every conflicting claim seemed to require endless hours of discussion which invariably turned into arguing and complaining that left neither side satisfied eskkar had believed he could deal with his new position but in the last few weeks doubt had crept in and he found himself growing more and more irritable and shorttempered and that he realized made dealing with everyone even more difficult so he felt glad to put down that mantle even temporarily and deal with something familiarlike ridding the land of thieves and murderers out here in the countryside among his men he could be a soldier once again that satisfaction combined with the fresh air the roughcooked food and the tiredness from walking and riding all day let him enjoy a good nights sleep for the first time in weeks the next morning eskkar rose before dawn happy that his body remembered the old ways he demanded the soldiers be on their way an hour after sunup and threatened to leave anyone and anything behind that wasnt ready the men had scarcely enough time to eat a hasty meal care for the animals and pack their goods before the march resumed almost immediately complaints of sore feet and tired muscles rang out as they continued their way north still following the east bank of the great river tigris today eskkar ranged ahead of the main group accompanied by grond and six of his horsemen they rode more toward the east away from the river and into the countryside eskkar wanted to see for himself the devastation the barbarians had caused everywhere the scattered homes and fields lay barren the crops burned the grass had just started to return having first been burnt by the villagers to deny food and fodder to the approaching enemy and then the fresh growth overgrazed by the barbarian herds this winters harvest would be small still the farmers considered themselves fortunate at least theyd have a chance to get enough of the precious and carefully preserved seeds planted in time for next season as they rode farther to the northeast the farms grew smaller and more isolated and they encountered fewer people many fled at the sight of them others stood their ground hands clenched nervously on crude weapons or farm tools when they learned who eskkar was and that he meant them no harm they relaxed their vigilance from these farmers he learned that the small village of dilgarth now only a few dozen miles ahead had in fact been captured by bandits more than a week ago the tales of dilgarths plight grew worse and worse as eskkars band encountered more people wandering in the ravaged fields his face turned grim once again dispatching a rider to return to the main column and order them to speed up their pace eskkar and his men rode as hard as they could push the horses alternating between a fast walk and a canter toward the village of dilgarth the sun had moved well past noon when they rounded a bend in the river and saw the village less than a mile away while they rested their horses a party of armed men rode leisurely out of the village heading north looks like they knew we were coming grond commented should we give chase eskkar stretched upright on his horse counting the distant riders his lips moving silently twelve men had ridden out more than twice his own number and on fresh horses no well wait here until the rest of the men get here he could say that easily now without having to worry some might think him afraid to fight no one doubted his courage and it would make a better impression on dilgarths inhabitants if he entered with the whole troop it took another three hours before the rest of the soldiers arrived breathing hard and complaining of the quickened pace eskkar gave them no rest he entered the village at the head of his men an hour before sunset dilgarth was a small place with fewer than forty mudandreed houses none with a second story eskkar had visited it several times in the last few years tracking runaway slaves or thieves before the barbarians came more than a hundred and fifty people lived here all of those had fled their homes most going to akkad then known as orak though many passed across the river or continued south some of those original inhabitants might have already returned but most would have abandoned their homes for good eskkar understood dilgarths importance the last sizable resting place before akkad the fields surrounding dilgarth supported many crops with soil almost as fertile as that surrounding akkad perhaps as important dilgarths inhabitants had learned special skills in working with their principal harvest flax a plant grown not for food but for its thin durable fibers that could be woven into linen and other materials before the invasion the local farmers and villagers had selected the finest fibers and woven them into quality linen cloth the merchants in akkad wanted to know when the supply of linen would be restored the barbarian incursion had created a shortage of skilled craftsmen who could fashion linen into fine tunics dresses or skirts dilgarth had thrived for years before the barbarians swept through the land there was no reason it shouldnt be prosperous again as eskkar and his soldiers rode in less than a dozen men stood scattered about watching the visitors in silence as they filed into the village none greeted them those few that met eskkars eyes looked sullen or suspicious everyones clothing looked ragged and filthy covering bodies thin from lack of food many had bruises on their faces or bodies he didnt see any women or children eskkar rode down the narrow lane until he reached the tiny marketplace located at the rear of the village he saw no carts with goods for sale no cooking fires accompanied by the smell of roasting meat not even any dogs running loose to yap incessantly and nip at the heels of his mens horses once the dwellers of dilgarth had lived happy and content with their lives now its few inhabitants had little more than rags to cover their gaunt bodies those who possessed anything more had lost it either in the initial barbarian onslaught or to the departed bandits without some hope for the future these villagers might abandon their homes and take to the roads perhaps even head toward akkad his city needed tradesmen and craftsmen plus a steady supply of flax not more refugees he took all this in as his horse reached the village well he remained astride until his men horses and pack animals filled most of the square the villages center had barely enough room for all of them but they stood patiently waiting for his order that would give them leave to put down their burdens unbidden trellas words came into his mind as you won over the hearts of your soldiers you must win over those whom you seek to rule eskkar turned toward sisuthros his second in command standing in front of the men awaiting his orders sisuthros rest the men here until you fi nd places for them to sleep keep part of the square clear his eyes turned to grond gather all the villagers and bring them to me i want to hear whats happened to them since they returned to dilgarth dont alarm them just bring them his order to rest the soldiers rather than dismiss them for the night meant they could put down their burdens and sit on the ground but little else eskkar didnt want them wandering around poking into peoples houses frightening the villagers even further until he knew exactly what new calamity had taken place in dilgarth he swung down from the horse handing the halter to one of the camp boys as sisuthros began shouting orders some of the soldiers left the ranks taking the horses to the crude corral to water and feed them sisuthros gave further instructions and the majority of the soldiers along with their animals and supplies wedged themselves around the sides of the square leaving the center empty eskkar paced over to the rough stone well in the center of the marketplace and stood there waiting his mind tried to sort out what had gone on here except on the battlefield where he trusted his instincts he no longer made decisions in haste he had learned to use whatever time he had to think things through that included understanding what he wanted to accomplish and what words he would use to obtain his goal so he stood there imagining what had befallen the village using the time to prepare and anticipate what he would do after he heard their story by the time grond and a few soldiers fi nished searching the huts and rounding up all the inhabitants eskkar had his thoughts in hand grond escorted the last few stragglers into the market just as eskkar ended his count thirtysix people stood before him fourteen were men or older boys fit for manual labor many of the women shook with fear as they gazed at the crowd of soldiers surrounding them others had the look of hopelessness on their downcast faces eskkar noted the signs of repeated rape and beatings easily enough he didnt see any tears days or weeks of weeping had dried their eyes the women had reached the point where even death might look inviting who speaks for the village he asked keeping his voice calm silence greeted his words and he repeated the question those who speak for the village are all dead noble the words belonged to an old woman grayhaired and stooped from laboring in the fields almost invisible in the center of the crowd a little girl of three or four seasons clung fearfully to her hand are there any village elders then all dead as well noble her voice sounded weary without any emotion but her gaze met his without fear eskkar scanned the crowd but every face stayed downcast no one willing to say anything he felt his patience wearing thin but kept his temper as he walked toward them they shrank out of his way until he stood in front of the old woman and what is your name elder eskkar kept his voice low and his words polite i am called nisaba noble one as for these others they are all afraid to speak to you lest they be killed by the bandits when they return they said they would come back as soon as you are gone but youre not afraid nisaba they have already killed my two sons my life is finished and i am too old for their sport the most they can do is kill me no one is going to kill you nisaba i promise you that you are under my protection now he took her free hand and led her back to the well the child following along eyes wide and still holding fast to the old womans hand sit down elder he unslung his sword from his back then joined her on the ground sitting on the dirt in front of her and placing the scabbard flat across his knees do you know who i am she took her time answering him as she gathered what was left of her ragged dress about her you are the noble eskkar and for now the ruler of orak he couldnt resist a smile at her use of the words for now in the last few months he had often thought the same thing it is no longer called orak nisaba now it is the city of akkad orak akkad it makes no difference noble one it was called orak when i was a child and i see no need to change the names of things eskkar tugged at the thin beard on his chin trella had suggested the change of names from orak to akkad to help the people identify themselves with eskkar and a new beginning eskkar had warned her that the switch might not be as smooth out in the countryside as within akkads walls well elder well talk more of that later for now you are the elder of the village of dilgarth and you will speak for the village he lifted his eyes over her head to watch the reaction of the villagers is there any other that thinks he should be the village elder no one challenged his decision nisaba dilgarth is under the protection of the city of akkad and all here will obey the laws of akkad from now on eskkar raised his voice and addressed dilgarths inhabitants akkads soldiers will soon clear the land of bandits and you and your families will be safe in your shops and on your farms the trade of flax and other goods will resume with akkad and as before you will be fairly paid for your goods if you have complaints bring them to your village elder he nodded toward nisaba and she will present them to the soldiers stationed here or bring them to akkad if necessary i will make the final decision the customs of akkad will apply to all equally and nisaba and the soldiers will see that they are enforced fairly eskkar felt glad to have that formality over with though he doubted many understood what it really meant not that it mattered over the next few months everyone in dilgarth will soon appreciate the stability and security akkad could provide he returned his gaze to the new village elder now tell me about the bandits that rode off when we arrived the story came out slowly as eskkars commanders gathered close around their leader anxious to hear the tale the rest of the soldiers strained to hear nisabas soft words and for a long time the only other sound came from the occasional movement of one of the horses crowded together across the square two months ago the villagers began returning to dilgarth after the barbarian migration had moved on slipping back to their houses by ones and twos as they started to rebuild their homes and look to their crops and animals they had rejoiced when they heard that the invaders had been defeated and driven off from akkad and even more farmers and craftsmen had returned but a little less than two weeks ago while eskkar and his men remained locked behind their walls still afraid to venture forth until the barbarians moved out of striking distance from the city a band of about twenty bandits had ridden into dilgarth in the middle of the night forcing the small fence and killing any who opposed them by dawn they had taken what women they wanted and looted the village nisaba thought they might move on after a few days of pleasure but these raiders seemed content to have the villagers gather and prepare food for them while they enjoyed their wives and daughters the bandits remained in the village a few now and then riding out on small raiding parties looking to rob any farmers trying to work their lands or searching for any weak or isolated travelers on the road to akkad the intruders had been cunning enough to kill any who attempted to escape to akkad and so only rumors had reached the city of their activity though enough travelers had been robbed and attacked on the roads the bandits had commandeered all the local food while the villagers went hungry this morning a little after dawn a rider brought word of eskkars approach they had taken their time before riding off insolently waiting until the soldiers from akkad had been spotted less than a mile from the village when nisaba finished the crowd remained silent eskkar knew that everyone soldiers and villagers alike waited to see what he would do not two full days march from akkad and already he had a problem dilgarth was an insignificant place a mere way station on the road to akkad and no one soldier or villager would be surprised if he left it and its misery behind eskkar had urgent business farther north at bisitun and he could ill afford the time to scour the countryside looking for a small party of wellmounted and wellarmed bandits or to worry about the fate of a few pathetic villagers eventually the bandits would leave the area when they had exhausted its food or tired of its women or when eskkar established control of the land to the north so in a matter of days or weeks the problem here would be solved even if he did nothing nevertheless these villagers had now come under his protection if eskkar could not look after these wretched people by killing a few brigands then his own authority would be little better than any bandit leader but as long as he stayed here the bandits would not return and he could not remain here long nor could he leave behind enough men to protect dilgarth properly he would need all of his soldiers in the north if he rode on the bandits would return as soon as he had passed on without sufficient men and even more important without enough horses he couldnt chase after the bandits either besides eskkar didnt know how many men they had and he might soon find himself fighting a force equal to or greater than his twenty horsemen so he had a problem with no easy solution but one he needed to resolve and quickly eskkar looked at nisaba and he could almost see the same thoughts running through her mind elder i will think about this for a while you and the others must eat my men will share their food with you he looked at sisuthros seated a few steps away making sure his second in command understood the request then we will talk again nisaba he stood up and his men began to move he heard sisuthros give the orders to establish the camp post the sentries and feed the villagers leaders of ten assigned sleeping places to their men while others saw to the pack animals with all the activity underway eskkar entered the villages largest dwelling the home that the bandit leader had taken for his own headquarters inside eskkar found the floor covered with discarded bones and shreds of cooked and raw fl esh scattered among broken pots and furniture flies buzzed about feeding on the refuse one corner had served as a casual latrine blood smears covered one wall and the dirt fl oor in the far corner was crusted red either with wine or more blood an odor of something rotten hung in the air overpowering even the smell of urine ignoring it all eskkar found an upended stool picked it up and sat down facing the doorway he didnt look up when grond and two soldiers entered and began cleaning up the place one of the men had found a broom and the other carried a pail of clean sand to dump over the urinesoaked dirt they all worked quietly not wanting to disturb their leader by the time they finished sisuthros entered followed by one of the camp boys and two women from the village carrying platters with some dried meat bread and dates as well as a crude carved goblet containing wine the food and wine came from akkad the bandits had taken what little food remained in dilgarth when they left eskkar looked up as one of the women placed the food in front of him i want these bandits dead sisuthros theyre probably already gone captain sisuthros answered cautiously he had heard that tone of voice before and knew what it meant theyve no reason to hang around here the place is stripped bare there isnt even any more food to be had and the women he shrugged eskkars second in command was a sturdy young man of twentythree seasons seven seasons younger than his commander but he had fought his way through the long campaign against the alur meriki and had earned the mens respect more important sisuthros had a good head on his shoulders eskkar planned to leave him in charge when they reached their destination farther north the village of bisitun theyll be back eskkar said quietly therere still some vegetables in the fields and theyll want to take some villagers with them as slaves either to use or to sell before they abandon this place they left here only minutes before we arrived they didnt even take any of the women they seem to know our plans well enough sisuthros said they probably guessed we dont want to stay here we could leave enough men behind to protect the village at least for a while if we leave men behind well have to leave some horses as well grond argued and we dont have enough horses as it is a shortage of horseflesh had plagued eskkar even before the siege of akkad began nor do we know how many men to leave behind eskkar took a sip from the wine cup if we leave too few they could be overrun he shook his head no i dont want to waste time and men defending dilgarth i want these bandits dead when they return from the east why east captain grond asked why not north or south they cant cross the river here not without boats its too wide they cant enter akkad gatus would seize any force of wellmounted and armed men loaded with loot so they wont go south and were moving north so they wont like having a large force of men following behind them that leaves east the land that the barbarians stripped bare if theyre heading that way even for a few days theyll need to get as much food loot and slaves as they can carry neither man said anything which merely meant they didnt see any immediate fl aw in his logic eskkar had established certain rules of command and one of these insisted that his subcommanders speak up freely regarding his plans and ideas it was another of the many painful lessons eskkar learned in the last six monthsthat it was more important to get everyones ideas and comments out in the open rather than have to make all the decisions himself so that means theyre probably watching the place grond said theyll wait until we move on make certain were gone then come back take as many villagers food and whatever else they want and be off why couldnt they have taken what they wanted today sisuthros asked because they dont have enough horses for the slaves and goods themselves eskkar answered glad that he had asked himself the same question and they werent sure if we would chase after them or not if they were burdened with slaves and loot we could have caught up with them easily enough no theyll be back some fool even said as much to nisaba eskkar looked toward the doorway making certain the sentry stood in his place before continuing he didnt want any villager to overhear his words nevertheless he lowered his voice to almost a whisper this is what well do like all of eskkars plans it seemed simple enough and like most of his plans there was plenty that could go wrong sisuthros first tried to argue him out of it then offered to take his place but eskkar wouldnt hear of it i know what youre saying makes sense sisuthros eskkar said putting an end to the argument but ill be safe enough and this is something i want to take care of myself sisuthros made one more attempt before we left lady trella asked me to make sure you didnt take any unnecessary chances when he saw that even trellas name wasnt going to change his captains mind he changed his tactic at least keep grond here with you by the gods eskkar they may have more men than you in the old days eskkar would have raised his voice and demanded obedience now he made his voice firm and his words final if we do it right they wont be expecting trouble and ill have trained men who should easily be able to take care of a dozen or so bandits grond and sisuthros both started to protest but eskkar held up his hand enough arguing lets eat in peace eskkar went on then well select the men and work out the preparations when were ready ill speak to nisaba she and the villagers will have to play their part as well the two subcommanders looked at each other they had made their arguments and heard his decision now the task ahead of them was to make sure their captain succeeded they nodded their heads in resignation and each man started thinking about his part of the plan an hour after dawn the akkadians marched out of dilgarth the villagers stood around sullenly watching them go and waiting until the soldiers were well on their way before turning to their own tasks some of the men went down to the fi elds others to the river the women soon followed their men out of the ruined gate to kneel in the mud and repair the vital irrigation ditches that carried precious water from the river to the everthirsty crops a thin plume of smoke rose up from the smiths fire and the carpenters hammer rang out as another days work in the rebuilding of the village began like the bandits the soldiers had come and the soldiers had gone with no other option the villagers would attempt once again to get on with their lives the morning passed uneventfully noon arrived and the villagers trudged back to their homes to eat a meager meal and take a brief rest before returning to their labor at midafternoon despite the sun still high in the sky they began moving back to the village carrying their burdens or tools walking slowly heads downcast their exhausted stares fixed on the dust of the earth when the last of them passed inside the gate eskkar stepped back from the edge of the square from there he could just see the village entrance he returned to the village elders house and pushed open the door for most of the day he had stood guard over the house and its eighteen occupants mostly children or those too old or ill to work making sure only his soldiers had gone forth to the fields eskkar didnt want to take any chance the villagers would betray him either willingly or with a knife at their throat his men had kept track of the women they took with them into the fields only those nisaba vouched for were allowed to depart and then only in close contact with eskkars men the rest of dilgarths men dressed in soldiers garb had marched off with the rest of eskkars force in the morning the tallest soldier in the column wore eskkars tunic and sat astride the captains horse that soldier had ridden at the head of the column between grond and sisuthros as the akkadians departed the village and continued their northward journey if the bandits had left behind a spy he would report that eskkar personally led the column if the spy could count he could also declare that all of the soldiers went north at least eskkar hoped his departure would be reported that way meanwhile the soldiers would march north until they made camp at dusk then the twenty horsemen would turn about and begin retracing the journey back to the village with luck they would arrive before midnight though eskkar expected everything to be long over by then eskkar had stayed behind with ten men the only number he could match against the ablebodied men of dilgarth but he selected some of the finest fighters and archers in his troop all eager to prove themselves at eskkars side to show themselves worthy of the hawk clan in eskkars rise to power many of the old ways had fallen aside and many new customs created after one of his earliest battles eskkar established a new kind of clan a clan not of blood or place but one of fighting brotherhood since then every hawk clan member had sworn an oath of loyalty first to eskkar and then to each other in the subsequent fighting against the barbarians the hawk clan grew in number though many died in the final assault only those who had proven themselves in battle could be nominated for entrance to the hawk clan if accepted their past their homeland their old clan did not matter now men from the corners of the earth many once homeless and friendless had a clan of their own a new family where all stood equal in honor the hawk symbol grew into a mark of valor and prestige and any soldier worthy of his sword hungered to wear the hawk emblem though they numbered less than thirty these elite soldiers formed the backbone of eskkars subcommanders and bodyguards the core of fighting men who supported eskkars power each hawk clan member wore the emblem proudly on his left shoulder so that all could see the mark of bravery and distinction any of eskkars soldiers would jump at the chance to demonstrate his courage and worth and how better to do it than to fight at eskkars side five of the ten soldiers who stayed with eskkar belonged to the hawk clan the others hoped to earn that honor in any upcoming battle without any way to know if the village remained under the bandits scrutiny eskkar ordered the men back from the fields early he didnt want the bandits riding in while his few soldiers were scattered in the fields or heading back to the village to be killed or captured by ones and twos besides his men would need some time to rest to prepare their weapons and take their stations eskkar hoped that the bandits if they were watching wouldnt think the early return of any significance hamati the only other senior man in the group walked to his captains side hamati had stopped only long enough to take a deep drink of water at the well and to wash the mud and muck from his hands and face marduks curses on these farmers captain and their filthy way of life i havent worked so hard in years legend told that marduk ruler of the heavens and father of the gods had created the first farmer from river mud to till the soil farmers asked his blessing for their crops even while they swore at him for making farming such a difficult labor youre soft from too much easy living hamati eskkar said with a laugh not even a full day in the fields and youre complaining be grateful you dont have to do it each day did the women give you any trouble no but they kept looking over their shoulders toward the hills half of them wanted to run back to the village and the other half wanted to hide in the fields or along the river a few nervous women wouldnt arouse anyones suspicions after what dilgarth had been through it would be natural enough for them to keep their eyes out for bandits and robbers make sure your men are fed and ready hamati if i were the bandits id be here an hour or two before sunset that will give them enough time before dark to gather what they need and be gone or they might not come at all eskkar worried they could already be far away or be planning to come back in a few days or a weeks time he had tried to put himself in their place and hoped they would do what he would have done if he were wrong if they had moved on three days out of akkad and hed look like a fool in front of his men outsmarted by a few lazy bandits he resolutely put the thought away the afternoon sun promised several more hours of daylight if they didnt come today his horsemen would be back tonight and he could ride out and search for them tomorrow if hamati had any doubts of his own he didnt voice them instead he moved off to see to the other soldiers eskkar turned to find nisaba standing before him she like hamati was covered with dirt from the fields the women had rebuilt an irrigation ditch a few hundred paces from the village even in the best of times ditches needed constant repair as they channeled the lifegiving water to the growing crops what do you need elder nothing noble i have already offered prayers for your success in battle kill all of them noble avenge my sons eskkar smiled at her take the bravest women and keep them at work just beyond the village entrance elder the bandits might think it strange if they see no one outside the village at the first sign of trouble return to this house and bar the door as soon as the meaningless words left his lips he wanted to recall them if he and his men failed a wooden stick across a door wouldnt stop any bandit she bowed and left him he strode quickly through the tiny square making sure the men stood ready and that everyone understood the plan that earned him a disapproving look from hamati who had just performed the same rite nevertheless eskkar wanted to take no chances and his concern showed each man how important their orders were in his successes against the alur meriki eskkar had learned no detail was too small to leave to chance just as no order was too simple but that some fool would forget it in the excitement of battle only when he felt sure everyone was ready and in place did he go to his own station near the main entrance hed assigned the best archers to hamati while eskkar could shoot a fair shaft hed never managed to match the rapidfire pace of his best trained men better to help hold the entryway where his sword might prove useful once a crude gate had stood there more to keep tame animals in and wild creatures out at night but the bandits wanted nothing to impede a quick entrance or exit from the village so they knocked it down and used it as firewood after a few moments standing about eskkar realized he didnt have the patience to just wait there where he couldnt see much of anything swearing under his breath he returned to the elders house entered and climbed the wooden ladder to the roof mitrac the youngest of eskkars archers glanced up at his captains arrival the youth reclined on his elbow studying the approaches to the village a blanket under him and his bow and two quivers of arrows close at hand a long dagger almost as long as the short swords the soldiers carried rested on the blanket his powerful bow stretched a foot taller than any that the soldiers carried and mitracs arrows were not only three inches longer but slightly thickerall marked with a red streak near the feathered end the boys face looked even younger than his seasons and eskkar had to remind himself that no one who killed an enemy in battle could be considered a boy let alone someone who had killed as many as mitrac is something wrong captain mitrac said surprised at eskkars unexpected visit i thought you would be at the gate eskkar sat down at the roof s edge no mitrac i just want to see whats happening and i could see nothing from the gate looking out over the fl imsy palisade eskkar saw a halfdozen women working on one of the closest irrigation channels part of the embankment had collapsed either of its own accord or because some bandits had ridden their horses through the soft sides three women stood in the ditch in brown water reaching their knees as they scooped the mud from the channel back onto the embankment only one had a shovel the others used clay shards or even their hands to pick up the mud and pack it into place as eskkar watched nisaba came into view and stood at the edge of the ditch she would be trying to reassure the women and keep them at their task the village had to appear as normal as possible to the returning bandits the women are frightened captain mitrac offered they keep looking to the hills well theyve been raped and beaten enough times he turned to the young archer are you nervous as well mitrac no captain not as long as youre here where you go i can follow you always know what to do eskkar smiled at the boys trust mitrac and his bow had probably killed more barbarians than anyone else in akkad eskkar hoped the young mans confidence in his leader wouldnt prove misplaced lets hope our luck holds mitrac part of eskkars reputation consisted of his ability to anticipate his enemies luck had favored him more than once in the last few months trella had suggested the idea of trying to think like his enemies to put himself in their places and to anticipate their actions no doubt those efforts had helped the gods bestow their good fortune upon him and his followers now that eskkar thought about it his young wife had turned out to be the greatest piece of luck in his life the womens shrill cries turned his head back to the countryside to see the women fleeing toward the gate it took a moment before he spotted the band of horsemen the bandits were approaching more from the south than from the east where eskkar had anticipated they would appear he watched them ride toward the village at an easy canter cutting across the fields and angling toward the path that led to the village they would reach the trail in a few moments and then there would be only the last five hundred paces to the village entrance they rode in barbarian fashion shouting their war cries as they galloped intending to frighten and panic the villagers as much as possible eskkar stayed immobile only long enough to get an accurate count of the riders damn the gods i count eighteen of them good hunting mitrac without rising eskkar slipped back down the ladder and raced to the main entrance his ten men were going to be outnumbered today he would need all the luck the unpredictable gods could dispense eskkar reached the gate as the last of the women breathing hard stumbled back into the village then nisaba walked through still wiping her hands on her dress she nodded at him as she passed by letting him know that all the women had returned eskkar took up a bow and nodded to the two soldiers on the other side of the gate one of them had a bow in his hands an arrow already fitted to the string while the other man leaned against a low cart the sort farmers used to display fruits and vegetables in the market eskkar knelt down behind a similar cart his shoulder against the rough stakes of the palisade and peered through a crack between the logs he ducked back his head and fitted an arrow to his string the bandits were only moments away the rush of battle tingled his nerves and he felt his heart racing the way it always did before a fight shrilling a war cry the first rider burst through the gate at a canter a sword swinging easily in his hand eskkar stayed down counting the horses as they crossed into the village riders eased back their winded mounts slowing as they entered dilgarth they didnt expect any resistance and the womens panicky cries had already faded straggling behind the last horse finally passed through the opening at barely a trot its rider apparently more concerned with the animals halter than his surroundings as soon as the last rider moved past the gate eskkar rose up and drew his bow at the same moment he let fly the arrow at the mans back a great shout came from the rear of the village followed by the screams of frightened and wounded horses eskkars target was less than twenty paces away but the mans horse jumped at the noise making for a poor shot that struck the rider low in the back instead of squarely between the shoulders nevertheless at that range the shaft landed with enough force to knock the bandit off his horse the moment he loosed the missile eskkar turned and keeping the bow in his left hand pushed hard against the heavy cart that had concealed him and shoved it with all his might into the space between the palisade from the other side of the opening the second cart bumped up against his own blocking easy exit from the village two waisthigh carts didnt form much of a barricade a really good horse and rider might even jump the obstacle but eskkar was determined to give no bandit an opportunity to test his horsemanship by the time eskkar had strung another arrow to his bow the second archer had fired four times at the distant horsemen fitting and loosing shafts with a speed eskkar couldnt hope to match but hitting a moving twisting target was another matter dust swirled everywhere rising high into the lane at the rear of the village the surprised bandits had encountered hamati and six of his men as they entered the square the soldiers would continue pouring arrows into their confused targets as fast as they could eskkar knew the bandit leader would have only a moment to make his decision if he dismounted and urged his men forward to attack hamatis archers things would get very bloody but mounted warriors rarely wanted to fight on foot and attacking an unknown number of men standing behind a barricade of carts and tables wouldnt be too appealing a mass of panicked horses broke out of the dust and surged back toward the gate from the hoofbeats eskkar knew the bandit leader had decided to run not fight eskkar picked the man out hanging low over his animals neck shouting to his men and urging his beast back toward the village entrance mitrac standing exposed on the edge of the roof wreaked havoc with nearly each shaft he loosed only three riders remained on their horses as they charged back toward the main gate ignoring the other two eskkar aimed at the leader and fired his arrow into the mans horse an easy target even eskkar couldnt miss at such close range the animal screamed and twisted in its tracks before stumbling to a halt and its rider clinging to the wounded beasts neck couldnt hold on and tumbled to the ground a second bandit went down but the last rider put his horse directly at the carts and the animal leaped high into the air horse and rider cleared the carts and landed cleanly outside the fence then one of mitracs heavy arrows struck the man high in the shoulder and the bandit pitched from his mount at the same moment the animal landed stop that man eskkar shouted dont let him get away eskkar slid his own sword from its sheath the bandit leader had fallen hard but already hed climbed to his feet sword in his hand and started racing toward the gate the riderless horses all turned back at the sight of the carts the dumb beasts racing back the way theyd come for the moment the area in front of the gate stood empty eying the horse wandering a few paces outside the gate the bandit leader made a dash for the opening eskkar blocked the way put down your sword the bandit chief showed himself a true warrior and flung himself at eskkar with all the speed and force he could muster his sword striking at eskkars head trapped the man knew there might still be a chance to escape if he could get outside the village eskkars sword made from the finest bronze flashed up to parry the blow and the loud clank as the two blades clashed carried over the other battle noises in the same instant before the man could recover eskkar lowered his shoulder and thrust himself into the bandit leaders chest the two men met with a crash the bandit moving at a run had momentum behind him but eskkar was the bigger man and he put the force of his body behind his shoulder gasping as the air was knocked from his lungs the bandit went down and before he could get up one of the soldiers from the gate leapt upon him pinning his sword arm until eskkar could stomp his sandal on the blade just past the hilt the man let go of the useless weapon and grabbed for a knife at his belt but eskkar pushed the point of his sword against the mans neck he stopped moving though his eyes darted from eskkar to the sword before the prisoner could change his mind eskkars soldier ripped the prisoners knife from his belt then used its hilt to strike the man hard across his forehead that stunned the bandit for a few moments and before he could begin to resist the soldier cut free the mans sandal straps rolled the prisoner onto his stomach and started binding the prisoners wrists behind him eskkar kept the sword against the bandits neck until the mans hands were bound captain over here eskkar turned to see the other soldier whod helped defend the gate hed scrambled over the carts and had the wounded bandit on his feet the arrow still protruding from the mans shoulder that prisoner grimaced in pain either from the arrow or from the fact that the guard had twisted his other arm up behind his back and had a knife at the mans neck eskkar shoved one of the carts out of the way so that the two could enter hamati arrived bow in hand with an arrow to the string his step as assured as if he strode on akkads training ground he had a big grin on his broad face i saw him take that cut at you captain he said not many men could have parried that blow eskkar glanced down at the weapon still in his hand then raised it up to hamati a tiny gouge in the metal showed where the two blades had met but nothing of consequence though eskkar knew that a common sword might have shattered under the impact of such a ferocious blow trellas gift keeps me safe the great sword painstakingly cast from the strongest bronze by the best craftsmen in akkad had taken months to forge trella had ordered it cast especially for him and it had saved his life once before how did it go hamati eskkar asked as we expected as soon as they rode into the marketplace we put seven arrows into the horses that put them in a panic the poor beasts started rearing and twisting and two men were pitched right off their mounts my men just kept shooting each of us got off at least five arrows that took the fight out of them eskkar wasnt particularly adept at counting but some numbers came to him more easily than others horses men arrows these kinds of things he could count quickly enough thirtyfive arrows from hamati and his six men in about twelve or fifteen seconds in those same fifteen seconds mitrac standing on the rooftop had fired at least seven shafts since he was much faster than the others nearly fortyfive arrows loosed into a crowd of sixteen or so bandits since a few hadnt made it all the way into the square before the ambush started did we lose anyone hamati grunted in disgust one of the bandits finally got an arrow fitted to his bow and markas took a shaft in his arm but it was poorly drawn it didnt even go through the women are tending to him hell be fine in a few days fitting an arrow to a bow while trying to control a panicky horse at the same time sometimes meant you couldnt pull the shaft as far back as you wanted with the smaller bows the horsemen used that could result in a weakly launched shaft the bows eskkars men used were much larger more powerful weapons shooting a heavier arrow and were as useful for hunting game as men their weakness was that they were too big to be used from horseback that disadvantage didnt trouble eskkar since he didnt have many horses nor men who knew how to fight from them the bandit leader on the ground groaned and hamati kicked him casually in the ribs but not hard enough to break anything captain except for one bandit at the square who was knocked senseless when his horse was killed these two are the only ones left alive all the rest back there are dead or dying the other prisoner was shoved to the ground alongside the man eskkar had fought the wounded man gasped in pain at the impact the shank of the arrow still protruding from his back had brushed against the ground twisting the shaft inside his shoulder and no doubt sending a wave of pain through the man better pull that out of him eskkar ordered looking at the wound mitracs arrow had struck the mans right shoulder but looked low and deep enough to be fatal the man would likely die but might live long enough to answer some questions bring them both back to the square and well see what we can get out of them eskkar glanced up at the sun and realized it had scarcely moved the whole fight had lasted only moments hamati meanwhile stepped over to the injured prisoner before he realized what was coming hamati gripped the shaft and ripped it from the mans shoulder a piercing scream erupted from the wounded man then he fainted from the pain and shock eskkar returned to the square he counted nine carcasses several with multiple arrows protruding from breast and neck the rest of the animals some of them wounded their eyes still wide with fear and nervous from the smell of blood had been rounded up and pushed into the same rope corral that had contained the soldiers animals last night the stink of blood urine and feces rose up from both man and beast eskkar didnt mind the familiar smell he knew you had to be alive to notice it a horseman since hed grown old enough to sit astride one eskkar hated the thought of killing such fine horsefl esh but despite the familiar pang of sorrow at their deaths he knew that in battle you did what you had to do the men remembered their training to shoot fi rst at the horse when you shoot the horse even if its only wounded the animal panics and the rider cant control it when the horse goes down the rider is usually stunned or injured from the fall first you stop the charge then you kill the dismounted riders hamatis veterans had all fought in the siege of akkad and they had learned that lesson very well indeed tonight there would be plenty of fresh meat for everyone and eskkar had gained himself another eight or nine riding stock animals for his men the other sight wasnt as pleasant a woman blood spattered all over her face and arms sobbed as she knelt against the side of the elders house nisaba and another woman attended her their arms around her trying to give comfort the bandit captured in the square lay dead his throat slit by the stillshaking woman she had waited until hamatis men had bound the prisoner and gone off to chase after the loose horses blood still dripped from the mans eyes and nose as well as from his neck and chest eskkar guessed she stabbed the helpless man a dozen times before someone pulled her off him the victim must have done some injury either to her or to her kin eskkar couldnt do anything about it now he turned to hamati but the soldier after shaking his head in disgust at his mens carelessness had already given orders to guard the two remaining prisoners eskkar went to the well and brought up a fresh bucket of water drinking his fill and dumping the rest across his face once again he was surprised at how thirsty he became after a fight even one as brief as this that was the way of most battles he decideda sudden brief burst of activity with no time for thought or fear then he recalled the long battles for akkads walls those fights had seemed endless and every man had been completely exhausted when they ended he remembered men on their knees trying to catch their breath some with tears running down their faces suddenly unable to control their emotions or even to raise their arms eskkar shook off the gloomy vision refilled the bucket and drank again his thirst satisfied he went back inside the house picked up the same stool he had used last night and brought it back outside he sat down under a small tree barely large enough to provide a bit of shade hamatis men dragged the two prisoners in front of eskkar both of them were bleeding and covered with dust they were forced to their knees the hot sun directly in their faces no doubt they were even more thirsty than eskkar they had ridden a wide circle to return to dilgarth where they found death waiting for them instead of food and water what are your names eskkar asked sharply the wounded man answered immediately i am called utu noble his voice cracked as he spoke and he swayed a little from side to side loss of blood had drained the color from his face water noble can i have keep silent you dog of a coward his leader spat the words at him though his own voice croaked harshly as well before anyone could stop him the bandit leader threw his shoulder against utus body knocking him into the dirt and wrenching another long moan of pain from the wounded man who lay twitching in the dust this time hamati kicked the leader with force using the heel of his sandal once twice and a third time until the man let out a moan through clenched teeth bring utu into the house hamati and give him some water go easy with him keep the other here and keep him quiet eskkar stood picked up the stool and carried it back into the house inside the mud walls and roof provided some shelter from the heat of the day eskkar sat down again while hamati and one of his men carried utu inside then held a ladle of water to his lips eskkar studied the man while he drank his face had turned as white as unleavened bread and his wound still bled though not as rapidly as before the man had lost much blood and eskkar guessed he didnt have long to live utu finished the water and asked for more eskkar nodded then waited while the wounded man emptied a second ladle utu youre in pain and youll probably be dead within the hour i want you to tell me about your leader and what youve been doing for the last few weeks if you do you can have plenty of wine and water to comfort yourself if not you will be put to the torture i can even hand you over to the women outside and let them toy with you they wont be in such a rush this time a sob came from the man and tears ran from his eyes then im to die he whispered the words in a trembling voice you are dying utu the arrow struck deep and hard nothing can save you not even the gods only how you die is left for you to choose eskkar spoke with the certainty of one who had seen many die before then he waited saying nothing the dying man needed some time to grasp his plight it took utu only moments to decide wine noble for the pain untie his hands and put something under his head eskkar ordered he had done this many times before tell them the truth that they were dying or would be put to death it didnt matter which in that state of mind most wounded men would appreciate every comfort hamati untied the man then eased him down on the dirt floor with his head elevated by a folded blanket hamati brought over the last of the soldiers wine and held the wineskin to utus lips letting the man drink until he coughed and spat up some of the harsh liquid now tell me utu eskkar asked what is the name of your leader and how many others have been raiding the lands shulat noble his name is shulat utu coughed again but cleared his throat and swallowed hard he rolled his eyes toward hamati eskkar nodded again and hamati dribbled more wine into the mans mouth how many others utu eskkar repeated utu swallowed twice before he could speak and even then he could barely raise his voice above a whisper there is another band of men up north in bisitun many men there shulat is the brother of their leader ninazu he rules in bisitun utus voice gave out and he looked pitifully at hamati who gave him another mouthful of wine ninazu ninazu wanted to know about the lands to the south and shulat wanted to raid the farms so we came here a few weeks ago the man paused to take a labored breath and his eyes closed for a long moment give him more wine eskkar said while he used the time to think bisitun was a much larger village five or six days march farther north from dilgarth bisitun sat on the northern edge of the lands that bordered akkad right at the point where the tigris turned sharply north it marked the outlying boundary of the lands eskkar intended to bring under his rule he planned to leave sisuthros in charge of bisitun after they finished ridding the surrounding countryside of bandits and marauders with akkad and bisitun working together more than half of the best farmlands on this side of the tigris would be under eskkars control eskkars plan worked out with the elders in akkad depended on securing bisitun how many men does this ninazu have with him in bisitun the man whimpered but said nothing eskkar placed his hand on utus good shoulder and shook him gently knowing even a small movement would send a wave of pain through the man and keep him conscious how many men utu he spoke sharply to make sure his words penetrated utus weakening mind tell me or therell be no more wine utu rolled his eyes toward eskkar his face a mixture of fear and pain but the dying man wanted the wine wanted anything that would ease the pain and the fright of dying seventy or eighty maybe ninety i dont know maybe more his voice trailed off a little do they plan to stay there or will they ride on utus eyes closed again and he didnt answer eskkar looked at hamati and a few more drops of wine were carefully dripped into the mans mouth another spasm of coughing took utu and he choked on the wine it took time before his breathing slowed and he could speak again eskkar waited patiently utu do they plan to stay there or will they ride on eskkar had to lean close to hear the mans words ninazu plans to stay in bisitun he says the village is his now from there he rules over the land eskkar ground his teeth in anger another petty ruler had arisen with eighty or ninety determined and wellarmed men it would have been easy to take control of bisitun already devastated by the alur merikis passage once in power ninazus force would grow steadily each day as more and more desperate men joined him either out of a desire for loot or simply as a way to get something to eat again eskkar silently cursed the barbarians and their passage whatever they touched they left in chaos he had expected to find problems in and around bisitun but not a village full of fighting men who surpassed him in numbers eskkar had more questions but utus mind wandered now his voice weak as he struggled to breathe the vague answers came slower and slower blood seeped into the dirt underneath the man utus face looked even whiter than before and now a bluish tinge showed on his lips finally the only word eskkar could get out of him was wine hamati still holding the wineskin looked at eskkar who noted the nearly empty wineskin and shook his head no we may need the wine for the other one give him water he wont know the difference eskkar stood up picked up his stool and walked back outside the sun still shone bright in the late afternoon sky and he had to shade his eyes when he left the house the square bustled with activity drakis one of hamatis men sat on the ground next to the prisoner to make sure he stayed alive and to keep him quiet before eskkar could speak drakis began ive posted a guard by the main entrance captain and mitrac keeps watch from the roof indicating the house eskkar had just left the bodies are being loaded on a cart and will be dumped in the river the rest of the men are helping the women butcher the dead horses or gather firewood well have plenty of meat for the next few days as eskkar watched two soldiers lifted the last naked body and tossed it onto the cart theyd already stripped the dead of whatever clothing and valuables they possessed he moved farther away from the house and looked up to the roof mitrac he called out do you see anything the young archer stepped into view nothing captain the fields are empty not even any travelers on the road it would be too late in the day for the few travelers brave enough to venture forth good keep a sharp watch mitrac eskkar said he walked back to the shade of the tree put down the stool and sat his feet almost touching shulats body well shulat are you getting thirsty yet the man had a fresh bruise on his face no doubt a reminder from drakis to keep silent its time for us to talk about your brother ill tell you nothing eskkar im not afraid to die as i told utu your death is certain only how you die is to be decided hamati came out of the house carrying the wineskin in his hand and stood next to eskkar the other one is dead captain you see shulat your man utu is dead eskkar said at least he died full of wine to ease his pain are you going to tell me about your brother ill be avenged when my brother takes your head shulat spat the words at him as a curse he likes to kill soft farmers and tradesmen eskkar smiled at the mans words but detected the first hint of fear behind the bravado im a barbarian myself shulat and my soft villagers took your men easily enough so dont be so sure of your revenge eskkar turned to his second in command hamati this man needs to change his ways stake him out here in the square well let the women have some time with him looking up eskkar saw nisaba standing in the shadows watching him her women had already stripped utus corpse now the loaded cart stood there awaiting only shulats body nearby the rest of the women eager for the taste of meat moved about a little faster and worked swiftly to build cooking fires for the butchered horses eskkar walked over to nisabas side did you hear what i said yes noble her hands fingered a small leafshaped knife shed taken from one of the dead blood streaked the dull copper blade eskkar saw the gesture no knives nisaba and just his hands and feet for now do you understand working only on the mans hands and feet helped avoid an untimely demise yes noble i understand she looked toward the group of women then back at shulat shulat killed nitaris husband in front of her and her children then took her and there was enough nisaba eskkar cut her off no doubt the man had taken every woman in the village just you and two women to start with he is not to die only to feel pain can you do that yes noble her hand gripped tighter on the knife she held i mean it nisaba if one of your women gets carried away i dont want him to die yet you can have your revenge after he talks make sure they truly understand nisaba he walked over to hamati who supervised his men as they finished staking the prisoner theyd cut his garment off then spreadeagled him in the dirt with his arms and legs spread wide apart a hammer and some wood stakes had come from the blacksmiths stall and the men pounded four stakes deep into the ground to anchor the ropes that secured him eskkar stood over him make sure the ropes are tight hamati i dont want him moving around if the man could move even a little an accidental death might occur that reminded eskkar of something else and break his thumbs first eskkar had once seen a man staked out like shulat grab a womans hand and snap her wrist there was no sense taking any chances with the mans thumbs broken he couldnt grab anything keep a close watch on the women i dont want him to die yes captain hamati answered patiently he waited until his men had shulat securely fastened then knelt on shulats right wrist letting his knee pin the prisoners hand to the ground shulat clenched his fist tightly but another soldier added his own weight and together they forced apart shulats hand ignoring his curses and struggles it took some effort but hamati finally grasped the mans thumb a quick twist accompanied by a popping sound and the deed was done the pain forced a low moan from the man even as it weakened his resistance the other thumb went much easier eskkar looked down at shulat eskkar knew his own presence would give the man a reason to resist so he went back into the house and again climbed the ladder to the roof up there a slight breeze blew and the air seemed free of the scent of blood and urine that lingered below mitrac turned as eskkar arrived nothing to see captain are more bandits in the hills i dont think so but theres a large force at bisitun and i dont know what theyre up to i want to get back to our men as soon as possible he gazed out over the hills taking his time letting his eyes slowly traverse every point of the horizon then moving them back and forth over the intervening landscape eskkar knew well how to search the land for enemies everything looked peaceful he decided there was nothing more he could do his twenty horsemen would arrive later tonight and tomorrow theyd link up with sisuthros and the rest of the soldiers stay and watch until its too dark mitrac hopefully our men will return soon after mitrac nodded and eskkar went down the ladder one of dilgarths women had cleaned the room and the signs of utus passing had vanished reentering the square eskkar heard shulats first cry of pain two women worked on his feet each sitting on one of shulats legs the women held stones in each hand and they had started crushing his toes by smashing the rocks together nisaba knelt on shulats right wrist doing the same to the fingers of his hand eskkar noticed that her hands seemed as strong as those of the two younger women with all the small bones in his toes and fingers crushed or broken the pain from each subsequent blow would increase and soon the mans extremities would be shooting waves of pain throughout his body eskkar lingered only long enough to make sure the women didnt get carried away and that hamati kept his eyes on them eskkar left the square and walked back to the main gate one soldier stood guard there sitting on one of the carts bow across his lap and looking out through the gate toward the horizon all of his fighters looked tired enough theyd had little sleep last night as they prepared for the ambush then theyd worked in the fields during the day and finished with a hard fight in the afternoon it wouldnt take much distraction for them to relax or fall asleep at their posts nonetheless the guard seemed alert eskkar spoke to him reminding the man to remain vigilant eskkar knew the more time he spent with each man the more he showed his trust in each of them the more likely each soldier would do his duty properly even before eskkar returned to the square he heard shulats screams five other village women stood a few paces away just watching or perhaps waiting their turn the women had finished with shulats toes and fingers and had moved up to his knees and wrists they had fallen into a rhythm first one would smash at him with the stones then pause to let the waves of pain shoot through his body then the second woman would strike then the third then back to the first soon they would begin on his genitals and by then eskkar expected shulat to begin talking eskkar stood at the mans head and watched for a moment hed seen many men tortured five years ago in the days of his own banditry he might have been the one staked out and put to the torture eskkar nodded to hamati and walked a few steps away out of earshot of shulat hamati joined him hes a tough one captain but i think hell talk just dont let the women get carried away hell be hoping theyll kill him nisaba understands what you want shulat raped both of them and killed ones husband nisaba is keeping the women under control ill keep a close eye on them we both will eskkar said he walked back to the prisoner folded his arms and stood there he took no pleasure from the mans suffering it needed to be done the man had information eskkar needed and shulat would have to give it up the hard part would be separating the truth from the lies when he did begin to speak the man resisted as long as anyone could before he began to scream for mercy by then his hands feet and knees were broken swollen and oozing blood nisaba worked alone now kneeling between his spread legs cupping his testicles in her hand twice she had clenched her fist each time extracting a long scream of agony from her victim as he thrashed helplessly against his bonds now she looked toward hamati and eskkar and waited eskkar picked up the stool and sat down near shulats head are you ready to tell me about your brother before the man could answer eskkar went on would you like some wine shulat hamati already knelt on the other side the wineskin in his hands and he shook the vessel under the prisoners nose for a moment shulats eyes stayed wide with pain and hatred but they followed the wineskin as hamati withdrew it the wine will make the pain go away eskkar suggested gently it cant hurt to have some wine can it or should i tell the women to continue the mans eyes moved back and forth but he said nothing eskkar turned toward nisaba and nodded the womans hand clenched again another scream split the air as the mans body arched up off the ground twisting and trembling helplessly as it fought against the ropes eskkar let it go on waiting impassively for the man to break it didnt take long shulat began to shout that he would talk eskkar called out to nisaba and she opened her hand this time he saw blood on nisabas palm and fi ngers eskkar waited until the pain subsided and the man could speak again if you lie to me even once shulat youll suffer for a long time you will answer my questions instantly or there will be more pain do you understand yes yes wine give me wine hamati started to move the wineskin to the mans mouth but eskkar held him back remember this shulat if you lie or hesitate you will be very sorry hamati dribbled the wine slowly into the mans mouth eskkar let him have as much as he could take at this stage the wine would loosen his tongue even as it dulled his nerves when the man began to cough on the wine hamati lifted the wineskin away from shulats lips and he began to speak it took some time for eskkar to learn all he could only once did he find it necessary to turn to nisaba and for her to clench her fist again by then hamati had emptied the wineskin and shulat was barely conscious the wine combined with the pain and exhaustion had greatly weakened him and now he drifted in and out of consciousness i think thats all youre going to get captain hamati said as the two men took a few steps toward the house yes hes finished how much of it is true well find out soon enough eskkar was thoughtful his face grim darkness had fallen and the cooking fires were well under way the smell of roasting horsemeat overpowering even the scents of death with nothing left to do most of the soldiers and villagers still stood there fascinated watching shulat take the torture enjoying the spectacle no doubt wondering what they would do in his place what shall i do with him hamati asked eskkar looked back over his shoulder nisaba still knelt between the mans legs waiting permission to continue one of the women had lit a torch to provide more light for everyone nothing hamati eskkar took a deep breath and let it out just give him to the women theyve earned their revenge when theyre finished load him on the cart with the others and dump them in the river he walked away and entered the house then climbed the ladder to the roof mitrac had remained there though darkness made it difficult to see much of anything eskkar told him to go down and find something to eat as mitrac started down the first of another long string of shulats screams pierced the night as the women unleashed their fury on him alone on the roof eskkar sat there sword across his knees staring out toward the north and cleared his mind shulats words had given him plenty to worry about and he thought long and hard about what to do next eskkar had several courses of action to consider he could return to akkad to wait there until he gathered more men he could even stay here for a while and scout out the lands to the north and east or he could continue on to bisitun going to bisitun now would almost certainly mean a battle not just a few skirmishes chasing down some illequipped and poorly led bandits a fight for the village would cost men and he had too few of those already eskkars veteran bowmen had taken months to train a huge investment in time and effort and he didnt want to lose any of them certainly not without some surety of success but turning back would leave the inhabitants of bisitun at the mercy of their occupiers and for each day he delayed the stronger his enemys position would become it might take weeks or even a month to gather and train more men and by then bisitun might be beyond saving the consequences to akkad might be as serious without a pacified countryside producing crops and herds the citys growth might falter and construction of the great wall itself might be delayed or even halted that would bring ruin to trellas plans for most of his life eskkar had concerned himself with his own problems now he had to think and plan for a whole city even the entire countryside thousands of people would be affected by whatever he decided and the wrong choice might plunge the land back into chaos or open war as devastating to akkad as the alur meriki invasion eskkar didnt consider himself a quick thinker and trella had advised him to take his time to take into account all the possibilities now he had many choices and each choice led to yet more possibilities all of them carrying their own risk and benefit he went over them again and again weighing the consequences and considering all the things that might go wrong at last he made his decision with that settled he began planning working out in his head how the entire campaign would go only after finishing that did he know what he would need and how to proceed at last eskkar felt satisfi ed it might not be the best course of action but only time would answer that question he never wanted this kind of responsibility never dreamed that some day his decisions would affect so many peoples lives or even bring about their deaths nevertheless trella believed in him and he didnt want to disappoint her eskkar shook the dark thoughts from his mind right or wrong he would continue the course he had chosen he stood and stretched muscles grown stiff from inaction looking up at the starfilled sky the little glittering points of light that moved across the night sky had fascinated him as far back as he could remember his father had taught him the stars names and how to use them to travel at night the moon had risen shedding its own pale gleam on the land for the first time he noticed the silence of the night shulats screams had ended long ago no doubt the women of dilgarth regretted their revenge had ended so swiftly the bandits demise had been the first of this campaign eskkar knew there would be many more death cries in the next few weeks just how many would depend on the course of action hed chosen and so lady trella drakis said finishing up his report lord eskkar dispatched me on one of the captured horses back to akkad to tell you and gatus what took place trella shifted her body slightly in her chair as she listened to the soldiers tale the meeting had lasted for some time and her pregnancy had reached the stage where she felt uncomfortable if she sat too long into her seventh month she already looked forward to the childs birth her body kept distracting her with one thing or another making it more difficult to concentrate on the task at hand not that anyone in the room noticed trella had grown very skillful at keeping her emotions and thoughts under control in the middle of her fi fteenth season trellas fi gure would have been slender except for the coming child she was slightly above average height her hair was her best feature very dark and thick reaching just below her shoulders a thin silver headband held the tresses away from her face leaving cheeks and neck bare around her neck a loop of thin leather held a small gold coin hidden between her breasts a gift from eskkar for saving his life aside from the unadorned fillet and necklace she wore no other jewelry though akkads shopkeepers produced some of the finest bracelets rings and earrings sold on the river strangers tended to notice her eyes first deep brown and set wide apart which seemed to overlook nothing as if they stared directly into your mind hardened soldiers twice her age often got flustered in her presence not that her eyes revealed the power of her mind her father had trained her well teaching his precocious daughter to listen observe and think her sharp wits did the rest when anyone spoke she listened intently while she watched his face his hands the shuffling of his feet to better analyze his words she perceived much by noting not only what men said but how they said it and what they omitted few could hide the truth from her many men underestimated her abilities at first seeing only a young woman those who knew her did not trella possessed a presence of authority an aura of domination the barbarian clan eskkar had befriended called her a gifted one a term that designated a woman singled out by the gods even allowed to speak at the council fires in akkad many thought the goddess ishtar blessed her with special insight a fact continually reinforced by ishtars priest even as he took trellas gold others swore shed learned the art of witchcraft with the power to cast spells and control mens souls trella smiled at all these ideas and did nothing to dispel any of them rather she used each to her advantage and you are planning to return to my husband immediately drakis yes lady trella as soon as i gather the supplies he requested i must rejoin him before he reaches bisitun gatus leaned forward across the table how many men did he leave behind in dilgarth seated at trellas right gatus the new captain of the guard commanded the garrison soldiers in eskkars absence an old man already past his fiftieth season gatus had trained nearly every soldier in akkad he said he would leave three men drakis replied the wounded man plus two others lord eskkar asked that you send more soldiers to dilgarth as soon as you can as well as craftsmen and whatever else you think best to help rebuild the village and he didnt say why gatus went on he wanted the ropes and oil no drakis answered he just told me to bring ten coils of rope and as much of the black oil as i could carry on one spare horse plus my mount i hope hes not planning on burning bisitun to the ground corio one of the noble families that helped rule akkad said the words only half in jest trella turned to her left each day at least one of the citys ruling families sat with gatus and trella to review any important matters today corio represented the nobles at the council akkad now possessed seven such families and the council room had scarcely enough space to hold all of them though they rarely came together as a group a skilled artisan corio had designed and built akkads wall the wall that enabled eskkar and his soldiers to defeat the barbarians undertaking that task had changed his status and brought him into the noble families trella knew that many in akkad especially those critics unhappy with eskkar regarded corio and his wall as the real saviors of the city im sure thats not his intention trella said smiling at corios words if it were he would have said so corio nodded agreement those who worked closely with eskkar knew he was not a subtle man and the oil will have to go in wineskins corio added its too easy to break pots on horseback even if theyre well wrapped i dont like this at all gatus shook his head as he spoke there could be more men in bisitun than eskkar has with him and this time theyll be the ones behind a stockade maybe we should tell him to come back to akkad bisitun can wait until we have more men eskkar knows the situation gatus trella said calmly though she didnt like it either they had expected that eskkar would encounter small isolated bands of robbers and thieves bandits who would flee before an organized force of fighting men no one had foreseen a village full of armed men still trella had learned not to question her husbands decisions on military issues eskkar had been fighting one battle or another for most of his thirtyodd seasons and he often saw things on the battlefield that another man would miss and something told him he would need ropes and oil at bisitun that meant he thought he could capture bisitun without too much loss of life drakis trella began you say that after shulat revealed his information eskkar remained on the roof for over an hour yes lady trella night had fallen and the horseflesh was well cooked before he came down to join us after he finished his meal he gave me my instructions and told me to leave at dawn one lesson eskkar had learned well was the need to think and work out his campaigns in advance trella knew that if eskkar thought about bisitun that long then he must have come up with a plan and he would have weighed all the alternatives she sighed to herself and shifted her weight once again short of an urgent plea to return eskkar would do whatever he decided he would take too many chances but that was the man he was you will see to drakiss needs gatus if the man left at first light tomorrow trella reasoned and the horses held up drakis would rejoin eskkar just as he reached bisitun yes lady trella gatus softened his gruff tone whenever he spoke to trella ill make sure he has the two best horses left in akkad and an extra man or two for dilgarth and i think ill send another man with drakis to make sure he doesnt fall off his horse or wander off somewhere and get drunk everyone smiled at the jest a member of the hawk clan drakis had proved himself steadier than most make sure you carry plenty of food with you drakis trella said but tonight you will eat and sleep at our house you need to rest youll be riding hard for at least four days she knew the words werent needed that the man would do his duty regardless but the effect achieved all she could wish the thought that the leader of akkad worried about his dinner and sleeping arrangements brought an embarrassed flush to drakiss face he stood up and bowed thank you lady trella i will be honored he bowed again this time to gatus and left the room trella gatus and corio remained seated at the table in what had come to be called the council house a goodsized onelevel dwelling located only a few dozen paces from akkads marketplace eskkar and the noble families met in the council house to govern the fast growing city and manage its affairs the structure contained only two large rooms an inner chamber where the leaders met and an outer room that functioned as a waiting area for those with council business three clerks worked there to keep a record of what the council decided and to keep track of those seeking to speak with the council two guards kept wary eyes on every visitor and made sure no one brought a weapon into the inner room two other hawk clan soldiers trellas usual guard waited there as well another soldier stood watch outside the house trella leaned back in her chair as she felt the child within her moving about at least the business of the day had nearly finished how are the plans for the new wall corio are you any closer to completing your design trella knew he had been meeting every day for over a month with all the master builders and artisans in akkad corio stood then moved around to the other side of the table so he could face them more easily a tall man with large hands he preferred to talk while standing we argued all day and into the night about it until there was no more oil for the lamps he shook his head as he remembered no one is really satisfied but based on what everyone needs and how much akkad is expected to grow in the next few seasons we finally agreed to begin and where will this new great wall be placed gatus asked his voice already rising in addition to providing soldiers to maintain order during the building process he would have to develop and train additional men to defend the expanded city in the event of another attack corio shook his head ruefully you wont like it gatus the new east wall will be eight hundred paces from the present one the north and west walls will remain as they are but the south wall will also need to be shifted the area enclosed by the extended walls will be more than three times greater than what akkad is today and how long will it take to build this wonderful new wall trella will be a grandmother before its finished ill wager trella smiled at the old soldiers words he thought of her almost as a daughter and considered himself one of the few in akkad that didnt need to use a title when he spoke to her though in formal occasions he still addressed her properly the new walls will be thirtyfive feet high corio said but ten of those will be belowground with the many towers that you and eskkar have demanded it will take at least three years to build the value of towers that projected above and over the wall was no longer questionedthey had learned that lesson the hard way during the alur meriki siege trella showed no surprise though privately she thought it would take closer to five years to complete shed attended many of the discussions and knew that akkads need for new space would be great it would be a huge project and take many years and she worried more about where the gold soldiers and laborers would come from with the new wall in place akkad would be the greatest and strongest city in the world and her child would be safe within its mighty walls gatus slapped his hand on the table in disgust three years thats if we can find soldiers and workers aplenty to work on it more likely twice that if you ask me i doubt ill live long enough to see it built trella placed her hand on top of his and smiled you will see it gatus as will all of us corio will build a great city for us we must be patient she held him in as much respect as the soldiers did though for a different reason the soldiers honored his experience and his years not many fighting men survived past their fortieth season for trella gatus had proven his loyalty to her and eskkar more than once she turned to corio i am glad all of you have agreed on what is needed as always you have done well master builder she stood grateful for the chance to ease her back and already looking forward to returning home a shadow crossed the open doorway and one of the attending scribes appeared a young man with the sallow face of one who rarely saw the sun he had a thin beard and a highpitched voice lady trella captain gatus there is one more waiting to see you a stranger from the far west the messenger from noble eskkar was brought in ahead of him shall i tell him to return tomorrow trella felt tempted to do exactly that but the far west meant the stranger came from the land beyond the other great river they seldom met travelers from the region west of the euphrates she saw the same curiosity on corios face and changed her mind no we will see him now please send him in by the time she and corio had taken their seats again the stranger stood before them trella guessed that he neared his thirtieth year though his smooth unblemished face made him seem younger not much taller than her own height the man had a slight build though he seemed sturdy enough his garments appeared worn but well made his features smooth and even except for his gray eyes and darker complexion nothing distinguished him from any local trader he bowed politely turning to face each of them as he did so i thank you for receiving me captain gatus korthac spoke softly with a pleasant voice and even though he had a strong accent his meaning was clear my name is korthac i realize it is late in the day and i saw that noble eskkars messenger was unexpected i can return tomorrow if you wish gatus turned toward trella but she gave no sign just studied the stranger the old soldier nodded formally at the visitor no we can speak now and there is no need to stand gatus waited until korthac took a seat facing them across the table this is corio our master artisan and this is lady trella the wife of eskkar our ruler you say youre from the lands west of the euphrates yes captain from beyond the great desert i arrived yesterday with a small caravan i am a trader and i would like to establish a house here in orak i mean akkad he smiled at his mistake everyone seemed to have trouble getting used to the citys new name what kind of trader corio leaned forward on the table the question was more than just idle curiosity every trader had his own contacts and trade secrets and if this man truly came from across the desert he might bring new trading links to the city noble corio i deal in gemstones and other small items that can be traded profitably i plan to bring such goods across the great desert and trade in emeralds onyx rose quartz peridot amethyst and glass beads to make a profit over such a great distance the items traded must be small and easily carried as im sure you understand jewelry made from beads of glass is very rare here corio mused they are much prized for their beauty and healing properties and peridot is in short supply as well since it has the power to dissolve enchantments then perhaps i shall do well in akkad korthac said politely his smile showing white and even teeth if noble i am permitted to open a house of my own there is a tax that must be paid before you can establish a trading house corio said glancing at trella before answering you understand korthac we have just defeated a barbarian invasion and at great cost to all of us i might add newcomers must pay to do business under akkads protection there are other taxes and rules as well a frown passed briefly across korthacs face i hope that such fees will not be too great nobles i have had to struggle across a great distance and my own expenses have been high trella cut in smoothly perhaps you can tell us a little about the lands to the west what are they like are there many people there once you get across the great desert to the land called egypt there are many villages and great numbers of people korthac answered villages as great as akkad gatus had more than a hint of doubt in his voice distant lands are always magical or mighty it seems but i traveled widely in my younger days and never encountered a city with as many people as akkad oh no none so great as akkad korthac said akkad is a mighty please forgive me korthac trella interrupted but you may speak plainly here she knew a visitor would be expected to praise akkad to the skies to flatter its rulers and important citizens we wish to hear the truth about the lands to the west those few who come to us from afar are mainly lost men or desert wanderers who understand little about the ways of village and farm such as those can tell us little korthac looked at trella carefully before continuing in truth lady trella egypt is a vast and fertile land of many villages some of them larger than akkad egypt has much gold and silver as well as great fl ocks of cattle and other beasts the numbers of its people are beyond counting do these villages have walls around them corio sounded unconvinced many do noble corio the stranger answered calmly not all but some have raised walls such as yours for protection to keep out bandits or invaders akkad is the first village in these lands to build a fortified wall to protect itself corio added a hint of skepticism showing through a strong wall is not such an easy thing to raise i can only tell you what i have seen noble corio korthac said raising his hands slightly in deference lady trella asked me to speak the truth and i have done so then we should thank you for your honesty korthac trella said again speaking before corio could reply but now it grows late and the council still has some business to attend to would you be able to call upon us tomorrow say at the hour before noon then we will have time to speak with you at leisure and you can tell us much more about what you have seen in your travels and this land called egypt korthac took the dismissal gracefully he stood and bowed respectfully of course lady trella i understand i will return at that hour trella had risen when he did and she bowed as well giving korthac a pleasant smile as he left the room she waited until he stepped out of earshot before she turned to corio and gatus this stranger took a great chance crossing the desert with such valuable trade goods with only the hope of establishing a house here in akkad whatever his reasons corio answered he is here and with his goods every merchant adds to the wealth of akkad let him establish his trading house if he can pay his tax of twenty gold coins no corio trella said firmly i think not tomorrow we will tell him that he must pay forty gold coins if he is to do business here ishtars eyes trella gatus swore mantar wailed for days when he had to pay twenty he claimed he would be reduced to begging in the streets and that only a month ago still mantar paid the tax trella said and remember korthac is a stranger mantar lived here all his life mantar dealt in livestock mostly goats and sheep that supplied milk and cheese he had complained bitterly about the amount of the tax but he had been one of those who fled the city before the barbarians arrived and now had to pay to reestablish himself trella had no sympathy for those who had refused to defend akkad and i doubt korthac will cry as loud as mantar did trella said i think it is important to learn as much about korthac as possible she turned to gatus how many men were in his caravan how many slaves how many animals what kind of people did he bring with him find out where he is staying and talk to the innkeeper let us all see what we can find out and well meet here tomorrow at midmorning we can speak about this before we see korthac again i will make sure nicar is here as well he sees much in men that we may miss the noble nicar had led the city before the invasion and had entrusted the citys defense to eskkar nicar had also given eskkar a slave girl named trella what is it about korthac that worries you lady trella corio sounded surprised at her concern he seemed polite enough trella shrugged nothing worries me yet corio but we can afford to be cautious and isnt it strange that a merchant would cross the great desert at such risk before he was sure of what awaited him here was he unaware that the alur meriki were passing through these lands killing anyone they encountered why didnt he send an emissary ahead of him corio opened his mouth to reply then closed it again in the last few months hed learned not to dismiss her thoughts think on it corio trella went on and you too gatus let us all learn what we can now if you will excuse me my body calls to me once again she walked into the front room her two guards rising as she entered her friend and companion annoksur waited for her as well getting to her feet as trella crossed the room the two women stepped side by side into the square and began the walk back to eskkars house one guard walked ahead of them the other behind both men kept their hands on their swords and their eyes moving about only a few months ago eskkars enemies attacked trella in the street and nearly killed her the men who tried to assassinate her had died under the torture in a true barbarian rage eskkar had threatened to burn the city to the ground and kill every inhabitant if it happened again no one doubted him and so the guards remained wary and suspicious exactly as eskkar and gatus instructed they didnt want to face eskkars wrath or their own shame should another attempt on trellas life take place annoksur as alert as any of the guards stayed close beside trella the wife of one of eskkars subcommanders annoksur had nearly twice trellas seasons her husband bantor and a group of soldiers had departed akkad a few days before eskkar left for the north by now bantors force would have ranged far to the south of akkad carefully watching from afar the progress of the retreating barbarian migration and making sure they did not double back for another attack on akkad the barbarians had been driven off but they still had many warriors and rumors of their presence even as the distance grew still frightened akkads inhabitants something troubles you trella yes annoksur but we will speak of it when we are home korthac returned to the modest inn hed picked for himself and his men walking through the lanes he ignored the openmouthed stares of the villagers although the clothing he and his bodyguard wore came from these lands their darker complexions burnished even deeper by months in the sun marked them as strangers and worse foreigners nevertheless korthac smiled pleasantly at anyone who caught his eye offering greetings and friendly nods he needed to gain acceptance from these simple folk there would be plenty of time to teach them proper respect later on then they would kneel in the dirt when he passed afraid to lift their eyes to his lest they lose their heads more than a month had passed since he left magabad hed entered akkad with only sixteen men carefully chosen to make sure they looked more like servants and laborers than fighting men the rest of his force remained far to the west awaiting his summons while ariamus roamed the countryside seeking men willing to fight for gold even with foreigners at their side fortune had smiled on korthac when it delivered ariamus to him korthac couldnt image a more perfect tool ariamus knew the city and the countryside knew the people and knew how to command the rabble that would soon sweep korthac to power the mans desires for power and wealth made him easy to control as long as ariamus remained obedient and loyal he would continue to be useful korthac remembered the astonishment in ariamuss eyes when he saw the bags of gemstones the mans greed would be the halter in korthacs firm hands korthac had brought two bags of jewels with him more than enough to establish himself in akkad in a few days or a week he would grudgingly pay whatever trivial sum the akkadians demanded of him after that hed buy a house and set up a base of operations he would bring more of his men into akkad by ones and twos increasing their number while he established an innocent trade in gemstones with the local merchants it would be lucrative business for the akkadians as korthac planned to be less than astute in his dealings that would win him many more friends even as he earned a reputation as a poor trader and hed bestow other gifts that would gain him more supporters at the same time ariamus would continue gathering men in korthacs first few talks after saving ariamuss life korthac hadnt been sure that his newly acquired servant and ally could deliver the numbers of fighting men he promised but as he traveled closer toward akkad korthac saw for himself the devastation in the countryside and numbers of masterless men wandering about many had flocked to join ariamus and his men and his newest subcommander promised to recruit even more when korthac had enough followers one nights fighting would see the city his tomorrow his campaign would begin he had already started learning who the important traders and merchants were and soon he would begin buying their support with judicious and discreet bribes korthac didnt begrudge the gemstones that would be required hed make sure he got most of them back when he seized command of the city akkad did impress him despite what hed told trella the city bustled with excitement korthac saw new construction or rebuilding on every street while freshly planted crops flourished in the surrounding fields the inhabitants looked healthy content and well fed with little illness in evidence even the slaves looked remarkably satisfied with their lot egypt might have one or two cities larger but none matched this place in energy no akkad would serve his needs perfectly perhaps someday he would raise an army large enough to return to egypt and vanquish his enemies he put that thought out of his mind it would take years to fully exploit akkad and right now he needed to concentrate on the task at hand hed spoken to the innkeeper and several others already and learned that eskkar had traveled north while sending other soldiers to the south korthac could scarcely believe his luck the foolish ruler had divided his forces and left the city in the care of his pregnant slave girl if ariamus could raise men fast enough korthac would have more than enough followers to take control of akkad it might take only weeks instead of the months he had envisioned while the fool eskkar chased bandits all over the countryside weakening his forces in the process korthac would husband and increase his own numbers korthac reached his lodgings and passed inside he nodded pleasantly to the innkeeper and sat down at a table except for the owner and his family only korthac and his men now stayed here the other guests had been encouraged to seek accommodations elsewhere by the innkeeper after a large gift from korthac the tiny inn normally couldnt accommodate so many travelers but his men could bear such a minor hardship as sleeping shoulder to shoulder on the dirt floor after the brutal weeks journeying across the desert the inns floor seemed almost luxurious even though korthac had selected these men with care they still had difficulty acting as simple bodyguards instead of trained warriors he only allowed them to carry knives befitting their role and kept their newly acquired swords in his room hed promised to kill the first man that quarreled with any of the local inhabitants so far theyd shown restraint knowing their days of plunder and pillage would come soon enough the innkeeper rushed to his table carrying a jar of wine and cups while his obsequious wife appeared with a bowl of dates and a chipped plate holding fresh bread korthac thanked them both with a smile ignoring their filthy hands and the dirty utensils the innkeeper no doubt imagined he would make a tidy profit from his foreign guest the thought of someday taking it all back from the man helped korthacs appetite the barely adequate wine smelled of vinegar but he drank it gratefully while he picked at the alreadystale bread todays meeting with trella had gone better than hed dreamed possible perhaps the fool lord of akkad would get himself killed and solve another problem this eskkar didnt even have an heir though korthac doubted many would rally to a son of an upstart barbarian korthac knew it took years of trust years of obedience to a ruler before the people accepted without question the passing of authority from father to son gatus the temporary leader of the city looked and acted like a plain soldier one with little imagination and corio was nothing more than an artisan only recently allowed into the company of what these locals called the nobles no these simple villagers hadnt rallied around eskkar out of choice but out of necessity eskkar had left the city taking nearly a quarter of its soldiers another sixty or so had gone south so that left little more than a hundred men here in akkad not even enough to defend the walls properly not without the villagers supporting them if the soldiers here could be eliminated the other two forces even if they got together would be too weak to retake the city especially after korthac convinced the villagers to fi ght for him there would be more than a few disaffected locals eager to gain a better place and position taking a sip of wine he grimaced at the taste he knew how to win over the rest of the villagers hacking a few to death in the marketplace would solve that problem that left only trella to be reckoned with she would be curious possibly even suspicious but a stranger with a dozen men wouldnt worry her or any of the others perhaps he could even win her over keep her occupied and amused with stories of egypt while ariamus gathered more men a few jewels might even do the trick ariamus hadnt found out much about trella but the innkeeper had plenty of stories to tell she seemed to have her wits about her but she was merely a pregnant girl too young to have any real understanding in how to deal with men or rule a city more important she lacked experience in warfare especially the kind of fighting korthac had waged in egypt no she and this eskkar had attained their positions by the luck of a barbarian invasion and in the confusion they had gained control of the biggest city on the tigris korthac needed to deal carefully with her but he would make sure she learned only what he wanted her to know until it was too late then she too would kneel at his feet he tasted a few of the dates and wished again for the fruit of the trees from the village of his youth somehow the food in this new place didnt seem quite as satisfying as that of egypt he assumed he would get used to it however especially when served to him on a golden platter by his new slaves taking another mouthful of wine to rinse his mouth he thought more about trella she had little beauty especially with her body already distorted by the coming child she did have a presence a sense of command one korthac would enjoy breaking he had seen how the others deferred to her though that might be simple fear of the barbarian eskkar perhaps she would make a good pleasure slave shed been a slave once so it only seemed fitting to return her to her true station he pictured her kneeling naked at his feet begging for the chance to please him yes that was something pleasant to anticipate almost as pleasant as the prospect of the entire city submitting to his authority eager to satisfy his every command in the morning he would meet with the council plead his case and begin negotiations over whatever trifling taxes they demanded tomorrow would be the first day of his new campaign it wouldnt be a long campaign but when it ended he would rule fi rst here then over all the surrounding countryside eskkar would be dead and his woman would be korthacs slave for as long as she pleased him or she too would be dead though trella lived only a few lanes away from the council house the journey home always took much longer than expected shopkeepers and villagers filled the streets and the sight of trella and her guards made it impossible for her to go about unnoticed everyone wanted to exchange a few words with her or even just call out a greeting she and annoksur took their time pausing often to chat with those she encountered only a few months ago trella had walked the entire city almost every day but now between her pregnancy and her new role as eskkars representative she had less time to wander about and meet the inhabitants nevertheless trella wanted to stay close to akkads people and so she took advantage of every opportunity to speak with them this late in the afternoon women their daily chores completed made up most of the crowd more than an hour remained before they started preparing their familys evening repast few could resist the opportunity to speak with lady trella the wife of akkads ruler young mothers showed off their new babies matrons pointed out their marriageable daughters and older women or young widows presented themselves many of these sought lady trellas help in finding a husband a duty she had assumed during the siege as the casualties mounted among both villagers and soldiers the war against the barbarians had improved the status of those serving as akkads soldiers and eskkar increased their pay enough so the more senior men could afford wives as with every task trella undertook no matter how minor she gave it her full attention at her urging eskkar summoned the more experienced soldiers and trella met with each of them taking the time needed to learn what kind of husband each would be and which woman would best suit him she soon had a good number of marriages to her credit because shed helped arrange the unions the husbands treated their newly acquired women properly and the brides attended to their duties neither wanted the lord of akkad or his wife to hear of matrimonial difficulties even newcomers to akkad soon learned to take advantage of lady trellas knowledge and services not only as a marriage broker but also as an honest advisor for almost any situation by the time annoksur and trella reached eskkars compound shed promised to find husbands for two more women two soldiers guarded the entrance and one held the gate open for the mistress of the house they passed into the courtyard where the scent of jasmine hung in the air and tulips in pots scattered along the inner walls offered some color to offset the drab mudbrick walls when eskkar became captain of the guard he had taken over this large twostory house with its private garden and separate quarters for servants the structure at that time the largest in akkad had belonged to a wealthy merchant who valued his privacy as much as his security eskkars domicile stood to the left its second story rising up at the rear the servants quarters as long as the main building faced it across the sizable open space and these dwellings formed two sides of the central courtyard manhigh walls enclosed the rest during the siege more than forty men had crammed themselves into the servants quarters though at present it housed only twenty guards most of them hawk clan klexor one of eskkars subcommanders lived there along with his wife and children another room remained reserved for guests or travelers a large plank table with half a dozen benches capable of seating thirty rested midway between the two houses in the hottest days of summer master servants and guards took their meals there a few hawk clan soldiers could usually be found relaxing around the table especially in the evening these warriors provided constant security for the house and its occupants day and night two men guarded the front gate while another watched the small garden at the rear of the main structure with its single highset window that opened into eskkar and trellas secondstory bedroom in the evening two guards took station inside the main house guarding the steps that led up to eskkar and trellas rooms annoksur and her husband bantor lived there as well when eskkar became captain of the guard bantor and his wife had been too poor to find decent lodgings eskkar with plenty of space in his new dwelling had offered the neediest of his subcommanders one of the extra rooms in the big house the size of the household grew quickly as soldiers and servants filled the rooms of both structures needing help trella asked annoksur for her assistance and soon realized bantors wife could run the combined household efficiently and by herself once the two women had established the domicile annoksur took over the daytoday tasks supervising the buying and cooking of food cleaning the house and washing their mens clothes in the river soon annoksur directed half a dozen servants and soldiers wives inside the big household with the household duties attended to trella helped eskkar with organizing the villages defense always her main task weeks went by as trella helped arrange the logistics needed to arm and supply the villagers and soldiers once eskkar had that effort in hand trella concentrated on helping to train the villagers and get them ready for the coming siege during the months of preparation she secretly kept to her real goal the effort to win over the hearts and minds of the common people she started with the women eager to speak with anyone who treated them with the least bit of consideration trella soon earned the respect of their menfolk and even the hardened soldiers who treated her more like a sister than eskkars wife in the process and by careful use of eskkars newly acquired gold trella gradually built up a small network of spies and informers mostly women and slaves who kept her aware of anyone plotting against eskkar and his new role throughout the city throughout the land men talked freely in front of their women whether slave or free often treating them as furniture something of no importance but many women had sharper wits than their menfolk though most had learned to keep such heresy to themselves these women soon learned they could earn a copper coin or two by reporting anything of interest to trella who not only paid for the information but actively sought the help of those who delivered it asking their opinions and advice shed been raised by her father an advisor to a ruling noble in a large village far to the south and hed taught her to use her sharp wits her days as a slave beginning with her fathers death and ending with eskkars ascent to power had sharpened them even further the information trellas spies collected helped eskkar survive the efforts of the nobles to replace him when the siege ended the siege had broken barely two months ago that day eskkar and trella stood atop the bloodstained wall victorious over both the nobles and the barbarians the people delirious with joy at their salvation from death or slavery acclaimed eskkar their lord and ruler at the same time they hailed trella as well wanting her wisdom and guidance they understood and respected the soldier who had saved their lives and property but in the end they trusted trella to look after their wellbeing as much as eskkar even the nobles had finally seen the advantages of a strong ruler though they would never have selected the bluntspeaking barbarian eskkar for them trella smoothed the way her intelligence and honesty giving them assurance that their own enterprises would be protected and allowed to grow with food again on their tables the people of akkad relished the return of prosperity if the bandits and thieves wandering the countryside could be driven off and the crops replanted security and wealth would soon surpass their earlier levels meanwhile the rebuilding and expansion of akkad continued a gigantic task but one trella felt capable of accomplishing not a trader merchant or farm holder she had no private interests to advance the nobles and leading merchants saw everything in terms of their own wealth did everything to increase their gold their power and their prestige at each others expense trella could focus on the safety of the city something even the lowliest laborer not only understood but desired as well as long as she treated everyone fairly and favored no particular noble or merchant the people would support her and eskkar they might grumble at the taxes and some of the new rules but everyone had learned the value of the soldiers who protected them just as everyone knew the barbarians would return someday seeking vengeance what trella desired most was time time to secure their position and power in a few years akkad would be a strong fortified city and she and her child would be safe within its high walls surrounded and protected by eskkars soldiers that day remained in the future akkads hastily built wall needed to be enlarged and strengthened and more soldiers recruited and trained to defend it until then she would neglect nothing overlook nothing that might threaten her plans not even something as insignificant as a strange traveler from a distant land trella and annoksur entered the main house stepping into the spacious common room that held another large table where meals were served wooden stairs on the far wall led to the second story they climbed to the top where a small landing faced a stout wooden door that opened into the first of the two large rooms that made up eskkars private quarters the outer room what eskkar called the workroom held a goodsized table and half a dozen chairs and stools a tall cabinet that served both as a cupboard and sideboard hugged one wall and two chests provided storage three wide rectangular windows cut into the walls near the ceiling and too small for even a child to crawl through provided light and air the wall opposite the entry had a second door as sturdy as the first that led into eskkar and trellas bedroom trella passed quickly through the workroom and into the inner chamber though not as large as the outer room the bedroom was spacious enough especially compared to the cramped rooms occupied by most akkadians most of them would be astonished at the idea of having a separate room just for sleeping trella knew a family of six or more would live work and sleep in this much space and count themselves blessed by the gods to have walls around them and a roof over their heads only this inner room had a true window albeit a small one that opened over a tiny private garden at the rear of the house a thick wooden shutter framed this opening with two stout wooden braces to secure it a wide decorated clay bowl resting beneath it held a knotted and coiled rope for escape in case of fire as in the workroom ventilation came from three tiny openings on each wall set high to let the heat of the room escape more easily unlike most of the houses in the city the architect had provided no access to the roof where the poor often slept at night to escape the heat of summer eskkar and trella benefited now from these luxurious arrangements a smooth coat of white plaster enhanced the interior walls the solid floor made of sanded and joined wooden strips stopped most sound and eskkars soldiers guarded the window from the garden below the entire compound with its thick and high mudbrick walls provided a secure base in a turbulent city the original owner had designed these rooms to keep himself and his gold secure and his vices secret for its new occupants these rooms provided one of the rarest and most valuable commodities in akkadprivacy behind the stout doors in the bedroom or workroom important matters could be discussed without danger of being overheard trella went directly to the chamber pot when she finished she untied her sandals and lay on the bed grateful for the chance to rest her feet and back for a few moments tired trella annoksur sat on a small stool next to the bed yes though it seems strange i tire so easily though ive done nothing but sit and talk all day once the child comes youll be yourself again rest for a few moments ill tend to the servants then come back with something for you to eat and drink trella closed her eyes and joined her hands across her stomach already her back felt better and as she relaxed she felt the babe kicking gently inside her womb part of her mind worried about the birth so many women died in childbirth especially their first delivery she accepted the risk involved all women did a wifes most important role was to provide children heirs for her husband to carry on his line childbirth might be dangerous but soldiers accepted their own risk of death in battle and even farmers in the field suffered injuries often enough still the thought of the birth ordeal bothered her more as the event drew closer a month ago annoksur had brought the most experienced midwife she could find to see trella the woman lived not in akkad but on a farm a days walk south of the city to trellas surprise the midwife turned out to be a woman of about annoksurs age not the ancient crone trella expected her name was drusala and shed helped deliver babies since her childhood trella stood naked on two wooden blocks before the midwife her feet spread apart and holding her hands behind her head while drusala and annoksur examined every inch of trellas body prodding and poking her looking for lumps or weaknesses of flesh then annoksur had spread trellas labia apart so that drusala on her knees in front of the girl and probing with her fingers could examine the birth channel her hips could be wider i suppose the midwife said critically when she finished with her examination but she is very strong even though she doesnt work in the fields i see no problems with your delivery lady trella but ill return to akkad when your time is near still you must walk for at least an hour each day that will help the child come out without too much pain trella remembered her words of advice and she had put them into action each morning right after breakfast she paced back and forth inside the courtyard for an hour or longer trella would have preferred to walk about the city as shed done before the siege ended but there would have been so many interruptions she would never have finished her walk besides such extended strolls had become too dangerous an assassin had attacked trella in the street before and those jealous of her growing power might be tempted to strike again she would have to be content with her courtyard excursions at least for now the unborn child moved again and this time the movement brought a smile to trellas face she closed her eyes and let her mind drift thinking of the future and the heir she would give to eskkar she hoped he wouldnt do anything foolish so much depended on eskkar without him her infl uence and authority would vanish the citizens of akkad would never take orders from a woman no matter how much they liked or respected her let alone an outsider and a former slave at that trella hadnt wanted him to go but the countryside needed to be pacified and brought under control and though she hated the risks she knew eskkar was the best choice for the task with bisitun taken and under akkads authority the situation would be different and she would insist he remain in the city he hated the inactivity and petty disputes that found their way to him every day but he would have to accept it she needed eskkar here and soon his son would need his protection as well trella considered finding him another girl to occupy his time while she was pregnant or raising the baby there would be less time to pleasure him she would have to select the girl carefully of course it must be someone who could please him without arousing too much of his interest trella sighed at the thought she didnt like the thought of sharing her husband with another woman so far it hadnt seemed a problem his love for her remained ardent but a strong man needed more than one woman at least occasionally if she didnt provide one the village elders might convince eskkar of the need to take a second wife if for no other reason than to weaken trellas influence no it would be better to do it herself one more task to occupy her time fortunately she didnt need to deal with it today when he returned from the north she would speak to him about it now she worried about the dangers eskkar would face she hated being idle while her husband prepared for battle somewhere in the north and today this stranger from the land of egypt arrived and intrigued her trella closed her eyes again and worried about the coming child annoksur slipped quietly into the bedroom thinking trella was asleep but the girl stirred when annoksur set the tray of dates wine and water onto a round table scarcely bigger than the two plain stools that stood beside it annoksur sat down on the one closest to the bed and ran her fingers through her brown hair already touched with a tinge of gray though she had one more year before her thirtieth season i should get up trella said her voice barely above a whisper no stay there annoksur said supper is at least an hour away she pushed the table closer to the bed eat something the child must be hungry annoksur knew that trella did not intend to let her pregnancy interfere with her work trella clasped her hands behind her head there is a stranger in town annoksur a trader from the lands far to the west the land called egypt or so he claims he says the land there has many cities and villages some with walls of mudbrick as high as our own this man plans to trade gemstones here in akkad annoksur had heard of the mythical egypt from her husband bantor so the land of egypt exists it is said that food falls from the branches of the trees and that gold and silver are everywhere underfoot she shrugged at the fable what does it mean to akkad nothing im sure its far away and the great desert makes travel nearly impossible even bandits cant raid across that expanse thats what interests me about this trader he wants to open a merchant house here and begin trade with egypt like trella annoksur kept her voice low more from habit than any need the servants had proven trustworthy and no strangers or guests stayed in the main house nevertheless outside of these rooms spies lurked everywhere looking to sell whatever gossip or secrets they heard to one trader or another women if they had any wits learned at an early age to whisper among themselves the less men knew about their wives and daughters dealings the better bantor told me the lands to the west of the euphrates are wild filled with only savage people who can withstand the desert heat he traveled three days into those barren lands once chasing a murderer before turning back emptyhanded yes the wastelands are desolate and dangerous trella agreed even eskkar has never gone very far west of the other river so trading across the desert will be a great risk this merchant what is his name korthac you saw him leave the council house he has delicate features almost like a womans his eyes are sharp and miss nothing ah yes i remember seeing him so this korthac will trade gemstones annoksur thought for a moment theres always much demand for such goods he can sell all he wishes in akkad now that the boats are again moving up and down the river rising from the bed trella sat on the other stool she poured some wine and water for them both careful to add just a mouthful of the spirits in her cup as she did not enjoy the taste of wine or even the local beer yes a steady supply of scarce gemstones would attract even more merchants to akkad benefiting all trella took a small sip before taking a date from the platter but i wonder what korthac will send back to egypt in return merchants must trade both ways to be successful the question seemed casual enough but annoksur knew trella didnt waste her thoughts on trivial matters well he would have plenty of gold annoksur answered he might deal in linens or bronze or perhaps her voice trailed off for a moment as she considered the possibilities when traders come to akkad trella went on as she selected another date they barter copper and ores for food and clothing or timber for tools or cattle for leather goods or weapons she looked at annoksur if you were a trader what would you carry back to this rich land called egypt annoksur deliberated the question gold of course but gold had its limitations you couldnt eat it or build anything with it and its weight made it difficult to transport just as important with every rich merchant making his own coins and setting their value its worth was often suspect so traders used gold mainly to adjust for differences in value between goods or to represent value that could be carried more easily than bulky merchandise across such a great and dangerous distance what would one carry back what would be worth the effort for such a trip food and grain would spoil on the journey tools and weapons weighed too much for their value besides if the land of egypt had as many riches as people claimed it would already have these things in plenty i see what you mean trella but there must be something in akkad that they lack or perhaps he intends to trade only in akkad he may have no plans to trade with his homeland she shook her head well know soon enough wont we yes well see what this stranger buys with the gold he gets for his gemstones trella answered but he did say he meant to trade with egypt so i think we should find out as much as possible about him she finished her watered wine then poured herself a cup of plain water korthac will need furniture for his house servants to care for him and food for his kitchen and he and his men will need women especially after such a long and dangerous journey annoksur smiled yes im sure we can learn much about korthac and his plans in the next few weeks be discreet trella said i dont want him to learn we are spying on him as a stranger hell expect to be watched but i will be careful annoksur got up and moved behind trella and began massaging her shoulders her fingers worked steadily and in a few moments annoksur felt her mistress relax trella nibbled at another date separating the pit from the meat with her slender fingertips her hair swirled around her cheeks her long lashes accenting her eyes even when doing something as simple as eating trella demonstrated a presence that enhanced her beauty no wonder all the men in akkad watched her with hot eyes whenever she walked the lanes you should drink a little more wine trella no now that im with child it tastes even worse besides my father warned me that strong drink dulls the senses and weakens the wits he never drank wine at all only a cup of ale with his supper most of the nobles including their women drank as much wine as they could afford annoksur had never seen trella with the glazed eyes or slurred speech that showed the effects of too much wine or even the local beer which nearly everyone consumed in large quantities in the old days the days before trella eskkar had passed out often enough from too much ale but eskkar stopped the heavy drinking the day he met trella restricting himself to a few cups of wellwatered wine or ale a day even bantor despite the fact that her husband could now afford as much wine as he wanted drank only enough to wash down his supper trella pushed her plate away even the dates taste different i dont think the child cares for them you should rest sleep a little more before dinner i will she sighed eskkar is gone barely a week and already i miss him he will be away for at least a month and already the people accept your rule they feel as safe with you as they do with eskkar annoksur stopped massaging now rest for the childs sake if not your own trella moved back to the bed letting herself stretch out you worry too much about me annoksur after youve had a child or two youll know enough to rest whenever you can since her marriage to bantor annoksur had delivered three children the first died stillborn the second from fever before it reached its first year only the third child her daughter ningal born five years after her marriage survived but since the long and painful delivery annoksur had not gotten pregnant again trella folded her hands on her stomach even now hes moving inside me can you feel him annoksur sat beside her on the bed and placed her hand beside trellas only six months pregnant and already the child seems strong it will be a boy im sure of it eskkar is a strong man he will give me many sons yes mistress you will have many sons and ill help you care for all of them now try to sleep while i think about this korthac ill stay here with you youre like the older sister i never had trella closed her eyes and it took only a few moments before she slipped into sleep annoksur gazed at her mistress watching her breasts rise and fall with each breath she did think of trella as a sister as a child annoksur had often longed for a little sister to be a companion instead shed grown up with three brothers on a small farm just outside akkad and her parents admonished her childish request for a baby girl instead they gave thanks to ishtar for her brothers who could share the farms labors her parents soon had their only daughter selling vegetables in akkads market there annoksur a plain but sturdy girl only a few months into the mysteries of womanhood first noticed a young farmer gazing openmouthed at her something about his wide brown eyes made annoksur smile back at him nevertheless it took bantor three days before he gathered enough courage to speak to her a few weeks later bantor only a year or two older than she stood before her parents honorable father i have five copper coins for a wife it would please me to give them to you for annoksur her father had asked for double that but bantor only shook his head five is a good price for a young bride he answered stiffl y and it is all i have annoksurs heart had faltered when bantor turned away ready to leave but her father relented the coins changed hands and in a few moments her future husband led her away from her family while she clutched the few things she possessed to her breast that day she stood beside him facing the image of ishtar and became bantors wife together they worked on his fathers farm for six years hard toil from dawn to dusk but annoksurs body grew strong from the years of laboring she was pregnant with her third child when bantors father died his oldest brother took possession of the farm and by the custom of ascension ordered bantor to leave she and her husband owned nothing but the clothing on their backs and two food bowls desperate they moved to akkad where bantor sought work as a common laborer eager for any menial job the birth of their daughter caused even more hardship raising ningal the three of them lived with another family who charged them rent to occupy one corner of their singleroom hut annoksur baked bread worked in the market and joined the farmers during harvesttime any work she could find to supplement her husbands efforts their first two years in akkad they seldom had enough to eat and annoksur watched her husband grow ever more dour and grim as their life of poverty drained his spirit when they had no coins for food she resorted to selling herself along the riverbank with the other prostitutes on those occasions bantor would look away embarrassed at his failure to provide for them even ningal proved a disappointment a frivolous child who complained often another year went by before bantor found work as a recruit in akkads guard he hated the long days on guard duty each dreary task interrupted only by another just as wearisome the occasional assignment to track down runaway slaves proved more to his liking and provided him a chance to get away from the crowded village and breathe once again the clean air of the countryside annoksurs world too began to shrink as the burden of life grew heavier and heavier once while bantor rode after some slaves the captain of the guard had summoned her for an afternoon of pleasuring him that act of humiliation tortured her for months but she had to obey lest ariamus dismiss her husband annoksur never spoke of that incident but somehow she felt certain bantor had learned about it whatever the cause bantor sank into an apathy so deep that he seldom smiled or even spoke she scarcely noticed when eskkar arrived in akkad the tall barbarian soon took charge of the horses and most of the pursuits of runaway slaves eskkar and bantor worked together often enough during the next few years but they spoke little and showed no signs of any particular friendship then ariamus ran off as word spread of the coming barbarian invasion eskkar the barbarian will be the new captain of the guard bantor told her an excited gleam in his eyes he has asked me to be one of his subcommanders stunned she listened as her husband explained his new duties the night before bantor had told her that they must fl ee the city as refugees their desperate situation would only grow worse now he planned to stay and fight for a brief moment she thought about the coming danger but one look at her husband convinced her his face hadnt shown such excitement or intensity in years then you must do all you can to help eskkar she said placing her arms on his shoulders if he can manage to defeat the barbarians you will be one of his subcommanders and he will remember your loyalty bantors fi rst test of courage and loyalty came not against the barbarian alur meriki but against one of the ruling nobles that wanted eskkar out of the way instead the rich merchant had died and eskkar had taken possession of the mans house aware of bantors difficult situation eskkar invited his subcommander to move into the spacious quarters annoksur remembered the tears that came when she saw the chamber a whole room they would have to themselves the first such luxury theyd ever had then she met trella eskkars new slave it took only a few encounters for annoksur to realize how sharp trellas wits were how carefully she considered everyones words and how deep she saw into peoples hearts the gods had surely arranged the joining of eskkar and trella between them they saved akkad from rape and ruin annoksur soon took over the task of managing the large household leaving the young slave girl plenty of time to work with eskkar preparing for the siege she had labored side by side with trella during the assault astonished at each task trella undertook and more amazed at how she achieved each goal theyd both risked death during those evil days helping defend the wall during the attacks and tending the wounded afterward even before eskkar vanquished the barbarians trella set her mind to a new task to ensure that she and her husband ruled akkad for the rest of their days to that end trella still labored influencing all the men and councils of the new city to her will annoksur had joined the venture with all her heart and strength determined to make certain that trella succeeded even bantor had changed under eskkar and trellas influence now he thought more before acting and watching his captains example had learned to take heed of annoksurs words we must follow wherever they lead she told bantor they will rule this city someday and eskkar will remember who stood at his side a chance like this might never come again bantor heeded her advice and as his responsibilities and prospects grew hed somehow returned to the ways of his youth softening his words and touch toward annoksur and for that she gave thanks every night to ishtar only the great mother goddess herself could have sent trella to them the two women had grown closer than sisters in many ways working and planning together to secure eskkars rule over the city pushing the past out of her mind annoksur returned her thoughts to korthac she had many tasks to start in motion the women of akkad would begin watching the egyptians every move and reporting back through the network of spies and informers trella and annoksur had established soon she was sure they would know all about this korthac the future of both women depended on so many things beyond their control only moments ago annoksur had glimpsed the long scar stretching from trellas left armpit to her hip an assassin had come within a fingers width of killing her and anyone in akkad with a few coins in his purse could hire a villain to do murder annoksur worried every time trella walked the streets even though two alert bodyguards accompanied her and now eskkar had gone off riding around the countryside risking his life for the chance to play warrior like any common barbarian an arrow in the back or a knife in his ribs and everything trella had worked so hard for would come crashing down around them well annoksur could do nothing about eskkar the man took as little heed of his own life as he did of trellas nevertheless trella needed eskkar needed him to protect not only her and the childtocome but annoksur and her husband bantor as well both women realized how dangerous their position in akkad really was one slip one mistake and they could all vanish during the siege everyone had clamored for eskkar and trella to save them now if eskkar got himself killed trellas authority would disappear everyone would remember her days as a slave and trellas control of the nobles and soldiers would vanish like the morning mist on the river in a year even six months annoksur knew things would change eskkar and trella would soon have an heir and by then the people would be used to their rule wealth would flow into akkad and be shared by all of its inhabitants the people would be happy and content gratitude and praise would flow to akkads rulers annoksur sighed and stood she picked up trellas comb from the side table and arranged her own hair then left the bedroom closing the door silently behind her she still had an hour before night set in to spread the word about korthac by tomorrow half the women in akkad would be watching his movements but her thoughts flowed in the same circles as her mistress with the same worries time would save them all if there were enough of it until then no one could be allowed to harm her mistress no one the sun beat down from directly overhead when eskkar and his men topped a low rise and saw the village of bisitun in the distance about an hours march away like akkad it nestled against the eastern bank of the river tigris at akkad though the great river curled halfway around the city here at bisitun the river ran straight a mile more to the northeast and the tigris would begin to curve sharply northward continuing its long journey to the mountains of its birth also like akkad bisitun offered easy fordage of the great river the tigris here stretched wider from bank to bank and the water flowed slower and somewhat shallower than at akkad a narrow sandy island split the flowing water in two and allowed travelers to rest at the rivers midpoint during the late summer season when the depth ran even lower a strong man could walk and swim across to the other side though the distance reached almost a quarter of a mile usually small boats made of reeds carried men supplies and even horses on their journey with the coming of the fall season the river ran deeper and stronger and its strength would continue to increase until midsummer eskkar signaled a halt and the akkadian soldiers took their rest glad to have reached the end of their journey it had taken them five days to march here from dilgarth long days with hard traveling broken frequently by training and special drills those had puzzled the men but eskkar ignoring their questions pushed them ever harder with a conflict almost certain he wanted the iron discipline that had saved akkad and eskkar demanded every order be instantly obeyed without question or argument the soldiers got no respite from the drills even after dark their rest and dinner often interrupted by subcommanders barking out orders to prepare a line of battle or form up for an attack at least once each night the men found themselves jolted awake their leaders shouting that the enemy was attacking and bellowing at them to find their weapons and places by the middle of the second day a shouted command would quickly transform them into a crude square with the pack animals and supplies in the center ringed by ready bowmen well drilled by now they would not be surprised by any attacking force moreover they had the soldiers confidence in themselves and their comrades knowing that every man knew his place and his duties even the liverymen scribes and merchants received extra tasks and these noncombatants drilled as rigorously as the soldiers taking charge of the mens baggage or making sure spare arrows and extra water stood ready that night a few of the men had grown weary enough to complain but they did that only once hamati had knocked one down so hard that the man lay unconscious for almost an hour by the time they reached bisitun eskkars men had achieved the mood he intended tired near exhaustion footsoretheyd transferred their anger to the men in bisitun the bandits who had wearied their legs and interrupted their sleep the akkadians took in their surroundings with grim interest knowing that from today on there would be no more drills if the men felt worried about what would happen now that theyd reached bisitun they were too tired to show it the scene before them seemed peaceful enough the usual farms lay scattered across the landscape crisscrossed by the everpresent irrigation canals with the occasional brown mud houses a single dirt pathway well trodden continued its way up to the village everything appeared peaceful and it looked much the same as on eskkars last visit here nearly two years ago well captain sisuthros said as he rode up to the head of the column where eskkar and grond had stopped their horses do we camp here or should we press on lets stay here for an hour at least eskkar answered were in no rush now they wont come out to challenge us grond said that would be too easy even bandits arent that stupid no i suppose not eskkar said but the men need a rest anyway and from now on we have to convince ninazu of our plan eskkar caught the glance that passed between sisuthros and grond but neither man said anything the time for arguing had passed and the next few days would resolve everyones doubts so the men rested and stared at the village for over an hour before they resumed their march they moved slowly the soldiers walking close together ringed at a good distance by the twenty mounted riders during the last four days eskkar had drilled the men for an attack by a large mounted band of riders the soldiers had learned to form up rapidly string their bows and prepare their weapons and make ready for an attack from any or all sides nevertheless the soldiers moved cautiously every man alert and it took another hour to reach their destination eskkar gave the order to halt fifty paces out of a long bowshot from the villages palisade eskkar nodded at sisuthros his subcommander turned and began shouting orders to the men first they straddled the road that led to the village and dropped their packs and supplies unencumbered they got right to work though every man kept his weapons close by while twenty men stood guard with strung bows the rest began to dig a ditch across the road they had plenty of shovels and digging tools most of them acquired during the last four days as the horsemen checked every farm they passed for digging implements paying copper coins to the farmers only too eager to sell them the rest of the men used their hands sticks or whatever else they could obtain fortunately the sandy soil made the work proceed quickly eskkar rode off a little ways grond at his side and studied the village before them the alur meriki in their passing must have burned a good portion of the palisade and eskkar could see where it had been rebuilt no doubt the barbarians had knocked down plenty of houses during their looting but mud bricks were easily replaced and a peasants hut could be rebuilt with a few days labor bisitun probably hadnt changed much in the last few years back then more than five hundred people lived here now that number might even be higher with all the nearby farmers driven from their land crops and homes destroyed some might have left since the coming of ninazu but others would still come looking for any communal place of safety even a village ruled by bandits fresh repairs to the main gate showed plainly no doubt the alur meriki had broken up the previous one and used it for firewood all the mud houses within bowshot of the palisade had been knocked down and the rubble broken up and strewn about to impede the progress of any attacker the palisade stood higher than eskkar remembered and appeared to have been reinforced with extra logs or planks the new gate looked sturdy as well though nowhere near as massive as akkads main entrance eskkar could see the defenders standing behind the stockade some still scurrying about searching for their assigned positions most of them carried bows with axes and swords no doubt close at hand from the highest point of the palisade just to the side of the gate a small group of men stood apart and watched the soldiers from akkad as they began to dig in ill wager that ones ninazu grond commented looks a little like his brother at any rate the tall one with the silver armbands eskkar picked out the man but his eye couldnt see any resemblance at that distance only the polished silver glinting in the sun for a moment that irritated him ten seasons ago it would have been his eyes that spotted such details not that he could complain his luck had kept him alive few fighting men made it to their thirtieth season and eskkar had survived more battles than he could remember still he knew the trades of fighting and soldiering were best left to men just reaching their twentieth season well know soon enough if thats him eskkar grunted but keep an eye on that one well need to identify the leaders for later on do you think theyll come out to fight they look ready enough no not if their leaders got any wits not yet at any rate this ninazu probably expects an immediate attack on the village if not today then tomorrow let him watch our men dig in give him plenty of time to wonder what were planning should we ride around and take a look at the other sides when were dug in therell be plenty of time tomorrow lets try and get a count of how many fighters were facing eskkar stayed in the same position a long time looking at the palisade trying to put himself in the bandit leaders place the siege at akkad had given him a wealth of experience in defending a village from attack soldiers and villagers alike had spent almost five months preparing for the akkad siege learning and even inventing new defenses then endured more than a month of hard fighting against the entire alur meriki clan in the end eskkar and his soldiers had forced the barbarians to move on defeating them as much by denying them food as by resisting them on the battlements with that experience eskkar studied bisitun and its wooden palisade this time he would be the attacker the one outside the walls put yourself in your enemys mind trella would remind him this ninazu had the village and the stockade to protect him and ninazu had more men than his besiegers but just because a man carried a sword didnt make him an experienced fighter the men from akkad had trained and practiced their skills for over five months more important many of them had faced battlehardened determined fi ghters and beat them no scruffy band of brigands held together only by their love of gold and fear of their leaders would stand up to eskkars men for more than a few moments in open combat ninazu must realize this so there would be no sudden sortie from the village to rush and overwhelm the attackers ninazu would have other worries as well eskkar hadnt really needed to talk to the local farmers to know how they had been treated and while the reluctant inhabitants of bisitun might stand on the wall and look determined they werent going to fight to the death for ninazu a man who had taken freely their wives and daughters as well as their crops and valuables and ruled only by force no ninazu couldnt trust his villagers for long and if the bandit ventured out and suffered a defeat many of his men would start thinking about taking what they had gained and slipping across the river to safety ninazu needed a quick victory if eskkar attacked and was driven off ninazus position and strength would increase the longer the siege went on the more confidence ninazus men would have but time which seemed to be on ninazus side would soon be working in eskkars favor this ninazu has plenty of men eskkar said willing and unwilling i count at least ninety or a hundred fi ghting men that i can see no doubt there are more waiting behind the palisade more than enough to attack us here but hell wait a few days to see what were up to then well have to show him what we can do captain grond answered hes in for a surprise just make sure were not the ones who are surprised the rough ideas that eskkar had first considered back in dilgarth and reworked on the march north still had merit and the terrain around the village seemed favorable now that he could study the villages defenses he needed to give more thought to some details but he had his plan tonight and tomorrow would give him more information even as he set in motion the first part of his plan though not by nature a patient man eskkar could afford to take his time he wanted to capture the village without losing too many men the soldiers he and gatus had trained were far too valuable to throw away in a frontal assault though he already felt sure he could force the palisade using his archers to drive ninazus men from the walls but many would die and eskkar needed all the trained fi ghting men he had not only here but back in akkad as well no he would stay with his original plan his mind made up eskkar and grond turned their horses around and headed back toward their new encampment by the time darkness fell the camps basic defense was nearly completed a shallow ditch surrounded the men on three sides with only their rear exposed by early tomorrow that opening would be closed as well the earth from the ditch had been piled up on the inside of the camp to form an embankment and men worked at packing it down even now this dirt wall would stop an arrow as well as any wooden fence while the ditch in front would hinder either men or horses should the men inside bisitun attempt to overrun the akkadians the idea for a fortified camp such as this had come from gatus he and eskkar had argued over many nights and much ale about its worth the old soldier had a special way with training the men and seemed obsessed with the idea of fortifications until this moment eskkar had remained skeptical but now watching the earthworks go up he realized that the old fighter was right sisuthros posted the guards and made the rounds to make sure they stayed alert but eskkar would depend more on the three men who slipped out of the camp as soon as the last of the sun vanished from the sky they would creep up as close to the palisade as possible to keep watch if the defenders decided to sortie out the three sentries would give warning inside the camp sisuthros kept all seventy akkadians busy for another two hours before they were allowed to turn in though a third of the men would stay awake and alert throughout the night the tired soldiers fell asleep in moments snoring away in blissful repose a sound loud enough to wake the demons or the dead only when everything seemed secure for the night did grond hamati and sisuthros sit down with eskkar around a small campfire to discuss their next steps from what we could see on the palisade eskkar began it looks as though ninazu has at least a hundred fighting men probably thirty or forty more that hes kept hidden the rest are villagers and the local farmers no doubt with swords at their backs as well as in their hands what if they try an attack tonight hamati asked he had charge of the first group of twentyfive men who would be awake and ready throughout the night i dont think they will eskkar answered he knows he outnumbers us why should they give up their strong position to attack us in ours no hell wait thinking we may attack tomorrow we could still try something at night ourselves sisuthros suggested we dont have the men to waste well stay with the plan for the next few days at least eskkar stood wake me when you change the guards hamati ill want to talk to the men now lets get some rest eskkar arose before dawn broke hed slept well during the night despite waking twice as the twentyfive defenders were replaced each time he made the rounds with the new men inspecting them talking with them and reminding them to keep alert all around him men groaned and stretched their muscles stiff from yesterdays digging he smiled at that those muscles would loosen up soon enough there would be more digging today a lot more the men should be grateful at least they wouldnt be marching anywhere before the sun cleared the horizon eskkar stood atop the dirt embankment and looked toward the village the palisade stood fully manned a sign of good discipline on his enemys part no doubt ninazu had expected an early morning attack or even something during the night with the sun behind him eskkar picked out the man with bright silver bracelets on both his arms if that proved to be ninazu he would be an easy target especially for mitrac and his bow eskkar studied the palisade only long enough to be sure the defenders had no plans for a morning attack of their own when he turned away half a dozen arrows flew into the sky trying to reach him all scattered themselves in the earth the nearest of them at least sixty paces short of their target smiling eskkar waved at the bandit leader then stepped back down inside the embankment after a quick meal of stale bread and hard cheese eskkar watched as sisuthros gave the morning orders his subcommander sent out ten scouts on horseback to make sure no one surprised the akkadians from their rear or flanks the scouts dispatched sisuthros directed the liverymen and scribes to fetch fresh water from the river and put the rest of the men to work first they would finish the ditch around the entire camp then the ditch would be made deeper and the rampart higher higher than really needed eskkar wanted the camp secure by days end and his men concealed from the defenders so they could prepare their surprises the men worked steadily only half of them laboring at any time as the others stood guard or rested by noon a steep wall of packeddown dirt surrounded the camp only an opening six paces wide at the rear remained sisuthross scouts returned leading two wagons that could be used to block that opening if necessary with the basic fortification constructed the men labored on making the ditch deeper and the rampart higher eskkar walked around the camp once again as he had already done a dozen times talking to the men encouraging them telling them they could rest when the ditch was completed a shout made him look up one of sisuthross scouts had appeared riding toward the camp from the south his slow canter told eskkar that he bore no urgent news so eskkar walked leisurely to the rear of the camp grond hamati and sisuthros joined him just as the rider dismounted what is it tuvar sisuthros clasped the man on the shoulder what did you see just what you expected commander tuvar handed the horse over to one of the other men then he turned to face eskkar captain we met fi ve farmers from the nearby countryside they were frightened but they still approached us good where did you meet them eskkar needed the local farmers they would be an important part of his plan a few miles to our rear captain we were well out of sight of the village i told them we were here to free the village from ninazu and his thieves and that wed purchase as much firewood food and wine as they could sell us and you told them eskkar couldnt stop the smile that appeared on his face i told them to bring it here they didnt like that theyre afraid well just take their food and keep our silver tuvar smiled at the memory i told them that if they were afraid to bring it a little at a time and that we would pay for each delivery it happened just as you said it would captain theyll come im sure of it since they know you ride back to where you found them and wait there for them you can escort them here remember were their friends eager to help them get rid of ninazu this is important tuvar take care with them and treat them politely i understand captain dont worry ill bring them in he nodded to sisuthros before remounting the horse and cantering away eskkar turned to sisuthros have men ready to greet them you too grond make sure you stop by and speak with them tell them youre looking to purchase the finest foods and wine for me yes captain the two men spoke the words together they discussed this last night and again early this morning but sisuthros knew his captain well eskkar would go over orders again and again as much to make sure he hadnt forgotten something than to see if sisuthros or the other subcommanders remembered them another shout made them all look up again a pair of riders had crested one of the low hills to the south each of them leading a pack animal both the men and beasts looked as though they had traveled hard eskkar stared at the two riders one of whom looked familiar its drakis grond said identifying the man first he should have been here last night whos that with him sisuthros asked that question was answered quickly enough and by drakis himself as soon as he dismounted and drank half a skin of water the four leaders took him aside all of them eager to hear what tidings he brought captain eskkar drakis began wiping the water from his chin with the back of his hand lady trella sends her greetings and wishes you success at bisitun trella is well almost ten days had passed since eskkar had last seen her very well captain she asked me to remind grond to keep you safe and out of trouble i will try and take care of myself drakis eskkar answered dryly somehow her concern made him feel proud not embarrassed what else did she say only that she wished you a speedy return and she suggested gatus send another man with me with a second pack horse so weve brought you twelve skins of oil three bags of cotton and all the ropes we could carry the extra supplies slowed us down or wed have arrived yesterday eskkar hadnt expected so much leave it to trella to make sure he got double what he asked for and he should have thought of sending two men if one of the horses got injured there would have been a delay in getting him what he needed and everything is well in akkad yes and dilgarth too drakis said anticipating eskkars next question theres no sign of any bandits remaining in the area and the village seems to be recovering corio and nicar are sending more men there and gatus sent a few more soldiers for protection no doubt theyve already arrived with the extra men dilgarth will begin rebuilding the palisade and irrigation ditches and helping the flax weavers get started again nicar says there is a great shortage of linen in akkad good very good eskkar said pleased to hear that dilgarth remained safe and secure he turned to sisuthros we can begin the next part of the plan grond turned to drakis what about this other man who is he rukor hes one of the new men gatus is training drakis seemed surprised at the sudden interest hes good with horses we wouldve been even later without him eskkar looked over toward the pack animals where rukor and some of the liverymen from the camp had already stripped the tired animals of their burdens and started rubbing them down eskkar didnt know this man and didnt want to take any chances well have to get rid of him rukor come here the shout made rukor turn and he jogged over to where his leaders stood yes lord eskkar he said as he bowed an older man rukor looked to have more than thirty seasons he had never spoken with eskkar before and knew little about akkads leader rukor drakis says youve done well eskkar said but i want you back on a horse and on your way back to akkad i have an urgent message for my wife you will tell her tell her that we are encamped outside of bisitun and waiting rukor looked both confused and disappointed no doubt he expected to get at least a few days rest before climbing back on a horse and the message didnt seem particularly urgent or important eskkar turned to grond give rukor two silver coins as a reward a weeks pay would make the man feel a little better while grond hunted in his belt for the coins eskkar went on rukor drakis says you can be trusted so i ask you to leave at once get a fresh horse and take whatever you need and tell no one what message you carry do you understand grond put the coins in rukors hand before the man could answer come with me rukor he put his arm around the uncomprehending mans shoulder and started him moving ill make sure you get a good horse and plenty of food when the two of them were gone eskkar turned back to drakis now i need you to do something important drakis listen carefully youre going to deliver the rest of the message gatus sent to me the message is that gatus and a hundred and twenty men will be here in four or five days do you understand drakiss mouth fell open there had been no other message but captain gatus did not listen to me drakis eskkar went on patiently keeping his voice low this is very important gatus told you that he and a hundred and twenty men will be here in four or five days thats what he told you to tell me eskkar waited a moment to let that sink in now drakis tell me what message you carry from gatus drakis looked from eskkar to sisuthros who grinned broadly at the mans confusion tell eskkar what gatus told you drakis sisuthros encouraged go on deliver the message from gatus now both eskkar and sisuthros waited smiles on their faces drakis turned back to eskkar uh captain gatus said that he and a hundred and twenty men would be here in four or five days very good drakis eskkar said now remember well what gatus told you you must believe the words and say them as if it were true when youre with the men someone will ask you what message you carried you will tell them what gatus said just as you told me i want our men to believe that more soldiers are coming you must believe it yourself so that they will believe you can you do that drakis if you cant then youll need to get on a horse with rukor the men have to believe reinforcements are coming i can do it captain drakis answered determinedly im not sure what these words mean but i can do it understanding is not required drakis eskkar said but softened the words with a smile just follow your orders believe the message yourself and youll have no trouble convincing any of the men now lets go over it again eskkar made drakis repeat the message half a dozen times until the words fell smoothly off his tongue finally eskkar dismissed drakis letting him rejoin the men so he could get something to eat the other men would ask for news of akkad and sooner or later drakis would confirm gatuss message rukor had already departed on his way back to akkad carrying a useless message that would raise trellas eyebrows and make gatus think his captain had lost his wits well captain sisuthros said its as you said the men will believe drakis and i expect the local farmers will be here soon they know weve arrived and that well need food you deal with them personally when they arrive sisuthros theyre important to the plan remember to pay them fairly for whatever they bring but no more if we start paying too much eskkar glanced around the camp now its time for grond and me to take our little ride around the village while you do your part moments later after eskkar had mounted his horse a ragged cheer went up from the men sisuthros had just told the soldiers that gatus and more men were on the way to bolster their numbers and should anyone ask drakis he would confirm that he had indeed delivered that message in bisitun men would start wondering about the cheering eskkar nodded in satisfaction with ten soldiers riding behind him eskkar started his survey of the village first they rode slowly to the west stopping often to examine the land always keeping at least a quarter mile from the village when they reached the river they paused for nearly a half hour as eskkar studied the land the river and the southwestern approach to the village before they began to retrace their steps they quickened their pace as they passed behind their own encampment then slowed down again and leisurely inspected the northeastern outskirts of bisitun until they reached the river once again as before eskkar took his time studying the landscape before they rode slowly back to the encampment they had been gone nearly two hours and during that time the walls of bisitun had been filled with men not only soldiers but villagers as well all of them nervous and curious as to what the men from akkad were planning shading his eyes grond picked out the man with the silver arm bracelets who followed them along the palisade from one side of the village to the other well we got their attention captain grond said as they dismounted and handed the horses off and sisuthros makes good progress in building the ditch it looks finished lets take a turn around the camp just to see how it looks they walked slowly around the encampment but found no fault with either the ditch or the rampart while a good rider on a strong horse might leap the sixfootwide ditch the animal would be jumping directly into the mound of dirt and would probably bury itself to the shoulder into the soft earth the ditch and the earthen embankment would slow down men on foot even more they would have to jump into the ditch then endeavor to climb up the ramparts side into the teeth of the defenders bows and swords satisfied that his position couldnt be taken eskkar strode back inside the camp thinking that if gatus were here he would be pleased as well eskkar repeated the inspection from behind the rampart taking his time as he paced around the camp the soldiers looked cheerful now with the possibility of a fight delayed they would have a few days rest before gatus and his men arrived with another hundred men they knew they could easily storm the village eskkar spoke to many of them always asking if they understood their orders and knew what their posts were in an emergency always trying to remember as many of their names as he could he wanted them to know that he depended on them and that this wasnt the time for them to relax or forget their vigilance he had just finished checking the ranks when sisuthros approached captain here come the first of the farmers coming slowly down the road eskkar saw three small farm carts each pushed or pulled by two farmers either these farmers had no draft animals or they feared the soldiers would confiscate them a likely enough occurrence with ninazus men well at least well have fresh food for tonight do you want to meet with them no let them get used to dealing with you both now and in the future say that i am too busy to deal with farmers dont forget to tell them well need a great deal more food in a few days do you think there will spies in this group captain no not this group eskkar said taking a moment to consider perhaps not even the next one but when the third group arrives then i think well have some spies or farmers relying on ninazus pay eskkar walked away from the rear gate and watched from a distance as the nervous farmers approached the camp sisuthros halted them outside the rear embankment then spent half an hour haggling with them at first the local inhabitants looked fearful afraid of their goods being confiscated or themselves taken as slaves or laborers but with ninazus men taking what they wanted without paying these farmers needed the copper coins and their need had driven them to take the chance so far none of these strangers from akkad had looted anyone or raided the local farmhouses so perhaps after all they would deal honestly that night eskkar enjoyed good wine with his dinner along with nuts and fresh bread the farmers had departed scarcely able to conceal their joy theyd received a decent sum for their goods and they promised to spread the word and that more food would arrive tomorrow morning once again eskkar muttered thanks to the gods for trellas advice she had given him a good supply of their precious silver to win over the goodwill of the local farmers in the old days he would have simply taken what he needed from them no doubt in much the same way that ninazu had now eskkar understood how that would alienate them and work against him in the long run for the next few days he needed their help even if unwittingly given sisuthross men kept a sharp lookout during the night the soldiers on alert for any attack from the village but as eskkar expected nothing happened the morning sun found the land empty around them though the sun hadnt climbed much above the horizon before a ragged column of carts wagons and individuals carrying whatever they could manage appeared on the road from the south the days trading would begin early eskkar resisted the urge to join sisuthros his commander knew what needed to be done after breakfast eskkar took grond mitrac hamati and half a dozen other senior men to a corner of the camp and they planned their next move the meeting didnt last long as soon as it broke up hamati put twenty men back to work ten on each side of the encampment they began digging out two new ditches these would extend from either side of the camp along the lines eskkar had marked out yesterday the men had been told that eskkar wanted to extend the ditchto accommodate all the reinforcements gatus would bring and to enclose the extra food and horses hed told them little more except that they could take their time and that they would be relieved every two hours with a secure main encampment already established eskkar felt certain the new ditches would raise plenty of questions inside bisitun sisuthros spent the morning with the farmers as they arrived in the beginning as he had done yesterday he kept them out of the camp but soon the numbers of eager farmers multiplied all arguing and pleading with him and the clerks and sisuthros grew careless some farmers carried their goods inside the camp seeking private purchasers others their trading completed just wandered in to satisfy their curiosity regarding eskkar and the akkadians only the wine and ale remained outside the camp away from the soldiers except for the lucky scribes who got to taste the goods in order to determine the quality and the price eskkar had given clear instructions on that issue sisuthros had assigned his most trustworthy men to guard the wineskins if the men got at the strong spirits half of them would be drunk within the hour and useless the rest of the day the sun had climbed high into the morning sky before sisuthros got rid of the last of the farmers and rejoined his captain by the gods captain i hate dealing with merchants and farmers every one of them wanted to argue about the price each claiming his loaf of bread or chicken was worth double what we offered i told you it would be harder than you thought still youd better get used to it are they coming back yes there will be more this afternoon but it went well i think good now tell me what you learned about ninazu grond was right eskkar hes the one with the silver bracelets they are afraid of him thats plain enough hes killed anyone whos opposed him theyd be happy if we drive him away eskkar nodded grimly at that yes that would please everyone now tell me what else you learned part of buying and selling was talking the farmers felt curious about the soldiers and the new city of akkad and seemed willing to offer up information about ninazu in his turn sisuthros had described to them how wonderful life had become in akkad now that the barbarians had been vanquished never to return again and prosperity restored under eskkars enlightened and just rule sisuthros related the tale of the defeat of the barbarians three times each version with more detail than the time before some of the farmers looked skeptical but the individual soldiers once theyd begun dealing with them helped convince the farmers as for ninazu none of them knew for sure but after much prodding from sisuthros and the scribes it seemed as though ninazu had at least a hundred and twenty fighting men as the story went the bandit leader had waited until the village had started to reestablish itself after the passing of the barbarians when the villagers had trickled back to their homes and farms ninazu had sent a few of his men into bisitun to spy on the inhabitants then only a month ago he and at least fifty men had suddenly ridden into the village hed killed the two village elders who had returned to their homes then executed a few more brave souls who resisted or spoke out against him at fi rst ninazus men had taken what they wanted but in the last two weeks hed begun restraining his followers trying to win over the villagers and gain their support despite his harsh treatment of the villagers ninazu now had plenty of men many of them recruited from the local countryside while others had ridden in from the west eager to join up and seduced by tales of easy plunder eskkar knew well that old story one he had experienced himself not so long ago though the less anyone learned about his past the better he didnt feel sorry for what he had done instead he felt embarrassed by the fact he and his raiders half drunk and still hung over from too much ale had been taken by surprise a band of barbarian warriors had secretly watched him capture a village and plunder it for two days before they swooped down on him and his band overwhelming them in moments his luck had saved him again hed escaped clinging to his horse and fleeing for his life most of his men killed or captured the rest scattered to the winds he put that uncomfortable memory out of his mind good work sisuthros just make sure you dont make it too easy for them let them pick up scraps of information from the men weve been very careful captain the scribes are talking freely though they still record every sale and the price we pay eskkar frowned at that he couldnt get away from the everpresent scribes who spent their lives counting and recording not only men and animals but bags of grain loaves of bread the numbers of swords and bows already one pack animal groaned under its load of small clay tablets youll have to deal with the scribes remember trella and nicar will check every item as well so take care or theyll take any losses out of our pay that remark brought a grin to both men eskkar had no more coins in his purse today than when hed first wandered into akkad and the only pay sisuthros would see remained inside bisitun still waiting to be earned the village would first have to be taken then nursed back to prosperity before sisuthros saw any gold for himself but he would rule here in eskkars name and both men understood that in time the gold would come sisuthros stayed with eskkar until midafternoon when the next ragged column of farmers appeared on the road this group about twentyfive men and ten women was larger than the one this morning most of the same farmers had returned their carts once again loaded with bread fruit vegetables a scrawny chicken or two and even a few skins of strong wine some of the women carried very little and eskkar guessed that what they had for sale was not necessarily what they carried in their baskets well a little business of that kind wouldnt hurt his men except in their purses sisuthros repeated the process from the morning at first he held the farmers outside the camp until the press of business and time made discipline relax and he let them deliver their goods inside there they mingled with the soldiers everyone still curious about each other this time eskkar thought one or two of the strangers had looked toward him with more than idle curiosity the afternoon trading lasted almost two hours before sisuthros finally got the last one out of the camp and on his way a few of the women wanted to remain and sisuthros had to line up the men to make sure they were all truly gone afterward he had to deal with the scribes for a few moments before he joined grond and eskkar by the gods if i had to do that every day id fall on my sword sisuthros exclaimed im beginning to hate all traders and merchants and the whores thank the gods they wont be back tomorrow the farmers had been told not to come back until the day after tomorrow the men from akkad now had more than enough supplies to last a few days you wont do very well running bisitun with that attitude eskkar commented did any of them seem unusual yes captain there were two or three that looked a little different one had soft hands and looked as if he hadnt farmed in some time he kept looking around and asking the scribes plenty of questions i noticed that one wandering through the camp and talking to the men eskkar knew it would take the spy or spies several hours to get back into bisitun now that eskkars men blocked the main road informers would have to go upriver a bit then hug the riverbank until they reached the village or if they had a boat readied they could float down to bisitun either way by this evening ninazu would have his report he would know his opponents camp was strong and secure the men confident and relaxed and that a large group of reinforcements would be joining up soon now eskkar wondered what ninazu would do with the information ninazus choices would be limited he could try and wait it out inside the village trusting to his palisade to stop the akkadians the problem with that plan was that if eskkar really had almost two hundred men and the skill to use them effectively ninazu wasnt likely to stop them and once his followers learned of the coming reinforcements the fi ght would go out of many of them they hadnt joined up with ninazu to cross swords in a close desperate battle for bisitun no they sought after easy loot not a death fight another choice for ninazu would be to slip across the river that way would always be open to him but ninazu wouldnt want to leave a big wealthy village behind one that would immediately be fortified against him he would then be in the position of trying to keep a motley group of bandits together in lands already plundered while having no secure base of operations the akkadians would start hunting him within days while his men would start lusting after ninazus personal booty that choice wouldnt look too attractive to ninazu either as eskkar saw it that left ninazu with only one other course of actionattack the akkadians before the reinforcements arrived overwhelm them and take their weapons faced with such a defeat the supposed reinforcements might turn back at the least ninazu would be no worse off than he was now a victory might even give his men the courage and resolve to resist another group of besiegers the rider had come from akkad only yesterday and it would be dark before news of the reinforcements reached bisitun it wasnt likely ninazu could get his men ready on such short notice to attempt anything tonight eskkar intended to keep the pressure on ninazu to continue forcing him to react as eskkar wanted tonight the next step of the plan would begin the one that would draw the noose around ninazu even tighter as the afternoon waned eskkar met with his commanders and the fifteen men chosen for the initial raid theyd had to wait until all the farmers moved well away from the camp the carefully selected soldiers received their instructions and eskkar used the few hours before darkness to make sure sisuthros and the men knew exactly what to do only after eskkar felt satisfied did they gather around the campfire for the evening meal nevertheless eskkar kept reviewing the details of the attack during dinner speaking to each man making sure each knew his assignment finally even eskkar could find nothing wrong he went off by himself to try and get some sleep leaving word to wake him when the men were ready sleep came slowly eskkar had never sent men out on a raid before had never delegated such a command to another always he had led sorties like this himself to send others out into danger while he remained safe in camp seemed unmanly but he knew that he couldnt risk his own life on such a small raid just as he knew sisuthros could easily direct the men at midnight grond woke eskkar from a restless sleep sisuthros and his men stood ready each standing by his horse eskkar gripped sisuthros by the shoulder then stood aside as his subcommander led the first two of his men out of the camp the rest of the soldiers left two at a time after a slow count to one hundred so that the horses wouldnt get nervous in the darkness and begin whinnying or making sounds that might alert any keen ears in bisitun eskkar knew horses could do strange things at night spooking at some shadow the moon or even a breeze each man would walk his horse a full half mile before mounting and waiting for the rest of the men to join up when all the riders assembled they would pace their horses at a slow step for another mile before turning north the last of them disappeared from sight and nothing remained for eskkar to do except wait he didnt expect ninazu to launch an attack tonight but eskkar wanted his remaining men alert and ready just in case the moon had risen late and progressed steadily across the starry sky the scouts stationed between the camp and the village came in at regular intervals all reporting no activity from bisituns defenders eskkar paced back and forth checking with the men as he went urging them to stay vigilant time seemed to slow the moons journey across the night and he thought morning would never come a few moments before dawn the sound of hoofbeats came from the south though expected the sentries gave the challenge sisuthros called out his name in a loud voice though the approaching horses slowed to a walk a hundred paces from the camp eskkar gave the word and soldiers lit torches that revealed a smiling sisuthros leading his horse back into the encampment as sisuthros and the others passed in eskkar grasped him by the arm and pulled him aside did it go well we heard nothing from here sisuthross grin turned into a laugh yes captain it went well they never heard a thing if we had more men we could have forced our way in by the river ill wager they dont notice anything until well after sunup you mean they saw nothing and the men all went according to plan by now everyone pressed round sisuthros and his band who came in laughing and swaggering pleased with themselves and the ease of their mission tell us what happened we walked the horses until we were out of earshot then rode to the northern part of the river men jostled each other to hear sisuthross words every one eager to learn about the first action against bisitun i sent the rest of the riders with all the horses downstream of the village telling them to swing wide of the encampment my men and i boarded the boats with no problems the scouts had found a farm a few miles upriver that possessed two small boats probably used mainly for fishing but each large enough to carry a few men no doubt by now the puzzled farmer wondered who had stolen his vessels we let the boats drift downstream sisuthros went on just before we reached bisitun four men from each boat slipped into the water and clung to the boats sides sisuthros had chosen only strong swimmers for this raid men who stood ready to trust themselves to the rivers current to carry them to safety if need be we drifted in among the vessels at the rear of the village sisuthros continued we untied or cut the ropes mooring all the boats there and shoved them well out into the current it didnt take long and we stood by in the boats to carry the men off as soon as someone raised the alarm we heard no outcry here sisuthros eskkar said no one gave the alarm we could see guards walking the palisade but they noticed nothing and no one raised a cry the sound of the river must have muffled the noise the guards were that lax in their duties eskkar couldnt believe it they never saw you at all no we made certain the current took all the boats downstream then with our men again clinging to the sides of their boats we followed making sure none of the boats had grounded a mile downriver we found our men and horses waiting and rode back well done sisuthros youre sure you cut all the boats loose every one we gave the river gods many offerings for whatever gods and fortunate farmers live downstream everyone laughed sisuthros had to repeat his story in more detail his men adding their own actions by the time he finished the torches had gone out and the sun climbed above the horizon in the eastern sky eskkar a smile on his face for the first time in many hours ordered the men to get some food and rest while he sat atop the rampart and watched the village so far the plan that he had fi rst sketched out in his mind back in dilgarth continued to progress smoothly when hed learned the size of ninazus force he had known that even though he could probably take the village by direct assault he would lose far too many men in the process no he knew he needed to capture bisitun quickly and with a minimum of casualties to his valuable men besides he needed the village and its inhabitants as intact as possible now in less than two days and thanks to sisuthross wellexecuted raid eskkar had bottled ninazus men in the village now the next part of the plan would begin ninazu and his men would have plenty to worry about theyd seen firsthand that they faced a disciplined force real soldiers who could throw up a fortified camp in less than a day the threat of reinforcements coming soon would make some of them think about moving on with all the boats gone ninazus quick escape across the river would be greatly reduced at this time of the year a strong horse ridden by a good rider who could swim himself if necessary might make it across but that rider couldnt carry much loot and eskkar was willing to wager that if ten good men attempted it three or four would likely drown so ninazu would have to fight or run before his own men began to slip away not that eskkar wanted them to run he didnt want them plundering up and down the river for the next few weeks with his akkadians wasting their days in pursuit he wanted most of the bandits dead and the rest as slave labor to rebuild bisitun the village shone in the morning light as the sun moved ever higher in the sky and eskkar fancied he saw fewer defenders than yesterday everyone inside bisitun would know about the loss of the boats and worry if not fear or panic would start taking its toll some would be thinking about escape the more they thought about escaping the less willing they would be to fight eskkar decided to apply more pressure he turned back to the encampment and found grond waiting there a few steps behind him grond get the men on their horses send ten riders and ten archers to each side of the encampment if any in the village want to make a run for it make sure they have to fight their way out i dont want anyone going in or out of bisitun grond relayed the orders to hamati and the other men it took only a few minutes to get the forty men chosen something to eat and send them on their way when they reached their positions each detachment would block any escape attempt by anyone on foot or mounted to pass through bisituns back gate and follow the river to safety of course if the defenders came out in strength on either side then the situation would change but they talked about even that possibility while the full force of the bandits could certainly ride through twenty men it might take some time and with enough time the rest of the akkadians from the main camp might catch them with their backs against the river what eskkar thought more likely was that a hundred men would burst out of the front gate and attempt to ride right through or around the encampment he now had only thirtytwo fighting men plus the scribes boys and liverymen remaining to defend the camp eskkar had stretched his forces very thin but he needed to act as if he had the upper hand as soon as the men in the camp finished their meal he had them ready their weapons and stand to their posts with his men in place he returned to the embankment and watched the palisade once again the man with the silver bracelets stood there studying the akkadians and undoubtedly making plans of his own nevertheless the loss of ninazus boats changed the situation and now the ground outside the palisade with its tumbleddown houses worked to eskkars advantage men on horseback would only have a clear path directly down the main road which would send them straight at the encampment or along the rivers edge where they would encounter archers and mounted men ninazu would see all this as could his men and they would begin to worry for days ninazu had assured his men that they could easily fight off eskkars small force from behind the palisade instead the bandits could see a hard fight ahead of them if they tried to escape moreover the worst worry of all would be knowing that in two or three days another strong force would reinforce the attackers grond returned to join him all the men are in position captain sisuthros and hamati are getting some sleep but the rest of the men are resting at their posts watch the walls grond if they all decide to run for it the guards on the palisade will slowly be replaced by villagers theyll be nervous and frightened that might give us warning do you think theyll run eskkar thought about that his brother was brave enough i dont think ninazu will give up bisitun without a fight besides he sees us splitting our force and that will make him wonder what we will do when night falls if he thinks that weve weakened our force here he may fall into our trap once again eskkar went though the thought process i still think he will come tonight with a large force right at our camp he faced his bodyguard who still stood there doubt still written on his face i know grond i have my own doubts but if he does nothing and another hundred men appear hell be trapped his men will run if he does nothing eskkar shrugged well thats what i would do but i am not him so well have to wait and see are you sure that we can withstand them if he sends everyone against us these are bandits grond not alur meriki warriors they have no clan or family to fight for no code of bravery to sustain them they are held together only by their lust for gold if thirty of us cannot break them he shook his head and headed back to the rear of the camp the daylight hours dragged by one by one with eskkar pacing back and forth the camp had to appear no different from the day before so all the regular activities continued men stood to their watches cooking fires sent smoke into the sky and anyone not standing guard relaxed on the embankment watching the village the detachments on either side of bisitun reported in but they saw no sign of anyone trying to cross the river or escape along its banks sisuthros after he had taken his rest declared that to be a good signif they werent trying to run then they would be ready to fight as the afternoon began to lengthen eskkar sisuthros hamati and grond met once again and began to prepare for the nights work they went over everything for almost two hours thinking of what could go wrong what evil chance could upset their plans what they would do if the plan failed and even what they would do if they were beaten the soldiers started the evening fires and prepared their meal before eskkar and his subcommanders finished at least the men continued eating well thanks to his largess with the local farmers with dinner finished eskkar and his commanders met with the other senior men the thirty men in the camp would be at the greatest risk and eskkar wanted them to know exactly what he expected of them each of the subcommanders went over it yet again this time with their men eskkar watched looking for signs of confusion but saw nothing but confidence no one showed any fear or doubted their ability to beat off an attack the men believed in him believed in his luck if nothing else at last it was time to go take care sisuthros and good hunting to all of us grond had made all the preparations and he and eskkar slipped out of the camp they took their time moving across the dark landscape swinging wide to their rear lest some chance fl ash of moonlight revealed them to any sharpeyed guards on the village palisade eskkar didnt want to trip and sprain an ankle in the darkness finally they joined up with the men who guarded the southern edge of the river the small camp had only a single fire burning in front of it lighting the darkness between it and the village the men sat well back from the firelight waiting for eskkar to arrive theyd spent the afternoon practicing their archery the same as they had done every day before and during the siege of akkad and talking over what situations they would likely encounter and how they would respond every one of these bowmen could loose a properly aimed arrow every three seconds and some even faster now they waited confident in the skills and in their leaders grond had briefed them earlier in the day but as soon as eskkar joined them they checked their preparations again these men were eager anxious to go on the offensive and ready to take their chances five of them were already hawk clan members and another seven mostly experienced fighters looked to prove themselves worthy of such an honor mitrac waited there leaning on his bow next to the two men he had considered his best archers both men who had fought beside hamati at dilgarth even eskkar felt satisfied that everyone knew what to do midnight passed without event eskkar could do nothing to make the time pass faster not even pace around if ninazus attack came it would likely be when the moon began to set about two hours before dawn too excited and nervous to rest or sleep eskkar and his men just waited most of them lay on their backs and watched the silver orb slowly cross the night sky at last the moon began to fade the time had arrived eskkar sat on the ground drumming his fingers against his leg a bad habit he had picked up during the siege of akkad he didnt like anyone knowing he felt nervous and he stopped the motion the moment he became conscious of it except for the faint crackling of the fire eskkar could hear nothing another hour crept by and still he heard no sign of any activity he wanted to start moving but he didnt dare take the chance any unusual sound might stop ninazus attack if ninazu even did plan to attack tonight it should have come by now his doubts growing every moment eskkar had just decided that he had guessed wrong when a shout went up from the akkadians main encampment a moment later someone hurled a torch into the sky sisuthross signal an attack had begun shouts drifted across the black ground without any commands eskkar and his men started to advance trying to make as little noise as possible they swung wide around their small fire in single file they moved rapidly toward the southern corner of the village each man following the man ahead of him mitrac led the way hed studied the ground during the day and now eskkar and the others followed him behind mitrac strode his two picked archers trailed by eskkar grond and the rest of the men time moved quickly and they soon drew close to the village where it came closest to the river when mitrac stopped less than a hundred paces separated them from the palisade they crouched among the rubble and hoped no one watched this side of the village too closely mitrac and his chosen archers disappeared into the darkness sound continued to drift in from the front of the village though eskkar couldnt tell what any of it meant for all he knew his men in the camp had been overrun and slaughtered or they had already driven back ninazus men whatever the result eskkar was committed and they hadnt much time he hoped any sentries watching this side of the village would be lax their attention focused on events happening in front of the main gate precious moments dragged by with no movement or activity from mitrac eskkar couldnt control his patience he hated to restrain himself from action when all his instincts urged him to the attack he started to move forward when one of mitracs men slipped back to his side come he whispered mitrac killed the sentry eskkar and the others began to move crouched over they crept straight toward the base of the palisade which they reached in moments unlike akkad bisitun had no ditch to give added height to the wooden fence no alarm had been given yet but at any moment they could be discovered they reached the base of the palisade hugging close to the rough timbers grond and another man unslung the ropes they carried coiled across their chests one end of each rope had been fitted with a short block of wood wide enough to secure the line against the top of the palisade mitrac had already scaled the fence boosted up by his companion and now stood guard atop the barrier grond tossed the two ropes up and mitrac wedged the wooden blocks behind the tops of the logs the two archers started climbing the timbers creaking under their weight though they hoped not loud enough to attract any attention eskkar could barely contain himself the sounds of fighting had increased from the direction of the main gate or perhaps the defenders cheered their own victory either way eskkar could no longer tolerate doing nothing if sisuthros had not held the camp if he had not driven back ninazus men no it was too late to worry about that the instant the two archers disappeared overhead eskkar grabbed one of the ropes and began to climb grond pushed him from below and the rough wood of the stockade gave eskkar some purchase the vertical beams creaking a little louder under his heavier weight he reached the top and one of the archers waiting there pulled him over eskkar dropped down to his knee and looked about until he saw mitrac kneeling on the rampart a few steps away the bodies of two men lay in front of him but already the arrows had been pulled or broken off from their bodies the silhouette of an arrow sticking out of a corpse was too easy to identify even at night eskkar crept over to the archer what do you see eskkar asked softly two more sentries up ahead but they face the front of the village mitrac whispered he held his bow at an angle with an arrow fitted to the string theyre staring at the main gate even as eskkar glanced in that direction he saw some flames shoot up into the sky crouched down he couldnt see the front of the village suddenly a flaming arrow streaked up into the sky and fell over the wall he grunted in satisfaction at the signal sisuthros and his forces had not only held the camp theyd driven back the attackers and started counterattacking the village with fire arrows using the black oil that drakis had brought up from akkad sisuthross men had made a hundred fire arrows wrapping cotton thickly around the shaft binding it with linen threads and soaking the tufts in oil when touched to fire the cotton would burst into flame a flame so hot that not even the arrows flight through the air could extinguish it the palisade behind him creaked again and eskkar turned to see grond come over the wall the last man to make the ascent eskkar looked down at the village beneath him the inner rampart stood only about ten feet off the ground and even in the dim starlight he could see a lane that seemed to lead toward the front of the village the smell of a slaughterhouse reached him and he could see animal pens below a few houses backed against the enclosure the village remained indistinct in the darkness lit here and there by torches or watch fires but dawn approached and already the eastern sky seemed a bit less dark as he watched villagers emerged from the houses roused from their sleep by the noise talking excitedly and all looking in the direction of the main gate that might change at any moment and eskkar had to get his soldiers off the rampart he turned to grond get the men down now moving as he spoke eskkar grasped the edge of the rampart and swung to the ground his men joined him all except mitrac who called softly to his two archers eskkar paused briefly watching as the three bowmen stood up drew their bows and launched their arrows at the sentries who guarded the next position on the palisade he heard a faint cry followed by the sound of a body thudding to the earth but nothing more no outcry or alarm mitrac followed by his two men paced slowly along the rampart anyone giving them a casual glance would take them for sentries ignoring the rampart for now eskkar started off striding with authority followed by grond and eleven other men it took only a few paces before they had to push their way past the first confused villagers nothing distinguished them from any of ninazus men in the darkness they would seem merely another group of ninazus followers moving toward the main gate eskkar saw one mans mouth open in surprise as he shrank back from them but the man said nothing and in a moment theyd moved well past the lane forked and eskkar didnt know which way to go so he grabbed the first villager he encountered an older man whose white hair shone in the dim light as eskkars hand tightened on the old mans arm the man froze helpless as much from sudden fear at these men as the hard muscles in eskkars grip which way is the quickest to the main gate the mans mouth opened but no words came and eskkar repeated the question shaking the man as he did which way the man pointed to the left and eskkar kept his grip on the man as they resumed walking dragging his unwilling guide with him the lane twisted left and forked again but this time eskkar had only to look at the man and he gestured the way a few more steps and eskkar could see his destination he loosened his grip a little return to your house and keep silent or ill slit your throat he pushed the man aside and increased his pace fire blazed from the outer fence and two watch fires had been lit in fire pits on either side of the gate sisuthross arrows would have started fires in several places and now his men shooting from the darkness would be targeting any defenders who attempted to put out the flames ninazus men had recovered from their shock men raced to the ramparts and cries for water echoed all around them a dozen villagers pressed into service carried buckets of water from the well to extinguish the arrows in the gate eskkar paid no attention to all that his eyes searching until he saw what he wanted a house with a low roof that faced the open ground behind the gate the passage to the house remained closed but even as eskkar approached prepared to put his shoulder to it the door opened an elderly woman wearing nothing but a loose shift bumped into him obviously intending to see what all the commotion was about instead eskkar pushed her back in his hand over her mouth to keep her silent though she seemed too frightened to cry out inside two more women and some children had roused themselves fearful at the sounds of fighting that now rang through the village grond swept them together into a corner of the hut keep your mouths shut if you want to live he ordered meanwhile eskkar climbed the flimsy ladder that opened on to the roof from the housetop torches and the burning fence illuminated the scene before him he knelt down taking everything in as he studied the situation the outer palisade blazed in three places and without immediate water the fire would soon be unstoppable villagers with water buckets rushed about pouring water down the palisade on the ground just inside the main gate a dozen men stood two of them with arrows still protruding from them ninazus men struggled to fight the fire and the attackers at the same time while others rounded up more villagers to bring water eskkar noticed plenty of men carrying weapons and standing about talking loudly and gesturing in frustration obviously ninazu hadnt lost too many in his attack on the camp eskkar guessed that most of the bandits had turned and run back as soon as they realized their foes waited for them he sought to pick out the leaders those trying to restore order to the mass of confused and panicky men grond tapped him on the shoulder all the soldiers had climbed up on the roof and knelt behind him including mitrac and his two men every akkadian had a bow except eskkar and grond who carried only their swords eskkar turned to mitrac there see them to the right of the gate and the one at the well and those two on the rampart mitrac nodded as eskkar pointed out the first targets mitrac took over pushing in front of eskkar and moving closer to the edge of the roof eskkar stepped farther back and shoved the wooden frame that covered the access hole to the roof into place he didnt want anyone coming up behind them the dry rasp of arrows on wood sounded as eskkars thirteen archers stood up bows drawn as mitracs low voice prepared the men for the first release then mitrac drew his own arrow to his ear and released even after all these months eskkar still found himself amazed at mitracs skill he scarcely seemed to aim and yet the shaft that vanished into the darkness would no doubt find its mark while another arrow seemed to leap from his quiver to the bowstring the other men fired as well and immediately the screams started it would take the defenders a few moments to figure out that theyd been attacked and many of their leaders would be down before they turned and located their attackers the men mitrac had chosen for this raid had proven themselves among the best archers in the troop and now despite being crowded together they poured arrows into their enemies at a rate that made them seem like twice their number the roof gave eskkars men clear shots and the watch fires burning at the gate provided plenty of light for their shooting for the defenders the shafts seemed to come out of the darkness and at such short range little more than forty paces the heavy shafts with their bronze leafshaped points struck with lethal accuracy before a man could count to fifty the akkadian archers swept the area beneath the gate clear of defenders the defenders tripping and scrambling down from the walls some of them tossing their bows and buckets aside out of the corner of his eye eskkar made note of every time the closest archer fired the man had released his tenth arrow before anyone spotted them and another four volleys were launched before anyone turned a bow against them eskkar couldnt count that quickly but he guessed nearly two hundred arrows had been launched enough to break any small group of men let alone those still recovering from being defeated by sisuthros at the camp the bandits broke and ran determined to get out of the killing zone with the defenders fleeing eskkar called out to grond who raised a small trumpet to his lips and blew a long blast that echoed out over the walls and into the darkness eskkar heard an answering sound from the akkadians outside the gate sisuthros and his men now pressed their attack in earnest the trumpet announcing that most of the defenders had abandoned the walls they screamed and howled like wild men as they charged every man shouting at the top of his lungs as ordered they carried with them the rest of the ropes and would soon be over the palisade and into the village even if the gate remained fastened eskkar kept his eyes moving and finally saw for what he searched a flash of silver in the flames and he saw the leader of the defenders on the move eskkar cursed the bad luck that let the man survive the archers arrows now ninazu would need to be hunted down and killed before he could escape over the fence into the darkness no even now the darkness had started to give way to dawn and the fi rst rays of the sun already climbed slowly into the heavens grond mitrac come with me eskkar ran to the side of the house and swung himself down grond mitrac and his two archers following him ninazu and a group of his men were moving down one of the village streets already out of sight and no doubt headed toward the river gate the bandits horses would be kept there close to the rear gate and the river ninazu had decided to run for it the bandit leader would have no idea how many soldiers had slipped inside bisitun not that it made any difference with all the casualties his men had taken the akkadians now outnumbered them more important ninazus men had lost the will to fight every bandits thought would be on fleeing the village and saving his own skin to stay meant death within hours the villagers would turn in or denounce any of ninazus men still in bisitun only escape could save them now eskkar didnt care if a few dozen leaderless bandits escaped but a man like ninazu who could organize and lead others would only cause more trouble if he remained on the loose ninazu must be stopped before he escaped in his younger days eskkar believed his strength and skill with a sword had brought men to follow him now he knew better as trella said those skills might be useful but they didnt make a man a true leader a good leader shed told him could think months ahead as he bent men to his will a great leader she added could think years ahead eskkar didnt consider himself a great leader but he knew he didnt want to be chasing ninazu around the countryside for the next few months so now he and his men ran headlong down the lane ignoring the frightened villagers who screamed and shouted in terror panicked by the fi res that lit the sky and worried their entire village might go up in flames for the fi rst time that night eskkar drew his sword raising it up over his head as he lowered his shoulder to clear the way whenever some panicked villager blundered into his path but before they had gone very far grond passed eskkar whirling his sword overhead as he opened the way for his captain then the lane widened and converged with the other and they ran right into ninazu and his followers the bandits had started first but they had the farthest distance to travel and the two lanes joined here eskkar guessed ninazu had twelve or fifteen men with him at least three times eskkars group but these confused men had only flight on their minds half of them kept running screaming in fear while the others turned raising their swords more in surprise than anything else grond struck down two of them with two rapid strokes eskkar slashed at another the man parried the stroke but the force of the blow took all the fight out of him and he turned and ran eskkar and grond kept running hardly slowing their pace and still pursuing the fleeing ninazu and his men this time the narrow streets and villages worked to eskkars advantage the frightened villagers slowed ninazus men one of them stumbled and grond slashed at the man as he ran past opening a gaping wound in the mans shoulder another man tried to duck into a house but a woman peered out from the doorway and they collided eskkar struck at the mans back and again a scream went up into the night as the wounded man staggered against the doorframe eskkar and grond ignored their victims wounded bandits would be easy to gather up later he and grond burst into an open area where two lanes joined eskkar caught the stable smell even before he heard the animals whinnying in fear of all the shouting and the scent of fire someone attempted to rally the bandits at the corral three of ninazus men turned to face their pursuers but others pushed their way into the corral diving through the enclosures fl imsy bars three men or a dozen meant nothing to eskkar he and grond charged ahead like men possessed each of them shouting at the top of his lungs they rushed at the bandits one raised his sword and died when eskkars blade struck twice once to knock the sword aside and then a killing thrust before the man could recover the other bandits changed their minds before grond could reach them one dropping his sword and diving through the corral the screams of horses split the darkness and one of them reared up crashing into the corral the horses weight knocked the bars loose and the frightened animal pushed its way through the gap another riderless horse followed two more horses loomed up men clinging to their necks as eskkar reached the fence one horseman swung a sword at eskkars head he sprang aside then dropped low as he thrust his sword into the horses rear leg the horse whinnied in fear and pain then twisted as its leg gave way stumbling into the second horse and sending both riders tumbling to the ground a third bandit attempted to ride through the cleared opening but an arrow struck him square in the chest and the man slid backward off the horse eskkar turned his head for a second mitrac had caught up to his leader and stood to the side of the lane already aiming a second shaft all the horses still inside the pen had panicked now moving away from the entrance of the corral after they bunched up in the rear they turned in unison and moved forward once again terrorstricken animals would not be easy to mount eskkar tried to see past them the nights darkness had turned to gray and in a few more moments the sun would be up he swore again he wouldnt let ninazu get away now grond mitrac shoot the horses with those words eskkar rose up bringing the great sword up over his head and striking directly at a horse that suddenly appeared charging right at him the horse shied away just enough for eskkar to move out of its path even as he struck the blow at the beasts head the animals cry of agony rose up its shoulder knocking eskkar to the ground he rolled away but even before eskkar regained his feet the horse had taken an arrow in its neck the two wounds driving it beyond control another horse went down then a third their almosthuman cries mixing with the noises of panic from the other beasts but the remaining horses turned away moving once again toward the rear of the corral one animal riderless jumped the fence in panic its hooves kicking the top rail to splinters eskkar looked again into the corral with the first rays of dawn he had just enough light to pick out two forms both of them struggling to hold on to their mounts another man lay senseless on the ground while a fourth pushed himself up from the dirt trying to get to his knees one of mitracs arrows took him and he pitched forward without a sound then three more men from akkad rushed up behind eskkar swords in hand calling out as they did so by now between the dead or dying animals and eskkars men any chance of escaping from the corral had ended alive eskkar shouted take them alive he wanted ninazu in one piece if possible to show the villagers the power of akkad grond shouted something too and mitracs young voice cried out reminding his archers to aim at the horses the bandit leader had not given up yet he and his companion each holding on to a horses halter pushed against the rear of the corral in a moment theyd knocked two of the wooden bars from their fastening immediately the frightened horses took advantage breaking through this new gap ninazu and the last of his followers swung up onto their mounts hugging the animals necks as they urged their beasts into the opening but this new passage led directly into a narrow lane forcing the frightened horses to turn sharply more chaos ensued as the animals jammed together for a moment mitrac and his archers moved forward and loosed their shafts one arrow either on purpose or by mistake struck one of the escaping men in the back the other two struck ninazus horse in the haunches and the animal whinnied in agony reared up and crashed into the wall of a house the flimsy mud bricks gave way and both man and beast half fell into the dwelling amidst a swirl of dust and crumbled mud by then eskkar had raced through the shambles of the corral ducking away from one horse that reared up at him and pushing another aside until he and grond reached the side lane up on the roof grond dont let him escape grond stepped back sheathed his sword and jumped for the top of the house pulling himself up and out of sight in moments eskkar shoved his way past another frightened horse until he reached the rubble of the halfcrushed house the dying animal still struggling to reach its feet behind eskkar the rest of the halfcrazed horses finally broke free hooves pounding as they made their escape from the smell of blood and death that filled the corral he saw ninazu there on his knees barely a shadow in the darkness at the rear of the house but a sword shone in the faint light the bandit had nowhere to go and even now the tip of gronds blade glinted at the top of the ladder the tiny houses only other exit ninazu was trapped mitrac rushed up as did several more of eskkars men shall i fi nish him captain he had an arrow on the string eskkar shook his head but kept his eyes on the trapped man put down your sword ninazu eskkar commanded youve no place to go for an answer ninazu leapt to his feet and flung himself at the opening eskkar saw mitrac start to draw the bow and knew that he wouldnt have time eskkar shoved mitrac to one side even as he jumped to the other ninazus blade flashed between them eskkar struck at the mans sword but ninazu recovered then thrust again with his own weapon eskkars own sword countered the stroke though he gave back half a step from the force of it ninazu raised his weapon to strike again a shout on his lips and charged forward then he jerked back his balance upset and his sword flailed wildly grond had dropped down from the roof landed on his feet and leaped on ninazu from behind yanking the man back by his hair with one hand as he caught the mans sword arm with his other eskkar ducked through the jagged opening his blade pointed up in the ready position as ninazu struggled with grond eskkar struck the bandit in the face with the butt of his sword the thick knob of bronze smashing against the mans nose stunning him grond tore the sword from ninazus slack fingers and struck him again with his free hand on the side of his head ninazu collapsed like a sack of grain unconscious before he hit the earth the fight for bisitun was over the same dawn that greeted eskkars victory found trella lying in her bed awake and already thinking about korthac yesterday afternoon the council had accepted korthacs petition and his gold to establish a trading house in akkad though hed complained loudly enough last week when given the terms hed handed over the forty gold coins with scarcely a comment to everyones surprise he offered up more than the coins presenting a large peridot crystal to each of the seven council members a small gift he explained to express his appreciation show the value of his goods and encourage further purchases from his stock each of the gemstones glittered even in the dimly lit council room the dark green crystals tinged with a hint of yellow trellas peridot stood out in quality from the other fine stones much larger and with a deeper shade of green enhanced by the wellpolished surface trella would have preferred not to accept the costly bribe but even she could not go against the looks and words of the other council members who quickly took their gifts as they gave thanks to korthac hers of course would be sold to help pay eskkars expenses gifts for council members were nothing new but since they all had wealth in their own right they had little need for outright bribery no trella recognized this more subtle offering korthac wanted friends in high places influential friends who could assist him in the future in a way that she still couldnt fathom sleeping on it hadnt helped and this morning the puzzle remained unresolved that meant more positive steps would be needed to uncover the mystery after breakfast she waited for annoksur to return every morning annoksur walked the village giving those with information a chance to meet with her away from their homes or places of labor some women dared not venture far from their husbands sight by moving about annoksur gave these women free or slave the opportunity to pass along what their men said or did the previous night more than once trella had garnered useful information through this informal network when annoksur returned midmorning had just passed alone in the workroom trella fingered the gold coin that hung around her neck as she faced annoksur across the table have we learned anything further anything new about korthac only that hes ready today or tomorrow to purchase a place to live hes looked at a few houses but hes still staying at the inn and nothing from his men nothing from the women theyve approached people hes dealt with no nothing like that his men keep to themselves and stay close to the inn twice hes brought women back there for a few hours to entertain his followers but i havent found any woman wholl admit to pleasuring him annoksur shrugged perhaps he prefers men or boys though ive heard nothing of that either its been more than ten days and we still know little about him except he possesses a good deal of wealth and pays well trella reached out and touched the peridot that rested on the table between them we need to learn more you still think theres something amiss with him something in his past its not his past that worries me annoksur its his plans for the future hes hiding something im sure of it ive been thinking perhaps tammuz can discover what it is can you bring him tonight tammuz barely into his sixteenth season had ridden as a camp boy with eskkar at the start of the campaign against the alur meriki his one and only battle had shattered his arm and hed nearly died from his wounds the fight also ended his dream of becoming a soldier before joining eskkars fighters tammuz had survived as a petty thief but now even that life would be denied him with little to look forward to except life as a beggar the young man had been devastated trella always searching for friends and allies no matter what their station in life had devised a plan for him four months earlier she and eskkar gave tammuz enough silver to set himself up in a small alehouse in the worst part of akkad one catering to the poorest and most desperate inhabitants acting under the cover of his former profession tammuz joined trellas network of spies keeping his ears and eyes open for any plots against eskkars house gatus provided an old veteran injured while training for the siege to help tammuz run the establishment which soon became more a den of petty thieves than alehouse tammuz flourished better than trella hoped and had already supplied some minor but useful information ill escort him past the guards annoksur said youll want gatus here as well in case tammuz needs anything from him midnight would be the best time aside from eskkar gatus and annoksur no one knew of tammuzs new role even the founding hawk clan soldiers had already dismissed the memory of the crippled youth warriors formed the hawk clan and none of them expected eskkar to remember his campfire promise to an insignificant boy since the day he left eskkars compound tammuz had returned only once at night and with his face concealed by a cloak only gatus or annoksur could vouchsafe an unknown person past the house guards no two hours before midnight trella said i want you to bring zenobia here at midnight ah then its time to help her establish a house trella sighed its past time i think i wish wed helped her before but there was no time now well have to move faster annoksur laughed it wont take zenobia long to get noticed trella could laugh at that lets hope not that night gatus accompanied tammuz and annoksur into the workroom where two lamps burned an extravagance that lent weight to the importance of the meeting trella always paid close attention to peoples faces when they spoke and if that required burning extra oil she didnt consider it a waste she rose and bowed respectfully to the young man reminding herself not to count his seasons though he was much the same age as she as eskkar reminded her you dont treat someone whos killed an enemy in battle as a boy greetings tammuz she said thank you for coming tammuz pushed back the cloak that hid his face worn more to mask his identity than keep out the nighttime chill and bowed as well straightening up he pushed light brown hair away from his face revealing a broad smile my thanks to you lady trella its good to see you again trella returned the smile remembering how eskkar had saved tammuzs life then placed him in her care when tammuz smiled he looked like a young boy innocent though she recognized his growing maturity come she said sit down and tell me what youve been doing but first let me look at your arm the left arm had been broken in two places and out on the battlefield none of eskkars men knew how to set the break properly the ride back to akkad had almost killed the boy tammuz lost most of the use of his left hand and now the arm itself seemed shrunken bent and hanging at an odd angle but the young man lived and trella knew that life even as a cripple was preferable to death she ignored tammuzs embarrassment as she came around the table and helped him remove his cloak before taking his hand let me see you move your fingers she ordered have you kept to the healers advice i have lady trella though i dont think it much matters he says he says my arm will never be straight and theres nothing more he can do if it werent for you and captain eskkar his voice trailed off as he lowered his head theres no work for a man with one arm trella had not only nursed him back to health and made sure the healers did their best but shed given him a reason to live more than that she showed him a different way to fight a different kind of warfare that went on each day in the shadows where men whispered over cups of ale dont forget you are hawk clan tammuz we are always proud of you and you will never lack for friends trella lifted her hand to include gatus and annoksur sitting quietly at the other table besides what you do is more important than soldiering remember that i try to remember lady trella though it is hard sometimes as is your work you are our eyes and ears among the poor the thieves the prostitutes and the murderers with akkad growing in size each day there are many desperate men men who will steal cheat and kill more such will arrive in the coming months we need someone who can mingle with these people to learn the things eskkar needs to know do you have enough silver do you need more no lady trella not yet i collect a share of what my customers steal in return for letting them hide themselves and their goods in the alehouse and i resell a few items myself mostly small things that cant be traced back to me sometimes customers disappear leaving their goods behind its enough to keep food on the table and ale jars filled part of the arrangement with eskkar and trella was that tammuz need only report on things that concerned eskkars house trella did not care about petty crimes or cut purses nevertheless everyone knew that when the wealthy wanted a private murder done they often sought out and hired desperate men like those who frequented tammuzs establishment if you need more silver send word through annoksur or gatus she pulled the cloak back over his arm and returned to her chair leaning forward she focused her attention on tammuz along with his responses she would examine every expression gesture even the way he sat very little escaped her eyes and ears and she knew how to take stock of what she heard and observed and now i have something different to ask of you it may be dangerous tammuz shrugged ive learned much about danger in the last few months still i want you to be extra careful in this do you know of korthac the egyptian everyone knows of him i want to learn more about him especially more about his men its possible you may be able to find things out overhear something notice something trella told him what shed learned about korthac and what she suspected dont underestimate him tammuz he has sharp wits and knows how to lead men he may have been a soldier in egypt possibly a leader of soldiers our spies have learned nothing about him his men or his plans so do not think this will be easy you must not let him be aware of your interest anything you can discover even some small bit of gossip might be useful this is a challenge worthy of the hawk clan when i see the hawk clan walking the streets their heads held high sometimes lady trella i dont feel like a hawk clan you are hawk clan tammuz i know how you all swore an oath to help each other to fight to the death if necessary eskkar had described the horrific fighting and the pact the survivors had espoused he repeated the oath for her depicted the ceremony the wind blowing through the dunes and the fire casting its light on each mans face as they swore binding vows to each other no man could vouch such words and ever think of breaking his pledge while he drew breath you of course were unconscious or delirious most of the time but they swore for you just the same and remember tammuz someday there will be much more to the hawk clan than simple fighting in the next few years there will be more than just battles to be fought at their last meeting eskkar had reminded tammuz that the binding oath extended both ways he would always be a hawk clan a true brother warrior to eskkar and his clan now it is time to speak of other things have you thought about taking a wife tammuzs mouth fell open in surprise at the odd question a wife why who would want to be with a cripple you are old enough and you own an alehouse trella said ignoring his question that makes you a man of substance annoksur thinks you can use some help someone you can trust and gatus agrees ive picked out a slave girl for you shes only a season or two older than you if she proves agreeable and dutiful we can free her for marriage if youre not pleased with her for any reason you can return her to me gatus watching and listening from a stool placed against the wall couldnt repress a chuckle you should see your face tammuz a woman isnt the worst thing in the world at least not all the time tammuz looked at gatus then back to trella i dont know what to say then please me in this and give her a chance enhedu is well suited to you tammuz and has her wits about her she is strong enough to work hard and free you for your other duties she needs to be treated well her previous owner drank too much wine and beat her often you must be gentle with her and patient until she forgets her former master she is not beautiful but i think she will be loyal especially if you treat her with respect ive spoken to her several times and told her about you trella leaned back in her chair feeling the child move within her would you consider taking her lady trella if you think it best but ive never been with a woman and she might think my arm bring her in annoksur trella said tell her nothing about the hawk clan tammuz thats to remain our secret for now at least other than that you can tell her anything and dont worry about what you know or dont know she will guide you through ishtars mystery a few moments later the door creaked open and annoksur led a tall sturdy young woman wearing a modest and patched shift into the workroom brown hair framed a plain but pleasant enough face except for her nose broken and never straightened properly afterward once again trella stood a sign of respect especially important to a slave and tammuz followed her example enhedu this is tammuz your new master you will obey him as if he were your husband he needs your help so i ask that you do all you can to assist him the girl looked at tammuz shyly showing a hint of apprehension at meeting a new master she bowed awkwardly then dropped her eyes to the floor tammuz seemed at a loss for words the sight touched one of trellas vivid memories she remembered a night not that long ago when she had been handed over still crying to her new master fear had rushed over her fear of the unknown that was the emotion a slave felt the most fear of the stranger who had the power of life and death over you trella walked over to enhedu took her hand and placed it in tammuzs good hand be good to enhedu tammuz trella looked at gatus who nodded and put his arm around tammuzs shoulders time to let trella get her rest gatus said with a yawn ill take you back to the alehouse by the time trella finished with the chamber pot midnight approached and she had only a few moments to wait before annoksur pushed open the door and guided zenobia into the room trella rose as zenobia approached the table once again the simple gesture had its effect throwing back her hood zenobia bowed very low as annoksur closed the door behind them now they could talk privately three women discussing things men should never hear i thank you for coming zenobia trella said you are well a woman of perhaps twentyfive seasons zenobia had deep black hair large brown eyes and a round face offering fine delicate features trella remembered how zenobia had looked months ago wearing a rough shift and with smudges of dirt covering her face frightened and bearing marks of ill treatment zenobia had done everything she could to make herself look unattractive an unprotected beautiful woman would have been quickly taken into some mans house never to emerge zenobia needed a benefactor somebody to protect her and make sure she was not enslaved again trella had provided that protection zenobia came from a land far to the east and had traveled many weeks before arriving at the village she hadnt been in akkad long arriving only a few days before the siege of akkad began shortly after her arrival she had met trella by chance during one of her walks zenobias story had been both sad and unfortunate but it created yet one more opportunity for trella raised as a pleasure slave since childhood zenobia had grown skillful at satisfying men shed pleased one of her patrons so much that he bought her and set her free despite his feelings for zenobia the patron saw a chance for gain and decided to establish his own pleasure house in the bountiful lands to the west with zenobias help he had purchased three slave girls to help launch the business hired a small caravan of guards and animals and set forth determined to reach akkad they journeyed for over a month crossing the eastern mountains and would have reached akkad in a few more days however the patron had become thick with wine once too often and abused his guards tired of his ill treatment they plotted with one of the local bandits together they attacked the caravan and killed the patron and his servants before turning their attentions to looting the pack animals and enjoying the women by then zenobia had escaped in the darkness running for her life leaving the other girls to their fate morning found her miles away having lost all her possessions except for a few silver coins sewn into her dress it had taken her three days to walk to akkad avoiding the roads for the fi rst two of those days for fear she would encounter the murderers or new robbers a woman alone especially an attractive one would be at the mercy of anyone she met she reached akkad in safety without a patron zenobia found work in one of the taverns cleaning tables and providing sex to customers and splitting her fees with the innkeeper encountering trella one afternoon in the marketplace zenobia had impulsively told her tale and the captains slave had immediately sensed an opportunity trella gave zenobia a few copper coins and told her to find a decent inn where she could sleep safely at night it hadnt taken trella long to figure out how zenobia could become an ally assuming any of them survived the barbarians besieging the city from time to time she sent annoksur to give zenobia more copper and to tell her to be patient a little while longer the siege had ended more than two months ago now the time had arrived zenobia trella began ive thought a great deal about you and your plight it occurs to me that we could be of great help to each other to serve my husband i need someone who can gather information from the rich and powerful in akkad with your experience and skills many men would whisper their secrets to you if you are willing i can provide protection for you and help you open a house of pleasure here in akkad zenobias eyes went wide at the prospect as doubts rushed to her lips mistress trella is such a thing possible to furnish a pleasure house with trained women would take much gold and a strong man would be needed to oversee such an establishment and there are the other brothels and alehouses to compete with i am not talking about just another brothel zenobia nor will there be any competition i want you to establish the finest pleasure house in the land and fi ll it with the most expensive women and the fi nest furnishings i have a strong protector in mind and he can provide men to guard the house and your women who would this protector be mistress trella gatus the captain of the guard will be the official owner of the house zenobia he will provide a soldier or two to keep order as well as a scribe to record all the profits and expenses he will take onetenth of the profits and i will take another fourtenths she watched zenobias eyes grow wider the rest would be yours alone there will be no man to take your share but mistress much gold is needed to start such a business a large house would have to be found girls must be recruited and trained furnishings bought fine wine and exotic foods must be available there is much that im glad you understand how difficult it will be zenobia but i have considered all these things as well to start i will loan you twenty gold coins more than enough to buy a goodsized house and furnish it properly it will probably take another ten coins before you are fully established especially if you begin your search for girls at the slave market im sure there are plenty of women in akkad who would be willing to work for you in the beginningand for very little trella paused for a moment to make sure zenobia understood her words if more gold is needed and all is proceeding well it will be provided six months from now you will begin repaying all the gold loaned to you at the rate of three gold coins each month that is in addition to our regular profits you will have to work very hard to make sure you are successful and there are other conditions as well are you interested zenobia the womans head bobbed up and down with excitement yes of course mistress i am very interested what else must i pay you need pay nothing further if you work hard and the house is successful you should be able to repay all of the loans within two years we would charge you no interest on the loan zenobia again she paused to let that information sink in you would be required to train the girls teach them the love arts and make sure they learn how to please their customers can you do that oh yes mistress trella i have been well trained myself and ive trained new girls for many years there is one more thing zenobia and this is the most important trella shifted her position on the chair to look directly into the womans eyes your establishment must be the best house of pleasure in akkad it must be the one place where all the rich and powerful men come to amuse themselves they will come for your women they will drink too much wine and they will talk about many things you will instruct your girls to report all that they hear only to you and you will pass it all on to annoksur or myself and you must do more than just listen you and two or three of your most trustworthy women must learn to extract as many secrets as possible you will reward those girls according to how much information they gather zenobia opened her mouth but trella continued on her voice harder now that is why we do this to gather information not because we wish to make a profit in a business arrangement you must make certain that no one learns of this no one only gatus and the three of us if any of the girls refuse to obey you will take whatever steps needed to make sure that they do i understand mistress it shall be as you say make very sure you understand me zenobia you will tell no one what you do with the information and you will keep silent about me also you will guarantee that none of your girls tell anyone especially their customers they must understand the penalty for careless talk as must you if you fail then you will be removed since you will not officially own any part of the business you would simply disappear so you will have great incentive to remain loyal and faithful zenobia swallowed nervously but didnt hesitate she had been in the village long enough to understand trellas meaning to disappear in akkad meant a splash in the river in the dark of night i will be loyal mistress none will learn of our arrangement trella smiled at her then reached out and gently took her hand when she spoke her voice sounded soft and pleasant again i am glad zenobia if you do this in a few years you will be rich and respected starting tomorrow you will meet with annoksur to begin the planning you will report only to annoksur or myself when you have listed all that you require and have an idea of the cost we will begin buying what you need yes mistress thank you mistress trella one more thing zenobia if you hear anything about korthac or his men anything you are to get the information to us at once the egyptian yes of course then we are agreed trella pushed back her chair and stood you will start tomorrow if all goes well in a few weeks you will have the finest pleasure house in akkad zenobia stood also and bowed again this time so low that her hair brushed the tabletop it will be as you say mistress trella i will learn all the mens secrets for you i promise it then we will both prosper zenobia annoksur stood also zenobia its too late to walk the streets annoksur said spend the rest of the night here ill escort you back to your home in the morning taking zenobias hand she led her from the workroom to one of the rooms below in a few moments annoksur returned to trellas presence well leave the house right before dawn with her cloak drawn no one will notice her thank you annoksur i think she will do well trella it will take many months perhaps years but zenobia will gather much useful information and you spoke to her with the voice of command with the voice of someone twice your seasons you know the ways of power and how to bend both men and women to your will yes i have learned much in the last few months trella answered a hint of bitterness in her voice when i was sold into slavery i was told a slave needs to learn quickly and so i am always learning from nicar from eskkar from the people of the village even from you annoksur i must be stronger and wiser than my seasons and i must hide my doubts if eskkar is to succeed she shook her head to banish the dark thoughts do you need any help to find the house or furnish it no i know what is needed annoksur replied but we should meet with gatus in the morning to make sure he is ready and understands his part in this new undertaking i think gatus will find this task to his liking perhaps zenobia will have the girls practice their arts on him they both smiled at the thought of the old soldier reclining in bed sipping fine wine and surrounded by eager women while counting his profits as long as they gather secrets trella said i just wish zenobia were already in business korthac and his men would be sure to visit her trella sighed the secretive egyptian seemed to be ever in her thoughts soon she hoped his riddle would be solved tammuz and his new slave followed gatus back to the alehouse where he grunted his goodnight without stopping tammuz watched the veteran soldier disappear into darkness down the lane hand on his sword while anyone walking around in the middle of the night could expect to be a target for robbers only someone blind drunk or very desperate would think of attacking the captain of the guard tammuz rapped three times on the door its tammuz kuri open up he waited glancing up and down the narrow lane enhedu still held on to his left hand an unfamiliar sensation he found surprisingly enjoyable hed taken her hand when they left trellas house before he remembered the need to keep his right hand free and close to the knife in his belt so he changed hands but discovered his crippled arm couldnt hold her properly as they walked before he could get frustrated enhedu had gently withdrawn her hand from his weak grasp and taken his left hand in her own holding him gently until they reached the alehouse the door creaked open at last and kuri stood there looking half asleep but holding his old copper sword in his hand a sour odor wafted out of the alehouse the old man smelled of barley ale on his breath and his garment his eyes widened in surprise at the sight of the girl fasten the door kuri tammuz stepped in leading his charge even in the best of neighborhoods you didnt stand about with the door open after dark no one else is to enter tonight inside he led his new slave carefully through the blackness of the main room trying to ignore the smells of ale sweat and worse his new slave would no doubt be disgusted by such a place especially after having lived at trellas house half a dozen snoring men slumbered on the fl oor the heavy sleep of those whod drunk too much ale before retiring late none of them woke as tammuz passed between them and into his private quarters at the back of the alehouse closing the door tammuz placed a rickety bar across the entrance the small room less than half the size of trellas workroom had no windows but a hint of moonlight filtered into the chamber from the roof opening like nearly every other humble dwelling in akkad the inhabitants slept on the roof during the hottest part of the summer tammuz unbuckled his belt and tossed it and his knife on a table then struggled to remove the unfamiliar cloak a covering he seldom wore enhedus hand reached out let me help you with that master she untied the cloak then folded it neatly and placed in on the table he stood there embarrassed at needing anyones help to remove a garment lady trella told me much about you master enhedu kept her voice low making sure her words could not be heard beyond the closed door she said you work in lord eskkars service so she knew about his duties just not that they considered him hawk clan its little enough that i do for lady trella he said she is a great lady without her help i would be dead either murdered by my master or by my own hand tammuz felt wide awake now despite the late hour and her words piqued his curiosity he guided enhedu to one of two stools that faced each other across the small table the only other furniture in the room beside the narrow bed a small chest and the ladder that provided access to the roof the darkness shielded them both and made it somehow easier for him to talk sit down would you like some ale or wine i have no nothing master the hour is late you should be asleep taking your rest i cant sleep now tell me about yourself how did you meet lady trella they spoke for almost an hour tammuz learned that enhedus parents had sold her at the slave market within days of her becoming a woman shed just entered into her thirteenth season and her parents pocketed ten silver coins for their virgin daughter her new master a tanner with his own shop put in long hours at his craft and made sure his new slave worked even harder when her masters labor ended at sundown enhedus continued he expected to be fed and pleasured long into the evening the slightest fault on her part resulted in a beating usually followed by a painful rape shed put up with it for three years before she overcame her fear and struck back in desperation thats when he broke her nose neighbors heard her cries and managed to stop him before he beat her to death the brutal beatings continued for the next few months two or three times a week some days she could hardly stand let alone work at the tannery a woman living nearby sought out trella and told her the story and the extent of the beatings trella and annoksur arrived the next day escorted by two hawk clan soldiers and offered the tanner five silver coins for his slave the man refused very well trella replied then i offer you four silver coins if you do not take them right now tomorrow you will find that no one will purchase your leather no one will sell you hides no one will sell you bread or help you quench your thirst for ale soon no one will even speak to you you will have to leave akkad choose now tammuz laughed when enhedu told that part of the story imitating trellas manner of speaking yes i remember her commanding the servants and even the soldiers in eskkars house it would be a brave man to stand up to her i remember every word she said enhedu answered i was on my knees in a corner of his hut where hed told me to stay afraid to look up lady trella waited and when my master didnt answer she dropped four coins on the floor called my name and told me to come with her then she turned and left i wanted to follow her but couldnt get to my feet one of the soldiers had to help me i thought id been saved by a goddess i couldnt stop crying he reached across the table and touched her hand therell be no beatings here enhedu ive never had a slave before and im not sure how you can help me this place will look even worse in the morning nothing like lady trellas fine house if you wish you can return to her service im sure she can find someone someone better for you she pondered his words for a moment no lady trella said i could be helpful to you and that what you do was important to lord eskkar and her i will stay with you she said you needed a woman to look after you im strong and work hard dont send me away before he could answer enhedu stood up now it is time to sleep come to bed master tammuz heard the rustle of her dress as she pulled it over her head then she took his hand and guided him next to the bed without asking she helped remove his tunic then crawled into the bed closest to the wall when he joined her she pulled the blanket over them both he felt her naked body against him and couldnt resist reaching out his hand she flinched at his touch then lay still submitting to his caress tammuz his member painfully stiff hesitated he remembered trellas words be patient shed said taking a deep breath he took enhedus hand in his and told her to sleep he waited a long time staring up into the darkness until her breathing grew rhythmic and he knew she slept to his surprise he found her presence comforting and distracting he felt her warmth under the blanket and his erection refused to subside for someone whod never had a womannow to have a girl in his bed seemed a dream come true to take his mind off enhedu he started thinking about korthac like many others in akkad tammuz had gaped the first time hed seen the egyptian walking about the lanes often with only a single bodyguard but after a few days the novelty wore off and tammuz like most of akkad forgot about the man nevertheless lady trella sensed something odd something dangerous about korthac and she seldom made mistakes in such matters tammuz tried to remember all the things hed heard about the foreigner korthac spent most of his day at the inn hed chosen for his home his men stayed close by never wandering about alone not drinking in the ale shops not doing much of anything staying inside even in the light of day tammuz realized how odd that was servants whether bodyguards or porters or household slaves were always wandering about trying to avoid work and their masters tammuz knew all about the petty thefts servants and slaves engaged in either from their masters or neighbors clothing disappeared sandals trinkets dozens of small items often vanished and reappeared at the local alehouses sometimes traded for a single cup of ale many brought such things to his establishment to sell or to those traders in the marketplace who didnt ask questions but as far as he knew none of korthacs men had ever entered his or any other alehouse in akkad he wondered if trella had noticed this no she would have mentioned it something like that was probably too insignificant a detail for trellas spies something that should be but wasnt tammuz wondered if hed noticed a small detail trella hadnt and what that might mean he put the thought aside for later lady trella he knew had a keen interest in small details always asking for more and more information tammuz made a mental note to ask her about it tomorrow hed take a closer look at korthacs inn tammuz could ask one of his patrons to approach korthacs men looking for something to buy if he could get one of the egyptians to sell some trinket he might be able to learn something useful about their master this whole business could turn out to be nothing just misplaced curiosity on lady trellas part still she had summoned him to her house and asked for his help never before had she or anyone for that matter asked him for anything hed passed on bits of talk he heard men grumbling over their ale but nothing of importance had ever come to his attention this korthac might actually present some small danger to akkad tammuz determined to solve the riddle if for no other reason than to justify lady trellas asking him with that decided he drifted off to sleep again thinking about the warmth of enhedus body brushing against him as she turned in her sleep it would be difficult to restrain himself still if tammuz had learned one thing since smashing his arm it was how to be patient they woke together at dawn bodies curled against one another tammuz hadnt shared a bed with anyone let alone a woman in months since the day he and kuri moved into the alehouse hed slept alone in the back room enjoying the luxury of privacy he never experienced before in his life nevertheless despite the shared bed and the shortened night tammuz slept deeply turning toward enhedu he saw that shed pushed the blanket down during her sleep exposing her breasts to the morning light enhedu conscious of his gaze closed her eyes and turned away she didnt try to cover herself she said nothing simply lay there waiting for him to take her be patient trellas advice echoed in his mind he pushed himself up off the bed and dressed before speaking the chamber pot is there i have to wake the customers kuri is never much help in the mornings she sat up in bed and once again he found himself looking at her body in the light he could see scars and lingering bruises from her former master he must have enjoyed hurting her no one should be beaten like that to carry bruises for so long her old master must be a savage worse than any barbarian tammuz remembered the countless beatings hed had growing up like all boys he expected to be beaten and not only by his father the older boys took advantage of the younger the same as the strong took advantage of the weak hed learned that fact of life early when hed grown old enough to steal hed received a few more beatings this time by his victims until he learned not to get caught but even the worst of these chastisements left no scars on his body more punishment than for the pleasure of inflicting pain then hed joined eskkars men as a stable boy he worked with horses before knew their ways and made himself useful to the soldiers a few weeks later tammuz begged his way onto the captain of the guards first expedition against the alur meriki tammuz remembered how thrilled hed been when eskkar asked if he wanted to care for the horses now hed grown into manhood and crippled or not no one would beat him again the knife he wore every moment of the day insured that when kuri fi rst saw him fumbling with the blade the former soldier showed him how to use it how to hold it how to move with it how to strike and counterstrike how to retreat and the parts of the body where a thrust would do the most damage most of all kuri taught him how to read his opponents eyes and how to wait for the right moment to strike be patient trella and kuri apparently shared the same beliefs as kuri explained a knife fight often turned into a bloody affair for both combatants and even the victor could bleed out practice hard now the old man advised and stay alive later since hed taken over the alehouse tammuz spent an hour or more each day practicing handling the knife moving and thrusting with it he found he had to work extra hard to compensate for his nearly useless left arm the patrons helped instruct him some had plenty of experience handling a knife and their nimble hands and feet moved far quicker than the aging kuri could ever do tammuz felt the strength and coordination of his right arm grow each day and the quickness of his feet soon made up for his weak left arm those who frequented the alehouse took notice of his growing skill no one considered him a boy anymore putting such thoughts aside he unbarred the bedroom door tammuz worked his way through the inns only other room using his foot to nudge those still sleeping awake kuri snoring loudly slept against the door the sword at his side each morning tammuz had to wake the old soldier depending on how much kuri had drunk the night before getting him awake could be a chore get up kuri its past dawn by the time he had the old man on his feet the other patrons had reached the door mumbling and shuffling out into the lane shielding their eyes from the already bright morning sun to relieve themselves against the nearby walls tammuz turned to find enhedu standing beside him and looking about is there food here for your breakfast master there might be but nothing he would offer to her he shook his head and reached into his pouch take this to the market and buy enough for the three of us he said handing her a few copper coins kuri go with her and keep her safe make sure everyone knows who she is once those living and working nearby knew she belonged to him shed be safe enough in a day or so she could go about on her own while they were gone tammuz spoke with two men who still remained inside men who preferred not to be seen in daylight men being hunted by their victims or by the captain of the guards men fortunately most of the guards knew kuri had soldiered with gatus that friendship usually kept any members of the watch outside though once while looking for a murderer they pushed their way inside luckily for tammuz the killer had already left the guards leader had looked about at the poor furnishings spat on the floor and left tammuz told the two men what they owed for food ale and use of the floor to sleep one who had the coins paid up the other left to earn it by whatever means he could he knew better than to come back emptyhanded if desperate men needed a safe place to stay they would have to pay for it and how they got their copper didnt concern tammuz nevertheless all of his customers had received one warning no killing murderers would not be protected even tammuz couldnt chance harboring a killer exposing himself to the villagers wrath for anyone who violated the customs by concealing such an offender that task done tammuz checked the ale supply first to make sure none of the guests had tapped the big clay jars during the night and then to see how much more he needed to buy his stock needed frequent replenishing that meant a trip to the market this morning for at least two more jars enhedu returned carrying a basket that smelled of fresh bread with kuri limping behind the three went into tammuzs room to eat their breakfast bread and sausage and sip wellwatered ale from crudely carved cups when they finished tammuz gave kuri some silver coins and told him to buy more ale kuri left grabbing two new customers to accompany him and carry back the filled jars a free mug of ale would pay for their labor enhedu swept the bread crumbs into the basket then faced tammuz across the table what should i do master a good question one that needed discussing but one he couldnt talk about here not with the door open and men hanging about come lets go for a walk fortunately during the mornings usually nothing much happened at the alehouse and kuri could take care of the few customers that came at dusk things got busy and tammuz knew enhedu would be useful serving the customers once in the lane she moved to his left side and took his hand without saying a word he led the way down the lane her touch affected him and the vision of her naked breasts flashed into his thoughts by the time he got the sight out of his mind theyd traversed two lanes and reached the lane where korthac resided tammuz slowed his pace thats where korthac is staying he said pointing to the inn a few dozen paces ahead a bored guard stood at the door a sword at his waist the egyptian wont stay in this place much longer hell be moving to a fine house away from common folk lady trella said only korthacs men lived inside except for the innkeeper enhedu said the guard didnt even look up as they passed they kept going and soon they reached the river gate turning south they walked in silence until the walls of akkad slipped behind them and the fresh air of the farms cleared their lungs a flat rock near the river gave them a place to sit you want to learn about this korthac enhedu pulled her knees up and held them with her arms yes lady trella wants to know what hes planning tammuz told her everything he knew about korthac his tight control of his men the way he kept them apart from the rest of akkad we should find out where his new house will be she said perhaps i can help it would be good to keep watch on his new home wouldnt it yes but theyd soon notice anyone hanging about all day yes but if i were selling something or other like any street vendor no one would notice me he looked at her a woman normally didnt make such suggestions to a man let alone a slave to her master but she wasnt merely a slave trella had urged him to listen to her which meant trella believed in her wits and if i set up my cart before they moved in no one would suspect anything she shifted on the rock to look straight into his eyes this is something i can do tammuz a slave has to earn her keep its what any servant would do for her master and at night you could return to the alehouse he mused to help with the serving once it grew dark i could keep watch on korthacs home from any of the rooftops he touched her hand you would do this to help you to help lady trella this is nothing master i worked from dawn to dusk with my old master tanning hides look at my arms she lifted her hands up her arms looked as strong as any farm womans who labored all day in the fi elds but his eyes noted her arms for only a moment before being drawn to her breasts he looked away when she dropped her arms master you need not look away you may take me whenever you wish ive been taken many times tammuz ground his teeth at the thought of her former master enhedu ive never been with a woman when i do lie with one i want her to be willing to want me the words had come out without thinking but what surprised him more was that he remembered where hed heard such words before at the campfire a few days before eskkars return to akkad someone had asked the captain of the guard about his slave trella and eskkar had answered that he no longer wanted to take women against their will that he found it more satisfying to take his pleasure with someone who wanted him tammuz im not sure i will ever want to be with a man all i have is the memory of pain pain and humiliation her former master again the man should die and why not enhedu lady trella gave you to me so that you could help me he stood and extended his hand perhaps we can help each other but for now lets make our plans for this korthac before we have to get back otherwise kuri will drink all the fresh ale she clasped his hand and he felt the pleasure of her touch flow through him be patient he thought then he thought about her former master ill be patient with him too he decided patient until i put my knife between his ribs the noonday sun shone straight down on bisitun before eskkar sat down for the first time he stretched weary legs straight out and let himself relax for a moment since the sunrise capture of ninazu eskkar and his men had rushed about the village scarcely pausing to scoop a cup of water or a fistful of bread chaos ruled all morning with a hundred tasks demanding his attention while sisuthros worked on securing the village eskkar rounded up every horse he could find and put them under guard mounted akkadians already ringed the palisade to make sure no bandits escaped sentries stood watch at the two gates as well while the rest of eskkars men guarded prisoners eskkar had escorted ninazu his arms bound tightly to his sides back to his own house the sight of the bandit leader being led through the lanes helped restore order to the village once there eskkar ordered one of ninazus legs broken to make sure he didnt attempt to escape meanwhile hamati took a squad of men and searched every house and hut looking for bandits trying to hide within the dwellings or on rooftops that took most of the morning when they finished theyd discovered and captured nearly a dozen more of ninazus men scattered through bisitun cowering in corners or huddled under blankets one bandit attempted to fi ght his way out killing an innocent villager in the process mitrac killed the bandit with an arrow when he refused to surrender by midmorning eskkar felt satisfied his men had captured or killed all of ninazus men gradually a sense of relief settled over the village the women stopped their screaming the men their cursing still most of bisituns frightened inhabitants stayed in their huts wondering what new woes these akkadians from the south would bring to them eskkar dispatched men to locate and gather the village elders and leading merchants though few enough of them remained at the same time three messengers on captured horses rode out into the countryside to spread the word of ninazus overthrow and bring in the more substantial farmers so that everyone could see what bisituns new leaders had accomplished as the populace realized they would not be pillaged and raped they gathered their courage and headed for the market area empty except for eskkars men and a few horses in prosperous times it would be filled with carts selling all manner of crops animals and goods but for most of the morning not a cart vendor not even a beggar could be seen the marketplace an irregular rectangle formed by dwellings of every shape and height was accessed by half a dozen crooked lanes that left plenty of room for the inhabitants and soon more than a hundred people filled the square to eskkars eyes they looked little better than the inhabitants of dilgarth though surrounded by fruitful farmlands food remained scarce in bisitun with ninazus men taking most of what the local farmers delivered many villagers showed bruises on their thin bodies marks from the bandits brutal treatment most wore simple tunics that needed washing only a few possessed sandals though eskkar recalled that almost all of ninazus men had worn them the demands for vengeance against ninazu and his followers mounted with the villages women shouting the loudest dozens raped by the bandits their husbands murdered or both cried out for ninazus blood those outcries only stopped when eskkar assured everyone that punishment would be meted out soon then the villagers pleaded for food ninazu hadnt bothered to secure enough provisions for the siege and most of what he had stored went to his men with little left over for bisitun fortunately the handful of dead horses would provide a decent meal to most eskkar dispatched more riders to the countryside to let the farmers know they could once again bring in their crops with safety while receiving a fair price by noon eskkars men patrolled the streets and lanes the gates stood closed and guarded and villagers labored to repair the burnedout section of the palisade fiftyseven of ninazus followers had died and fortyone taken prisoner some of these the least violent and most tractable would become slaves with the mark of akkad branded on their foreheads they would live out the rest of their lives working in the fi elds and canals the rest would be killed no one including eskkar felt the slightest sympathy for any of them theyd chosen to live by the sword at the expense of their neighbors the captured bandits deserved a sentence of slavery if for nothing else than to make amends for their crimes another thirty or more bandits had slipped away in the confusion eskkars men had reported hearing splashes in the river so no doubt many had risked their hand at swimming those that made it across the river would offer no threat to bisitun for quite some time one or two might still be hiding within the village but eskkars men would soon discover any that remained surprisingly eskkar had lost only six men in the fighting two of those had climbed the palisade with eskkar sisuthros had lost the others repulsing ninazus sortie or storming the gate eight more had taken wounds but with luck would survive to the soldiers of akkad it seemed an incredible accomplishment outnumbered and with minimal losses they had defeated an entrenched and determined enemy in the space of a few hours eskkars reputation among the soldiers as a canny leader who cared about his men grew even greater the inhabitants of bisitun appeared as impressed ninazu had lied to them told them that the akkadians would kill everyone in the village just as hed told them that the village couldnt be taken eskkar and sisuthros had plenty of work to do the scribes arrived from the encampment and set about making lists of those villagers killed or robbed by ninazu and his men eskkar sent a rider to akkad to inform trella and gatus that bisitun had been freed he spoke with more than a dozen men imprisoned by ninazu and released all of them using one of the scribes eskkar made an account of the loot found at ninazus house the bandit leader had taken over the largest structure in bisitun for his residence and eskkar saw no reason to let it go to waste claiming it as his headquarters the villagers organized in small parties began to bury the dead and repair the damage caused by the fighting nevertheless it wasnt until midday that eskkar felt confident enough to order everyone to the market square to hear his words if so many villagers hadnt been killed or driven out the square could never have accommodated them even then the rooftops seemed as crowded as the streets eskkar hated giving speeches but the people of bisitun needed to hear and see him but they like the villagers in dilgarth needed to know who he was why hed come and what their role would be in the future when he looked over the crowd he saw shock and fear still gripped most of them the crowd quieted when he climbed on a cart and raised his hand as the soldiers ringing the square called out for everyone to keep quiet he waited impassively until the chattering turned into murmurs then into silence in a loud voice eskkar announced that bisitun had come under the rule and protection of akkad and that from this day sisuthros would command here in akkads name a new village council to include craftsmen and farmers as well as merchants would be established to handle local matters including justice for the bandits and their victims the same customs governing akkad would be established here and would apply equally to all just as they did in akkad what are these new customs a voice in the crowd shouted out the council eskkar said raising his hand for silence will set the prices of grain and other goods the council will also set the penalties for crimes from theft to murder the council will decide what rules the people in bisitun need and those rules will apply to everyone in the village and the surrounding farms including the members of the council persons who feel themselves treated unjustly can appeal first to the council and then to sisuthros he will decide anything of import or if he thinks necessary sisuthros can refer the matter to me and the council back in akkad for a final decision you will be governed justly and fairly the villagers looked at each other no doubt wondering what that really meant but a few cheered at eskkars announcement the new customs eskkar added apply to my own soldiers theyve received strict instructions to take no liberties with the local people starting now sisuthros will provide soldiers for protection not only of the village but enough to begin regular patrols of the surrounding farms more soldiers and craftsmen will arrive from akkad over the next few months to strengthen the palisade and provide more security restoration of the farms to their rightful owners and assistance with the canals and irrigation will be given the fi rst priority taxes in the form of goods will be sent to akkad on a regular basis to pay for the protection and safety akkad will supply eskkar didnt speak long just expanded on the same speech hed given in dilgarth only a few days ago he turned the crowd over to sisuthros leaving him to take the brunt of the inhabitants questions hours passed sisuthros explained the new ways of akkad in detail interrupted constantly to answer question after question he had trouble keeping the crowd under control at first but when everyone realized their voice would be heard they quieted somewhat and learned to raise their hands when they wished to be heard sisuthros consulted with the local people and tradesmen as well as the few farmers who had taken shelter within bisitun he took nominations for the council and promised to begin the distribution of stolen lands and goods tomorrow morning when he finished he dismissed the villagers and told them to return to their homes or farms then ignoring the pleas and questions that still lingered he gathered those who would become the council of elders and departed for one of the houses a little way off the square eskkar breathed a sigh of relief as he watched them go most of the crowd following after sisuthros he and grond entered ninazus former home someone had stocked the table with food and drink and the two men emptied their water cups even before they sat until now thered been little time to eat or rest since the attack began the night before by the gods im glad thats over grond said as he banged down his cup i thought the questions would never stop eskkar laughed they wont not for a few weeks at least he refilled his cup from the pitcher if theyre anything like the people of akkad theyll drive sisuthros crazy with their complaints and quarrels i still cant believe how quickly ninazus men collapsed grond said shaking his head and yawning its going to take a day or two before everything calms down longer than that eskkar said lifting his feet onto the table remember we have to settle the countryside as well as the village we need those crops in the ground as soon as possible in the last few months eskkar had learned all about the mysteries of the farm now he understood that real wealth flowed from the crops in the fields that gold merely transferred that wealth from one person to another when the farms produced in plenty gold would flow into bisitun and akkad however without the farms there would be little gold no trade and no prosperity the talk died out as the two men picked at the food spread before them there was wine and bread as well as cheese dates and honey ninazu had stocked his house well with luxuries long absent from the villagers tables eskkar mixed a splash of wine in with his water the long night had tired him more than he would admit and he didnt trust himself with too much strong drink he looked up when two women entered the room passed in by the hawk clan guard who stood at the door one carried a large wooden platter holding half a dozen slices of roasted horsemeat the other held a small plate stacked with sweetened cakes the women bore a strong resemblance and eskkar guessed them to be sisters the older of the two put a slice of horsemeat on each of the mens plates then left the platter in the center of the table she took the sweet cakes from her sister and placed it before them as well her eyes carefully appraising eskkar as she did so then she bowed looked at grond and both women left the room grond cleared his throat captain i forgot to tell you when we searched this house we found six women here ninazus women four have returned to their homes or families but these two he shrugged they say they have no place to go eskkar shook his head hed be dealing with ninazus legacy for months one thing after another even the bandits loot had become a problem theyd found a small windowless room in the house containing four sacks crammed with gold jewelry and other valuables ninazus personal share of the booty many of the coins bore the marks of villages to the north and west so the bandit had obviously accumulated plenty of booty even before arriving in bisitun ninazu remained with his plunder though no doubt it gave him less pleasure today sitting on it with his leg broken still a hawk clan soldier stood constant guard over ninazu and his gold the bandit chief seemed much too crafty and resourceful and eskkar didnt want to take any chances with him escaping but until now eskkar hadnt heard about any women though it didnt surprise him even a bandit needed someone to run his household as well as needing women with whom to take his pleasures six women seemed quite a number for one man eskkars opinion of ninazu increased well they must have come from someplace eskkar took his knife and sliced a bit of the warm meat and put it in his mouth after last nights slaughter at the corral there would be plenty of horsemeat for the next few days the steamy flesh tasted good and he realized how hungry he was cutting up the thick steak he alternated bites with bread sweet and fresh washing everything down with watered wine ninazu brought these two women with him when he rode into bisitun grond continued as he worked at his own food sisuthros asked me to take care of them they offered to keep your house if they could stay here i said that you would speak to them eskkar looked at his bodyguard in surprise but the mans attention remained focused on his plate grond had never offered to intercede for others with his leader though more than a few in akkad had sought him out to try and take advantage of his friendship with eskkar ill talk to them later then eskkar said as he finished the meat and selected some figs to finish the meal he had never cared for the sweet cakes villagers devoured at every opportunity thinking them somehow unfit for a warrior a concept that dated back to his barbarian days trella had smiled when he told her about it but she ate them only infrequently herself when he finished eating he drank another cup of water then stood up and stretched the heavy meal sapped whatever strength remained and he felt exhausted more than a day had passed since hed slept and even that had been cut short he felt the heaviness in his legs and cursed his own weakness grond im going to get some sleep get some rest yourself well probably be up late tonight as well with all these villagers pestering us tell the guard to wake me in three hours eskkar had explored the house earlier it possessed five rooms the common room ran the length of the house and took up half the structure one end contained a fireplace and a work table for preparing meals the other held the large table where the previous owner had taken his dinner four chambers varying in size took up the rest of the dwelling all of them accessed from the main room the masters bedroom occupied a corner of the house with a solid door a few steps from the table inside eskkar found a large comfortablelooking bed a thick wooden bar leaned against the wall and he used it to secure the door knowing hed sleep sounder with the door fastened he heard grond giving instructions to one of the soldiers to stand guard more to keep anyone from bothering their leader than from any need for caution stopping only to unbelt his sword he dropped gratefully on the bed threw an arm over his eyes to block out the light and fell asleep in moments the knocking on the door shook the wooden panels and when eskkar forced his eyes open he realized the pounding had gone on for some time gronds voice called to him through the door but it took a real effort to clear his head and force himself to sit up a glance at the window told him several hours had gone by he shouted at grond to stop beating on the door then went and opened it grond had already gone replaced outside the door by the two women who had served the meal earlier one carried a tall pitcher of water in both hands while the other held a large clay bowl both had drying cloths across their arms they moved past him while he stood there trying to comprehend their presence and they placed their burdens on the small table near the bed the older girl turned toward him and bowed lord eskkar i am called lani this is my sister tippu she added nodding to the younger girl who bowed even lower than her sister grond asked us to attend to you when you woke up when he didnt answer her she went on would you like some water lord still not fully awake eskkar tried to clear his mind the offer of water made him realize his thirst so he nodded the younger girl took an ornately carved cup from the table and poured water into it then handed it to him he drained the cup before handing it back to tippu lord would you permit us to help you with your bath lani inquired your tunic is filthy and covered with blood as are your hands you should wash and put on clean clothing before you appear again before the villagers for the first time he noticed the stink of blood and sweat on his body is there a well nearby eskkar asked the dryness gone from his mouth he certainly didnt plan on letting two strange women clean him his thoughts flashed back to trella and the first time she had washed down his naked body the first time any woman had ever done so it had been intensely erotic and now even the remembrance sent a shiver of pleasure through his manhood yes lord there is a well across the square but right now it is crowded with villagers gossiping about the men from akkad fully awake now eskkar noticed how tall lani stood and how attractive with a full graceful figure topped by soft brown hair shed rimmed her brown eyes with a trace of ocher which added an intriguing reddish tint to them many of the wives of the welloff merchants in akkad did the same to enhance their beauty though trella never did lanis deep voice sounded pleasant to his ears and she wore a dress of fine quality no doubt plundered from somewhere by her former master now that he had time to study her he guessed her age to be about twentyfi ve seasons she noticed his stare and lowered her eyes your pardon lord but we do not know what you wish please instruct us either her words or her tone aroused him further so he walked to the bed and sat he looked down at himself and saw that indeed his tunic remained spotted with blood and dirt and that his brief moments at the well earlier in the morning had not removed all the blood from his hands glancing at the nowsoiled bedding he decided this lani spoke the truth he considered going down to the river but that would be a long walk from ninazus house and no doubt hed be pestered every step of the way by villagers eskkar would have to use the cloths and water bowl after all he could do it himself but is there a clean tunic i can wear lani she pursed her lips for an instant you are much taller than ninazu but perhaps we can find something in the house lani turned to her sister see what we have here if there is nothing that will fit we will have to send out to the market tippu put down her drying cloths glanced nervously at eskkar and left the room eskkar stood up and pulled his tunic up over his head then tossed the dirty garment on the floor your sister does not talk much she has been through a great deal and is afraid lord eskkar lani said calmly as she poured water from the pitcher into the bowl as am i we are both frightened of what is to become of us eskkar watched her movements as she soaked one of the washcloths in the water then wrung it out her hands were quick and sure you have nothing to be afraid of lani no one will harm you now she turned to face him looking into his eyes you should remove your undergarment lord eskkar i fear that needs changing as well she wrinkled her nose as she spoke but didnt say anything else for a moment eskkar hesitated damn the woman treating him like a child he stood then loosened the garment and pushed it to the floor she moved it aside with her foot then took the washcloth and began cleaning him she started with his face scrubbing hard to get all the surface dirt and rubbing his beard to clean it as well then she began on his neck and shoulders rinsing the cloth again turning him around to do his back standing naked in front of this woman he felt himself begin to stiffen she ignored his growing erection as she rinsed out the cloth again and again moving lower until she knelt before him her face inches away from his nowfirm manhood but she gave it no attention except to wipe it gently with the cloth before scrubbing his legs vigorously please sit down lord eskkar so i can clean your feet lani said rising to rinse out the cloth yet again she knelt and started cleaning his feet tippu returned carrying a tunic if she thought it strange to see her sister on her knees before a naked man with an erect penis she said nothing didnt even meet eskkars eyes lani turned to her lord eskkar will need a fresh undergarment bring one tippu again left without a word apparently there was no shortage of undergarments in the house eskkar decided when lani finished his feet she asked him to stand again and dried his body with a clean cloth rubbing gently on his face then briskly on his chest and shoulders then gently again around his stillfirm manhood again she asked him to sit then she wiped his feet dry there my lord at least youre clean enough to meet your subjects suddenly she reached out and brushed his penis with her fingers if my lord would like a woman i or my sister would be glad to pleasure you this time she met his eyes waiting for his answer eskkar noticed a slight change in her voice something that made the offer more than just a duty to his surprise he wanted her and not only for the physical need something about her aroused him youve seen me naked lani now let me see you take off your dress she wiped her hands quickly on the drying cloth lifted her dress up over her head and tossed the garment over the foot of the bed she shook out her hair to straighten it then just stood there for the first time he saw her as a beautiful woman his manhood surged as he stared at her lush body all softness and curves once again the door opened and tippu slipped back into the room closing the door behind her she barely raised her eyes to take note of the two of them bring the garment here tippu eskkar said without taking his eyes off lani put your dress back on lani he took the undergarment from tippu and pulled himself into it grunting a little as he forced his stillerect penis into the clothing before lacing it tight around his waist tippu handed him the clean tunic and he pulled it over his head he noticed its quality a fine garment more suited to a rich merchant than a soldier nonetheless it fit well enough though a little tighter than he liked and reaching only to midthigh by then lani had put her dress back on and again she knelt at his feet this time to fasten his sandals he helped her with the lacings and she lifted her eyes to him as their hands touched a loud knock on the door startled both of them grond entered without waiting for permission are you well rested captain you slept half the afternoon eskkar did feel better much of the tiredness gone from his body and mind a quick glance at the window showed about two hours of daylight left still plenty of time to meet with sisuthros yes grond i think i needed the rest lord may i speak with you for a moment lani asked her eyes downcast and her tone respectful he thought for a moment no doubt grond had told her eskkar would speak with her but she hadnt reminded him of it merely asked for permission eskkar glanced at his bodyguard but saw the man staring at tippu grond wait outside take tippu with you while tippu gathered up the pitcher cloths and the washing bowl eskkar fastened his sword around his waist then sat on the bed go ahead lani what is it you wish to say she stood in the same spot she had stood unclothed a few moments ago but her voice remained calm my lord my sister and i were captured by ninazu and his men four months ago my husband was killed as was tippus betrothed along with our servants ninazu took both of us for his pleasures he favored tippu and would have turned me over to his men except for tippus pleadings i made myself useful by cleaning up after him and keeping track of his women and his affairs after a while he came to depend on me and once we came here i managed his household she paused for a moment as if remembering i think i would be dead if tippu hadnt saved me she took a deep breath as if to put the past behind her here in bisitun we are called ninazus whores the village women he took hated us as much as they hated him this morning one of them said we would be dead by nightfall ninazus other women have returned to their families but we have nowhere to go our village is many miles away to the northwest across the euphrates even if we could return there is no one there who would take us in dishonored as we are and with nothing but the clothing on our backs so what do you want from me lani no one will harm you here my men will protect you from the village women that is what i want lord your protection that and this morning i i heard this morning that you will soon return to akkad i would ask that you take us with you this place is hateful to us she saw the frown that crossed his face at her suggestion and went on quickly we can be your servants lord as well as your concubines i have skill at running a household and tippu can weave and sew we will do anything you ask any work just take us away from this place please lord her eyes lifted to his and he could see her lip trembling he saw that she held back the tears the first time shed shown any emotion she might be right about the village wives they would abuse and torment ninazus women at the very least especially one who acted in ninazus name the sisters would be safer in akkad and trella could find good use for someone like lani whose wits seemed sharp enough thinking of trella made him feel uncomfortable for a moment he hadnt thought about her much in the last few days lani waited patiently but he saw the fear in her face she thought he was going to refuse lani you can return with me to akkad and i will place you under my protection there as well no one will harm either of you but i warn you that i may not return to akkad for some time and i may have to send you on ahead my wife trella will find a place for you speaking trellas name aloud helped clear his own head though it didnt quite drive away thoughts of lanis body and you need not be a concubine for me or anyone else lani neither you nor your sister with a small cry of relief she went down on one knee and took his hand then kissed it thank you lord thank you her body shook slightly the words catching in her throat eskkar stood up womens tears made him uneasy he touched her head and left the room stepping into the main chamber of the house the common area ran the length of the structure and the five bedrooms along the wall all faced the center of the house the room hed slept in by far the largest sleeping chamber occupied a corner of the home the dining table stood only a few steps away sisuthros sat there along with grond hamati and drakis did you get some rest captain sisuthros asked eskkar opened his mouth to make some careless rejoinder before he realized sisuthros appeared really concerned about him eskkar saw the same look on gronds face and even on the other commanders they knew he had slept little in the last three days and they worried about him he softened his voice yes sisuthros i slept very well now im hungry again food covered the table and the smell of horse steaks cooking wafted in from outside and made his mouth water his stomach rumbled with hunger even though hed eaten only a few hours ago he sat down at an empty place but before he could reach for anything tippu arrived at his side and placed a clean earthen plate and wooden cup before him she filled it halfway with water before leaving grond took another pitcher one that held wine and poured some into eskkars cup as he put the cup down lani came in from outside carrying two steaks that still sizzled on a wooden trencher she slid them both onto his plate then turned to him is there anything else you need lord she stood at his side and when he turned his head he found her bosom only a handbreadth away the picture of her naked body crossed his mind and he felt the urge to take her back into the bedroom somehow she managed to project sexuality into a few words words directed only at him nothing now lani thank you he spoke the words carefully in a neutral voice when she stepped away he remembered his promise and turned to sisuthros ive given my protection to lani and her sister he told those at the table make sure all the men know it and youd better tell these villagers too ill tell the council today and make sure they spread the word throughout bisitun sisuthros said eskkar took a sip of his watered wine now tell me what has happened while i slept in a moment all thoughts of lani vanished sisuthros had met again with the newly appointed village elders by tomorrow morning the most influential farmers would arrive and they could select the fifth and last of the council members the elders could then start governing the villages affairs they would begin with the execution of ninazu and the disposition of his men with ninazus head on a lance above the gate and the worst of his followers dead eskkars men would be freed up for other duties instead of wasting time guarding prisoners night and day as for the rest of ninazus men theyd be branded and put to work then the newly formed council would address the matter of the stolen property what ninazu had taken and how what remained would be allocated back to its original owners akkad would take twotenths of each allocation as a restoration fee sisuthros guessed that it would take another day to divide the loot including what hed taken from the prisoners and added to ninazus storeroom with ninazu and his stolen gold out of the way the soldiers villagers and slaves would be put to work rebuilding bisitun and the surrounding farms clearing the land outside the palisade repairing the damaged irrigation ditches and any other tasks necessary to get the community back on a road to prosperity once that effort had commenced the council could begin to take up all the smaller issues that would fill its days in the coming weeks settling disputes and hearing appeals for justice eskkar listened to sisuthross orders for the men before speaking to hamati and drakis about their roles by the time the meal ended he announced himself satisfied with sisuthross plans and dispositions as soon as ninazu and his men are dead ill take grond and some men and begin riding out into the farmlands i want to see for myself how the farmers and their crops are faring and how well the herds of sheep and goats are doing if any at the table thought it unusual to have the leader of akkad visiting farmers they kept the thought to themselves but eskkar knew that trella and the nobles back in akkad needed that vital information they couldnt complete their own plans until they knew what could be expected from the north country and when without the steady supply of flax grain and livestock trade at akkad would slow and that must not happen not with so much rebuilding underway the real goal of eskkars efforts remained back in akkad not here eskkar stood and stretched he felt relaxed now his stomach full and with enough sleep to get him through the evening has ninazu said anything useful sisuthros shook his head we havent even had time to put him to the torture sisuthros sighed as he contemplated yet another task ill talk to him no grond and i will deal with him you keep your thoughts on the villagers grond led the way to the other end of the common room to the bedroom farthest away from where eskkar had slept this windowless room had only a tiny aperture near the ceiling for light and ventilation it possessed the only other solid door inside the dwelling the stillfresh wood indicating a recent improvement a soldier guarded there sitting on a stool but he rose up as the two men approached grond pushed the door open inside another guard this one from the hawk clan sat on a chest his short sword unsheathed across his lap facing ninazu the prisoner had a large bruise on his forehead where eskkars sword hilt had struck and the side of his swollen face showed cuts and bruises from gronds fist theyd trussed ninazu up like a chicken his hands tied behind his back and his arms tied to his sides the silver bracelets hed worn were gone given to grond and sisuthros as gifts another rope looped around his neck the other end knotted around a second wooden chest ninazus legs remained free but his captors had smashed his right shinbone the swelling on the leg had bruised to a deep blue with blood crusted along its length whoever had done the work knew his job no one bothered to set the bone straight ninazu would be dead long before he could walk or die from infection for a moment eskkar almost felt sorry for the man a daring bandit who had gambled for a rich village and lost ninazu turned toward the door his eyes alert as eskkar entered the expensive tunic told him all he needed to know about his visitor greetings ninazu eskkar began when the man didnt answer eskkar reached out with his sandal and touched ninazus right leg that sent a jolt of pain through the prisoner and he couldnt control a sharp intake of breath eskkar turned to the guard has he been given anything some water this afternoon captain nothing else eskkar nodded in satisfaction give him just enough water to keep him conscious so he could feel his pain and worry about the future well give you more water later maybe even some wine if you tell us what we want to know eskkar went on the man said nothing just looked up at eskkar with hatred in his eyes your brother looked at me that way before he died ninazu he took the torture for a long time before we gave him over to the women of dilgarth who took hours killing him he told me all about you and your men ninazu flashed a look of hatred at his captor but said nothing eskkar leaned against the wall and looked about the room two chests were crammed with dozens of golden statues bowls and other valuable items most of the wealth of the village four goodsized sacks contained gold silver and copper coins as well as jewelry gemstones and even some fi ne leather goods ninazu remained surrounded by his loot at least until tomorrow in the morning the village elders and i will sentence you to death ninazu its up to you how much you suffer between now and then there isnt much we need to hear from you if you tell us what we want to know you will be given as much wine as you can handle and youll feel less pain eskkar paused a moment he didnt hate the man nor even condemn what ninazu had attempted to do many others would have done the same including eskkar in his younger days now those days seemed from the distant past the days before trella had explained the ways of power and the mysteries of farm and village or we can just give you plenty of water to make sure you enjoy every sensation the choice is yours ninazu your brother chose the wine but too late and he suffered much who are you ninazu had a deep voice one filled with anger and hatred why did you come to bisitun it would be a waste of time to explain akkads plans to ninazu i came to claim the land for akkad and i have done so eskkar turned to the guard give him as much water as he wants he glanced about the room filled with the bandits booty such things meant little to eskkar now that hed learned the ways of power gold had its uses but it didnt put strength into a mans sword arm or even crops in the earth he nodded to the guard and stepped back into the common room closing the door behind him eskkar and grond passed out of the house into the village square the afternoon sun had dipped below the horizon and soon another night would begin grond there must be more loot somewhere and ninazus subcommanders might have hidden their own valuables make sure he tells us what we want to know start on him in the morning right after the morning meal remember he has to last into the afternoon so not too much wine this one will talk captain hes finished and he knows it shulat could at least hope for his brothers revenge but ninazu has nothing to live for by tomorrow the fever will weaken his will the sooner hes out of the way the sooner the villagers can get on with their lives eskkar spent the rest of the evening with sisuthros eskkar encountered three of the new elders but they only wanted to talk about how much they had suffered under ninazu and eskkar could only stand so many hours of that kind of talk leaving them with sisuthros eskkar and grond accompanied by two soldiers toured the village checking on the guards the horses and the men that task finished they found a small tavern well lit and filled with the sounds of singing and laughter packed to overflowing happy villagers celebrated their deliverance from ninazu eskkar and his men entered received a drunken cheer that went on as the happy patrons made room for them eskkar spent an hour there squeezed behind a table buying drinks for everyone and talking with the common people but he drank only one cup of ale grond had two and after the second one mentioned that he thought tippu the most beautiful woman hed ever seen by the time they returned to the marketplace most of bisitun had prepared itself for bed even from ninazus house only a single oil lamp burned few people had the wealth or reason to burn oil or candles long into the night not when the moon and stars shone brightly overhead the big well in the market squares center stood deserted for the first time all day and eskkar stopped to drink some fresh water and wash his face and hands at the house two soldiers stood guard and inside he found hamati asleep sitting at the big table his sword beneath his hand eskkar stopped to check on ninazu and found the prisoner had fallen into a restless sleep nevertheless his guards remained alert watching their charge through the open door sisuthros had taken one of the bedrooms for himself and gone to bed an hour earlier his snores audible in the common room eskkar bid good night to grond and entered his room he didnt bother with the lamp just left the door open the soft glow from the main room gave him enough light to see the bed covered with fresh linen he unbelted his sword and pulled the weapon from its sheath and laid it on the low table that stood beside the bed then sat to unlace his sandals he went back to the door pausing for a moment to make sure he knew where everything in the room was placed eskkar closed the door and dropped the wooden bar to seal it pulling his tunic over his head he tossed that on the foot of the bed and sank tiredly onto the bed he thought he would be asleep in moments but instead he lay there staring up at the faint moonlight that shone in through the tiny window set high in the wall a long day had finally ended but everything had worked out well enough bisitun would enjoy its first night of freedom now he just needed he sat up in the bed his hand reaching for his sword something moved at the window and his hand tightened on the hilt of the sword as the movement repeated itself a darker blackness against the night sky the shadow moved and he heard the thump of something landing on the floor next to the bed still eskkar had caught a glimpse of it as it jumped down the cat had greengold eyes that gleamed in the faint light and eskkar saw them watching him for a moment he considered taking a swing at the creature thinking it might be some demon sent by ninazu then he reconsidered the animal seemed to think it belonged as it sat down in the middle of the floor a dark shadow without color except for its eyes which stayed focused on the bed as eskkars eyes grew more accustomed to the darkness he saw that the cat looked alert but not frightened eskkar muttered to himself and put the sword back on the table the creature had climbed into the room it could get itself out again stay if you will just let me sleep nothing much bigger than a cat could get inside he felt certain of that he fell back on the pillow let his breathing relax closed his eyes and soon began to drift off into sleep the soft knock at the door had him moving in an instant on his feet and up from the bed his hand again finding the sword without any fumbling he stood by the door who is it it is lani lord ive brought you some wine she kept her voice low and he could barely hear her through the door he didnt want any wine he wanted to tell her to go away but instead he opened the door lani and her sister both stood there lanis face flickering behind a small candle that she carried on a tray behind them eskkar saw grond watching from the table may we come in lord lani asked he hesitated not sure that he wanted to see her but he opened the door wider and stepped back the tray that lani carried held a pitcher of wine and a cup while tippu carried a bowl filled with water and some cloths lani stepped into the room almost as if she worried he might close the door once again tippu followed though more slowly he watched them pass by him the cat had vanished no doubt leaving the way it entered and just as silently we thought you might want some wine before bed or that you might wish to wash your hands and face she put her things down on the table then went to the door and closed it though eskkars hand was still on it before she shut the door eskkar caught another glimpse of grond standing there a frown on his face eskkar turned to lani and for the first time he noticed that shed changed her dress from the one shed worn earlier a much finer garment and one woven from something softer than the usual linen and not one that you pulled on over your head instead it looked as if it would open from the front the two edges crossing over her breasts and tied together at her waist eskkar had drunk more spirits tonight than he usually allowed himself he didnt plan to drink anything more in the old days hed guzzled as much as he could afford which had only allowed him to get properly drunk two or three times a month trella had changed all that and hed sworn never to lose control of himself again no lani i dont need any wine he smiled at her and i washed up at the well before i returned you and your sister can go she peered at him in the fl ickering light almost as if checking to see if he had really washed lani went on as if she hadnt heard him perhaps you would like one of us to stay with you to pleasure you tonight if you prefer tippu she is more pleasing to look at or or we could both remain if that is your wish he looked at lani then tippu in the light from the tiny flame lanis eyes met his own while tippu stared at the floor the thought of both of them in his bed sent a wave of desire through him eskkar had always taken a woman after every fight even during the fighting for akkad hed taken trella after every encounter he remembered lanis naked body and the temptation surged through him battle did that to a man made him want a woman just to prove hed survived while others had died another thought struck him tippu he began and thought he saw lanis lips compress for a brief instant tippu my bodyguard is outside he is more than my bodyguard he is my friend as well and he has looked at you with longing and told me of this perhaps you could spend tonight with him tippu looked at her sister without showing any emotion and waited until lani nodded approval yes lord i will go to your friend tippu said she began putting down the bowl and cloths she still held and i lord what should i do lani asked he wanted her to stay but his days of taking women against their will had passed if she thought she had to please him to get what she wanted he would send her away but he didnt want to do that not yet if you like lani you can stay with me tonight but only if you want to you already have my protection and i dont need you in my bed to remind me of my promise i will stay lord lani called after her sister wait tippu go to our room i will send grond to you there treat him well tippu she guided her sister to the door opened it for her and followed her out eskkar watched in surprise as lani crossed the room and spoke to grond who still sat at the table lani spoke to him for some time before gesturing toward the room that her sister had just entered grond answered lani then listened for another moment before nodding his head lani came back to the bedroom and this time she dropped the bar across the door she moved within arms length and began untying her dress he reached out and took her hands then pulled her closer to him you dont have to do this lani i dont take women against their will or because they are afraid i know lord eskkar i spoke with many of your soldiers today they told me much about you about akkad and about your wife she pulled her hands free from his grasp and continued untying her dress when the knot came undone she opened the dress wide and pushed it back over her shoulders letting it hang from her arms as if to frame her body they told me so much about you that i feel safe in your care but i also saw in your eyes today that you wanted me eskkar started to say something but she put her finger up to his lips the movement swirling the dress around her there is nothing to say lord eskkar i want to be in your arms and in your bed lani took her hand away and this time the dress fell to the floor she stood on her toes and put her arms around his neck burying her face in his shoulder he inhaled her hair and noticed she smelled faintly of cinnamon a delicate perfume that mixed with the warm musky smell of a woman she made a small sound as she felt the pressure of his erection and moved her hips against him i do want you lani he whispered into her ear and you are wrong you are much more beautiful than your sister she lifted her head up and he kissed her a long lingering kiss that aroused him even further when the kiss ended she leaned down to blow out the candle as the darkness enveloped them she began unfastening his undergarment soon that dropped to the floor and they lay down on the bed their arms wrapped around each other in the dark her body felt soft and full her full breasts brushing against his chest whenever he took his hands from them she kissed him with abandon almost possessively until he grew more and more aroused at last she moved on top of him and guided him inside her moist body lani gave a long sigh of pleasure when he slid deep within her and for a few moments she stayed still he pushed up against her and she began to move slowly at first then faster stopping often to let him kiss her breasts or leaning down to find his mouth with her own while she squeezed her muscles around his penis fully aroused now eskkars hands tightened around her waist and she moved against him forcing him deep inside her pushing herself against him until he thrust up hard against her and cried out as he emptied his seed both hands grasping her breasts her hands on his chest she stayed atop him holding him tightly inside her until he began to soften then she lay next to him in his arms letting him touch and caress her lani he began but she kissed him again to stop his words tomorrow we can talk lord eskkar tomorrow now you need your sleep let me stay with you she shifted her position on the bed wrapping her arm behind his head letting his face fall on her breast at first he kissed her one hand caressing her stomach but soon he stopped as the long days effort washed over him just before he drifted off or in his dreams he couldnt be sure which he heard her voice again i will stay with you lord eskkar woke in darkness like most people he tended to rise with the dawn but this morning something had awakened him though he heard no one moving about the house he wondered if the strangeness of his surroundings or the unfamiliar woman beside him had cut short his sleep lani stirred murmuring something into the blanket that he couldnt make out she lay on her side her back toward him he slid his arm free from under her neck his arm felt numb and he worked his fingers until the tingling disappeared lani didnt wake just kept whispering unintelligible words in some strange language eskkar glanced up at the dark outline of the tiny window the blackness it framed seemed a shade lighter and he knew the sun would soon be up the household rising with it he turned onto his side so that his face rested against lanis hair and caught the last trace of her perfume or perhaps just her scent her closeness soothed him and he had no desire to arise wide awake now and refreshed by a long night of sleep he knew he should be thinking about the coming day the dozens of tasks that needed his supervision instead he found himself worrying about trellawhat she would say about this woman what he would tell her how she would look at him he knew she would not be pleased not so much because he took a woman while away from her that would be expected from a soldier on campaign no trella would be concerned because she would see in lani more than a mere bed companion in fact lani seemed in many ways like trella the similarities between the two made him uncomfortable perhaps he should have taken tippu to his bed merely to quench his lust tippu who could be forgotten in the morning a pretty face frightened for her life and eager to please trella would not be concerned with a woman like tippu any more than she worried about the other women in akkad who offered themselves at every opportunity to her husband since that first night when hed bedded trella he had ignored those offers no matter how beautiful or willing the woman trella had made him aware of how satisfying a strongminded woman could be someone who could share and understand his feelings lani possessed much of that awareness yet was somehow different eskkar should have sent her away last night even packed her off to akkad or simply given her to one of his men but hed sensed a quality in her something that quickened both his desire and curiosity hed wanted her wanted to keep her close to him now he couldnt send her away not after she had pleasured him so completely even this morning his desire remained strong maybe the need would lessen in a few days when the excitement of a new woman had worn off eskkar hadnt slept with anyone except trella for many months and even longer since hed lusted after another woman trella always equaled his passion as she loved him and he had not wanted any other woman not even for an afternoons dallying until last night now another woman troubled his thoughts and what should have been a simple pleasure had turned into a problem he looked toward the window as the first gray light of dawn arrived providing enough illumination to see inside the bedroom lani twitched in the bed and he knew her dreams troubled her she spoke again but he still couldnt comprehend the words soft and indistinct like a sleepy child in its mothers arms her head tossed about then her arm and she called out a word a name he realized namtar namtar she gave a small cry and sat up her eyes wide but empty her hand covered her mouth as if to prevent herself from speaking further lani remained motionless until he reached out and touched her arm oh she whirled in the bed pushing herself away from him she seemed confused to find him beside her please dont hurt me please why would i hurt you lani she still wasnt fully awake youre safe here nothing can harm you now she took a deep breath and tried to speak but all he heard was a choking sound youre safe lani he repeated and this time his words seemed to calm her who is namtar she jumped as if hed summoned a demon by speaking its name lanis body shook and she started sobbing eskkar had seen enough women cry before but nothing to equal what he now heard and felt lani fell back on the bed hugging her knees to her chest her whole body trembling until last year hed never wasted a moment over a crying woman walking away from whatever sorrows plagued them he considered leaving lani to her misery instead he remembered the times trella had cried into his chest those nights shed felt helpless before the barbarians eskkar had sworn an oath that trella would cry no more if he could help it so he stroked lanis head and held her lightly dawn had risen and he heard people moving about the house no one would disturb him he knew but they would hear lani crying and wonder her tears subsided and her body sagged against him as whatever demons tortured her spirit faded with the mornings light she attempted to sit up but he held her close trying to give comfort im sorry lord she began her voice so hoarse that at first he didnt understand her please forgive me lord i did not mean to ruin your nights sleep again she tried to sit up and this time he let go but kept hold of her hands in the growing light he saw her face red with tears her eyes swollen and filled with blood who is namtar he repeated she shuddered and he thought the tears would start again namtar was my husband lord ninazu killed him in front of me her eyes closed as she no doubt relived the moment after ninazu captured us he said he would put namtar to the torture if i did not pleasure him willingly give him much pleasure she turned her face away from eskkar her eyes staring at the wall so i pleasured ninazu while his men laughed and my husband watched bound hand and foot to a cart her lips trembled as she fought back the tears i had to please him had to do many things we had already seen men and women put to the torture namtar never said a word he just closed his eyes after ninazu finished with me he stood naked over my husband letting him smell my scent on his body then ninazu laughed and stabbed him in the heart with his sword eskkar let his hands drop from her arms there was nothing you could do lani weve all seen men put to the torture you saved your husband from that she shook her head letting her hair fall in front of her face as if to hide her shame i did not kill myself lord i should have killed myself thrown myself on the same sword that took namtar her voice hardened or i should have killed ninazu in his sleep but he told me he wanted tippu to be as willing ninazu said he would put us both to the torture if we did not please him i did not want my sister to die though she has not been the same in her head since that day but she obeyed my wishes and we lived we stayed alive and hoped to escape someday or for someone to kill ninazu the goddess ishtar answered my prayers she sent you and your soldiers to free us from him her voice cracked with her words and eskkar heard the dryness in her throat he got out of bed and looked down at the table at the empty water cup lani followed his gaze ill fetch water lord she said swinging her feet off the bed stay where you are he ordered then strode to the door unbarred it and stepped out into the great room most of the men had risen earlier and sisuthros already sat at the table with hamati no doubt talking about the coming days events no one seemed surprised at the sudden appearance of their captain naked have someone bring water to my room eskkar said then turned back into the bedroom he stood by the door waiting and in moments tippu stood there a large goblet of water in her hands bring it in tippu give it to your sister he watched the younger girl to see if he could detect any signs of her madness she seemed calm even more so than last night lani took the cup and drank he watched as she halfemptied the cup gazing at her naked body and he felt another stir of passion when lani lowered the cup she looked at him guiltily my pardon lord i should not drink your water he returned to the bed and sat down pulling the blanket over his lap then accepted the cup from her hands and took a few sips a mouthful remained so he gave it back to her finish it lani she drained it and handed the empty cup back to her sister tippu started for the door tippu stay a moment eskkar said studying her with care for the first time shorter than her sister tippu possessed swirling reddishbrown hair that floated around her tiny face with features as delicate as a childs her dress the same one shed worn yesterday showed the full body of a woman a beautiful woman he decided but one without her sisters sharp wits he knew that given a choice every one of his soldiers would have chosen tippu over lani just as he knew that lanis strength of will made her more desirable at least for him days and nights with trella had spoiled him weak emptyheaded women painted and perfumed or trained only to keep house and hearth no longer interested him eskkar put the annoying thought aside last night tippu i sent you to gronds bed i did not realize what you and your sister had been through though i should have guessed you need not return to him tonight ill speak to him for the first time tippu lifted her eyes to his lord there is no need to say anything grond did no more than hold me through the night i am no longer afraid of being with him hes offered me his protection eskkar turned to lani who appeared just as surprised as her sister that didnt sound like grond at all a simple soldier who enjoyed taking a woman as much as any man someone as beautiful as tippu maybe the girl had bewitched him tippu bring food for us both well eat in here he touched lanis hand we have much to talk about lani i want to hear more about ninazu and about you and your sister eskkar sat on the bed and ate while lani told him everything about ninazu in managing ninazus household she directed his servants and concubines and served at his table lani knew everything she had overheard or been present during most of ninazus meetings with his men she even knew the secret place where ninazu had buried his personal store of gold ninazu like most men had spoken too freely in his conversations around his women a bad trait eskkar had once possessed until trella showed him just how dangerous such a habit could be after the meal he took hamati and a few men to retrieve the buried gold they crossed the square and entered a wellconstructed house with two rooms big enough for a goodsized family no doubt one of ninazus trusted subcommanders or perhaps even his brother shulat had occupied it it took only moments to find the hiding place still untouched and exactly where lani had said it would be a few moments of digging uncovered a goodsized sack containing gold silver and gemstones buried in the floor eskkar hadnt expected to find such a large cache apparently ninazu had been very successful in his raids even before he came to bisitun added to what they had found in ninazus main house there would be more than enough coins to keep trellas wallbuilding going for several months even after allocating a good portion to sisuthros and bisituns elders for use in the village even under torture ninazu might not have revealed this hiding place so eskkar decided he owed another debt to lani most of the morning had passed before eskkar and grond left the house for the second time they took a slow tour of the village checking on the soldiers prisoners and inhabitants reassured that his men had bisitun under control he decided to return to the house and visit the prisoner ninazu had scarcely moved except to soil himself he looked weaker and fever burned on his face infection had started in the broken leg eskkar ignored the hatred in the mans eyes are you ready to talk ninazu eskkar began without preamble ill not ask you again and i warn you that i already know much of what i want to know so dont try to lie to me ill tell you nothing barbarian ninazu tried to spit at eskkar but his parched lips produced only air he turned his face away the mans words satisfied eskkar hed made the offer yesterday and still felt bound by it but the situation had changed with the bandits gold in hand ninazu now meant little to eskkar then youll suffer for nothing ninazu lani told us everything eskkar said weve already found the rest of your loot buried across the square ignoring the mans curses eskkar turned to the guard only water as much as he wants there would be no wine to ease ninazus pain with him dead and his marauders broken or enslaved any freebooters still in the countryside would soon take heed and leave the area if not eskkar would drive them away in the next few weeks as his patrols began combing the countryside when hes finished drinking eskkar said to the hawk clan soldier guarding the prisoner take him outside have the men keep a close watch on him i dont want him killing himself to avoid the villagers revenge and dont let any villager man or woman near him remember what happened in dilgarth eskkar turned away and moved to the next bedroom the chamber used by lani and tippu as their sleeping quarters he found tippu curled up on the bed and lani sitting on a stool waiting she had changed back into the simple dress shed worn yesterday her eyes still looked red and puffy its time for ninazu to face the village lani theyll list their charges against him i will stay in my room lord i do not want to see his face again eskkar thought about that then shook his head lani i want you to accuse ninazu for the deeds he committed against you your husband and tippus family i have given you my protection but everyone in the village and all my soldiers must know what ninazu did to you and your kin otherwise some might think that you came with ninazu willingly even my men might not understand she cast her eyes downward and said nothing it will be hard lani but you need to do it both of you otherwise the spirits of your family will not rest in peace it may even help tippu with her memories i we will do it lord lani said still looking down when will we be needed not for some time farmers are still arriving from the countryside and there is much to discuss tell your sister what to say ill fetch you when you are needed he started to go then turned back after ninazu is dead the healing can start once youve reached akkad youll both be safe she didnt answer eskkar left the bedroom straightened his sword and brushed the hair back from his eyes when he stepped outside into the bright sunlight a shout arose from his men and the villagers echoed the cheer deliverer deliverer deliverer sisuthros had prepared well for his meeting with the village council hed joined four tables endtoend and sat in the center of the justformed council of elders who faced outward toward the square and the rest of the villagers at last all of the important farmers arrived sisuthros called the council of five to order and with a loud voice began listing the charges against ninazu and his men every soldier not on watch at the gates or corral gathered as well and sisuthros used them to guard the prisoners or keep the villagers back away from the tables grond carrying the last stool from the house followed his captain outside eskkar took a seat behind and a few paces from the table his back to the side of the house determined to take as little part in the proceedings as possible the crowd interrupted sisuthros after every charge shouting approval or calling down curses on ninazu at the end of the indictment sisuthros called for silence then announced that the rest of bisitun could add their own complaints to the grievances after everyone had voiced their accusations sisuthros and the council would apportion justice to ninazu and his men after dealing with the bandits the council would supervise the return of the stolen property to the villagers sisuthros gave the order and two guards dragged ninazu out into the sunlight a furious shout arose from the crowd and echoed around the square they shouted curses at ninazu and it took four soldiers with drawn swords to keep the villagers back as two men halfcarried the prisoner into the open space before the tables another soldier pushed a low cart into the center of the square they bound ninazu to the side of the wagon finishing up with a gag over his mouth to make sure he couldnt call down curses against his accusers during the proceedings other guards took positions in front of him facing the crowd alert and determined to make sure no one seeking private vengeance attacked the helpless ninazu with a knife or sword the process began though it moved too slowly for eskkars liking each of the elders wanted to speak and sisuthros had to cut two of them short when they rambled on venting their hatred when the elders finished the villagers came forward pushing and shoving one by one to list their charges against ninazu every man and woman in the square seemed to have a personal grievance against the bandit the sun had marched nearly to the top of the sky before sisuthros rose and announced that the council had heard enough and that lord eskkar wished to speak for the fi rst time the villagers quieted down not knowing what would come next eskkar stood and walked toward the elders when he reached the tables he climbed smoothly atop one and turned to face the people he hated talking to crowds but he had prepared his words while the villagers spoke a breeze pushed his hair against his cheek and he brushed it back waiting until everyone stopped talking for the first time the inhabitants of bisitun got a good look at their new lord they stared openmouthed at the tall warrior one hand resting on the hilt of the great sword a man clearly born in the northern steppes and who now ruled their lives eskkars eyes slowly scanned the square gazing it seemed at every single person who faced him when he spoke his deep voice carried even to those farthest away people of bisitun i too have grievances against ninazu i will speak for the people of dilgarth who have none here to represent their wishes at ninazus order his brother raided and killed many in dilgarth and their spirits cry out for vengeance as much as any here a peaceful village they had no fighting men to guard them today dilgarth is under the protection of akkad as all here are now under the protection of akkad i tell you what i told the people of dilgarth the days of bandits raiding this countryside are over from today on they will be hunted down and killed the few still left will soon learn to leave alone any who live under akkads safekeeping you will be safe in your homes and on your farms the prosperity that you enjoyed before the coming of the alur meriki will return and this time it will be even greater because of akkads protection he paused to take a breath clearly in awe of him the crowd remained silent and he felt glad that he had left all the petty details to sisuthros it made it easier to play the role of a distant guardian handing out decisions from above akkad dilgarth and bisitun as well as the other small villages will all work together trade together and defend themselves together eskkar turned to grond bring lani and tippu out he raised his voice again there are two more to accuse ninazu i want all to hear what he has done lifting his arm he pointed at lani and tippu as they walked into the center of the square grond supported tippu his arm around her waist but lani stood alone her head high holding tippu by the hand some in the square called out their displeasure at the sight of the women a few shouting that they too deserved punishment silence eskkar bellowed the single word the force of his voice shocking the crowd into stunned silence he glanced about the square but none of the villagers dared to meet his eyes all of them suddenly fearful of his wrath come forward lani ignoring the crowd she kept her eyes on eskkar until she reached the tables finally the two sisters stood directly in front of ninazu in a clear voice lani listed the crimes the bandit leader had done to her and her family she told the whole story what had been done to her giving the names of those murdered and tortured when she finished lani took her sisters arm and held her while tippu added her own grievances the murder of her betrothed her rape and enslavement tippus tears flowed as she spoke and only those close by could make out her halting words spoken in a barely audible voice after tippu finished eskkar spoke raising his voice to make sure everyone heard lani and tippu are under my protection because of them much of the gold stolen from you was recovered so all of you should give them thanks and although they are not from this village they are to be treated as honorably as anyone here eskkar jumped down from the table and this time the crowd shouted approval he returned to his spot near the wall while grond escorted the two sisters back into the house meanwhile sisuthros queried each council member and asked for his decision death each in turn called for ninazu to be put to the torture until he died sisuthros nodded his assent death at the hands of those whose kin he murdered he pronounced in a loud voice so that everyone present could hear the councils just decision one clearly approved by the gods let the torture begin the crowds roar of approval filled the square the three villagers selected by the elders to administer the torture came forward eager to get to their task and wielding small knives such as used for carving and the mallets and bronzetipped chisels used by the tanners to decorate their leather goods the implements would work equally as well for inflicting pain the guards moved farther apart as the torturers began their work so that all could see the crowd called out their curses on ninazu and shouted for the paingivers to hurry their work they removed ninazus gag and the torment began soon his screams echoed throughout the square the broken leg made things easier the slightest touch there instantly overcame any of ninazus efforts to hold in his pain he passed out several times but they always revived him by flinging a bucket of water in his face they forced more water down his throat to refresh him before they started in again urged on by the crowd by then eskkar had had enough unnoticed he returned into the house followed by his bodyguard he and grond sat down at the big table you dont feel like watching captain grond filled two cups with water ive seen enough of death and torture in the last few months eskkar felt glad to be away from ninazus ordeal besides it always makes me wonder how long id last under the knife i was put to the torture once grond said just because my master caught me looking at him said i wasnt respectful eskkar didnt bother to ask if grond had screamed everyone did again eskkar wondered what he would do if he were the one being tortured how well he would stand the pain or how long it would take before he began to plead for mercy or death some men resisted to the last but most begged for the pain to stop long before the end the thought sent a shiver through his frame in all his days of fighting hed only been captured once and that day death had come close the memory of being helpless before his enemies still troubled him eskkar swore to himself that he would never be taken alive better to fall on your own sword than go through that horror if the assault on bisitun had gone badly grond i might have ended up dead on the cart and ninazu might be standing over me well captain i wouldve avenged your death or at least buried your remains he looked at grond and had to smile they were alone in the house except for the two sisters huddled in their room trying to block out the noise from the crowd everyone else was outside enjoying the spectacle the screams from the square seemed almost as loud inside eskkar finished a handful of grapes from the platter would you like some wine lord or something to eat lani had come out of the bedroom you dont care to watch ninazu take the torture lani no lord i have seen enough of people being tortured now that its his turn on the wheel i know what will happen eskkar looked around the room where is your sister in our room her head under the blanket tippu cannot watch such things it sickens her even to hear it grond stood up perhaps i should go to her lani do you think it would help eskkar wondered about grond and tippu and what had happened last night or not happened as it seemed he would ask his bodyguard about it later when they were alone but lani mentioned it herself i think it would be good for her to be with someone besides myself for a little while at least until this horrible day is over she looked at grond can you restrain yourself as you did last night for a while longer when youve been a slave lani grond answered you know what is needed ill just hold her for a while he looked at eskkar if i may captain eskkar nodded surprised at the serious tone of gronds voice the bodyguard left the table and went to the womans room eskkar looked at lani for an explanation thats what he did last night lord he held her and told her she was safe she cried in his arms for a long time until she fell asleep your bodyguard didnt take her was he a slave in akkad no not in akkad he told me that hed been a slave in the lands to the west but he never said much about it only that he escaped he has the marks of the lash on his back and even in akkad he might have been put back into slavery except that we needed soldiers to fight the alur meriki but you did not put him back into bondage when the danger passed did not those in the village declare him a runaway slave i was born a barbarian lani the ways of the village are not always my ways besides he saved my life more than once do you think i could repay him for that by making him a slave again he pushed his wine cup toward her and she took a small sip before handing it back and now you rule the greatest village in the land so youre not a barbarian any more else the villagers would not follow you eskkar smiled at that theyre still having trouble accepting me as their ruler and i do not rule alone lani it seems even stranger that the nobles of akkad would accept a woman to rule over them so lani had heard about trellas true role in akkad well that made things easier she was a slave herself given to me to help manage my household he smiled at the thought trella is what my people call a gifted one she sees much knows the mysteries of farm and village and understands the ways of men without her i might not even be alive let alone ruler of akkad i heard that she is young only fifteen seasons she must be gifted indeed you must care for her a great deal eskkar nodded more than you can know lani shes very special to me and she carries our child now the child that will rule in akkad after us then i bless her name and i will not allow myself to be jealous of your love for her dont be lani its because of her that i am here and that youre under akkads protection he reached across the table and touched her hand and yet you are much like her i think your wits are quick and you understand the ways of men how old are you lani in the spring i will have twentyfour seasons lord but much of what i have learned is what i would soonest forget ninazus cries of agony rang throughout the square theyd managed to ignore the noise outside for a few moments suddenly the screams ended cut short replaced by a loud groan of disappointment and disapproval from the crowd ninazu must be unconscious or dead eskkar said ill go see he went to the doorway and called to one of the soldiers in a few moments eskkar returned to the table and sat down again ninazu is dead lani the torturers were too careless the villagers think he scarcely suffered lani bowed her head im glad hes dead my husbands life has been avenged now i can bury him at least in my thoughts everyone had to deal with grief and loss in their own way and eskkar had already done all he could to help her you will not be needed for the rest of the day lani stay inside until everything is finished he turned away and went back out into the square the crowd regained its voice with ninazu dead the villagers started arguing again many wanted all prisoners to be tortured and killed and eskkar watched as sisuthros pounded his sword hilt on the table to shut them up before sisuthros finished reckoning with the rest of ninazus men the sun passed midday the akkadians had captured thirtyone men and each one needed to be dealt with individually eskkar knew those who had committed the worst misdeeds would make poor slaves too ignorant or intractable they would have to be watched and guarded for the rest of their days always seeking to escape and more trouble than they were worth the villagers denounced nine of these and the council sentenced them to death four had committed particularly atrocious acts and were put to the torture giving each of them added pain before they died a quick sword thrust to the heart took care of the others sisuthros condemned those remaining the ones docile enough to accept their punishment to slavery to be branded with the mark of akkad and to labor for the rest of their lives he ordered fifteen to be sent to akkad as soon as possible akkad needed laborers more urgently than bisitun to work on the expansion of the walls corio and his builders would put the extra workers to good use despite akkads need eskkar shook his head at the thought of sending the slaves there some of his precious soldiers would be needed to guard and transport them more food would have to be found and sent with them along with horses ropes and everything else needed for at least a weeks march back to akkad sisuthros spent the remaining daylight dividing up the goods and animals recovered from ninazu despite recovering much of what ninazus men had taken many valuables couldnt be located of course several villagers claimed the same items causing arguments to erupt even with fair dispositions the rightful owners argued about the part taken by akkad everyone claimed that twotenths for akkad was far too great a portion until sisuthros threatened to take everything from the next man who protested he reminded them that they would have nothing if the akkadians had not rescued both them and their goods and that akkadian soldiers had died freeing them the gold and silver coins taken from ninazu provided another source of contention the difficulty being to establish how much had been taken from any one person acting together the council made those decisions often after appealing to the villagers who made dispositions based on what they thought a man might have possessed at last the sun began to sink below the western horizon and sisuthros announced the end of the days proceedings another assembly would convene the next day starting at midmorning the council of elders would meet earlier an hour after sunup to go over what would be the next order of businessrestoring the productivity of the farms the shopkeepers and the merchant traders the crowd began to disburse heading to their homes for supper even after most departed guards were posted at eskkars door to keep a few overeager supplicants away from the leaders of akkad marduk take all of them sisuthros said his voice hoarse he lifted his feet onto the table as he leaned back against the wall another day like today and ill run off and become a bandit myself eskkar felt every bit as tired the constant arguing grated on his nerves wearing him down yet he had to remain alert to study those as they spoke in order to determine who might be lying from those who had little skills with speech hed stayed out of it as much as possible but he had intervened twice when sisuthros looked toward him for help eskkar attempted to follow trellas advice be aloof do not deal in common matters leave those to your commanders that way the people will know you concern yourself with far more important things than some farmers cow or the innkeepers bill tomorrow will be easier sisuthros at least youve got the gold out of the way theyll quiet down as soon as they get back to work youll be besieged with requests for men to help rebuild the farms the ditches the shops the boats everything damaged or destroyed by ninazu captain i dont know how you and trella stand it better a hard fight against the barbarians any day he shook his head i dont think we have enough scribes and traders let alone soldiers lani approached the table carrying a tray of wine cheese and bread the first part of the evening meal eskkar mixed himself a cup of watered wine sisuthros was right they would need more help and they wouldnt be able to trust anyone from bisitun for months ill send word back to akkad sisuthros maybe nicar or corio has someone else they can spare to help you perhaps trella knows of someone he didnt mention sisuthross wife far too shy and retiring she wouldnt be able to deal forcefully with determined villagers eskkar watched lani as she moved gracefully about the cooking area giving directions to the two women preparing the food he knew she could be of use to sisuthros but the people of bisitun would never accept her in that role to them no matter what eskkar had said today she would always be ninazus woman besides he had promised her protection in akkad hamati drakis the scribes and a few of the other senior men sat down at the table everyone hungry for their dinner lani and tippu returned carrying more trays laden with food helped by the other women who had done a good part of the cooking in their own homes no fancy fare yet food would remain in short supply in bisitun until the market reestablished itself nevertheless in the next few days farmers would be bringing in whatever they could spare to sell to the soldiers and villagers so for tonights dinner the men ate a stew made from two chickens chopped into tiny chunks and mixed with fresh vegetables four loaves of bread fresh from the ovens helped soak up the stew and watered wine completed the meal not much food for fighting men but most of bisitun would not eat as well tonight at least no villager would starve in the next week or ten days though plenty would go to bed hungry the meal finished eskkar and sisuthros took another walk about the village both men felt the need to stretch their legs after sitting or standing all day with solemn looks on their faces accompanied by grond and three other guards they spent hours poking about until darkness made it too difficult to see anything eskkar took every opportunity to talk with the villagers such casual speech didnt come easy to him but trella had gotten him used to making small talk with the common folk asking about their homes their families their needs and their hopes hed learned that people provided the real basis for his rule and he worked hard at building a bond between himself and those he ruled the three men were yawning when they returned to the square for once empty of villagers after such a long and exciting day everyone would be in bed eager for sleep eskkar sisuthros and grond washed at the well stripping down and pouring water over their bodies it didnt feel as refreshing as a good swim in the river but eskkar promised himself that luxury tomorrow come what may carrying their clothes the three of them walked back inside the house the big room empty of servants held only two soldiers standing guard just inside the door eskkar spoke to both of them to make sure they stayed alert though sisuthros had distributed much of the loot the house still held the gold destined for akkad eskkar had just entered his room when lani appeared carrying a pitcher of wine another of water and a single cup shed no doubt heard the men cleaning themselves at the well so she brought no washing bowls splashing a bit of wine into a cup she added water before handing it to him already she had learned that he drank his wine well watered thank you lani he said breaking the silence she probably thought he expected her to attend him she wore the same soft robe she wore last night when she came to him and already he wished she would unfasten it he took a sip from the cup lani you dont have to be here your sorrow for your husband is she touched her finger to his lips my husband has been dead for over four months today watching ninazu die i put an end to my grief now i have to care for my sister then shell need you tonight lani stay with her she doesnt have your strength tonight she has grond to comfort her she saw the look on his face no lord she went to him willingly its time she ceased being afraid of men and i think grond is the right man for that task he ignores her dishonor and treats her with respect his presence reassures her more than my words ever can she knows no one will hurt her now true enough eskkar thought only a foolhardy man would offer any insult to a woman under gronds protection lani turned away and went to the door she closed it then placed the wooden bar across the frame turning back to face him she lifted her head high i think its time that i too went willingly to a mans bed i would stay the night with you again lord if i do not displease you he looked at her and his resolve vanished she had some essence something that made him want her and he knew it was more than just her skill in pleasuring him eskkar sat down on the bed more than a little unsure of himself you know i want you lani but i wont take you with a lie on my lips my life is back in akkad with trella and ill be going back soon enough then i only ask that you keep your word lord to take me and my sister back to akkad with you until then you will need someone to manage your household care for you while you are here and hold you in the darkness of the night you do not need to call me lord lani my name is eskkar i am just a simple soldier one trying to rule a city and a land full of problems she stepped toward him stopping just out of reach and began to unfasten her dress no eskkar i heard you in the square today and saw what you did you gave the villagers honesty and justice something they havent seen in many months despite their complaining they already accept you as their ruler and trust you to protect them you are a great lord to have such power over men the robe untied she slipped it over her shoulders letting it hang from her arms the same as shed done last night she closed her eyes to his gaze but her body trembled as if she could already feel his hands upon her he shook his head no one had ever called him great before if he ever ruled this land it would be trella who deserved that honor he couldnt explain all that to lani not now he stood and reached for her taking her in his arms and catching her hair in his hand he kissed her upraised lips and heard the robe slip to the floor she tasted sweet to him and he kissed her even harder letting his other hand find and fondle her breast until she caught her breath what can i do to please my lord tonight she kept her voice low but he could hear the passion in it he swung her around and pushed her gently down on the bed for a moment he felt tempted to leave the candle burning but the sight of her body already burned in his memory he leaned over and blew out the flickering light despite his passion he took the time to unsheathe the sword and lean it against the wall before sliding into the bed they held each other neither one saying anything just kissing and touching for a long time until his excitement grew when lani moved to pleasure him as she had done the night before he held her down kissing her neck oh no lani not tonight tonight i will give you pleasure he lay on his side and began caressing her sucking and biting on her nipples while his fingers probed and teased her body at first she seemed uncomfortable with the attention but gradually she relaxed letting him arouse her his lips moved up and down the length of her body tasting her kissing her and she began to moan from the pleasure he gave her he resisted her first pleadings ignored the way she pushed her body against him held back until her hand tightened so much around him that he thought he would burst finally he moved atop her and slid deep into her body a long sigh of pleasure escaped her lips and she locked her legs around him he began to move against her and she matched his movements pushing herself against him before long she cried out her arms and legs fastening themselves around him her sounds of passion coming faster and faster until she gave a little scream into his neck as her body overwhelmed her trembling she could do nothing but hold him fast he increased his thrusts against her and soon he too cried out as he gave her his seed his face and mouth buried in her hair for a long time he lay on top of her his passion spent but enjoying the touch of her body when he moved beside her she moaned a little he took her in his arms and held her her whole body shook and he tasted the salt of tears on his lips when he gently kissed her cheek did i hurt you lani no lord her arms pulled tight around his neck and she buried her face against his these are tears of happiness in akkad the days passed swiftly for tammuz overnight the addition of enhedu to his household made the gloomy place seem brighter and its dull routine soon disappeared as she set about improving the alehouse neither kuri nor tammuz had ever bothered trying to keep the place clean but she soon made up for their past neglect she traded a few cups of ale to a carpenter who lived nearby he labored there whenever he had no work of his own or if hed worked up a thirst an hour at a time over the course of a week he fixed the rickety benches and tables and built a new shelf to hold the few cups and plates the alehouse possessed at tammuzs suggestion the carpenter also rebuilt the taverns two doors making the outer door more solid and repairing the inner one that led to tammuzs private room when the craftsman finished the two doors hung properly swung freely and both could be fastened securely for working on the doors the carpenter asked for a payment of five copper coins in addition to his usual libations he had to shape some castoff bronze strips for the hinges make a dozen nails and rebuild the outer doors lintel for the satisfaction of sleeping safer at night tammuz agreed to the sum in his neighborhood inhabitants paid any price for the chance to sleep in safety at night a few days later when the carpenter completed his tasks and emptied his last cup of free ale the alehouse looked much better for a finishing touch enhedu using some red dye bought at the marketplace sketched a wine cup and the barley symbol on the outer wall so that passersby could tell at a glance what the establishment sold while all this was going on tammuz watched in astonishment as enhedu began ordering the patrons around first she made them stop urinating against the alehouses outside wall the regular customers soon grew tired of her berating and scolding and went down the lane and around the corner to relieve themselves newcomers were warned and if anyone forgot she told kuri to keep them out until they learned their lesson in a few days much of the rank odor disappeared from the outside of the alehouse at the same time with kuris assistance she cut a small hole through the ceiling of the public room giving the stale air and cooking smoke a chance to escape a good tradeoff for the occasional rain that would find its way inside for another copper coin two barrows loaded with clean sand arrived tammuz watched as enhedu efficiently spread the contents over the dirt floor that helped keep the bugs and insects under control with these and other improvements enhedu suggested the establishment took on a somewhat more reputable appearance the number of customers increased as well which not only helped profits increase but provided more of a cover for the halfdozen or more thieves who habituated the place since tammuz kept his ale prices low his clientele soon increased and most of the patrons knew each other that kept the fights to a minimum and kuri had fewer problems keeping order enhedu wanted to do more but tammuz a smile on his face told her to stop before the place began to look too good for its customers that made her laugh and without thinking he took her in his arms for a brief moment she looked happy and alive then she stiffened and he knew thoughts of her former master still troubled her nevertheless he couldnt stop from kissing her her mouth felt warm and soft and she didnt resist nor did she kiss him back he knew she wasnt ready not yet the fear remained in her eyes so he let her go to his surprise she hugged him for a moment before turning back to her work her touch gave him a feeling of contentment that lasted the rest of the afternoon the days went by and if his nights still lacked the pleasure of the gods he refused to allow the shortcoming to bother him be patient he said to himself though now he whispered it with a smile on his lips best of all the purpose lacking in his life returned since hed crippled his arm hed held little hope for the future though hed undertaken the assignment at the alehouse hed done so more to please eskkar and lady trella than out of any conviction he would ever accomplish anything of importance now he saw how he could make a difference how what he did today and would do in the future could help protect the vision eskkar and trella wished for akkad watching enhedu day after day he began to comprehend the mysterious ways of women and the more he learned the more he understood how eskkar commanded trellas affections the tiny hint of jealousy hed always felt for akkads ruler disappeared with that new knowledge with the alehouse in good hands and running smoothly tammuz spent several hours a day shadowing the inn where korthac stayed or the river where he traded his gemstones one morning after korthac departed for his business at the docks tammuz tried to enter the inn ostensibly to buy food but the egyptian guarding the door stopped him with a hand on his chest before tammuz could even plead his case the inns owner standing behind the guard called out for tammuz to leave informing him that at present the inn served only korthac and his men frustrated tammuz decided to risk another more direct approach one of his customers sargat a young man only a season or two older than tammuz made his living by thieving at night agile and strong sargat could hang by his fingertips and pull himself up and over any roof in akkad as quiet as a mouse he could see in the dark better than most sargat had slipped into many a house without waking its inhabitants collected what he could and left as silently as he entered in order to entice sargat tammuz invented a story about a trader who competed with korthac sought information about the secretive egyptian and would pay well for anything sargat could learn if you can discover anything see anything fi nd out what their plans are or even what these egyptians are doing this man will pay well for the information as tammuz finished he slid a silver coin across the table to sargat and if you happen to pick up any of his goods my patron will be glad to buy them from you sargat reached for the silver but tammuz put his hand over the coin not until you return and youll have to be careful korthac has guards everywhere and they look as if theyd do more than just break a few bones if they catch you the thief nodded in understanding hed seen korthacs men in the lanes a little after midnight that night while tammuz waited at the far end of the lane sargat took to the roofs and made his way toward the inn vanishing into the darkness tammuz squatted down to wait the better part of an hour passed without a sound suddenly he heard voices then something falling with a crash but all too muted to wake anyone sleeping nearby nevertheless he knew something had gone awry tammuz pushed himself to his feet cursing at whatever unknown problem had occurred and anxiously scanned the rooftops a shadow blocked the moonlight for an instant and tammuz caught a glimpse of a dark shape running along the rooftop by now a light burned in the inn and tammuz heard the door bang open his heart began beating faster and he took off down the lane running as fast as he could and trying to make as little noise as possible when he felt sure he wasnt being followed he slipped through the streets and back to the alehouse kuri waited there the door unbarred sargat was already inside his breathing still audible as he tried to catch his breath tammuz led the thief into his private room while enhedu watched the lane and kuri guarded the door the two men sat in the darkness what happened tammuz kept his voice to a whisper did you learn anything i almost got killed they were up in a moment looking tammuz heard the fear in the young mans voice tell me what happened you were gone long enough sargat took a deep breath tammuz poured the thief a cup of ale then watched as sargat gulped it down without pausing the strong brew calmed him and he took a few more breaths before going on i got inside one of korthacs men was on guard below watching the roof hole but he looked ready to doze off so i waited until his head began to nod and i slipped past him tammuz hadnt expected anyone to be guarding the roof the fl imsy wood and vine rooftops creaked and swayed with every movement and made plenty of noise only someone with a slight figure like sargat who knew how to move silently and with patience could traverse the delicate rafters without waking those below tammuz puzzled over why korthac would place a guard over the roof s entrance since only an exceptional thief could gain entrance that way you could have been caught you werent supposed to i know sargat went on but he was breathing like a sleeper so i felt sure i could get past besides there was nothing to see from the roof just a room full of sleeping men all snoring away but when i climbed down the ladder i saw two more men guarding the door and another standing before one of the private rooms tammuz felt a tingle go through him four guards on watch during the night hed never heard of such a thing no merchant no noble kept that many men awake during darkness then what happened nothing with three or four men on guard i decided to get out i started back up the ladder but the wood creaked and the guard jumped you know the way you do when you wake suddenly i scrambled up the ladder then i heard a crash the guard swung his sword and nearly got my leg he came up the ladder after me in an instant and i ran i heard him stumbling behind me but i took to the ledges tammuz knew the rest sargat could outrun anyone across a rooftop youre lucky you werent caught i told you not to take any chances what about my coin will you still pay me the silver yes youve earned it maybe even more stay here ill enhedu slipped into the room keep silent she whispered there are men with swords in the lane looking about stay here and dont move about she went back into the common room tammuz felt his heart pounding in his chest how had they tracked him here could he have been followed he heard sargats rapid breathing and reached out and gripped the thief s arm stay still and dont make a sound he ordered they sat like that not moving not making a sound until enhedu returned theyve gone theyre checking all the houses on the street putting their ears to the doors listening thank the gods your customers are still snoring their ale away so korthacs guards hadnt followed him tammuz realized theyd just headed to the places most likely to be frequented by thieves they werent listening for sounds but for the absence of sounds if they found a place without the little murmurs of slumber they would have forced their way in he wondered who gave them the idea then answered the thought himself korthac only he would have the cunning to think of such things something else occurred to him sargat youre not cut or anything are you tammuz still worried about anyone overhearing kept his voice to a whisper no the sword missed by a handbreadth thank the lazy god who watches over thieves though my tunic got torn and show me enhedu ordered startling both men sargat fingered his shoulder it caught when the ladder slipped probably on some splinter or a nail i heard it rip dont leave the alehouse enhedu said tomorrow ill get you a new tunic why whats the matter sargat asked tammuz took a moment to catch up with his slave theyll be walking the lanes tomorrow looking for someone with a torn sleeve if they saw that youll stay inside the alehouse for a few days if any of the egyptians come wandering in here theyll find nothing theres nothing else to do tonight enhedu said kuri sargat get some sleep sargat emptied another cup of ale before he left going into the common room to try and sleep tammuz checked the outer door before returning to his chamber fastening the inner door and climbing into bed enhedu moved against him so she could whisper in his ear if theyd caught him they would have beat your name out of him she said i dont think you should risk anything like that again korthac is leaving the inn soon ill watch his new house as we planned it will be safer than trying to break in tammuz knew she never liked the idea of sending in sargat but she didnt remind him youre right he admitted if sargat had been captured and put to the torture it would have been bad damn the gods i just wanted to find out something about korthac for trella something useful you just did you learned how alert his men are and how well he guards his secrets lady trella will want to know that before she makes the same mistake now go to sleep he felt her thigh brush against his and suddenly korthac and trella were forgotten the urge to take her mount her right now surged over him and he had to struggle to keep control be patient he had to say the words to himself a dozen times before he finally drifted off to a restless and uneven sleep for enhedu the days with tammuz seemed like a dream a happy dream she hoped would never end her brief stay at lady trellas house had mended her body but she knew her soul still needed more time to recover her years as a slave had nearly ruined her mind but lady trella had assured her that in time her spirit would heal the experience of living with trella annoksur and other strong women in lord eskkars house showed enhedu that she could make a difference that her life wasnt entirely under the control of others in lady trellas household enhedu saw that even slaves could be treated well respected for their talents and rewarded for their service for the first time in her life enhedu began to appreciate the many unique and special talents a strong woman could possess and how they might be used she also came to understand some of trellas reasons for rescuing her pity had little to do with it trella wanted allies those who could help her keep control of akkad she offered enhedu the opportunity to shape her own destiny if she could grasp it enhedu determined to make the most of this chance at a new life her childhood had consisted of hard labor on her parents farm and the brutal existence shed endured the last three seasons now helped her more than she realized physically strong she could labor long hours without tiring enhedu soon comprehended the simple business of running an alehouse far less complicated than the craft of tanning leather after the first day she took over almost all of kuris duties leaving him free to assist tammuz as needed her new master helped her more than he knew even as he gave her the time she needed to heal he offered something else a life she could share as an equal partner with each day enhedu grew more accepting of both him and the life trella had restored to her tammuz had almost no possessions much less than her former master and enhedu owned nothing but the dress she wore each day but he had something more valuable than goods to give her the trust of lady trella if the ruler of akkad considered tammuz a friend and a valuable ally then enhedu would devote her days to helping him and indirectly lady trella that common purpose helped bind them to one another and tammuz listened to her that gave enhedu more pleasure than anything shed known in her life no man or woman had ever asked her advice or cared about her thoughts sharing her confidences with him benefited them both and she saw that tammuz felt much the same one night he confided to her that for the first time in his life he felt happy for enhedu the discovery that someone cared for her really cared awakened feelings shed never experienced tammuz filled her thoughts as she knew she filled his slowly almost reluctantly she began to think about giving herself to him to give him the one pleasure he lacked to her surprise the thought seemed less repugnant than shed expected now that her body had healed she began to think more often about submitting to him though she still had misgivings still enhedu worried that tammuz might not be satisfied with her that afterward he would turn from her like her former master she sought to banish such thoughts but they returned seemingly strongest the closer tammuz and she were drawn to each other nevertheless they shared a common purpose that drew them together as the days passed master and slave worked equally in their effort to unravel the mystery that was korthac they both wished to please lady trella and for much the same reason enhedu out of gratitude for saving her life and tammuz for giving his life purpose their first day together enhedu and tammuz talked for hours about korthac when they finished they had a plan and the next day they began the preparations necessary to set it in motion taking advantage of enhedus experience in the tannery tammuz approached an older woman ninbanda whose husband had died a few weeks earlier he too had worked with leather cutting trimming and shaping the cured hide into finished goods that ninbanda sold in the market but with his death his duties had passed to his brother who could do little to help his brothers widow he gave her some work and a place to live and allowed her to sell some of the poorer quality goods that came through the tannery but she often didnt earn enough to offset the hardship to her family the woman quickly accepted tammuzs offer to share in the selling of additional goods that tammuz would provide ninbanda also agreed to his one condition that she and enhedu sell their wares not in the market but in a particular lane and at a specific location tammuz of course didnt mention that this was where korthac decided to dwell ten days after enhedu came to the alehouse tammuz received word that korthac had finally settled on a new house the largest houses in the better parts of akkad remained occupied and no amount of gold could entice their occupants to leave to korthacs obvious annoyance he eventually had to compromise on his new dwelling the egyptians new residence actually consisted of one large house flanked by two smaller ones unfortunately for korthac the large central house remained occupied by its former owners who delayed their departure an extra week or so thereby preventing korthac from taking possession moving quickly tammuz established ninbanda and enhedu as sellers of goods in the lane outside korthacs residences a few days later when korthac finally took possession enhedu had already established herself and her wares as if shed been selling there all her life each morning enhedu rose before dawn gathered the days wares and went to her post just a few paces down the lane from korthacs new houses corio akkads master artisan had offered to build a new home for korthac as grand as he wanted but the egyptian decided to wait for that and settled for the three joined houses he split his men between the two smaller structures and lived in the main house with just a few servants and guards enhedu and her business partner ninbanda pushed their cart into the lane at dawn then sat behind it all day pitching their wares to all those who passed by sandals leather strips for binding belts pouches scabbards for knives and swords wrist guards and even some leather rings necklaces and bracelets were offered for sale mixed in with the goods were the occasional items stolen by tammuzs customers so the business actually helped her master recover some of his expenses with two women working the cart the business thrived especially since enhedu took but a tiny part of the profits the selling took little effort leaving her plenty of time to chat with ninbanda and those who lived in the lane enhedu soon became familiar with korthacs men even learning their names after a few days she called out to them when they passed by offering her wares urging them to look and to buy she quickly learned not to attempt to speak with them when they walked with korthac the egyptian showed no tolerance for those beneath him and coldly berated any of his men who fraternized with the villagers of course a woman selling in the streets was far below his notice and after one glance at enhedus disfigured face he ignored her completely korthacs men however looked at her far differently enhedu knew the look of lust when she saw it and the egyptians all seemed to burn with it her broken nose didnt matter to them and not only her but any woman in the lane their hot eyes devoured each woman they passed mens lusts were nothing new to enhedu shed had to satisfy not only her former master but some of his friends on more than one occasion spreading her legs shed closed her eyes and did what they commanded her old master had taught her to obey as soon as she reached his house he raped her at once not even bothering to close the door then beat her for not pleasing him the beatings continued every day until she learned to obey every command instantly remembering those times made her apprehensive she knew tammuz wanted to take her and she dreaded the day when he could no longer restrain himself a slave was bound to pleasure her master and yet the thought of a man even tammuz taking her being inside her brought back the painful memories after all these weeks shed learned to trust tammuz to let him hold her in the darkness and she clasped his hand at every opportunity nevertheless she wondered fretfully what lady trella would think if she learned enhedu hadnt pleasured tammuzthat she had failed in one of the most basic duties due her master aside from that concern she looked forward to the end of each day when she returned to the alehouse shed soon discovered that old kuri needed plenty of help dispensing the ale especially in the evening hours he drank too much of his own wares and easily lost track of what the customers consumed and paid enhedu kept a close watch on the stock and cut down on the waste and spillage kuri gladly relinquished that part of his duties and instead did his best to maintain order naturally many customers wanted more than just ale and solicitations for sex and worse initially followed her every step tammuz ordered one man out the first night for laying a hand on her and kuri did the same the following night by then enhedu had grown confi dent enough in her own strength after shed knocked down one drunken patron and threatened to bash his brains in with a stool the regular patrons soon learned to leave her alone she was the owners slave and he was keeping her for himself a not entirely unreasonable thing to do once the customers grasped the odd fact that she was not for sale they accepted her as one of themselves for herself enhedu came to enjoy the time spent behind the selling cart being outside breathing fresh air and enjoying the sun with little to do except watch the cart gave her more time to heal the long days turned into weeks and enhedu and her leatherwares became as much a part of the lane outside korthacs residence as the walls houses and dirt underfoot and just as unnoticed and so the days passed enhedu watched the egyptians with care always challenging them to purchase something from her cart some of them spoke only egyptian but many had picked up more than a few words of the local language they remained subdued when korthac walked about but a week after his arrival in akkad korthac began spending most of the daylight hours at the river he set up a trading table there and each day offered a handful of gems for sale or trade many akkadians stopped at his table as well as travelers boatmen and traders journeying up or down the tigris that left most of his guardsas enhedu soon came to think of them that waywith nothing to do except wait for their masters return she discovered they were not allowed to leave the house without korthac or his senior assistant a tall baldheaded man named hathor hathor also functioned as an occasional bodyguard though there were other egyptians who regularly guarded korthacs person forbidden to walk the lanes korthacs men lounged in the doorways staring boldly at the women who passed by for the braver ones it only took a few steps to cross the lane and examine enhedus merchandise and exchange a few words with her in their halting way she made sure they always received a warm smile for their efforts they seem to be waiting for something enhedu said to tammuz each night they sat alone in the dark of their bedroom or lay together in the bed leaving kuri to keep watch in the outer chamber while the customers snored on the floor we know no more than we did last month tammuz said impatience and frustration showing in his voice each week i send word to trella weve learned nothing new we must wait a bit longer tammuz she said korthacs men are becoming more friendly he cant keep them in the houses forever by now shed watched korthacs house for more than four weeks and understood tammuzs frustration i wish i could slip into the house at night just to listen you know you cannot do that tammuz since the incident on the roof korthac had added another sentry on the rooftop at night and still had the usual guards at all the entrances no doubt another one or two would be inside the main house alert and awake the extra guards didnt arouse any suspicion to the rest of akkad everyone knew korthac possessed plenty of gold and gems and naturally he would take precautions something will turn up sooner or later she said taking his hand and holding it close we just have to be ready when it happens soon i hope soon im sure now go to sleep master enhedu waited as he tossed and turned before finally falling asleep his arm thrown over her chest she let go of his hand and thought about the man asleep in her arms he needed to be pleasured and soon frustrated by his inability to learn anything about korthac she knew tammuz needed something else to think about she sighed any day now and she would have to do it offer herself to him and endure the pain perhaps it wouldnt be so painful with tammuz and better a little pain than facing lady trellas disapproval i tell you trella this is wrong asurak deserves his goods and the council should support his claim otherwise otherwise asurak will have to pay what he agreed corio cut in the annoyance plain in his voice which he should have done yesterday instead of wasting the councils time the discussion argument really had gone on for some time and trella didnt need to hear much to make up her mind the dispute started at dawn when the trader from dilgarth tried to deliver his goods to asurak the trader chuvash had come down from dilgarth yesterday with the first wagonload of raw flax two merchants had bid for the goods and asurak had proffered the higher price to chuvash with the goods to be delivered this morning now asurak claimed that after a closer inspection the goods were inferior and only offered to pay fifteen silver coins instead of the agreedupon price of twentyfive within the hour everyone in the marketplace knew the story trella on her way to the council meeting learned of it from annoksur whod heard it from one of the women in the market rasui the newest member of akkads nobles and a close friend of asurak supported the merchants claim and made the argument before the other council members trella spoke before rasui could start again i think the council has heard enough both asurak and chuvash gave us their versions and the council has heard the same story twice she turned to corio nicar and then to rasui before going on asurak inspected the goods before he offered the price he waited until the other bidder had left the city before he decided the goods were inferior if the trader wants to sell his flax rasui countered then he has to sell to my asurak there are no other buyers of flax in akkad trella smiled at rasuis logic true enough all the usual buyers of flax had departed for dilgarth in the last few days eager to resume trade and lock in prices for the first deliveries knowing of the temporary shortage of buyers in akkad asurak no doubt felt confident the dilgarth trader would have to accept the revised terms no the deal is revoked trella said asurak says he doesnt want the goods at the original price fine then let him pay chuvash two silver coins as a penalty for attempting to change the agreed upon price i will pay the trader twentyfive coins for the flax myself im sure i can resell the goods in a few days when the flax weavers return from dilgarth corio laughed aloud sounds fair to me he turned to nicar what do you say actually i was about to make the same offer nicar said a hint of humor in his voice i dont usually deal in flax but i have a boat going downriver tomorrow and i can ship the raw flax south plenty of weavers in the villages along the river the first boatload should fetch a good price if lady trella doesnt mind i will buy the goods from chuvash for twentysix silver coins trella laughed be my guest nicar you can make better use of it im sure rasui muttered something under his breath trella couldnt hear what he said but corio sitting beside rasui must have watch your tongue rasui corio said disdain plain in his voice this council isnt here to help scheming merchants take advantage of others your friend should have known better well then at least asurak need not pay the two silver coins as trella suggested rasui argued since hes getting twentysix from nicar and the two extra coins are for wasting the councils time and the traders trella said he pays or he can leave akkad lady trella speaks for all of us corio said turning to rasui and emphasizing the honorific asurak can pay now or leave tomorrow whichever he prefers trella had noticed rasuis frequent omission of her simple title a sign of respect given to her as eskkars wife and for presiding over the council in his absence and while the council of nobles was technically a group of equals everyone remembered when eskkar had convened the first meeting a week or so after the siege ended some newly returned shopkeeper had referred to trella casually eskkar had given the man such a look that he turned pale and couldnt stammer his apologies fast enough after that no one failed to refer to her properly and now rasui caught up in the heat of the argument and trying to help his friend cheat the trader from dilgarth had not only forgotten her title but said something derogatory about her under his breath if eskkar were here the man would already be packing his things assuming he still had his head on his shoulders trella sighed and wished for a brief moment that indeed eskkar were here her husband might hate these endless and interminable meetings but he did have a way of settling certain disputes once he simply ordered a tavernkeeper out of akkad when the man protested eskkar stood and put his hand on his sword before asking if the man wished to go for a swim in the tigris without his head not very diplomatic but when used occasionally and with care very effective trella rose and leaned forward on the table resting her hands on the rough surface she gazed directly into rasuis eyes tell your friend two silver coins to chuvash now and the council doesnt want to hear any more about this matter so tell asurak to keep his complaints to himself if he cant trade honestly he can leave akkad im sure theres room on nicars boat for one more rasui clenched his jaw but one glance at the two hawk clan soldiers guarding the door reminded him that trella had no problem with using force no one spoke and all eyes turned to rasui then its settled nicar said speaking before the silence went on too long and rasui felt tempted to speak up and if theres nothing else to discuss this morning i would like to get back to my business and i corio agreed theres so much building going on i hate to be away from my apprentices any longer than necessary rasui dropped his hands on the table and nodded agreement as you say lady trella trella ignored the hint of condescension in rasuis tone straightening up she sweetened her voice then until tomorrow nobles rasui left first no doubt to give his friend asurak the bad news and put the matter behind him corio nodded at trella but made for the door nearly as fast as rasui trella and nicar left together her two guards forming up around her as soon as they went outside and into the lane rasui lets his tongue run away with him nicar commented as they walked side by side asurak probably offered five coins to rasui to help him shave the price if we dont treat these traders fairly then the goods will flow elsewhere trella said repeating the policy she and the council had established weeks ago yes but a little cheating is expected nicar said thats what we merchants do sometimes to get the best price even trella laughed at that i dont recall you ever doing anything so obvious nicar you always appreciate the need to keep good relationships with your suppliers perhaps im just more subtle in my dealings at least i hope i am theyd reached the fork in the lane and nicar bade her goodbye as he walked off toward his home annoksur whod followed behind them since they left the council house moved alongside trella with only two more lanes to cross trella took her time stopping whenever she saw any of the dozens of women she knew and answering the same questions again and again about the coming child trellas excellent memory enabled her to keep a name with each face and her ability to recall nearly every detail of every conversation convinced her followers that they occupied a special place in her thoughts in a few moments the women and guards reached eskkars lane and a few paces later they turned into his courtyard do you need to rest trella no i just want to sit outside for a while trella answered dealing with rasui always leaves a bad taste in my mouth they walked to the back of the house and sat together on the bench between the two young trees only a single guard kept station there to make sure no one slipped in over the wall and to keep an eye on trellas bedroom window on the upper story the soldier at a smile from trella obligingly moved away across the courtyard he could still see the women but not hear them if they kept their voices low that asurak annoksur began he should be driven out of akkad he tries to cheat everyone he deals with sooner or later someone is going to put a knife between his ribs hes no worse than a dozen others trella said except he has a friend on the council rasui encourages sharp dealing i sometimes wish we had never accepted him into the nobles rasui had the gold to pay his way onto the council annoksur said though how he got it no one knows before the siege rasui had been a minor trader dealing in slaves like many others too fearful to stay and fight hed chosen to depart the city before the alur meriki arrived a few months later after eskkar drove off the barbarians rasui returned with plenty of gold in his pouch and a steady supply of slaves the trader paid the penalty demanded by the council for abandoning the city and paid again to join the council itself as a noble trella never cared for slave traders not after her own experiences with them but the reborn city required all the skills and trades it could find shed put aside her own distaste for rasui and his calling though now she wished otherwise in a few months if he doesnt change his ways well send him packing trella said but not now we still need every trader merchant and worker we can entice to come here during the siege many merchants and craftsmen had left the city most of them going to the south some even as far as sumeria and except for war goods such as timber and bronze much of akkads trade had fallen off as traders sought safer places to do business and though many people had returned to or settled in akkad the number of craftsmen herders and farmers hadnt recovered the situation would change soon enough but the next six months would be critical to insure the citys continued growth afterward akkad would be stronger than before and individual merchants and traders would be less important in another week or two annoksur said asurak will be back before the council answering some other complaint and hiding behind rasuis tunic probably trella agreed but for now i think the real problem goes deeper these council meetings waste most of our time on petty disputes that do little to grow the city when we first convened the council important matters needed to be resolved but now akkad has grown too big to govern in the same way as a small village even eskkar knows that we need a new way of ruling a way that allows the city to grow while protecting its trade and its people more changes annoksur said the nobles wont like that theyve already given up much of their authority a breeze filled the courtyard rustling the trees and shaking some blossoms from the limbs both women paused for a moment watching the tree limbs sway gracefully there are nearly five thousand people in akkad trella went on in another few years there may be twice as many the number of disputes will more than double there will be quarrels over housing farmlands herds anything and everything if there are two or three confrontations a day to be resolved now there will be a dozen each day soon enough no we need to reshape akkads ways now before the sheer number of people overwhelms us no one likes change trella people like things to be the way theyve always been i know eskkar and i have spoken about this many times hes visited dozens of villages throughout the land and seen every abuse of power possible even here he wants to rule bisitun in such a way that the people there are thankful to be under akkads control hes become a different man in the last few months because of you annoksur said now even my bantor is starting to consider his choices with more care hes started worrying about the future too new times call for new skills trella said she reached down and picked up a blossom swept against her feet but it pleases me to see bantor learning new ways she thought for a moment admiring the flower as she did so i think great change is coming for all of us and if we do not lead the way those changes will overwhelm us with bisitun to worry about we must fi nd new ways to rule there too ways that dont make the people there and here in akkad hate our authority otherwise well be no better than any bandit what would you change first trella as eskkar says there must be a better way to resolve disputes trella answered it would be even better to avoid them in the first place there will always be disputes trella the larger the village the more frequent the arguments one mans word against another shopkeepers and customers alike complaining about their dealings the problem i think is not what to change first i think we need to change everything all at once annoksur reached out and took trellas hand if anyone else said that id laugh but you do you really think you can replace the customs so easily no not easily trella said but the sooner we start the easier it will be suppose we wanted to stop merchants from sharp dealing if all the prices for everything were written down everyone would know them and it wouldnt be so easy to cheat most people cant read the symbols there arent enough symbols anyway and that i think is another thing we must resolve we must get the clerks together and have them invent new symbols ones needed to run a city there would have to be many more symbols and they would have to be written down so that the scribes and clerks dont forget them youd need many more clerks as well yes more clerks more symbols more ways to record agreements and a person in authority to settle disputes based on these new written records so wed have to start there with a new school for scribes and a new house to administer the customs she shook her head revising her thoughts no they wouldnt be customs any longer once they were written down they would become laws something that couldnt change on a merchants or nobles whim can the people even learn the symbols annoksur countered if they couldnt theyd still be trusting some scribe or merchant to explain them people would only need to know a few basic symbols if youre a farmer then you need to know about crops bushels hectares and farm animals a craftsman in the city would need to know different symbols the ones that dealt with his craft only the scribes would need to know all the symbols whenever someone needed a contract or to record an agreement or transaction they would visit one of our new scribes i think it would work annoksur there would have to be rules established to maintain order annoksur said warming to the idea perhaps another house might be established one to govern the growth of akkad yes next to the building where theyll teach and train the scribes and store the records that will be a large house then annoksur said only halfjokingly important contracts were written in clay most on pottery shards about the size of a womans hand once dried they could be duplicated stored and even transported the clerks traveling with eskkar had sent back by boat several baskets containing records all carefully wrapped to prevent breakage storing large quantities of such records would require many large rooms filled with hundreds of shelves to contain the shards trella leaned back letting her shoulders rest against the wall of the house she felt the child moving about and rested her hand on her stomach trying to comfort the babe within still it will give the younger sons of the prosperous merchants and craftsmen something to do a respected calling for those who cannot inherit perhaps parents could list their inheritors in advance and so avoid all those family disputes the eldest son generally but not always inherited the family business a practice that often led to quarrels among brothers when death took the head of the household brother often fought against brother with the loser driven out of the family you will change everything trella the nobles will complain about you again perhaps but the people i think would approve as would most of the smaller shopkeepers and craftsmen theyll see the advantage of laws that not only protect them but provide for stable prices in the future its only those grown powerful enough to take advantage of others that will object the people rely on you trella they know you and eskkar dispense justice not whim theyll trust you to keep track of their shops and farms even their contracts but not anyone else thats why we must show the people we can control people like asurak and rasui still youd better wait until eskkar returns do you think he will approve if it reduces the number of council meetings my husband has to attend hell approve we spoke about many of these issues right up to the day he left for bisitun he wanted new ways of dealing with the people there when will you tell the council im sure it will take several weeks to consider every aspect you and i will start tomorrow well go over everything we need and how we think the new houses will function we have to be ready to answer every objection from the likes of rasui even nicar and corio may not agree with all these ideas well have to find ways to show them the advantages nobles rebba decca and rasturin with their big farm holdings might be more amenable nevertheless well need to have every answer prepared in advance every problem considered and a solution a good solution ready to present trella finished with a smile for eskkar to present that is annoksur nodded agreement both women knew it would be easier for the men who made up the council to accept such sweeping new changes if eskkar proposed them the nobles might know that trella conceived of the ideas but it would still be more palatable coming from him and with the hawk clan and the rest of the soldiers still solidly supporting eskkar the nobles would need good grounds before they dared to object youll need more gold as well eskkar will find that in bisitun the upriver trade will make the gold flow in akkad again already goods are moving briskly between akkad and the south and the nobles and leading merchants will pay to secure their sons positions in the new houses lets hope eskkar returns soon annoksur said and laden with goods and gold well begin the planning after tomorrows council session trella said the sooner we start the better and we may need to include others to help us but im sure we can do this more changes for akkad annoksur said shaking her head when will it end i wonder twenty miles east of the euphrates and more than a hundred miles south of akkad ariamus cursed the hot sun that beat down on him and his men each day then he cursed the high desert where they camped the lack of water that plagued them the ignorant louts who whined incessantly and the clouds of sand fleas that tormented man and beast finally he swore at korthac though ariamus kept that oath under his breath lest one of the egyptians who always seemed to be shadowing his steps hear and inform the grim egyptian even though korthac had saved his life from the vengeful villagers on the edge of the desert ariamus found little pleasure in serving his new master at least so far ariamus would have liked to do more than curse at the two egyptian subcommanders in the camp but that too would have to wait takany korthacs second in command spoke little and his eyes expressed no emotion a brutish man he maintained tight control of the egyptians and they obeyed no order that came from ariamus without takanys approval nebibi the other egyptian commander proved more approachable he spent more time with ariamus talking about korthacs exploits in egypt both had sworn blood oaths to korthac nebibi explained one night after a little extra wine horrific oaths neither would ever dare to break nebibi at least understood the need for the new men ariamus recruited and did his best to keep the two camps working together hed even contributed some of his fighters to help with the training still ariamus blamed korthac for insisting they establish their camp so far away from akkad and other settlements ariamuss new master demanded a place so distant that no word could reach the city about the growing force hidden beyond the fringe of the desert each day the situation grew worse as the number of men and horses under ariamuss command increased demands for food and water also increased daily the moment he left this cursed encampment behind couldnt come too soon for ariamus even if it meant attacking akkads very walls with his bare hands the desolate place chosen for his camp lay well off the usual trails ariamus camped here twice before in his wanderings each time for but a single night the high desert might be a little cooler than the hell of sand and wind korthac had crossed but not by much containing only a few scrub plants and stunted trees growing among the rocks it had little to recommend it except for its desolation worst of all there was no water which probably explained why wanderers seldom bothered to come near the rocky hills that circled his growing force one of the first things ariamus did was establish a work party for a daily trek to the nearest river more than ten miles away and had the men haul back as many skins of water as their horses could carry in one respect he didnt mind assigning the backbreaking labor it gave the men something to do to take their minds off their training and the boredom of waiting for action each day half his troop rode off to gather another days supply of water for man and beast those not on the water detail practiced their riding improved their swordplay tended the horses and waited of course takanys egyptians didnt deign to do something so menial as carry water though they managed to drink more than their share of what arrived in camp ariamus spent most of his time on horseback with a handful of riders enough to provide protection without frightening the locals he rode across the land looking for recruits and horses to add to his band of fighters he stopped at every village and collection of mud huts too small even for that title he had gold to offer gold that first came down the river within a week of korthac reaching akkad more gold arrived each week payment for the restive force growing under ariamus as the egyptian exchanged ever larger quantities of his gemstones for gold and silver in akkad korthacs egyptians kept control of the gold making sure that ariamus used it only to buy men horses weapons or supplies not that they needed to watch him ariamus was too excited by the prospect of looting akkad nothing would please him more than returning there in power to take revenge on the shopkeepers and merchants who had ordered him about for so many years they would bow before their former captain of the guard soon enough in the initial planning with korthac ariamus had been more than a little skeptical that their forces could capture and hold the city but with the reports coming from akkad he soon began to change his mind eskkar the ignorant barbarian had split his forces and if he remained out of the city ariamus believed they would have a good chance to capture the akkad each week ariamuss force grew as he enticed more local bandits wanderers and even raw farm boys desperate for any means to escape the endless drudgery of a farmers existence a shortage of horses plagued ariamus but down here far south of akkad the passage of the alur meriki had caused little damage to the land and livestock in this part of the country marauders and other smaller clans of barbarians had taken their toll but most farms and villages had survived intact horses remained scarce but not impossible to get if you were willing to scour the countryside and pay more than their worth in gold or steal them twice hed ridden into small farm holdings at night killed the men and taken their horses he preferred not to do it as korthac didnt want to inflame the countryside against them lest word reach akkad nevertheless ariamus needed horses for his fighters korthacs plan demanded them so ariamus gathered every mount he could find at the same time as he trained his men to ride and to fight not that most of this rabble would ever become true fighters or horsemen not in these few weeks but if they could swing a sword and ride a horse ariamus asked little more the rest those who survived the coming battle would have plenty of time to improve their fighting skills in akkad he heard hoofbeats and looked up to see a rider coming toward him raising a cloud of dust and no doubt stirring up another wave of sand fleas ariamus stood outside his tent until the outrider galloped up ariamus four riders are coming in i think one of them is hathor the man shouted as excited as a boy taking his first woman get back to your post you useless piece of crap ariamus ordered of course hes coming weve been expecting him for two days by then the party appeared crossing the hilly skyline four men riding toward the camp ariamus didnt intend to stand there waiting in the sun so he went inside his tent the visitors would want water and care for their horses before they got down to business korthac had dispatched his third subcommander hathor the last two times as well upon arriving he might want to count all the men the horses and even the cursed weapons and of course count up all the gold expended ariamus had to admit that these egyptians were thorough korthac wanted every man well fed well armed and trained in how to use a sword and be able to use it from horseback korthac had stressed that point not many of his egyptians could fight from horseback they preferred to fight on foot what korthac demanded from ariamus was a troop of horsemen that could be used to sweep the countryside those same mounted fighters would prevent the citys inhabitants from fleeing their new master at the same time as they gathered up new recruits willing or unwilling two weeks ago when hathor came downriver the first time hed told ariamus how eskkar had split his soldiers and scattered them over the countryside that made the horsemen ariamus trained even more important as they might have to engage more than one enemy and one possibly spread out over the land on his last visit hathor had even dared in korthacs name to inspect the egyptians to see them practicing their swordsmanship and their physical readiness hathor asked takany to stage some mock fights with sword and knife hathor watched as both the egyptians and ariamuss men went through their drills or charged back and forth waving their swords and shouting their war cries takanys dour face had flushed a darker shade than normal at the insult but hed said nothing the more than fifty egyptians in the camp trained nearly every day practicing with sword axe and knife and they impressed ariamus with their skill hed never seen better fighters certainly not in that number of men he had no doubt that in a pitched battle they would defeat an enemy two or three times their number but korthac also knew he couldnt hold akkad without horsemen and thats where ariamus intended to impress his new master with a little luck ariamus would soon be second in command already he had the larger number of fighters reporting to him that would naturally elevate him above the egyptian subcommanders even takany because korthac once akkad was taken would need ariamus more than he needed his own forces besides plenty of egyptians were going to die taking the city which would strengthen ariamuss position with a little more luck korthac might get killed himself that would put ariamus in command since without korthac even hardheaded foreigners like takany and nebibi would realize they needed someone from this land if they intended to rule here if all went as korthac planned then ariamus would have plenty of time to think about getting rid of korthac the egyptian had taught ariamus how to play the game but the pupil intended to rise above the master even if it took a year or two the first step was to court the egyptian subcommanders takany was hopeless but hathor and nebibi would see reason soon enough hathor was the lowliest of the three who served korthac as subcommanders but the one chosen for all the more difficult tasks or whenever korthac needed someone with more wits than brawn the egyptian obviously wanted men about him that he could trust but none too sharp in the head lest they get ideas of their own as captain of the guard in akkad ariamus had done the same himself making sure his subcommanders followed orders without asking too many questions let alone doing any thinking in some ways eskkar had been the perfect subcommander a friendless loner he kept his mouth shut and obeyed orders spending as much time as he could away from the village caring for the horses and chasing after runaway slaves and petty thieves once again ariamus wondered how such an insignificant barbarian outcast had ever managed to seize control of akkad nevertheless ariamus didnt have time to daydream about such things now he needed to hear the latest news from hathor and by now takany would be waiting for him to come to his tent ariamus would have to swallow his pride once again and defer to these cursed foreigners but not for long he vowed not for long hathor had just finished washing the dust from his body when ariamus strode into takanys tent hathor took another drink of water though the warm liquid tasted more like moldy leather and horse sweat after its journey under the hot sun to this place out of the corner of his eye he noted takany looked even grimmer than usual the man didnt like it when hathor spoke in korthacs name ignoring takanys frown hathor joined the two egyptians already sitting crosslegged on the sand and waved his hand for ariamus to join them greetings hathor ariamus said his voice filling the tent hows the soft life in akkad did you bring more gold are you weve been waiting for you takany said do not keep me waiting again last time i came here you kept me standing outside ariamus countered as he sat i didnt feel like cooking in the sun while you three whispered secrets to each other you presume much ariamus youd better learn to watch your tongue please lets not argue amongst ourselves hathor interrupted though he extended a small bow to takany as he did so hathor did remember that last meeting takany had insisted on hearing everything first and then hathor had to repeat the same message a second time for ariamuss edification hathor got right to his masters business korthac wishes to know how ready you are ariamus and how many men and horses you have the situation in akkad grows even more favorable eskkar remains in the north and the city is at ease there are barely enough men in akkad to maintain order they all smiled at his news hathor noted now ariamus how many men will you have ready to fight in two weeks two weeks ariamus sounded dismayed at the early date why so soon ariamus has almost ninety men takany said speaking as if the man didnt exist though most of them fight like old women korthac in his wisdom had warned hathor about the growing conflict between ariamus and takany the sooner they attacked akkad hathor realized the better these two would be at each others throats soon enough either that or ariamus just might take it into his head to collect his men and ride off leaving takany to his own devices and to korthacs wrath we must all work together hathor said soothingly trying to keep the peace a great prize awaits us akkad will provide wealth and a life of ease for all of us and the sooner we take it the better but time grows short and korthac says we need to move quickly he turned to ariamus how many men in three or four more weeks i can get another thirty or forty men were still a little short of horses you only have two weeks ariamus hathor countered shaking his head firmly then we need to start moving toward akkad well have to travel by night avoiding the roads korthac has picked a place to ford the river and arranged for boats to be waiting for us all eyes turned to ariamus in two weeks probably another twenty twentyfi ve men i think i can get mounts for that many or at least most of them youll need food as well hathor said there wont be any time to scour the land for something to eat and you must travel in secrecy if the city gets word that a large band of men is raiding nearby or approaching the guards will be doubled and the defenders alerted but if we move quickly and outrun word of our approach the mood in the tent improved considerably at the thought of action hathor knew the prospect of a good fight would take everyones mind off their squabbles he turned to takany with our egyptians and that number of ariamuss men korthac says we will have enough hathor said using his masters name whenever possible he knew takany feared nothing on the earth except their leader and weapons you have arms for every man yes every man has at least a sword ariamus said weve only a few bows though they wont be needed and there will be plenty of bows once were inside akkad hathor didnt mention that if their men needed bows then they were finished hed seen the akkadians taking their archery training and korthac thinks we can win ariamus asked the question the only one there who would even dare cast doubt upon their master oh yes ariamus hathor said confidently i know we can win we only need to get inside he looked around the circle even takany had stopped frowning no doubt willing to do anything to get out of this miserable camp then everything is settled tomorrow ill return to akkad hathor said smoothly korthac will be pleased to learn that ariamus has everything he needs and that all of you will be ready to move in two weeks two weeks he repeated not one day longer korthac said there must be no delays no excuses no failures or he will hold all of you accountable the minute he sends word you must be ready to move no one said anything whatever korthac wished would be done nebibi you are to come back to akkad with me then you will return to help guide the men on the final leg of the march ill give thanks to isis and osiris nebibi said for getting me out of this place hathor turned back to ariamus ill need four of your best men to return with me to akkad men who wont attract attention and who can follow orders perfectly and keep their mouths shut men who know how to kill and are good at it do you have any like that ariamus lifted his brow yes but i need all my subcommanders to help if you need help with the training takany can provide it hathor caught the momentary frown on ariamuss face ill meet with those you select now to see if theyre capable your best men ariamus nothing less will do if theyre good enough theyll need good strong horses have them ready to ride with me at dawn for once ariamus stood speechless his open mouth showing his dismay at losing four good men hathor leaned back and smiled at everyone his mission had gone remarkably well and for the next few weeks the two forces would be too busy training to cause each other trouble korthac had shown his wisdom once again by pushing up the date for the attack best of all hathor would be out of this unhappy place in the morning and he wouldnt be coming back he let himself relax now that korthacs business is settled what can i tell you of akkad trella greeted nicar and corio when the two nobles entered the upper room seating nicar in the place of honor at the head of the table she took the chair across from corio in the days before the alur meriki invasion nicar had led the five noble families that ruled orak faced with the citys destruction and fi nding no one else willing to risk his neck nicar selected eskkar as the new captain of the guard in addition hed given eskkar a recently acquired slave girl named trella to be his helpmate and keep him out of the alehouse at night those two decisions made less than a year ago created a future none of them could have foreseen a future brought about by the common people long without a voice in their daily affairs now they acclaimed eskkar as their leader and expected him to protect them not only from barbarian invasions but also from the power and whims of the noble families today nicar remained the foremost of the noble families but everyone understood who had the real power in akkad while nicar might regret the loss of his authority eskkar and trella had saved not only his city but his life and that of his family when the mob had shouted for their death though their roles had reversed trella still felt beholden to him a good man she grieved that nicar had aged much in the last six months nearing his sixtieth season his only remaining son had taken charge of the familys trading ventures in the last few weeks lifting that burden from his father trella planned to use that situation to her advantage i hope todays meeting will be brief lady trella corio said ever in a hurry to be about his business its already past noon and the feast of ishtar has begun he waved his hand toward the window where the sounds of celebration already echoed throughout the courtyard so ishtars priest has reminded me every day for the last few weeks corio trella answered you and your family are attending the feast tonight shed arranged a major banquet the first shed ever given to honor the goddess and reward those friends who had stood at eskkars side during the siege there will be an abundance of food and wine annoksur has hired the finest cooks and entertainers in the city corios family accompanied us here trella nicar said now can you tell us why you asked us here early i assume you have something special to discuss with us yes trella said pushing her hair back from her eyes before eskkar left he spoke about proposing a change to our customs and i wanted to ask your advice before bringing it up at the next council meeting trella preferred to speak the truth whenever possible though shed been the one who broached the subject of how to rule akkad with her husband shed started by asking eskkar about the customs that governed his former clan he told her how each clans leader settled disputes as he chose with no recourse confl icts between clan leaders if not settled by blood were resolved by the alur meriki ruler often with the help of the full council eskkar compared the customs of his barbarian clan with those of the nobles of akkad hed seen enough of the local customs enforcing them for the nobles before the invasion and knew how unjustly they could be administered to her surprise eskkar had several suggestions for changing akkads customs and enforcing them less capriciously when trella mentioned changing them into something more permanent he not only agreed but suggested they establish similar customs in the north they spent several hours talking about the way akkad bisitun and the other northern villages should be ruled eskkar had learned the mysteries of the farm as well as those of gold and bronze from trella nicar and the other nobles and understood that the more lightly they administered those under their rule the more wealth would flow to akkad when shed told eskkar what she wanted to do he smiled and wished her luck she spent the next few weeks preparing for this moment waiting for exactly the right time to bring the subject before nicar and corio the most influential members of the council of nobles that time had now arrived todays celebration would provide the most opportune moment to launch such a new concept well what changes to our sacred customs are you proposing trella corios voice held a hint of humor something new and exciting i hope i want to alter the way all of our customs are administered she saw corio glance at nicar in surprise not so much change them but establish them as a code of conduct laws for all the people of akkad i want to set them down in writing so that everyone can know them and follow them without fear or worry customs set penalties for crimes determined the prices paid to the farmers for their produce and even set the dates for feasts and celebrations as akkad had grown more prosperous customs often changed and not always for the better but the nobles had always reserved final say to themselves and often exempted their own families from the justice they imposed on others some of the council will object to that nicar commented straightening in his chair his voice reflecting the seriousness of her suggestion theyve followed their ways for years and dont see any reason to change yes they follow custom when it suits them corio said i remember how it was a price might be agreed upon the work completed then the payment reduced or even withheld and no one to appeal to either an artisan by trade corio had joined the ranks of the nobles when he agreed to build the wall that now surrounded akkad for him the customs had not always operated fairly something trella had counted upon it seems to me that prices vary as well trella said changing the subject before the two men began arguing about the past a bushel of grain set at one price when the nobles deal with each other and a different price for everyone else she had worked with nicars finances and learned the details of his commerce that has led to discontent among the people as well as disputes in the marketplace the child within her stirred about and trella shifted in her chair she watched nicars eyes for any clues as to his thoughts this would seem to him like one more way to lessen the authority of the nobles nobles she said since eskkar drove off the alur meriki nearly all of his time has been spent settling disputes over prices petty crimes even ownership of homes you both know him you know he should be thinking about akkads defense about building the new wall not such petty squabbles neither man said anything they knew eskkar had no patience for such matters by making eskkar the final arbiter in such affairs we waste everyones time if all the customs were written down turned into laws that applied to all who live within akkads control think how many hours laboring over such matters could be saved and if these new laws were administered fairly i believe trade and farming would increase with still more benefits to the citys merchants and traders and leave eskkar in a better mood corio laughed even nicar found a smile at that certainly that would be something to be desired what exactly are you proposing trella first i want to set the prices for all the common items that are bought sold or traded in the marketplace if farmers know in advance what price they will receive for their produce theyll be easier to deal with and can concentrate on growing their crops and not worry about what theyll be paid for them including the nobles nicar asked what merchants sell their goods for on the river or in the countryside is their business but in akkad theyll pay one price a fair price with no cheating or sharp dealing and if there is cheating then nicar the nobles will face the same penalties as anyone else as the customs say if a man tries to cheat on an exchange hes to pay double that would be the law of akkad and apply even to the nobles and all this would be written down with everyone agreeing to it corio looked dubious as he leaned on the table youll need a halfdozen clerks just to keep track of everything trella shook her head i think well probably need about twenty to keep records of the laws the penalties the prices contracts the ownership of the land and houses theyll have to invent new symbols to record events and probably new ways of calculating sums youre creating a whole new category of apprenticeship nicar said trying to judge the extent of what trella had proposed this will change everything so it would trella knew and probably to a greater extent than nicar realized it will change our future for the better akkad will be a better place to live and work to train so many clerks store so many records youll need a new building to house them their teachers servants and families corio mused clay records require large rooms with many shelves to store them he fell silent no doubt already thinking about how he would design and build such a structure yes i imagine there is much more about this than ive considered as ever she preferred to let others figure out what might be needed though she and annoksur had spent the last few weeks going over the likely impacts on their society between them theyd considered all the ramifications at least she hoped theyd thought of everything how would you pay for such an undertaking nicar said it will be many months before akkad returns to full prosperity and even then this will require much gold well eskkar will bring in additional taxes from the countryside trella said and those wishing to become clerks will pay for their apprenticeships in advance that should bring enough to feed and house them she turned to corio we would need a place for them to live and work i was hoping you would build one for us corio and perhaps charge us less than your usual price it took corio only a moment to understand her meaning if he didnt discount the price she would fi nd another architect not that it mattered hed still make a good profit only a bit less than usual of course lady trella i would be honored to construct a building for you say at a discount of onetenth that is more than generous master builder and perhaps you can help determine the prices and penalties for akkads other builders along with of course the other nobles trella accepted that he would make sure the law favored the artisans but that would be a small price to pay besides the poor didnt pay others to build for them they built their own huts out of mud the wealthy had more and so they would pay more she turned to nicar i hope you will help me draft the laws a common set of laws that will apply to all how will these laws be administered nicar stroked his beard a dubious frown on his face i hoped you would tell me nicar i would like the council to appoint someone to oversee the drafting of these new rules and then preside over their administration that someone would be responsible only to eskkar and would make sure the laws were applied fairly to everyonenoble merchant shopkeeper and farmer alike corio laughed in understanding youve been chosen nicar youll have to deal with it nicar clearly hadnt expected this what you ask why it will take months even years and my business what would i do you said yourself that your son is prepared to take over your familys business trella said noting the nobles discomfort perhaps he is readier than you know besides who else in akkad do the people respect as much as you nicar and youll have help the council will provide whatever you need im sure there are plenty of younger sons men with their wits about them who would appreciate the opportunity to serve as corio says this would be a whole new house a house of laws with a staff of clerks and administrators needed to ensure its honest application youd be deciding disputes between all of akkads inhabitants one of my sons is more clerk than artisan corio offered he cant plumb a line to save his life any house he builds is certain to fall down sooner or later but he knows the symbols and might prefer such an apprenticeship it would be far better for the boy to be a scribe than a builder the people trust you nicar trella went on and the chance to establish a new house one of your own choosing accepting only the best and most honest of our people you would be honored by all accept the honor nicar corio added the other nobles will rely on you to treat them fairly what would this new position be called nicar asked with a sigh looking as if he might be tempted in spite of his usual caution im not sure trella answered since youd have to determine the truthfulness of what men say and do it seemed to me that the title of judge would be appropriate akkads chief judge would be accountable only to eskkar he and i believe it is one of the most important duties of a ruler to give just decisions in resolving disputes you know how much akkad needs such an office and who better to fill it chief judge of the city of akkad corio said sounds impressive doesnt it it did indeed trella agreed in a few months certainly less than a year the title would change to the lords judge or even the kings judge the title of king meant ruler of all the land one blessed by the gods and dispensing their favor it had never been used in these lands but the word king could wait a little longer until the people grew ready to accept it say yes nicar she pleaded touching his hand with her own your name will be remembered forever in akkad and think of all the good you can do he looked from one to the other and lifted his hands in surrender when do you wish me to begin put your affairs in order in a week or so we can begin figuring out what will be needed i thought i would be getting some rest in my old age trella now youll have me working from dawn to dusk longer than that trella thought noble nicar i believe this will be as good for you as for the city well have much to discuss but we can start whenever youre ready since thats settled can we get on with the feast corios tone made nicar and trella laugh i can hear my granddaughter squealing with delight even from here yes i want to greet your wife and children trella said perhaps i can find some extra treats for them my thanks to you both when the two men left trella felt pleased that one of the days more important items had been concluded nicars honesty would reflect favorably on eskkars personal code of justice the nobles would grumble and complain about losing more of their privileges but they would see the benefits to themselves soon enough and they might even believe they could influence nicars judgments but she knew her former owner better than that no shed moved akkad another step forward this time using the nobles selfinterest to solidify and strengthen eskkars rule eventually the people would come to trust lord eskkars arbiter of the laws and until then they could appeal to eskkar if they believed themselves treated unjustly the more they trusted eskkar and herself the more they relied on their leaders the safer her unborn child would be in time the people would accept her son as their ruler without hesitation assuming of course that she carried a male child if she delivered a baby girl then she would have to get pregnant again as soon as possible eskkar needed an heir to carry on his line just as akkad needed that same heir for stability to know that in the coming years eskkars son his inheritor would be there to protect and defend them and their families the childs safety had become even more important than her own trella remembered all too well how she had changed from a nobles daughter to a slavetraders property in a single night such a fate must never happen to eskkars sons and daughters to protect her firstborn she would change the customs of akkad to ensure the people felt safe and secure under eskkars rule nothing would stand in her way not the nobles not the wealthy merchants not even the soldiers all of them must bow to eskkars rule and to her design for building a mighty city patting her stomach to soothe the babe she followed nicar and corio to the door at the landing she caught annoksurs eye and nodded with the issue of drafting new laws resolved only two more items remained before she could enjoy the feast her separate meetings with gatus and then korthac a few moments later gatus entered the workroom closing the door behind him what is it trella he asked is anything wrong im sure its nothing gatus she said but her face remained serious as she took her seat across from the soldier i know your messengers returned this morning and i wanted a word with you before the feast gets under way at her urging gatus had sent a few riders out to check on the two regular patrols guarding akkad the patrols rode a gradual circle around the city returning every five or six days hed instructed the messengers to make contact with each patrol afterward the messengers would then ride a great arc to the east and south looking for any unrest so is everything in the countryside as it should be how far did your riders go the patrols are about forty miles from here one to the east and the other to the south they say theres little trouble anywhere especially since eskkar went north even the bandits in the west and south seem to have drifted away perhaps they heard what happened at bisitun and took the lesson to heart perhaps but im still troubled by korthac weve learned little more than what he told us himself that first day we met the women have failed to learn anything and even tammuz and his customers havent found a way to get inside his rooms maybe theres nothing to learn gatus said just because he keeps control of his men doesnt make him dangerous his treatment of his men is what concerns me they stay inside away from women they dont gamble in the marketplace drink in the alehouses or visit the prostitutes on the river so hes a hard taskmaster but there have been no fights no thefts he said he didnt want them running about until theyd learned the language and customs theyve only been here a month or so actually its been nearly two months but i suppose youre right trella wasnt convinced but she had no facts to argue with gatus still i want to be sure the countryside is secure its quieter than its ever been with eskkar up north and bantor following the alur meriki to the southeast the countryside has been swept clean of bandits even the lands west of the river are peaceful and they were mostly untouched by the barbarians theres never been much there except isolated farms have you heard anything different along the river each day boats arrived and departed akkad heading for the villages downriver some going as far as sumeria and the great ocean no the villages on the tigris seem peaceful enough the boat captains report no unrest and fewer bandits and pirates than theyre used to seeing gatus shrugged well what does it matter when eskkar returns in a few weeks hell bring back at least another thirty soldiers as well as new recruits eager to join akkads soldiers trella and gatus had both spoken to eskkars messenger hed arrived from bisitun this morning bringing news that eskkar intended to remain up north at least another two or three weeks he seems pleased with his new woman trella said gatus looked down at the floor and shrugged nothing for you to concern yourself about trella and its important that bisitun be well secured im sure hell be back soon enough trella had learned of lanis activities even before gatus one of the first messengers from bisitun had mentioned lani to his woman who immediately relayed the information to trella at first she hadnt been concerned but as the weeks passed she felt her concern growing still she gave no indication to anyone that she worried about eskkars dalliance im sure youre right gatus but since he remains away im uneasy about the countryside could you move the patrols out farther from the city say another twenty or thirty miles in every direction well it would take more men and horses and id need more messengers riding back and forth do you really think its necessary humor me then she said leaning toward him and touching his arm and you can tell your riders there will be extra silver for their labors a few more sweeps before eskkar returns have them increase their distance at least thirty miles for extra silver theyll ride an even larger circle he laughed ill send them out in a day or so she touched his arm again send them tomorrow gatus as soon as they recover from the feast youre that concerned about this korthac its not just him besides you must bear with a pregnant woman as you say eskkar will be back soon but until then i find myself often worrying she laughed at her own weakness oh and theres one more request i want a rider for a special assignment to journey to the far northwest do you have anyone you can trust hell need to be a strong horseman and have his wits about him will he have to do any fighting no merely gather some information you can offer a gold coin in addition to his regular pay for that id almost go myself ill talk to some of the men tomorrow and find one to your liking then once again you have my thanks old friend she stood and now its time to begin the feast ive kept you away from the food and wine long enough she escorted him to the door and they descended the stairs together annoksur waited there along with the servants the workroom would also be used to entertain guests and they needed time to prepare it trella planned to meet with korthac there as hed already become one of the citys more important traders korthac had received and accepted her invitation the egyptian remained a mystery keeping to himself and staying aloof from the usual akkadian ways her informers had learned nothing useful she wanted to understand korthac better to learn firsthand what drove the man only then would her curiosity be satisfied trella hoped to draw him out during todays festival perhaps wine and exotic foods would help loosen his tongue korthac didnt bring any of his usual bodyguards to the feast instead he brought hathor the only one of his three subcommanders whod accompanied him into akkad and the only one with the wits and selfcontrol to act the part aside from hathors trips downriver his primary responsibility entailed keeping the men under control away from wine and apart from the locals every day that task grew harder and the men more difficult to keep under discipline theyd earned their silver survived the desert and now wanted to take some leisure in this strange new city whose pleasures beckoned them fortunately the men respected hathor who urged them to control themselves a little longer korthac knew he needed to keep the men restrained with only a handful of men in akkad korthac had too much to lose to take any chances with a drunken soldier getting into trouble hed ordered one whipped last week only yesterday hathor had knocked another to the ground both korthac and hathor reminded their men again and again that in a few weeks theyd have plenty of gold and unlimited opportunities to enjoy the women of akkad korthacs other two subcommanders takany and nebibi remained across the river with ariamus keeping a watchful eye on the man and helping raise and train the desperate men they recruited korthac felt certain he could rely on ariamus at least as long as the gold kept flowing more than six weeks had passed since korthac arrived in akkad and hed received a report each week about ariamuss progress korthacs business as a trader provided a legitimate reason to spend hours at the docks with a few of his men meeting ships as they arrived doing a little trading here and there occasionally a boat carried one of ariamuss men who would sit with the egyptian and report korthac made sure the messenger got right back aboard a ship heading south with trellas spies everywhere there must be no boasting words or smug looks to give away his plan according to hathors latest report the former captain of the guard had already mustered over ninety men almost all of them mounted and most of them claiming to have fighting experience ariamus had dispensed plenty of korthacs gold and silver along with promises of future loot to recruit these men korthac doubted they would come close to the quality of his egyptians but right now he needed bodies with enough men who could at least swing a sword korthac would seize power in akkad more than half the citys soldiers were away either with eskkar or bantor that meant on any given day less than a hundred men maintained order watched the walls and manned the gates korthac had no doubt his seventy egyptians could take the city from within as long as they didnt get involved in an archery battle hed watched the akkadian soldiers practice and seen what they could do with the bow but in closeup fighting his men would prevail holding akkad would be another matter and for that he needed ariamus and his men and equally as important their horses in a few more weeks as the entire city knew bantor and his men would return from the south korthac wanted to act before their arrival eskkar proving as unpredictable as everyone said lingered in bisitun nevertheless the barbarian might return to akkad at any time probably bringing with him at least half his forces if he stayed away a few more weeks korthacs work would be much simpler hed been in akkad long enough to understand local politics the nobles who formed the ruling council were merely traders men who dealt with buying and selling not fighting and all of them intimidated by eskkars soldiers several chafed at eskkar and trellas new restrictions on their authority the people wouldnt rally around any of them a few public executions followed by distribution of a few gold coins would silence both traders and nobles and bend them to his rule trella might provide such a rallying point but he intended to take care of her when the time came and without eskkar here to rouse the inhabitants and give them the will to resist the city would fall like an overripe apple from a tree into korthacs waiting hands eskkar would have to die of course but that could happen just as easily in the north as here in akkad as soon as ariamus raised another twenty or thirty men korthac would strike hed take the city then destroy the rest of eskkars forces piecemeal only a fool divided his forces in his many battles korthac had learned one thingconcentrate his fighters and overwhelm his enemy it had worked in egypt and it would work here he looked forward to teaching this eskkar the same lesson putting such ideas out of his mind he thought about todays celebratory feast korthac could smile at that the futility of the men of this land relying on ishtar a female deity for protection as foolish as the men of akkad relying on trella eskkars wife had planned a special repast at her home to celebrate some incomprehensible aspect of ishtars power though the occasion also gave thanks for the deliverance of the city from the barbarian invasion and for eskkars recent success in bisitun whatever the reasons korthac recognized it for what it was a chance for trella to entertain and impress her followers with her authority all the powerful and influential people in the city had received their invitations a blackpainted piece of pottery bearing eskkars mark on one side and an image of the goddess on the other only the lucky few bearing the invitation and their retainers would be admitted to eskkars house the rest of akkad would celebrate in the streets probably long into the night korthac had already resigned himself to a night without sleep with the city full of noise and revelry hed received the invitation three days ago and befitting his new status in akkad no doubt one of the first to be delivered this morning hed coached hathor in his role making sure the dour soldier knew how to behave and reminding him once again to make sure he gave no offense korthac had even bought a new tunic for his subcommander something that would reflect favorably on his employers status the late afternoon sun drifted toward the horizon when wearing his finest garment and new leather sandals korthac strode through the streets to eskkars gate hathor at his side naturally his subcommander carried a sword but korthac went unarmed weapons would not be permitted inside the courtyard the usual policy to ensure guests who drank too much didnt wind up killing each other over some perceived slight of course the weapons ban also protected trella and korthac had to admit that her guards knew their business staying alert and watching the crowds wherever she walked about the city reaching eskkars gate korthac and hathor had to wait in line as the guards checked invitations and made sure none of the guests were armed greetings honorable korthac the guard bowed slightly as he took the clay shard from korthacs hand are there more in your party no just the two of us korthac gave the soldier a friendly smile hathor had already removed his sword belt and handed it to another of trellas guards hathor even managed a tight smile as he did so please enter lord eskkars house honored guests the guard bowed again already turning to greet the next in line inside the courtyard a halfdozen tables held pitchers of wine bread covered with honey platters of fruit and sweets a clay bowl in the center of each table held a large spray of flowers each table offering a different blossom smoke rose from the rear of the courtyard as well as from the kitchens and the scent of crisping meat hung in the air on the roof opposite eskkars quarters musicians played their flutes and a juggler tossed his brightly painted wooden balls high in the air the courtyard big as it was couldnt hold everyone and the guests mingled inside the main house as well talking and gesturing servants poured the wine mixed equally with water and several guests appeared to be under the winegods spell already korthac spotted several nobles from the ruling council all of them distinguished by the dark blue trim on their tunics a color reserved for the ruling families he accepted a brimming cup from one of the table attendants then moved as close to the rear wall as he could get without moving into the cooking area some of the guests appeared to be nothing more than common tradesmen still wearing their ragged and dirtstained tunics at least a dozen soldiers were scattered about the hawk clan emblem on their shoulders mingling with the guests as if they were equals unlike the rest of those invited the hawk clan alone carried weapons either short swords or knives they korthac noted did not have wine cups in their hands women made up almost half the crowd wearing their finest garments standing beside their men or gossiping together most did not even cover their heads with scarves a custom korthac still hadnt gotten used to honorable korthac may i offer you some of lady trellas best wine he turned to find annoksur standing at his side a small pitcher in one hand a wine cup in the other korthac smiled at her as he exchanged his halfempty cup for the new one i thank you for your gift annoksur he took a sip the sweet wine had a pleasing odor a far better blend than what he had picked up at the table this is very good my thanks to lady trella he looked about but didnt see his hostess is lady trella unwell no shes resting upstairs annoksur said with a smile of her own shed be pleased if you wish to visit her she enjoys your stories about the land of egypt and always interrupted each story with a dozen questions that probed for any detail of his past life korthac recalled of course who would resist such a generous hostess he turned to hathor wait here he didnt like leaving the man alone but it would look odd to bring him into the house annoksur weaved her way through the crowd and korthac trailed in her wake annoyed that he had to follow in any womans footsteps hed never been inside eskkars house before looking about he saw the great room as crowded as the courtyard most of the guests stayed close to a long table loaded with wine and food trying to get as much of the free fare as they could a guard kept the stairs to the upper rooms clear but he stepped aside and nodded at annoksur as they passed another guard stood at the top of the landing looking about korthac studied trellas private quarters as he entered quarters that would soon be his benches and stools lined the walls and a small table held pitchers of wine and water but no food korthac recognized the captain of the guard gatus sitting next to trella near to the window corio stood nearby with his wife and two sons talking to one of the nobles who operated several boats that plied the river trade nicar his wife their son and daughterinlaw stood together talking excitedly among themselves trella rose from her seat as korthac crossed the room surprised by her size he realized her pregnancy had progressed since hed last seen her even the loosefitting dress she wore couldnt conceal her condition hed always found pregnant women distasteful unclean somehow their bloated bodies should be hidden away out of sight until they produced their offspring preferably without annoying their betters korthac had fathered more children than he could remember but had never cared for any of them or their mothers either a womans children made her weak and easy to manage and he looked forward to trellas delivery greetings lady trella he bowed low to show his respect welcome to our home honorable korthac she bowed politely to him like any respectable wife greeting her husbands guests a blessing to the goddess ishtar for your future family and for your invitation to share in her blessings he intoned fulfilling the courtesy the celebration required you learn our customs well honorable korthac she turned to gatus can our guest take your seat for a moment gatus yes he can have it gatus replied getting up and stretching i need something solid to eat anyway ill take your leave trella he bowed to her then to korthac sit beside me trella said resuming her seat again i find i tire easily and preparing for the feast has kept me busy since early this morning the city is praising your name lady trella and thanking you for the gifts of food and wine for a city reputed to be pressed for gold trella had managed to buy enough food to give nearly everyone in akkad a good meal and enough ale to wash it down and you korthac have you decided to remain in our city hed spread the word that he considered living in the countryside or perhaps even downriver the news had sent a dozen traders to his door entreating him to stay and trade his gemstones in akkad the simple rumor had helped him make a dozen new friends i think ill stay in akkad lady trella he might as well tell her the truth she knew no merchant would willingly leave the city and all its advantages im still looking for a new house perhaps something like this one i heard this once belonged to a merchant yes but nicar loaned it to eskkar for the siege afterward my husband paid nicar for it when does your husband return lady trella im looking forward to meeting him if even half the stories ive heard are true she laughed thats what they are honorable korthac halftrue but he is a strong leader who cares for his people i think you will like him im sure i will lady trella ill like him better when hes dead which will be soon enough korthac thought and then hed wipe that smile off her face he hated having to restrain himself around anyone let alone an upstart young girl now tell me honorable korthac when are you going to let your men move about the city i hear they spend all their time cooped up inside that dreadful inn my servants are uncouth men many are not even used to living in a village let alone a city like akkad but they were all i could find to accompany me on my journey korthac kept his tone soothing his time would come soon enough i would prefer to keep them out of trouble at least until theyve learned to speak your language and understand akkads customs a week or two after im established in my new home theyll be ready to go about on their own the merchants will be glad to see them as glad as my men will be i can promise you that he saw a hint of disbelief in her eyes and wondered if his words sounded too condescending have you been able to sell your gemstones for a fair price thats hard to say lady trella some of my pieces have moved quickly enough but othershe shruggedim not so sure until one has lived in a place for some time it is hard to know what makes for a good trade its difficult enough for me to know an honest price thats why im keeping a close watch on my men to make sure they arent cheated and meanwhile giving away most of my jewels for far less than what theyre worth youve picked up our language well honorable korthac you speak with only the slightest accent its hard to believe youve learned it so quickly a trader must master many tongues as im sure you know and aside from trading im spending most of my days learning your language and customs he reached inside his tunic but ive nearly forgotten he brought out a small cotton pouch laced shut with a thin strand of dark leather this is for you lady trella a gift from the land of egypt he handed her the pouch watching her deft hands as she untied the knot and upended the contents into her palm an emerald the size of a mans thumb cut into a square shape and banded with a strip of gold attached to a thick golden chain glistened in the light honorable korthac this is ive never seen such a stone korthac relaxed as his hostess stared at the jewel fascinated by its deep green color as well she should he thought these lands produced very few of them and those were mostly small and of poor quality he remembered lifting the jewel from the neck of a rich merchants wife in egypt on her knees she pleaded with him not to take her favorite possession so he handed it back to her watching her eyes fill with gratitude he let her hold it for a moment until he plunged his sword into her belly then he took it from her and dangled it in front of her face while she watched her blood stain the ground until she died it is a beautiful gem lady trella but who else in akkad should have it if not you im honored but i cannot accept this its much too valuable lady trella i insist i have others just as fine by wearing this one youll encourage all the other women in akkad to buy my stones and perhaps if i need help in some matter or another i can turn to you he watched her eyes linger on the stone no woman could refuse such a gift he knew hed always found it so easy to manipulate women trella stared at the stone for a moment then returned it to the pouch it is too much but i thank you for this gift its the most beautiful necklace ive ever seen she turned to him and smiled a smile full of warmth that he hadnt seen before but honorable korthac i will not wear the necklace until after the child has been born otherwise the gods might be jealous korthac concealed his disappointment he would have preferred to have her flaunt the jewel at todays feast making everyone aware of his gift and his special place in her favor but it didnt really matter hed take the stone back from her soon enough and when he did his pleasure would not be so easily satisfied may your child bring you great happiness lady trella for as long as it lives he thought on the other side of akkad no lamps or fires burned in tammuzs alehouse the sun had gone down moments ago but for once the alehouse stood empty the usual customers had departed to partake of the food and ale that fl owed freely today in ishtars honor thanks to lady trella a few would undertake to help themselves to goods left unattended especially when their owners grew lax from too much wine enhedu heard laughter and the sound of loud voices coming from the lane rising and falling as people passed to and fro since there were no customers enhedu asked tammuz if he would close the alehouse for a few hours he suggested they walk the lanes and enjoy the crowds but enhedu asked him to wait she left their chamber and went into the common room closed the door to the lane and set the bar in its groove when she returned to the bedroom tammuz started to rise from the table no dont get up there is something i wish you to do for me she began rushing the words a little more than shed wanted there was just enough light for her to see the puzzled look on her masters face why what do you need she stood directly in front of him i want you to take me to bed enhedu had forced the words out and now they couldnt be called back she pulled her dress up over her head and stood there not even a step away hed seen her without her clothes many times but shed never displayed herself like this never simply stood there for him to see and enjoy she took a deep breath and moved her legs a little apart his eyes caressed her body lingering on her breasts and the jutting mound of hair beneath her belly enhedu he began are you sure yes im sure i need to be your woman to bring you the pleasure of the gods and to give you children more than that i want to please you you are a good man and i want to stay with you forever he stood and took her in his good arm you will never leave me enhedu i want you with me always and you do not have to she leaned closer and kissed him a long kiss that silenced him when the kiss ended he had her breast in his hand causing her to gasp with pleasure your clothes master she said huskily feeling a wave of pleasure run through her body her head felt light and she wondered if she would fall when he released her she led him to the bed then helped him with his tunic for once her fingers moving clumsily instead of with their usual efficiency then they tumbled onto the bed her head swimming with new sensations this time he kissed her and something shot through her like a tongue of fire she felt herself grow moist between her legs accompanied by an unfamiliar flash of warmth that excited her even more now his hands roamed her body exploring squeezing touching he moved along her body and she felt the heat of his skin against her she moaned when he stroked her mound and he stopped dont stop she gasped as surprised at her words as the speed at which she uttered them dont stop she pressed his hand against her holding him there until his fingers slipped inside her never had she felt this way there was no pain no roughness to make her wince or cry out instead a wonderful feeling of warmth passed over her in waves enhedu heard herself laugh a tiny sound that startled her as much as it did tammuz shed never laughed in bed before before he could speak she grasped his shoulders and pulled him on top of her spreading her legs wide using her hand to guide him inside her this time she heard herself moan with pleasure and he whispered something enhedu didnt hear the words but they didnt matter she wrapped her legs around his body and clutched him to her she felt him hesitate but then he began moving against her thrusting himself and twisting his hips faster and faster she moaned in pleasure arching her back while he pushed himself deeper inside her then he cried out her name again and again his body moving uncontrollably as he drove himself into her she heard herself cry out as much at the pleasure she was giving as her own though her own secret place trembled uncontrollably as it grew even more moist at last he slumped against her breathing hard still murmuring her name over and over telling her he loved her and that she must never leave him never master she promised him i will never leave you when he began to move off of her she giggled and held him tight no stay where you are i want to feel your body against mine oh yes he said whispering the words in her ear hold me tight that was so good so good she held him in her strong arms feeling proud that she could please him so easily caressing his face with one hand she felt glad the darkness hid her smile she kissed him again and suddenly he responded his tongue penetrating her mouth and exciting her she felt him growing hard again so she slid her hands down his back and pulled him tight against her that elicited a gasp of pleasure from him as he buried his face in her neck and hair but only for a moment he started moving again growing firmer each thrust sending a wave of pleasure through her and she heard herself moan another wave of pleasure swept through her this time it lasted a long long time only a single lamp burned in trellas bedroom the feast had finally ended at least for trella and her household she sat on the bed annoksur next to her holding korthacs emerald in her hand and he asked for nothing trella no gift in return nothing just my favor he didnt mention eskkar didnt even suggest that i tell him about this great gift as if eskkar didnt matter what will you do with it annoksur set the precious stone down on the bed between them nothing for now after the child comes as soon as i can ill sell it it will fetch enough to pay corios builders for some time im sure if you can find someone with enough gold to buy it at anywhere near what its worth annoksur sighed perhaps you should keep it no if the people saw me wearing such a thing theyd lose their trust in me how could i ask everyone to make sacrifices for the sake of the wall if i showed myself in public wearing a jewel worth so much trella shook her head but this korthac something about him troubles me even more than when he first arrived youve learned nothing new about him annoksur sighed little enough his men are never out of his or that hathors sight he bought two women in the slave market to cook and satisfy his men but they rarely go out when they do theyre always escorted by one or two of his men weve tried to speak with them but theyve been warned not to speak to anyone and theyre too frightened to disobey they buy their goods or wash their clothing in the river and return to korthacs inn aside from that they seldom leave his house ive seen them they look wretched hes hiding something annoksur maybe he committed some crime in egypt something so horrible that he fears it even here whatever his secret we need to discover it i dont know what else to try trella we watch his men we watch him but all he does is spend time at the trading carts along the river still he cant live like this forever even servants need time for themselves trella picked up the emerald and returned it to the pouch i think id give this away to learn what korthac is hiding she knotted the lace securely standing she went to the bed and knelt down pushing hard she slipped aside part of the leg of the bed exposing a tiny hollow barely large enough to conceal the pouch when she fitted the wood back in place the jewel had vanished only a very keen eye and a close examination would detect the tiny compartment there were more such hiding places secreted about the bedroom shed searched the room often enough and discovered three others but there might still be more the previous owner had many secrets perhaps you should send word for eskkar to return annoksur said hes been away long enough what would i say to him that some rich trader worries me that i cant fi nd out if hes hiding something he wouldnt know any more than we do she shook her head besides hes sent back gold as well as goods from bisitun and the council is happy that the lands up there are being pacifi ed and this new woman eskkar is keeping suppose he begins to forget about you the child will bring him back trella said though the same doubts had visited her let him have his pleasures for now he risked his life taking the village at least bantor will return soon that will make both of us feel better annoksur maybe we should get rid of this korthac if for no other reason than to stop you from worrying about him no not yet not until we learn more theres plenty of time and sooner or later well find out what hes hiding ten days after the feast of ishtar korthac stepped from his house and into the lane well past dawn his guards had already checked the street and today hathor waited there as well looking as alert as the two soldiers protecting korthac this day no one in akkad questioned his need for bodyguards everyone knew he often carried large quantities of gems or the gold from their sale on his person and that made him a tempting target for any thief desperate enough to risk his life so far no one had made the attempt korthacs guards looked too alert hands always on their swords and eyes constantly moving searching for any threat for any thief bold enough to get past the guards korthac carried a long knife of his own and no one doubted he knew how to use it even if a daring thief managed to cut korthacs purse and escape the whole city would be turned out looking for the robber everyone understood that korthac had made many friends in akkad and its traders and leading merchants would demand the soldiers hunt down the cutpurse even if he tried to flee the city this morning however the lane outside of korthacs new dwelling appeared as peaceful as every other day just the usual handful of vendors hawking their goods to those who avoiding eye contact hurried by korthacs lane didnt have much foot traffic not with the marketplace only two lanes over most of the more established and better quality vendors sold their merchandise there away from the market goods tended to be of more dubious quality with correspondingly lower prices most of the carts and booths near korthacs house were staffed by women often surrounded by what seemed like gangs of children all either shouting or crying whose noise and antics managed to annoy anyone simply trying to get through today the lane appeared relatively quiet and korthac started walking one guard leading the way and the other following behind hathor took his usual place at korthacs left side and the quartet of egyptians began their journey to the docks another fine day korthac said glancing up first at the bright blue sky and then shifting his gaze to his stilltired subcommander when hathor and nebibi had returned to akkad the night before both men reported to korthac on ariamuss activities nevertheless ever cautious korthac wanted to hear it again in more detail his plan required careful timing and events had to unfold on schedule to avoid failure yes lord hathor said his evervigilant eyes searching for danger as they walked they entered the marketplace already crowded with buyers and sellers some still arriving from the nearby farms the most industrious rose well before dawn to occupy the more advantageous locations in the square those who had farther to travel would continue to arrive for the next few hours nearly all of the local farmers sold their crops and animals in the morning and started returning to their homes an hour or so after midday those farther away usually faced a long day selling their goods to the boat captains visiting the city unfortunately many of the boats didnt arrive until well into the afternoon korthac stepped with care watching not only where he placed his feet but also the jostling crowd a man could get bumped by a basket of fruit or run over by a squealing cart laden with produce each day required charting a different path through the market the result of constantly changing stalls squealing animals even buyers and sellers the citys local craftsmen who usually sold their leather tools clay pots and some bronze tools and bowls every day had to take whatever space they could find fitting themselves between farmers carts bearing fruit or vegetables or cages of chickens raucous noise filled the square with men trying to attract customers competing with frightened animals in cages or tethered to anything solid today only a few slave traders congregated at their usual corner of the marketplace a scarce and unpredictable market the slavers always attracted a good deal of attention from the crowd sellers paraded their wares mostly women or young girls shouting out their abilities and boasting of their skills some of the slaves promoted themselves eager to find a good master and earn their keep and find a secure place to live in akkad in many cases parents sold their unneeded children amid much crying and tears as fathers clutched a few coins and watched as their sons or daughters became the property of someone else dozens of gawkers idlers or even people just passing through stopped and listened always interested in the buying and selling of human flesh in egypt korthac recalled the slavers market operated in much the same manner except the snap of the whip echoed out over the slaves cries more often here a steward or head of a household watched the slaves and little force or punishment was needed indeed korthac had been surprised to find that most of those in akkads slave market offered themselves for sale hoping to find an easier life than whatever one theyd left behind on the farm or in some remote village even parents selling their children hoped their child would fi nd a better life as a slave to some welloff merchant or craftsman in the growing city selling a daughter was less painful since there was little difference between a slave and a wife both obeyed someone else for the rest of their lives thieves and bandits made up the last group of slaves and these were watched and guarded more carefully ordered into slavery for their crimes they knew the life they faced theyd labor hard for the rest of their lives and if any slaves ran away akkads soldiers would hunt them down and bring them back apparently so korthac understood eskkar himself had fulfilled that menial role not so long ago a slave hunter who now thought he ruled a city but not for much longer korthac knew hathors latest report told of steady progress by ariamus and takany the number of men and horses under korthacs command increased steadily and soon they would be put to use the crowds thinned as korthac and hathor cleared the marketplace and soon they passed out of the river gate activity at the docks varied each day as boat captains arrived and departed some making more than one trip a day others passing through akkad and going up or down the great river on longer voyages korthac reached his chosen place of business close enough to the docks to see every arrival but far enough away to avoid being trampled underfoot by those loading or unloading goods other gem traders sold in the marketplace but korthac needed a quieter place to run his business away from the mob of gawkers who didnt have two coppers to rub together since he sold only highquality gems serious buyers soon learned where to find him at least this morning korthac wouldnt have to wait for his hired man to arrive and set out his stall for a copper coin each day a carpenter living just inside the gate agreed to store korthacs narrow table threelegged stool and awning pole safely each night and return it first thing in the morning today everything was in place and the carpenter stood there grinning and waiting for his coin hathor handed it over while korthac took his seat on the stool he could have had his guards carry the load each day from and to the house but korthac decided that would make him a figure of fun a rich man who traveled throughout the city with two guards carrying his makeshift stall once paid the man rushed off eager to be about his own trade without a word of thanks to either hathor or korthac not that korthac really cared about words of gratitude he intended to cut the mans ears off as soon as he took power korthac settled in for another day of sham trading as usual he sent one of the guards to take a place near the gate with orders to look for anyone who might be taking too much interest in korthacs table the other guard stood a few paces away hand on his sword and watching everyone that passed to and fro meanwhile korthac took his seat on the stool sharing his morning meal of bread and hard cheese with his subcommander gem buyers and sellers seldom did business so early and by now korthac and his table attracted no more attention than any other dockside trader he let hathor take his time retelling his observations and conversations at ariamuss camp speaking between bites as he related everything he had seen and heard both men spoke in egyptian and kept their voices low so ariamus will be ready korthac said when hathor finished up yes lord he may have to sweep the land for the last ten or twenty horses but by then it wont matter and the men you brought back with you will they do i was with ariamus when he chose them lord i tested their skills with the sword myself theyre all experienced fighters quick and more than competent for that much gold theyll kill anyone korthac wanted to speak to them himself but that would be too dangerous the four men had spent the night at a small inn only a few paces down the lane from korthacs house with nebibi keeping an eye on them to make sure they saw no one and kept their mouths shut good give them their gold and get them out of the city before noon and tell them there will be an extra ten gold coins each when they succeed surprise showed on hathors face that much gold theyve already agreed to the price i want to make sure they finish the job i dont want them getting up to bisitun and deciding its too dangerous besides there will be plenty of gold to pay them with by the time they get back korthac smiled at the thought and tell them if they fail ill offer the same gold to others to hunt them down and bring me their heads that should help stiffen their nerve ill send them out of the city one by one hathor suggested theyll be less likely to attract attention that way they need to buy one new horse to replace the one that went lame make sure they know the schedule theyre to ride hard to bisitun and strike as soon as they can if they delay theyre of no use to me ive told them lord they understand the urgency theyll strike as soon as they can good that will mean one less thing to worry about korthac glanced around always checking to see who might be watching them trellas spies were everywhere and not always easy to spot he put thoughts of the assassins aside make sure nebibi has time to study the land across the river this morning takany may need a place to hide if he arrives early or if we need to delay get nebibi on his way back to takany as soon as the others leave will he have any problems traveling alone no the land on the west bank is peaceful enough a few farmers live there but mostly herders nebibis got a good horse and hell carry enough food so he wont have to stop less than three days ride if he avoids the villages lets hope he isnt murdered by bandits on the way hathor laughed politely at his lords joke is everything ready here lord yes ive nearly finished my listkorthac tapped his head with his forefingerof those we can use rasui of course he hates both trella and eskkar thinks theyre upstarts who should both be driven out of akkad and five or six of the citys leading traders mostly ones whove been penalized by eskkar or the council im sure theyll all be glad to become part of the new council of nobles theyll influence their friends to join us more than enough to build upon have you spoken to them yet i mean did you tell them what you plan no nothing so soon korthac didnt mind discussing this with hathor the only one of his subcommanders with the wits to see the need for subtlety but ive listened politely to their petty complaints and offered my sympathy so they consider me one of their worthy companions the moment weve seized the city theyll all thank the gods for the chance to become my followers and take my gold theyll gain power and wealth as well as a chance to pay back their enemies the rest of the city will hate them but thats a small price to pay is there anything that can go wrong lord of course korthac said with a laugh eskkar may return or that bantor could arrive early if gatuss scouts get wind of ariamuss force that could change everything but so far everything seems to lord the bodyguard called out to korthac lady trella is approaching korthac turned toward the gate surprised to see trella on her way toward the docks despite her pregnancy she moved gracefully enough head held high surrounded by four hawk clan guards and walking beside a man korthac recognized as a river trader from the south nicar accompanied her and the group walked to the very edge of the river where trella and nicar spoke at some length to the trader well our mighty ruler visits even the docks korthac said her guards look alert enough hathor commented shes been attacked once before pity she survived still i suppose that worked out the best for us korthac studied her guards and had to admit they knew their business they faced outward eyes moving all the time watching everyone who passed by especially those who tried to approach lady trella at last trellas goodbyes ended the trader bowed first to trella than nicar and trod carefully down the gangway to his boat where his twoman crew waited no doubt eager to depart trella and nicar turned away and started wending their way back to the gate then trella caught sight of korthac and changed her direction heading toward him nicar however continued into the city in a moment she and her entourage arrived good morning korthac she said bowing slightly good morning lady trella korthac said bowing as well i havent seen you on the docks before and you are hathor trella said giving him a smile i remember you from the feast i am honored lady trella hathor said bowing low please lady trella korthac said take my stool and come under the awning you should not stand in the sun ill take your shade she said but id rather stand you dont seem to be doing much trading this morning she added touching the bare table in front of them korthac laughed i usually dont display my wares unless someone shows interest he said he reached inside his pouch and brought out a dozen or so gemstones which he spread across the table the stones sparkled in the light a bright green emerald three goodsized citrines a blue sapphire and two dark red garnets standing out even among the others the women of akkad would love to wear any of these im sure trella said fingering the darker of the garnets a special price for you lady trella korthac said smiling she shook her head no not until after the birth then there will be a reason to celebrate i look forward to the happy day korthac said he turned to hathor you should be about your duties the sun is rising ever higher yes lord hathor said and turned to trella you will excuse me lady trella of course she said giving him another smile im sure you still have much to do in your masters new house hathor bowed to both of them and strode off stepping between the guards as he headed back to the gate i am glad you decided to stay in akkad trella said your trading will bring benefit to many in the city i did think about moving farther south korthac said but in truth your city seems to be growing so fast that my business cannot help but grow with it and your wise administration keeps the people content i have never seen so large a city with so few thieves and beggars many people left the city before the siege began trella said those who remained were willing to risk their lives for a new start still i suppose there will always be some too lazy to work and too ready to steal unfortunately they prefer to prey on the poor and weak why wouldnt they steal from the rich look at yourself korthac trella said unlike the poor you have guards to protect you and where could a thief sell anything stolen from you hed have to leave akkad and hope not to be caught or robbed on the road anyone trying to take his gems would wind up dead korthac knew hed selected only those quick and efficient to guard his person and his guards knew all about thieves and assassins you seem to care more for tradesmen and farmers than for the wealthy traders lady trella she laughed at that a pleasant sound that made everyones eyes turn in her direction perhaps thats because the wealthy and prosperous need little from me its only those that suffer privation who need help and guidance her concern was genuine korthac noted surprised in spite of himself in egypt rulers had claimed to lead the people as a wise father guides his family but in truth theyd done little more than take advantage of anyone weaker than themselves and that korthac thought was why hed win here the common people couldnt be depended on didnt have the strength to endure hardship or difficulty or the courage to face up to their conquerors once again he wondered about eskkar wondered if he too had the same feelings about the common rabble not likely korthac decided barbarians he learned had little use for anyone not of their own kind anyone weaker than themselves the people of akkad are fortunate in their ruler then the city is indeed blessed by the gods trella said and now honored korthac i must leave you there is another meeting of the council this morning he bowed and she returned the gesture before walking away her guards forming around her in a moment shed passed through the gate and disappeared the few laggards on the dock whod wasted time watching their discourse turned away and returned to their own business lady trellas visit to korthac and his tiny stall already forgotten korthac swept the gems off the table and back into his pouch turning away from the gate he stared at the sunlit river not really seeing it instead thinking of his words with trella she had her wits about her he decided any other women in the city would have been pawing over the gems commenting on their beauty admiring them against the soft skin of their breasts after a single glance trella had ignored the sparkling gems keeping her eyes on his and searching he knew for any hint of weakness since hed left egypt he had conversed with no one as an equal but this slave girl knew something about the ways of men if she wasnt carrying another mans whelp he might even keep her on as his concubine to amuse his thoughts and challenge his wits on occasion after he trained her properly of course but unfortunately for her she was much too popular instead she would play another role in his city proving for everyone to see that he ruled here absolutely it was a role that would see her dead at his feet soon enough five more days went by without event and already a fortnight had passed since ishtars feast the late afternoon sun drifted toward the western horizon and enhedu considered packing up her wares for the day a good hour earlier than usual this day like all the other days and weeks before it had brought little out of the ordinary business always slowed down in the late afternoon when people tired after a long days work worried more about eating their dinner than buying trinkets shed only sold one belt all day and that before the noon hour to a trader whose own had split shed arrived in the lane at first light just in time to watch korthac head toward the river a little earlier than he normally did but he returned at noon his regular hour to take his midday meal in private korthac had moved into his new quarters two weeks ago a few days after ishtars festival his new residence consisted of three small houses in a row all attached together with the central one slightly larger than the other two enhedu had started selling her wares in korthacs lane two days before he took possession of his new house by the time the egyptian moved in shed become just another woman selling goods her wares displayed only a few paces away from a farmers wife selling vegetables at least half a dozen pushcarts lined the lane every day sometimes blocking traffic as the vendors moved and shifted their carts and goods about or their owners took time to gossip after so many days at her post enhedu knew the name of every one of the seventeen egyptians and spoke to all of them whenever they passed but only if their master were absent shed soon learned not to call attention to herself not with korthac nearby none would dare venture into the lane or even acknowledge her greeting the only small exception to that rule was hathor a seriouslooking man who seldom smiled he functioned as senior steward to korthac or acted as occasional bodyguard depending on the need when korthac left the house hathor took charge and he spent his time moving between the three houses checking on the men and maintaining order that brought him out into the lane and occasionally he would smile or nod a greeting to enhedu as he passed twice he actually bought something from her cart a belt one time and a wrist guard the other he made other purchases for the household as well sometimes in the lane but more often in the marketplace which held a better selection of goods to her surprise hed picked up the local language very well and even ventured to ask about her other wares enhedu tried to draw him into conversation but he never stayed long or spoke much he never acknowledged her presence if korthac accompanied him the egyptian leader remained as elusive as ever after taking his midday meal korthac usually returned to the docks boats that had started their journey toward akkad at dawn often arrived in the afternoon hours and trading could be brisk until late in the day today though korthac remained within his walls then in the middle of the afternoon two men she had never seen before walked up to korthacs house the door wardens recognized them and passed them inside without the usual challenge the strangers hardlooking men in dirty tunics remained less than an hour then departed walking toward the river gate as they did so several of korthacs men began passing from one house to the other and the attitude of the guards changed those stationed at the doors seemed more tense and the quick smiles they often directed at her disappeared that piqued enhedus interest even more than the strangers visitation she changed her mind about quitting early and began working on another belt using a tiny bronze needle to etch a design in the soft leather the simple pattern occupied her hands and still let her watch the lane looking for anything out of the ordinary you say ariamus is ready to cross the river seated on a small stool korthacs words sounded harsh in the small windowless chamber he used when he desired complete privacy yes lord rihat answered sitting crosslegged on the floor before korthac all the men are in place hiding in the hills just across the tigris ariamus said to tell you we can attack today or wait until tomorrow if you need more time no we will attack today at dusk just as we planned youre sure no one saw our force none that we left alive lord rihat licked his lips ariamus was very careful we traveled most of the night then took shelter in the hills we saw only a few herders tending their flocks korthac studied rihat with care one of ariamuss subcommanders rihat appeared to have his wits about him though he looked nervous at finally meeting korthac face to face not that that meant anything korthac knew he made most men uneasy the man showed the fatigue of days of hard traveling his face covered with sweat he gulped another mouthful of water from the cup he glanced from korthac to hathor the only other man present in the room listen to me very carefully korthac said speaking with deliberation tell them theyre to cross today an hour before sunset he kept his eyes locked on rihat probing for any signs of inattentiveness or fear then youll approach the city from the south and wait for my signal yes lord takany and nebibi explained everything they made sure everything was prepared before they sent me on ahead both takany and nebibi knew the penalty for failure to obey orders exactly korthac worried more about ariamus and his men they represented the unknown quantity and if they failed korthac might be left trapped in the city lord do you want me to return with rihat to make sure the men are ready hathor offered the suggestion humbly enough and korthac considered the question for a moment before he answered no i need you here hathor rihat can convey my orders word for word to takany and ariamus isnt that right rihat korthacs tone dripped with menace and rihat dropped his eyes to the floor yes lord he finally answered when the silence between them stretched out exactly as you say good korthac even permitted himself a small smile to encourage the man you will be rewarded when the city is ours now return to takany and tell them to make sure they get across the tigris without being seen then theyre to follow the river to the gate and await my signal they must not be late korthac nodded to hathor who stood and extended his hand to rihat pulling him to his feet the two men left the room leaving korthac alone with his thoughts takany would be the one whod suggested waiting another day he would have wanted to rest the men no doubt all of them were weary after four days of hard traveling mostly at night to reach akkads outskirts unseen still korthac knew someone in the countryside would have seen something and a hint of his mens passage would probably arrive in the morning besides the longer the men had to wait the more likely something else would go wrong or that takany and ariamus would get in some argument and blood would fl ow and right now korthac knew he needed ariamus and his horsemen more than takany a brute fighter completely loyal to his master hathor returned to the room and stood in the doorway rihat and his companion are on their way back lord summon simut its time to prepare hathor stepped away returning in a few moments with simut another one of korthacs bodyguards whod proven himself in many fights over the years gather your three men simut korthac began do you know what to do korthac had gone over this assignment several times with the man so there was no need to go into the details again make sure you give yourself enough time to find gatus and kill him simut nodded i understand lord he shall die in the lane returning to his house theyd studied gatuss routine for over a week the captain of the guard would finish his duties at the barracks or the council house then visit his favorite tavern for a single mug of ale before heading back to his house just as dusk fell if something goes wrong simut korthac said if the alarm is given youll have to kill him as he leaves the alehouse the man must die no matter how many men you lose yes lord ill not fail you of all the men in the city only gatus had the experience and presence to act as a rallying point for any resistance with all of the other senior men out of akkad the rest of the soldiers and the citys inhabitants would look to him for leadership so the old soldier had to die first to dishearten the soldiers and the people then youll be well rewarded when we have the city korthac turned to hathor youll keep the gate to trellas house open trellas house with its surrounding wall and force of soldiers stationed within would be easy to defend given sufficient warning and trella would provide another rallying point for resistance korthac preferred to capture her alive if possible but dead or alive the house must be taken before it could become a stronghold to rally the citys inhabitants korthac had given that dangerous assignment to hathor the man could think while he fought and he knew the importance of capturing the house as soon as takanys inside the river gate ill join you at the house hathor just hold the gate open until i arrive yes lord the gate will stay open then by tonight we will rule in akkad korthac said he looked from one to the other neither man showed any sign of doubt or fear theyd fought at korthacs side before and hed always led them to victory they understood the plan and had no questions they were ready prepare your men korthac ordered it is time enhedu pretended not to notice korthacs men moving about and kept hawking her wares at every passerby often following shoppers for a dozen steps up and down the lane a convenient excuse to move about and study any goingson the sun had begun to sink toward the western hills when she noted hathor leaving korthacs house accompanied by four men two of them carrying rolledup blankets under their arms enhedu thought that a little odd shed never seen hathor go anywhere with more than one guard before she called out to him but either he didnt hear or had no time for her usual banter by now business at the river dock would be winding down and certainly no boats would be setting forth so close to sundown enhedu still puzzled over what it might mean when simut another of korthacs bodyguards departed the house accompanied by three more men again two of them carried bulky bundles unsure of what if anything these strange goingson meant she knew she must tell tammuz enhedu began packing up her leather goods displayed upon the carts frayed blanket the blanket also served to transport the items and in a few moments it resembled the bundles korthacs men carried only shorter using two mismatched leather strips she fastened the ends of the blanket to seal it her mind kept working however weeks had gone by with nothing out of the ordinary now many of the egyptians were moving about and the change in their manner worried her by the time she finished packing up her goods she heard voices speaking egyptian and looked up to see korthac exit the house accompanied by two of his men again one of korthacs followers carried what seemed a heavy bundle this one a bit longer than those carried by the other men enhedu never looked up even when korthac passed within an arms length of her cart she watched his feet through her tangled hair and waited until he disappeared down the lane the sight of the grim egyptian worried her she felt tempted to leave the cart but an abandoned cart might call attention to herself best to move it as she did every night shoving it down the lane back to ninbandas house where it would be safe but before she could start the cart moving a fourth group of egyptians stepped into the lane staring at their feet she counted five of them the number surprised her that meant the three houses were now empty whatever contents the dwellings contained left unguarded in the six weeks shed watched the houses korthac never had less than half of his men inside guarding his property this last group however did not go toward the river instead they went up the lane toward the center of akkad she watched their backs for a moment then leaned her weight against the cart which yielded reluctantly with a screech of wood against wood enhedu alarmed now used all her strength to keep the cart moving unmindful of those who had to dart out of its path as it creaked and wobbled along when she reached ninbandas hut she didnt pause just shoved the cart against the huts entrance as she called out to the woman to attend it enhedu hurried down another lane toward the alehouse something was wrong she found herself running clutching the heavy blanket of wares to her chest and dodging between the workweary villagers plodding back to their homes breathing hard she turned into the narrow lane that led to tammuzs alehouse ducked past two men who tried to greet her pushed through the halfopen door and ran inside kuri looked up at the noise but she ignored his usual smile wheres tammuz is he here she dropped her bundle worried that tammuz might have been watching the house might even have followed hathor or simuts party but tammuz stepped out from their private room hed heard the door bang and her excited voice enhedu whats one look at her face silenced him she pushed him back into the bedroom and closed the door keeping her voice low she described what shed seen these bundles how big were they enhedu held her hands an arms length apart the blankets that korthacs men carried were longer and thicker too mmm not long enough for bows tammuzs eyes widened swords could they have carried swords yes i suppose i didnt hear anything clanking swearing under his breath tammuz scooped up his belt and swung it around him from habit enhedu helped him fasten it fear rising in her when she saw him loosen the knife in its sheath im going to eskkars house to warn trella he said you stay here with kuri he slipped through the door then out of the alehouse moving at a run enhedu stood there stunned what could tammuz do with one good arm and only a knife if there were trouble he would she stepped back into the common room one of the patrons saw her and called out for another ale and something to eat enhedu stared at him unheedingly then noticed his companion the man carried a knife on his belt i need to borrow this she said moving so quickly that shed pulled the greentinged copper blade from the mans belt before he even realized what she intended kuri stay here she tucked the knife inside her dress clutching it tight against her body through the thin shift holding it firmly from outside and ran after tammuz ignoring the voices that called after her people filled the lanes many had eaten their evening meals and looked forward to a few hours of relaxation before turning in for the night they frowned at enhedu as she pushed and bumped her way through their midst following the path she knew tammuz would take toward eskkars house the sun sank below the horizon already the daylight colors had faded replaced by the grayness of shadows that began to cover everything at this time of day it would take some time to reach eskkars residence and she hurried as fast as she could breathing hard as she weaved through the strollers to her surprise before shed crossed three lanes she saw tammuz walking a few paces ahead of her relieved she slowed to a walk to add to her astonishment he turned away from the lane that led to eskkars she wondered what could have made him change his destination about a dozen paces behind him she opened her mouth to call his name when gatus tammuz yelled look out the shout froze everyone in the lane but only for an instant then the dull clank of bronze on bronze shattered the peaceful evening tammuz darted ahead drawing his knife enhedu broke into a run fear rushing through her at what she might find a voice shouted in egyptian and she heard a man scream in pain as she reached the intersection where tammuz had shouted with scarcely enough light for her to see enhedu recognized gatus his back against a wall and a sword in his hand fighting off simut and his men a man gatuss bodyguard lay writhing on the ground bleeding his cries for help ignored gatus fending off three men was about to be overwhelmed when tammuz slipped up behind one of simuts men and stabbed him hard in the back the man screamed and enhedu saw blood gushing from his tunic simut saw the blow and swung his sword at tammuz who ducked away from the cut seizing the opportunity gatus shifted to the opposite side striking at the closest of his attackers gatuss thrust drove the man back giving the old soldier a chance to dodge aside and escape but before he could get clear the other egyptian lunged at gatus driving his sword into the captain of the guards side gatus rammed the hilt of his sword into the mans face with enough force to shove the man back into his companion then gatus clutching his side whirled away and disappeared up the lane merging with the growing shadows meanwhile simut turned to tammuz to finish off the youth whod disrupted simuts ambush he raised his sword and stepped toward tammuz slashing at his head tammuz stepped sideways as he jerked his knife from his victims back simuts sword just missed but the egyptian had fought too many times to stake his life on a single blow moving smoothly he followed up with a cross cut at tammuzs head then lunged at tammuzs chest tammuz his knife no match against his attackers sword twisted away trying to avoid the thrust but he lost his balance and stumbled unable to shift his weight tammuz landed hard on his weak arm simut with a grunt of satisfaction drew back his sword and thrust downward but before the blow could gather momentum simuts easy kill turned into a hiss of pain enhedu arriving at a run had drawn the knife from her bosom and shoved it with all her strength into simuts back a hands width above his belt feeling it sink to the hilt the thrust froze the egyptians sword for a moment he stood there then with a grunt of pain he turned his blade toward his attacker mortally wounded but still able to strike before the blow landed tammuz lunged up from the ground with his knife burying his blade under simuts ribs with an incomprehensible curse the man fell to the ground the sword striking enhedu weakly but with the blade flat before it slipped from his hand enhedu jerked her knife free from simuts body feeling hot blood gush along her arm and reached tammuzs side helping him to his feet gatus had slipped away his two remaining attackers vanishing after him in pursuit half a dozen onlookers stunned into silence stared openmouthed into the gathering darkness at the three men lying dead or dying before them tammuz took one look around shoved the bloody knife in his belt then grasped enhedus arm in a moment they too faded into the growing shadows at a run leaving the shocked and surprised inhabitants to wonder what theyd just witnessed weaving between the unconcerned strollers tammuz guided enhedu down one lane then changed direction to another enhedu looked behind them but saw nothing they slowed to a brisk walk no one noticed them here one lane away the commotion had gone unheard weve got to get to eskkars house tammuz whispered trella needs to what about gatus enhedu realized she still clutched her knife in her hand she stuffed it back inside the bodice of her dress shivering as the hot blood still on the blade dripped between her breasts she had to force the image of simuts face showing a mixture of pain and hatred from her mind i saw him run up the lane with the egyptians in pursuit we cant do anything about him tammuz said moving her along faster as he got his breath back either he got away or theyve caught up with him by now we need to warn trella enhedu realized theyd gone back the way they came then closed in on eskkars house the lane twisted and turned but only one more intersection lay between them and their destination as eskkars house came into sight sounds of violence erupted from just outside the gate they saw a halfdozen men fighting at the courtyard entrance tammuz started forward then stopped as a wall of egyptians pushed past them from behind knocking tammuz and enhedu aside in their haste tammuz covered enhedu with his body and pressed her against the wall they both watched in horror as dozens of foreign soldiers swords in their hands charged toward eskkars house before tammuz or enhedu could overcome their shock and surprise the egyptians had raced up and overwhelmed the akkadians defending eskkars household earlier when korthac left his house a little before dusk he strode past the woman his men called enhedu without observing her or any of the other vendors accompanied by only two guards his eyes scanned the lane alert for any signs of danger but saw nothing out of the ordinary no longer a stranger he wended his way through the twisting lanes almost unnoticed by the people of akkad the few that did give him a glance didnt perceive the long knife fastened beneath his tunic the marketplace stood nearly deserted as korthac passed through it heading toward the river gate on the way he encountered several of akkads soldiers most of them unarmed and none of whom even glanced at him by now korthac knew their routine they would have finished their duties for the day and already eaten dinner in the barracks common room now they would search out their favorite alehouses to enjoy a few hours relaxation before heading for their beds and another nights sleep arriving at akkads rear gate korthac found it halfopen though both gates should have been sealed at dusk the river gate often stayed open a few extra hours the guards had pushed the one side closed but left the other side accessible people continued to walk in and out some heading for the river to bathe while others strolled along the bank taking their ease or conducting business of a personal nature a watch fire burned beside the gate next to a bundle of torches korthac spotted one of his other four men sitting against the wall as unnoticed as any beggar the man raised his right arm in greeting and korthac nodded the signal meant all of the men were ready and in place korthac continued on noting that only two guards stood at the gates entrance watching to make sure no strangers entered after dusk the gathering darkness made it difficult to be certain yet korthac counted no more than seven soldiers manning the gate usually a detail of ten secured the river gate but the number varied and hed found nights when as few as five walked their post taking his time he climbed the steps to the rightside parapet one of his guards followed the one carrying the longest bundle while the other remained below at the top three soldiers stood guard looking down toward the docks and those passing in and out through the gate the gate commander approached korthac orders said that only soldiers could mount the wall but exceptions might be made especially for a rich trader who wanted to see the river and didnt mind parting with a few coins greetings honorable korthac the man said how may i help you tonight korthac had mounted these steps at least once a day for the last few weeks to offer his prayers to the river god hed explained each prayer session always short ended with a copper coin for the guard greetings to you and your men korthac answered with a smile tonight i have to make a special offering to enki the river god to thank him for the favorable cargo he sent me today korthac nodded to his bodyguard who unslung the sack hed carried across his shoulder then turned back to the guard perhaps you can help my servant with the offering the other two guards curious at this new ritual moved closer as the bodyguard knelt to open his bundle korthac stepped behind them hand on his knife as the blanket came open korthac struck moving so quickly that hed stabbed the two guards before either could react and with only the sound of their moans escaping the watch commander died at the same moment a stunned look of surprise on his face as korthacs bodyguard snatched up a sword from the sack and drove it into the soldiers stomach the man died without even reaching for his sword and more important without sounding the alarm pushing the bodies aside korthac reached down and took a short horsemans bow from his bodyguards hand it took but a moment to string it and nock an arrow but there was no need the soldiers guarding the other side of the gate had died struck down by his egyptians whod moved into place just under the steps as their leader mounted some of the dead had cried out but thered been no loud clash of weapons nevertheless a few citizens looked about in surprise wondering what had happened too confused to understand what theyd witnessed korthac didnt worry about them all that mattered was that the alarm hadnt sounded and by now one of his men had secured the trumpet more egyptians guarded the two lanes leading away from the gate ready to stop any messenger rushing toward the soldiers barracks with a warning instead korthac leaned out over the wall and waved the bow he couldnt see far into the darkness but he knew his men waited there close enough to see the signal and would relay it to takany and ariamuss men looking down into the well of the gate he saw the rest of his men moving into position taking station just inside the opening to make sure no one attempted to shut the portal from the darkness he heard the rumble of many sandals approaching and looked back toward the river the moment korthac saw his men running toward the gate he descended the steps takany and nebibi led the first group of men through without stopping fifty egyptians and an equal number of recruits followed him all moving at a run directly toward the barracks ariamus leading another forty men followed them in pausing only long enough for korthac and his six egyptian bodyguards to fall in step beside him korthac had belted his sword about him and strapped on a bronze helmet both taken from the same bundle that concealed the swords and bow the invaders jogged steadily moving fast enough to cover the ground quickly but not too fast to leave the men exhausted korthacs force of nearly fifty men headed straight toward eskkars house korthac needed to capture it and those inside without a major struggle hed seen that the house was strongly built given enough warning even a handful of men could hold out there for some time his contingent had farther to go than takany and those moving to the barracks which were closer to the river than eskkars house hathor would be positioned there with orders to wait as long as he could before attacking to let his leader reach his destination the alarm sounded while they still had another lane to traverse korthac broke into a run his men speeding up behind him he turned into eskkars lane a torch burned next to the gate and he saw a knot of men fi ghting hathor and his men had orders to keep that gate open a clamor rose up from behind the courtyard wall another trumpet sending its warning up into the darkness overriding the noise and confusion the clash of bronze on bronze told everyone fighting raged and inside the compound eskkars soldiers fumbled for their weapons and rushed to close the gate two of hathors men died fighting but they held it open long enough for korthacs men to reach it korthac stopped just outside and ordered them in ariamus led the way bursting through the opening shouting his war cry korthac let a dozen men pass through then followed them in guarded by the same two bodyguards who helped kill the soldiers at the river gate another torch still burned in the courtyard lighting the dead bodies scattered about two more of ariamuss men had died forcing their way in the rest of korthacs egyptians formed up around him he hurried along the house wall toward the house ariamus had orders to break in if necessary and two of his men carried hammers and stakes for that purpose if necessary they would drive the stakes into the door and wrench the wood apart korthac saw the tools wouldnt be needed the thick door stood wide open sounds of fighting came from the house though that noise ended by the time he reached the entrance ariamus blood on his sword met him just inside the door theyre in the upper rooms well have to force the door two men pulled hammers from their packs and rushed toward the stairs perhaps not bring another torch stepping over the dead body of a soldier korthac passed inside and ascended the steps stopping just below the landing he rapped on the door with the point of his sword lady trella he called out tell your men to open the door otherwise well have to break it down and kill everyone inside shouts answered him and from behind the door he heard men arguing soldiers of akkad the house has been taken korthac waited a moment while the sounds of men cursing sounded through the door lady trella tell your men to surrender your soldiers are all dead and more of my men have captured the barracks there wont be any help if you dont want your followers to die open the door he let the arguing go on for a few moments they had no choice as soon as they realized no one would come to their rescue theyd surrender korthacs men filled the courtyard some already busy looting the soldiers quarters behind the door the defenders kept arguing their voices rising as they shouted at each other some wanted to hold out others wanted to talk open the door now trella you need my protection for you and the child youll let the soldiers live her question carried over the bickering which quieted at her words korthac detected no panic in her voice only acceptance of the inevitable yes as slaves its that or they die they had no choice and it didnt take trella long to convince her guards he heard the sound of the table dragging across the floor and in a moment the bar lifting from its braces the door swung open to reveal annoksur standing there behind her stood four men swords at the ready korthac saw another man wounded lying against the wall tell them to put down their weapons and come out you and lady trella will stay here drop your swords and obey him lady trellas voice came from behind the men she sounded unafraid but hed soon change that the soldiers looked at each other then tossed their swords to the floor in surrender tie them up ariamus well need good slaves korthac meant his words a few weeks working as tethered captives under the whip would find them more than willing to join his forces with eskkar dead and forgotten trained fighting men would willingly join him korthac watched as ariamus and his men secured the soldiers binding their hands and pushing them down the stairs to join the other prisoners in moments only trella and annoksur remained ill send your servants up here trella if you want them to stay alive youll remain in the bedroom why are you doing this trella said ignoring her question he gave orders to have both the upper rooms searched and all weapons removed korthac left six of his men to watch over trella telling them in egyptian to kill her if anyone attempted a rescue moving downstairs he found ariamus and hathor waiting for him a messenger just came from takany hathor said still holding a sword dripping with blood hes taken the barracks and seized all the weapons but men are holding out at the main gate hathor had done well securing the entrance to eskkars compound with takanys capture of the soldiers quarters the most difficult objective had been achieved the only real resistance could have come from the barracks with that taken the battle had ended korthacs main goal had been to secure trella alive and unharmed so that he could use her to force the inhabitants to his will ariamus leave twenty of your men here korthac said take the rest and guard the river gate make sure no horses leave the city watch the boats and the river as well korthac turned to hathor take your men to the main gate keep whatever soldiers are left penned up there put archers on the walls to make sure no one leaves the city when takany gets here well bring our men to the main gate and finish the last of the resistance afterward we can begin hunting down any whove escaped by dawn the city will be mine unsure of what to do tammuz and enhedu stood there with a dozen others even after the fighting ended watching events unfold along with a few dozen of akkads stunned citizens tammuz and enhedu had seen korthac capture eskkars house whatever warning tammuz might have given would likely have arrived too late by the time hed convinced anyone of the danger korthacs men would have struck just when tammuz decided theyd best return to the alehouse armed men poured out of eskkars house tammuz and enhedu like all the frightened villagers shrank against the wall or into nearby homes while the fiercelooking egyptians marched by many with blood still on their swords after all the invaders had passed with enhedu holding his left arm tammuz followed behind them keeping back a safe distance when they reached the open area before the main gate he and enhedu could see that the archers in the towers had refused to surrender as they watched shafts flew at the invaders pushing them back into the lane wait here tammuz said nudging enhedu into a doorway he slipped as close to the rear of the egyptians as he dared he heard hathor and korthac talking along with another man they called takany who seemed to be korthacs second in command the three men spoke briefly but always in egyptian and tammuz had no idea of what they said when korthac finished hathor raced off back up the lane toward eskkars house tammuz watched as korthac and takany positioned their men to make sure no reinforcements could reach the gate or towers and to prevent the soldiers within from escaping then korthac stood there waiting before long hathor returned leading a dozen men carrying torches and escorting lady trella her hands bound together with a leather thong and escorted by two grinning egyptians who held her by the arms as they hurried her along they took her directly to where korthac waited he spoke to her then slapped her across the face before taking hold of her wrist and twisting it until she cried out appearing satisfied at trellas reaction korthac pushed her into hathors arms take her to the gate korthac ordered speaking in akkadian to make sure trella understood his words if the soldiers dont surrender kill her stunned at trellas treatment tammuz watched as hathor led lady trella out into the open space behind the gate soldiers of akkad hathor shouted his powerful voice echoing throughout the area if you dont lay down your weapons and surrender lady trella will be put to death and then well kill everyone in the towers tammuz saw that hathor stood beside trella an easy shot for most of the archers in the tower but everyone knew what would happen to trella if an arrow struck him down hathor waited a few moments then called out again for the last time surrender now and you will live he pushed trella forward tell them soldiers come down from the towers trellas voice carried easily to the walls dont resist save your own lives tammuz shook his head never had he thought such a thing could happen korthacs too wise to stand out there in the open where an arrow could take him enhedu said watching the spectacle shed ignored tammuzs order to stay behind and moved up to join him he lets hathor take the risk of dying this is bad tammuz said the guards will have to surrender we should get back to the alehouse enhedu whispered we cant do anything here they may start killing everyone in the streets as soon as i see what happens i have to make sure shouting voices came from the towers but the debate didnt last long the twenty or thirty men divided between the towers and outnumbered by at least five times their strength had no choice but to yield without weapons food and water they couldnt hold out at trellas urging they put down their weapons and filed from the tower by then tammuz had seen enough with all resistance ended the terror would begin lets get out of here before the looting starts he hurried enhedu along his knife held tight against his side but they didnt encounter any of korthacs men and soon reached tammuzs establishment as dark as every house on the lane no one would burn even the smallest lamp tonight afraid to attract any attention from their new masters a worried kuri let them into the alehouse sword in hand and barred the door behind them only a faint glow from the fireplace embers gave any illumination tammuz peered into the common room but saw no one i chased them all out and told them not to return until morning kuri said theyll be busy enough picking up whatever they can steal in all this confusion using a shard of pottery he lifted a glowing ember from what remained of the fire and carried it into tammuzs private room where he touched it to the oil lamp he blew on it gently until a tiny flame appeared enough to reveal another presence waiting for them whats happening out there gatus lay across tammuzs bed one hand clutching his side his voice weak and full of pain his stillbloody sword lay beside him close to his hand enhedu pushed past the men she lifted the lamp and moved it closer to gatus hold the lamp here tammuz while i look after his wound lifting his garment she moved aside gatuss hand and examined the gash just above his hip shed tended enough cuts and scrapes at the tannery though nothing as deep as this hes still bleeding his arm is cut and his side the blade must have passed through his arm an arms not very good as a shield gatus said wincing in pain just tie it up i have to go get to my men you cant go anywhere gatus tammuz said his voice sounding harsh in the small room trellas been captured the barracks and both gates seized all the soldiers have been taken prisoner except for the ones who died korthac rules akkad korthac that egyptian dog by dawn half of korthacs men will be searching for you simut must have had orders to kill you instead we killed him and one of his men the egyptians will want revenge for that theyll want you or your dead body that was you my thanks for that stroke tammuz gatus said did kuri teach you how to fight thank enhedu as well she saved both of us gatus looked at enhedu in confusion so tammuz recounted the fight and described simuts death while enhedu cleaned the soldiers wounds he can stay here kuri said i mean hes bleeding pretty bad theyll search everywhere including here tammuz said well have to find someplace else well hide him here on the roof enhedu said she tore a piece of cloth in half and turned to kuri help me lift him they lifted gatuss shoulders up off the bed enough for her to slip the cloth underneath him she used another piece of linen to thicken the bandage and tied it tight around his waist then she bound up his arm straightening she faced the two men theyll search here but they wont go up on the roof we can distract anyone who comes looking if need be and make sure they dont poke around too closely he can stay up there in the hiding hole all day or at least until theyve come and gone all day in the sun hell bake well give him a blanket to cover himself she said and some water with luck they wont find him up there after theyve searched we can bring him back down enhedu looked down at gatus he needs a healer but that will have to wait at least until tomorrow night ive been in the sun before he said peering from one to the other in the dim light one more day wont kill me he choked off a laugh at his own words the roof above their heads the solid part had a flat space barely large enough for two people to stretch out but what looked like the end of the roof was in reality a false wall concealing a narrow niche where tammuz like the previous owner had found occasion to temporarily hide stolen goods it would be a tight squeeze to get gatus in the hiding hole but hed be out of sight and well hidden well have to get him up there before dawn so nobody sees him tammuz said if they find him you and enhedu should go somewhere safe kuri said get out of the city ill stay here with gatus no were not going enhedu said her voice decisive why would we leave our business theyd be suspicious at that it makes no difference to us who runs akkad we should tell everyone were glad korthacs taken control tammuz stared at her hed never heard such hardness in her voice we dont know how many men korthac has they may loot and rape the whole city before they go theyre not going anywhere she said still speaking with conviction korthac would have struck weeks ago if hed wanted to loot and run if they stay there will be rapes the women no place will be safe tammuz looked at her worry on his face she reached out and touched tammuzs arm so we might as well stay here i wont see you taken by those men enhedu i swear we have our knives she said if it comes to that and my old sword kuri said patting his belt they looked at each other in the dim light enhedu raised her arms and placed one hand on each mans shoulder its settled then we stay and wait for eskkar to return and we stay alive long before midnight the last of the fighting for akkad had ended korthac felt secure enough to station half his followers at the gates and let the rest get some sleep the most serious fi ghting had occurred at the barracks a few of the soldiers had managed to get their bows in play and takany had lost a dozen egyptians while almost twenty of ariamuss followers had died taking the barracks had secured the city and capturing trella had made the victory complete most of akkads soldiers had been in the wine shops and alehouses and the rest taken by surprise as important as the men the captured barracks held almost all of the soldiers weaponsthe bows swords knives and axes needed to defend the city with the barracks and eskkars house taken the remainder of the soldiers had headed for the main gate trying to rally their forces there for a time the soldiers blocked the entrances to the guard towers but without someone to lead them they had little choice but to surrender a few scrambled down the wall and escaped to the fields but korthac didnt worry about them ariamus would have men hunting them down in the morning dawn brought a new era to akkad people did not leave their houses huddling inside in fear while korthacs men roamed the streets looting the shops and random homes guzzling wine and assaulting women after letting the pillaging go on for most of the morning as a reward for his men korthac issued orders to his egyptians and they soon had the citys inhabitants and ariamuss ruffians under control the killings began just before noon all those who had insulted korthac during his stay in the city died as did those who spoke out against their new ruler the nobles and leading merchants summoned to the marketplace under threat of death to them and their families swore allegiance on their knees to korthac he promulgated a series of orders the fi rst of which instructed everyone to turn in any weapons in their possession at once all persons caught carrying or possessing a sword or bow would be put to death on the spot along with their families all persons speaking of eskkar or trella would have their tongues cut out the process of teaching eskkars citizens their new place in korthacs world had begun korthac returned to eskkars house by midafternoon tired and hungry the long night and hectic morning had wearied him but he still had one task to perform accompanied by ariamus he climbed the stairs to trellas quarters his guards moved aside as he stepped into the bedroom annoksur and trella rose from the bed as he entered annoksurs arm around trellas shoulders the room seemed hot and the smell of fear and blood lingered inside the walls you are well i hope lady trella he kept his voice pleasant and smiled at her discomfort what is it you want honorable korthac why have you whatever i want is what ill have lady trella and you will not question me again about anything you are mine now as much as akkad is mine follow me he stepped back into the outer room his men had returned the big table to its proper place and he stood next to it trella moved toward him and stopped just inside the workroom annoksur a step behind her come here kneel before your new master trella hesitated honorable korthac moving swiftly he caught trella by the hair and yanked her in front of the table he pushed her up against it then slapped her across the face you are my slave trella for as long as i choose to let you live and you will address me as lord do you understand her hand went to her cheek and she nodded yes lord annoksur stepped into the workroom but korthac whirled to face her i did not give you leave to move about he turned to ariamus kill her if she leaves the bedroom stay inside annoksur trella said dont let korthac turned back to her you do not give orders to anyone any longer he struck her again harder this time blood dripped from her mouth and she slipped to her knees as much from the blow as his order to kneel if you speak out of turn again if you fail to obey the least of my orders ill have the child cut from your body and tossed into the fire he smiled as she moved herself upright but remained on her knees for a moment he was tempted to have her pleasure him right then and there it would be fitting humiliation for her in front of a roomful of strangers but such things could wait and he felt too tired to enjoy it properly besides every day that passed would add to her embarrassment keep her in these rooms the door is to remain open she is to see no one speak to no one if she complains or gives you any trouble kill her servants in front of her one by one starting with annoksur looking down at her he noticed the thin strand of leather hanging around her neck he pulled it toward him lifting a gold coin up from between her breasts youll have no need for gold any more lady trella with a quick jerk he snapped the leather then raised the coin to his eyes it was simply a common coin one with nicars mark on it and a thin groove korthac tossed the coin to one of his men it pleased him to take it from her obviously the coin meant something special to her and now it too was gone shed learn soon enough that she had nothing was nothing he reached out and ran his fingers through trellas hair enjoying its texture gradually he tightened his grip until her head twisted upward the hair pulled back from her face her eyes wide with distress when she started to gasp from the pain he relaxed his hand then gently brushed the few loose strands from her eyes yes shed give him plenty of pleasure before he finished with her trella sat on the bed trying to think in less than a day korthac had seized akkad and established himself as the citys ruler hed killed captured or driven into hiding akkads mighty archers shed become a prisoner worse a slave only this time she had a child due in a few weeks the last word from eskkar had come three days ago informing her yet again that he intended to remain in the north a little longer her fists clenched in anger furious at her husband for taking his pleasures in bisitun while akkad and she fell into korthacs hands how dare he leave her like this he should have returned weeks ago to protect her she wanted to no she needed eskkar needed him to save her and their unborn child the thought that he might abandon them to their fate turn away from her and akkad frightened her she thought about his new woman and that image made her rage increase perhaps hed choose a fresh life with his new concubine choose to avoid a fight and continue his life in the north that image tortured her for a long moment until she regained control of her emotions no she decided eskkar would not abandon her if for no other reason than his barbarian code of honor he would return to destroy korthac for what hed done if he still lived trella shook her head without him if he were dead there would be no hope to escape the fate that korthac planned for her and the child she had to believe that he remained alive that he would come for her she could cling to that we must get word to eskkar trella whispered to annoksur seated beside her hell need to know how strong a force korthac has assembled dont forget bantor is due any day together theyll korthac isnt afraid of eskkar or bantor annoksur did you see how many men he has i counted as many as i could when they took me to the gate he must have at least a hundred and fifty maybe two hundred more than enough to control the city and stop anyone from rising up against him only eskkar can rally the people to resist assuming that hes still alive annoksur said he has to be alive or were all lost trella said besides how could they kill him up in bisitun guarded by grond and surrounded by his men both korthac and ariamus said eskkar is dead do you believe them they offered no proof her own question made trella stop and think proof would be eskkars head or a dozen witnesses to his death she took her time trying to recall the egyptians exact words and comparing them to those shed overheard from the boasting ariamus korthac had claimed his men had struck down eskkar in bisituns lanes but ariamus said eskkar and his men had been killed in a fight the slight difference might not mean much but she needed something to give her hope korthac knows bantor is returning trella said her mind beginning to think clearly once again ariamus has taken every horse he could find and ridden south theyll meet bantors men on the road long before they arrive here bantor has plenty of men trained men they wont be easy to defeat trella shook her head no korthac must have some plan in mind if bantors force is defeated even driven off korthac can turn his full attention to the north hes defeating eskkars forces piece by piece thats his plan she reached out and took annoksurs hand i fear for your husband ariamus will find killing bantor harder than he thinks bantor hates the man since from the old days when he was captain of the guard she put her arm around trella and eskkar isnt easy to stop either i wanted eskkar back here but now its better that he remains up north he might be safer there both women stayed silent for a moment their hopes for survival depended on their husbands living long enough to rescue them is there anything we can do trella i mean can we kill korthac somehow even if we could his egyptians would cut us to pieces then slaughter half the city and i saw his face hell use any pretext to beat me but hes looking for an excuse to kill you to keep me in fear of him you must not give him any reason no matter what he does to me keep still dont provoke him i need you to stay alive promise me that you know what hell do to you hell want to show everyone in akkad that you belong to him now that youre nothing more than his slave trella touched her swollen face still feeling the sting in her cheek from where korthac struck her whatever korthac wants well do we need to stay alive at least for now in a few days if we find everything is hopeless then ill try to kill him hell use the child to control you the child will have to die i know that hell want no reminder of eskkar or me left alive she shook her head at the thought ill kill the babe myself if it comes to that trella reached out and took annoksurs hand youll die as well he surely knows what role you played in gathering information as soon as he thinks hes secure then well no longer be needed trella shrugged i have the birthing knife trella if it comes to that though i prefer trying to slit his throat with it during the confusion trella had seen annoksur slip the small knife inside the lamp but the tiny implement a special gift from drusala and meant to be used to cut the umbilical cord had a blade no longer than trellas finger its not much of a weapon against korthac trella said although it may serve to end our own lives keep the knife safe annoksur we may have to use it on ourselves until that day we obey our new master we must stay alive for the childs sake if nothing else and to give eskkar time to gather his forces as long as we obey korthac instantly as long as he thinks were of use to him hell keep us alive for a little while longer so we grovel before this egyptian we grovel annoksur out of habit trella reached for the coin that shed worn around her neck since eskkar first gave it to her her freedom coin hed called it now it was gone given to another as vanished as her freedom we grovel and we wait ariamus had hidden his sixtythree horsemen in a tiny fold of ground a little more than one hundred paces from the trail bantors men were following back to akkad ariamus had galloped his horse that far himself and knew his horsemen could cover that distance in moments long before his victims could dismount and string their bows horse to horse his charging men on fresh mounts would have the advantage the low crest of the rise concealed fifty of ariamuss men abreast and the remainder formed a smaller group behind the main line he had twenty hardbitten fi ghters scattered among them most of these hed recruited himself though korthac had added half a dozen of his egyptians probably with instructions to keep an eye on their commander chewing his lip ariamus waited for the single scout who tracked the approaching column theyd sighted bantors men hours ago and theyd be here soon everything would work against the akkadianstheir horses would be tired from a long days ride they would be traveling uphill and they expected to reach akkads gates and safety in a few more hours ariamus knew the akkadians had shadowed the retreating alur meriki for over a month that mission completed bantor and his soldiers were returning in high spirits to their women plenty of ale and a chance to sleep in their own beds the last thing on their minds would be an ambush so close to home he grinned at the thought instead of safety the returning soldiers would die right here and it would be ariamuss men who would ride through the open gates of akkad korthac had planned everything with care ariamus admitted though he hated to give the man so much credit ariamus and his men had done well in last nights battle capturing the river gate with a minimum of fighting just as important hed seized the boats docked there with no loss of cargo and no vessels escaping up or down the tigris with both the river and the local roads under korthacs control at least a few days would pass before the countryside learned what had taken place in akkad the only thing that could have gone better was if takany had managed to get himself killed ariamus had craftily made sure the thickheaded egyptian led the fight at the barracks where the heaviest fighting would occur but the man had survived without even a scratch you did well ariamus korthac had said afterward grunting his approval at his newest subcommanders efficiency now take your men and destroy the akkadians returning from the south then you will have your reward relishing the praise ariamus had bowed politely gathered his men and departed as eager as korthac to finish off the returning soldiers he and his men camped for the night a few miles ride from the city and ariamus sent out scouts to look for the approaching akkadians a successful ambush of bantor and his troops would ensure korthacs confi dence and earn ariamus an even bigger share of the loot waiting back in akkad the moment to earn that reward had arrived the men from akkad marched unsuspectingly toward their fate in a few moments ariamus would destroy bantors soldiers leaving no organized force to rally support against korthac the handful of men eskkar had with him up at bisitun would be no problem to defeat ariamus knew he could raise recruit and train an equal number in the week or ten days it would take for eskkar to reach akkad and with any bit of luck the barbarian would already be dead struck down by korthacs assassins as soon as ariamus returned to akkad with the news of bantors destruction korthacs rule would be secure the egyptian would proclaim himself sovereign of the city and ariamus would stand at his side with enough men to guard the walls no power could force them out assuming ariamus could keep his men under control he reminded himself hed readied his men for the ambush more than an hour ago even after yesterdays success in akkad many of the men looked nervous and he saw fear on the faces of more than one the sooner he got them into battle the better he wished hed had a few more weeks to train them but korthac wouldnt wait news of bantors approach had forced korthac to move a little earlier than he planned the city had to be taken the day before bantor arrived so far everything had gone exactly as the wily egyptian had planned ariamus heard his men talking again their voices quickly rising and threatening the whole plan they kept testing his patience shifting their feet they whispered to their neighbors and boasted about what they would do in the coming battle his hand twitched at his sword and he resisted the temptation to kill one as a lesson halftrained and lacking discipline they might be but hed worked with worse and right now he needed all of them demons take you all he said keep silent gritting his teeth at the fools who couldnt keep still he walked back and forth along the line hand on his sword urging them to stay ready shut their mouths and look to their mounts not that ariamus cared how much his men twitched and worried but he didnt want the horses picking up their riders fears and getting spooked two days ago hed had to kill a slowwitted fool who disobeyed him once too often and hopefully that memory remained fresh in their minds just so long as they followed orders ariamus didnt care how much they feared the enemy as long as they feared him more nevertheless most of these bandits had little experience in attacking battlehardened men fresh from akkads capture they now fancied themselves fearsome fighters almost all had seen some fighting or raided enough farms and small caravans to convince themselves of their bravery but ariamus knew they could never stand against the alur meriki even facing the soldiers from akkad most of this rabble would be dead in moments still ariamus had more than enough men to do the job and if he could surprise bantor the combination would guarantee victory the mens talking grew louder and ariamus turned to see his scout trotting toward them at least the man one of korthacs subcommanders had remembered his orders to raise no dust trail and to make sure he wasnt seen ariamus turned back toward his stillmumbling men and again put his hand on his sword they fell silent under his glare the sooner the attack got under way the better well nebibi are they coming speaking in the language of the egyptian ariamus didnt even wait for the man to dismount yes ariamus theyre but moments behind me their horses look weary and they suspect nothing all ride with bows slung youre sure no scouts out to the front or flanks none nebibi replied only a rear guard of three men theyre trailing a good distance behind the column but thats all ariamus grunted in relief if he and his men had been spotted korthac had warned him not to challenge the akkadians bows if ariamus couldnt smash them before they could bring their bows into play he would have to return to akkad and get more men good work nebibi return to your men and make sure they know what to do try to keep the fools quiet nebibi had charge of onethird of the men rihat ariamuss other subcommander commanded another third rihat ariamus called out to his other commander now speaking in their native tongue get the men ready theyre almost here ariamus walked up and down the line one last time looking each man in the eye and making sure each knew his orders the veterans spread throughout the line would steady the fools and urge them onward they lined up the horses almost shoulder to shoulder with the men standing beside them waiting ariamus could still hear some men whispering he swore to himself but said nothing anything he did now might spook the horses even more than his mens talk besides the beasts appeared to have grown used to the incessant chatter nevertheless now was not the time to take chances nebibi rihat i want absolute silence kill the next man who opens his mouth both subcommanders drew their swords and ariamus nodded in satisfaction remember men well be watching you any man who breaks too soon or disobeys orders dies on the spot now mount up and ready your weapons their smiles disappeared and silence came at last over the group he smiled in approval at their fear that fear would drive them forward which was all he wanted destroying bantors force meant everything and he would take any casualties to accomplish that end low sounds of men and horses rippled up and down the line for a few moments before stillness again fell over the group ariamus scanned the line one last timemen horses and weaponsthey were ready ariamus climbed the low rise lying flat on the ground to make sure he wouldnt be seen as he peered through the tall grass the path bantor followed remained empty in front of him no other travelers or dust trails in sight in either direction he turned his gaze to the south and waited he checked the suns progress and cursed at his enemys slow approach dusk would be on them in little more than an hour at last the head of the column appeared as if rising slowly out of the ground the akkadians walked their horses two abreast the men relaxed talking to each other their bows slung across their backs they would be tired hungry and thirsty no doubt all of them looked forward to an evening of food and ale in akkad behind him he heard the faint whispers of his subcommanders as they kept the men in check each man attending to his beast making sure it didnt whinny at the scent or sound of the approaching horses and men no wind blew and even the occasional breeze came from the south he counted the men as they appeared and ended at fortysix with three more for the rear guard ariamus knew that fiftythree men had gone south with that fool bantor weeks ago the missing soldiers had probably returned to akkad earlier or even more likely deserted he could hear the akkadians now the horses plodding along ariamus wanted to return to his horse but he didnt want to move until the very last moment to make sure none of his men charged out before the column reached the spot directly in front of them ariamus waited those last few moments then slipped backward down the hill before rising to his feet and walking calmly to his horse he jerked the halter free and swung onto the animals back the whole line began to move a little back and forth and the animals started pawing the earth and snorting but it no longer mattered ariamus tightened his knees on his horses back attack he shouted and the whole line of his fighters burst into motion in an instant they raced up over the top of the rise and charged at the startled column of men in front of them bantor rode with klexor at the head of the column while alexar another leader of ten rode behind the column with the rear guard bantor felt as weary and thirsty as his horse earlier in the day everyone had spoken of getting home women warm beds hot food and thick ale but near days end the men rode mostly in silence keeping their thoughts to themselves if akkad werent only a few more hours ahead theyd be making camp right now tomorrow theyd get their pay and each man would have plenty of silver in his pouch the taverns would be full of cheap wine and smiling women all glad to welcome back their men theyd been away for five weeks shadowing a still dangerous and much larger force of warriors and in all those days they had never relaxed their guard until today now close to home they rode easy the two lead horses lifted their heads at the same time ears twitching as they rolled their eyes to the left bantors eyes followed those of his horse just as a burst of sound rolled toward them a force of screaming men arose from what had appeared to be level ground to their left racing their horses toward the column flashing swords in their hands the ground shook from the thudding hooves that threw clods of dirt and grass high into the air for a single moment every man froze the sudden appearance of the attackers a complete surprise bantor felt the fear rising in his chest dismount string your bows he heard klexor echoing the same orders as both men pulled their horses around to face their attackers form a line several horses reared up in terror other soldiers began shouting and already the attacking warriors had covered half the open ground bantor saw that not all the activity was panic even as theyd watched the southerly progress of the retreating alur meriki these akkadians had trained for such an attack by their enemy the men seeing the oncoming danger had reacted without hesitation they flung themselves from their horses and moved to string their bows in a rush of action all of their weeks and months of training had told them one thing over and over they could not defeat the alur meriki on horseback so they had been trained to dismount ready their weapons and band together bantor leapt down from his horse then smacked the animals rump with the flat of his sword sending the animal lumbering toward the oncoming riders all the other riderless horses began to mill around scattering in different directions some of them racing toward the attackers their movements slowed the oncoming riders a bit as the bandits shifted their course to avoid the frantic animals even so only a handful of bantors men managed to launch an arrow before the wave of bandits struck them bantor waited with dread for the killing flight of arrows from the alur meriki bows but the arrows never came instead the attackers arrived in a thunder of hooves that shook the earth a terrifying sound to those facing it on foot swords slashed downward at bantors men some still struggling to string their bows others drawing swords screams of the wounded mingled with the war cries of the attackers nevertheless the akkadians had no time to ready themselves and the attackers cut their way through bantors men some of the soldiers threw themselves to the ground trying to avoid the swords that flashed down at them with nothing to slow them down no line of men on horseback to impede their attack most of the bandits galloped right through what remained of the column swinging their swords at anything man or beast within reach some of the attacking horses jumped over the prone akkadians following their animal instinct to avoid stepping on anything that moved not all of the soldiers managed to get flat to the ground and many took blows from slashing swords or found themselves crushed under the horses hooves for the first time bantor realized he didnt face alur meriki horsemen as he flung himself facedown on the grass he saw his attackers rode more like bandits not barbarian warriors from the steppes a man wielding a sword on a galloping horse cannot reach down far enough to strike at anyone lying on the ground barbarians carried lances to take care of that very problem a trained rider could thrust the lance down to kill someone crouching or even lying prone or hurl it at someone hugging the earth these attackers carried neither lance nor bows and some of bantors men escaped without a scratch though fewer than half struggled to their feet after the wave of riders smashed through them bantors left shoulder burned in agony a flying hoof had landed on him and he wondered if his arm had been crushed ignoring the pain he pushed himself to his feet fumbling for his sword with his good hand form a line on me hurry before they turn hurry it took the attackers time to slow their horses and turn them around expecting to ride back and deliver the killing blow but the very speed of their charge had carried them another sixty or seventy paces past the shattered column before the first man could goad his horse back toward the akkadians for a second attack an arrow reached out and struck him in the chest then another and another hold bantor shouted as the survivors rushed together lining up to face their attackers draw aim he waited until every man had drawn his shaft to his ear loose as the bandits finished turning their horses and began their second charge twenty arrows flew into their ranks man and beast went down both screaming in pain and the second charge slowed less than three seconds later another wave of arrows struck and now some of the bandits had no thought but to get away from these deadly archers the brave few men who kept riding toward the archers died killed in the third wave delivered at less than twenty paces the shafts striking with enough force at that distance to stop even a horse in its tracks horses and men flopped on the ground between the two forces and the scattered dead and dying prevented a quick assault on the line of bowmen again bantor directed the mens fire and another wave of arrows landed in the midst of a group trying to rally for another attack the attackers turned away urging their horses to either side of the bowmen still within range more horses and men died before the last of the bandits galloped to safety bantor had seen broken men flee before and guessed that these attackers wouldnt be back not for some time at least he cursed at their backs and flung his sword down into the earth before sinking to his knees the whole fight had lasted but moments from beginning to end but more than half of bantors men had died and his horses scattered over the countryside when klexor reached his side he found his leader wincing in pain and muttering one word over and over ariamus it took more than half a mile before ariamus and his subcommanders managed to halt and regroup their men some of them had bolted for akkad others just raced in any direction anxious to get away from the great arrows that buzzed like bees about their heads striking down their companions they circled about trying to regroup and ariamus finally brought them together dismount he shouted get down off those horses some refused still frightened of the akkadian bowmen most kept glancing back toward the place of ambush theyve no horses to follow us you fools he bellowed what are you a bunch of cowards to run from half your number nebibi rihat bring the men together kill anyone who disobeys ariamus took a quick count of his riders then slapped his hand upon his leg so hard his horse jumped in surprise ariamus had struck bantors line with over sixty men losing only one or two to arrows before they clashed and ariamus doubted if hed lost a man as they rode through them one more charge would have finished the job now ariamus counted less than forty men and these looked so shaken up he doubted he could drive them back for another attack he had lost an equal number of horses but had more than recouped that loss since almost all of bantors horses had trotted after his own animals he stopped cursing at his men dismounted and squatted down on the ground to think things over nebibi and rihat joining him the rest of the men began to breathe a little easier relaxing enough to lick their wounds or to tell their companions how bravely they had fought we killed most of them rihat offered and weve got almost all of their horses were not here to steal horses you fool you should ariamus took a deep breath it wouldnt help to shout at his underling and the man was right they had killed most of bantors men how many do you think were left alive rihat closed his eyes the better to think about what he had seen twenty maybe less not more than that ariamus had made the same guess so hed killed more than half of bantors men perhaps some of the survivors had taken wounds damn bantor ariamus had planned well but he hadnt expected to find himself in this situation with only half a victory what would he tell korthac how could ariamus explain that hed left twenty akkadians alive when he had over twice that number still fit to fight exactly how many men did we lose rihat rihat shrugged then got up and began a detailed count it took some time before he came back and sat down on the grass weve fortyone men left not counting us two are wounded but not too badly they can still ride only two men wounded but more than twenty dead or missing the numbers didnt improve his mood those arrows had struck with such force and at close range the shafts struck hard enough to knock a man off his mount he doubted any of his men whod lost their horses or gotten wounded survived the akkadians arrows would have finished any survivors by now ariamus had lost about as many men as he had killed not that he cared about his losses with korthacs gold they could always recruit more men more important bantors men had been soldiers men trained to fight and not so easy to replace the horses couldnt be easily restocked either ariamus had to scour the western lands to get the mounts he had acquired on foot the akkadians wouldnt be much of a threat ariamus remembered seeing bantor go down under hooves and didnt recall seeing him get up he recalled bantor as a slowwitted fool anyway and once again ariamus wondered what eskkar had seen in the man nevertheless eskkars stupidity was ariamuss good fortune hed broken bantors men and left them on foot their bows would be useless against the walls of akkad and from those walls korthac and his men would have their own bows no the situation looked less bleak the more he thought about it at least it would have to sound that way when he reported to korthac ariamus had promised the man he would destroy all the akkadians not just half of them he started thinking about what he would say to the new ruler of akkad even more important ariamus didnt dare lose any more men without a sizable force reporting to him takany would overshadow him and ariamus as leader of the horsemen would lose whatever influence he had with korthac no ariamus decided hed already lost more men than hed expected any more would be disastrous even if he survived another attack himself we must go back and finish them ariamus nebibi interrupted ariamuss thoughts korthac said we should korthac isnt here nebibi ariamus cut him off do you want to charge again against those bowmen nebibis face told him the answer the egyptian had plenty of courage but they both knew what kind of men they led weve no bows nebibi ariamus began lowering his voice and speaking now in the language of egypt even if we could drive this lot back for another attack even if we succeed well lose too many of our own doing it and remember those archers will be targeting anyone urging the men to the attack nebibi opened his mouth then closed it the man might fear korthacs wrath but nebibi had never seen arrows such as those knocking horses to their knees weve done what we set out to do nebibi weve smashed bantors force the few that survived that escaped lets say less than a dozen are masterless men now and helpless korthac will be pleased when he receives our report nebibi thought it over no doubt trying to balance the danger of shading the truth to korthac compared to facing bantors men again at last he nodded uneasily yes ariamus only a few escaped us less than a dozen korthac will be pleased ariamus smiled in satisfaction then turned to rihat close up the men moments later the whole force of bandits clustered around their commander men we have won a great victory we have broken our enemies and left less than a dozen alive most of them wounded and without horses you have done well to fight so bravely that raised a ragged cheer from his fighters though some of them wondered how they could be cowards and fools one moment then heroes the next now we return to akkad we will join up with korthacs men and enjoy the city we took yesterday the gold the women the horses all the best of akkad will be ours they cheered again as they realized the fighting had ended he saw the smiles on their faces and knew their confidence had returned that they once again considered themselves ferocious fighters so long as they didnt have to face those archers again that would be how he explained it to korthac nebibi would support the story or have to admit to his own failure besides a few men on the loose scattered over the countryside wouldnt matter anyway theyd round them up in a few days back to akkad ariamus shouted as he climbed on his horse back to akkad and our gold another cheer louder this time went up nebibi looked at ariamus and nodded acquiescence tightlipped their report would satisfy korthac at least for now by the time the three trailing scouts reached the column the fight had ended bantor back on his feet shook with rage swearing torture and death to ariamus half the men had never heard the name before take it easy bantor klexor said trying to calm his captain down lets take a look at your shoulder alexar walked up carrying a water skin they took us by surprise but we drove them off and killed more of them than we lost he and the other two men acting as rear guard had rushed forward as soon as they saw the ambush but none of the attackers had passed within a hundred paces of him alexar managed to dismount and tie his horse to a bush hed been one of the first to fire as the men rode past the ambush left everyone with a raging thirst and they drank the remainder of their water with no thought to save any for later they couldnt carry it far on foot anyway anyone know who they were alexar tossed away the nowempty water skin they werent alur meriki or wed all be dead by now if they were alur meriki klexor offered they wouldve finished us off with lances the barbarian way instead of riding through us like a bunch of old women who cant control their horses their leader was ariamus the former captain of the guard in orak bantor said staring at the ground he tested his shoulder moving his arm carefully it didnt hurt quite as much perhaps the bone hadnt broken after all bantor took a deep breath still struggling to control his emotions the coward ariamus ran off when he learned the barbarians were coming to akkad and thats when eskkar took command of the village bantor left unsaid that a few months before his departure ariamus had sent bantor out on a patrol then summoned annoksur to his bed for an afternoon of pleasure annoksur had never spoken about it but bantor had heard whispers of it from the men short of stabbing ariamus in the back and so forfeiting his own life for killing his superior bantor could do nothing so hed swallowed his pride and pretended ignorance he knew annoksur had not gone willingly but to protect her husband and daughter flexing his arm bantor couldnt remember a time in the last few months when he wasnt recovering from one wound or another well whoever they were they headed off toward akkad alexar replied so they must be sure of being able to enter the city they cant enter akkad not that many of them and not carrying weapons bantor answered trying to understand what had happened no large force of armed men could get into akkad unless could they have taken the city klexor asked his mind going down the same path as his commanders they must have captured akkad bantor said they knew we were coming and didnt want us reaching the gates forty or so bandits isnt enough to take akkad klexor offered they must have more men inside the city as well so they ambush us just before we reach akkad alexar said before we learn whats happened to the city that made sense bantor decided take the city then take the soldiers piecemeal he wondered if eskkars force to the north might be next if they hadnt already been crushed damn the demons below bantor swore we cant just walk up to the gates and ask what the hell is going on these bandits may have had enough fighters to capture akkad from within well what are we going to do klexor sounded worried if this ariamus has captured akkad he may come back with more men we cant just stay here a good question bantor thought and he didnt know what to answer what would eskkar do he wondered eskkar always knew what to do on a battlefield bantor thought about that for a while how many horses and men do we have he asked abruptly alexar had already taken the count counting us weve twentyfive men six of them wounded and seven horses he glanced at the soldiers gathered around their leaders the men looked alert some tended to the wounded while others salvaged what they could from their dead companions or the bandits we may get a few more horses if were lucky but darkness is coming on bantor thought that over he took longer to work things out than some of his men but hed survived plenty of fights one thing he knew for certain he didnt have enough information to decide what to do if he picked the wrong course of action they might all be dead by noon tomorrow so he would get information first he looked up to find his men watching him waiting for him to speak heres what well do alexar take the four best horses and one other rider start north for bisitun at once weve got to make sure eskkar and sisuthros know what is happening get far enough away from here before you rest for the night then keep going as fast as you can changing mounts as often as you can ride the horses until they drop if you have to you should be able to get to bisitun in five or six days maybe less with two horses for each man tell eskkar whats happened and that it was ariamus who led the attackers make sure you remember that name ariamus take anything you need for the trip he waited until alexar nodded understanding then bantor turned to his other commander klexor put the wounded on the other three horses and send them south back the way we came we passed some farmhouses a few miles back maybe they can hide there until they recover and the rest of us where are we going klexor asked bantor shifted his shoulder wincing at the pain but he could move it hed have to hope it mended itself in a few days we are going to take what we can carry and head north ourselves as if we were heading for bisitun as well well walk all night and tomorrow morning then well cut over to the river if any follow us theyll think weve crossed over to the west bank well see if we can find some boats to take us south back to akkad back to akkad klexor questioned what can less than twenty do against the city nothing dont worry we wont be going into akkad just to the farms north of the city rebbas farm thats where well go he has a jetty on the river and plenty of room to hide twice as many men he can tell us what the hell is going on bantor turned back to alexar tell eskkar thats where well be and to get word to us at rebbas farm get ready to move out they all picked up their weapons gathering up all the spare arrows they could carry alexar picked a young archer to ride with him a man no taller than a boy departed on the four strongest horses and started moving north at an easy canter a few minutes later the injured started south walking their horses to ease the wounded the rest of the men closed in around bantor waiting for the order to move out klexor broke the silence why didnt this ariamus come back to fi nish us off the others moved in closer eager to hear their commanders words because the coward knew wed kill most of his men before they overran us bantor pulled his sword from the earth knocked the dirt off and returned it to its sheath he didnt like admitting defeat or that ariamus had still enough men to finish the job but i know one thing im going to kill him myself if its the last thing i do im going to rip his heart right out of his chest no one said anything and bantor went on talking as much to himself as his men well have to wait at least until eskkar gets word about whats happened if we can join our force with his well have enough men to face ariamus and i can spread his guts in the sun the men looked at each other bantor rarely spoke with such passion but all could see that hatred and a desire for revenge possessed the man just as they could hear it in his voice they too wanted their revenge ambushed like raw recruits theyd seen their friends and fellow soldiers killed worse their dead would have to lie unburied while their comrades fled for their lives hands tightened on sword hilts and bows counting bantor they numbered seventeen they looked at each other the fight wasnt over for these men the battle had just begun bantor looked up at the descending sun slipping halfway below the horizon it would be dark soon he had thought theyd all be drinking in a tavern by then all right men get what you need and lets go weve a long walk tonight ignoring the pain in his shoulder he picked up a bow and a full quiver and started north once the moon rose they had enough light to make out the flat terrain bantor drove the men hard all night theyd alternated between jogging and walking and the threat of ariamus and his horsemen not only drove them onward it kept them looking over their shoulders except for an occasional farmhouse they saw little twice they stopped at a farmers well for water the first time they went unnoticed but at the second the dogs awoke everyone with their barking and bantor had to order the family back into their house warning them to say nothing to anyone by the time he gave the order to halt only a few hours remained before dawn exhausted sorefooted and hungry the men had covered twenty miles and reached the trail that led north to bisitun everyone fell asleep in moments falling to the earth without regard to comfort when the sun woke them no one felt rested theyd slept only long enough to sustain them the road posed even greater danger travelers and traders would be coming along some on horseback and it wouldnt be long before word of their passage got back to akkad even more worrisome ariamus might send any number of riders up the road to prevent their escape to the north bantor determined not to lose a moment as soon as he started walking the pain in his shoulder returned sleeping on the hard ground hadnt helped the brief rest had stiffened it and each step made him wince in pain the soreness seemed worse than the day before klexor examined him and declared that nothing seemed broken and for that small comfort bantor gave thanks by midmorning theyd walked and jogged another ten miles and every tired step took them farther from akkad they began to encounter travelers most heading in the opposite direction toward akkad and all of them on foot shouldnt we warn them there might be danger in akkad klexor asked the first time they passed some travelers heading toward the city if we do theyll spread the word and soon half the countryside will know were heading north theyll have to take their chances at akkad otherwise any scouts ariamus has in the area will know weve passed this way they may mention us anyway when they arrive or they may forget all about us in the excitement bantor had anticipated this during the nights walk more important hed learned from eskkar the need to appear confident before the men even when uncertainty gripped your insides besides it will take them hours to reach akkad maybe even until sunset well cover a lot of ground before then bantor turned to face klexor tell the men to say nothing to anyone we pass not a word klexor grunted and began to pass the word down the line not that anyone wanted to speak to them anyway bantor decided he and his heavily armed men looked gaunt dirty and dangerous and the few wayfarers they encountered shrank aside staring openmouthed and with fear in their eyes as the soldiers strode past in silence they rested every hour all of them trying to ignore the pangs of hunger that rumbled in their bellies just before noon bantor gave the order to halt the men sank to the ground too tired to complain about their hunger klexor were about thirty miles north of akkad bantor wiped the sweat from his face as his men grouped themselves around their leaders its time to cut over to the river i know a farm that has some boats well wait until the road is clear then well move west were nearly halfway to dilgarth we could be there by early morning if we push hard id like to klexor but we dont know what might be waiting for us in dilgarth and even if we made it there wed never be able to get back to akkad bantor shook his head no i think the river is safer for us we can find something to eat at the farm too if things are really bad we may be safer on the other side of the tigris anyway klexor shrugged but didnt have anything better to offer then lets get off the road now while its clear one by one they slipped off the dusty trail leaving as little trace of their presence as possible they stumbled along as best they could on the uneven terrain until theyd passed well out of sight of anyone traveling on the road they covered the last stretch to the river at a slow walk the only pace they could manage when they cleared a low hill and saw the farmhouse ahead nestling a stones throw from the river bantor felt close to exhaustion the pain from his shoulder combined with the unfamiliar effort of walking had tired him more than he would have expected his men looked no better and he decided hed made the right choice traveling on the road they would never have reached dilgarth before riders caught up with them spreading his men out to avoid leaving tracks they stepped down into the nearest irrigation ditch and splashed along its winding course down to the river the farm a large one with several separate buildings surrounded by fields of wheat and barley belonged to a man named hargar children playing under a tree noticed them approaching and ran to warn the adults the family barricaded themselves inside the main building bantor knew the appearance of so many armed men would frighten any farmer when they reached the sheep pen bantor climbed out of the ditch wait here he told the men klexor come with me the two men walked side by side to the house ho hargar no need to hide in your cellar its bantor commander at akkad and we need your help nothing happened so bantor and klexor sat in the dirt under a fruit tree in front of the main house a few paces from the door bantor leaned gratefully against the tree and hoped nobody in the house decided to launch an arrow at him after a long moment they heard shuffling at the door and a young man stuck his head out and stared at them eyes wide and mouth open who are you bantor called out im hargars son hannis my father has gone to dilgarth to sell a goat is it really you bantor his voice sounded fearful but he stepped outside and slowly approached the men sitting on the ground by the gods it is you what are you doing here why did you approach through the ditches its a long story hannis but somethings gone wrong at akkad have you heard any news from there no no ones gone to market in over a week hannis said still looking nervous at the sight of the rest of bantors men well we need your help if we wanted to slit your throats youd all be dead by now i need food and drink for my men bantor reached into his pouch and took out the last of his silver coins knowing your father i suppose ill have to pay for it he tossed the coins to hannis give these to hargar when he returns an hour later bantor and all his men full of food and a few mouthfuls of ale had fallen asleep behind a storehouse nestled next to the river klexor stood watch as much to make sure no one left the farm as to guard against anyone approaching a little before sundown bantor and his men ate again filling themselves on bread cheese and several tasteless sausages hargar had been planning to sell in the market at akkad were taking your boats hannis bantor said dont bother complaining youll be paid when things settle down in akkad and if they dont settle down then ill be out two boats hannis answered cant you pay me now bantor smiled youve learned your fathers ways i would if i could but youve already got the last of my silver besides youll probably get the boats back anyway where are you going were going upriver to dilgarth its better than walking and theres no place nearby where well find enough horses whats going on in dilgarth has eskkar returned from the north bantor took the last piece of bread from the platter and stood stay away from both akkad and dilgarth for at least a week and hannis make sure no one in your family says anything about us being here or taking the boats or ill come back and take that silver out of your hides youll wish the alur meriki had returned if i find youve told anyone we were here or where were going do you understand bantor walked away without waiting for a reply at the river two boats bobbed in the water tied to posts sunk into the bank one was little more than a skiff and used as much for working in the irrigation ditches as on the river the other craft was larger and sturdy enough to ferry crops and animals to the markets in akkad four of bantors men knew about boats and he told them to take charge they emptied the vessel of ballast and positioned the men with care seventeen men could barely squeeze aboard and both boats rode dangerously low in the water even bantor could see it wouldnt take much to capsize them the sun had just gone down when they pushed off heading north without a breeze they didnt bother to raise the tiny sail on the larger craft powering the overloaded boats upstream took plenty of muscle and the men handed off the small paddles to one another whenever they tired they paddled until well away from the farm only when the darkness of night covered everything did bantor order them to turn toward the shore satisfied no one could see them if anyone came to the farm and put a knife to hanniss throat the farmer could honestly say that bantor had gone north up the river they rested watching the stars appear before turning the boats around and heading back toward akkad with four men working the oars the paddling went easier downstream and they made better time bantor wanted to go faster but the boatmen refused to speed up afraid of a spill in the darkness in an overweighted boat paddled by clumsy oarsmen most of the men sat immobile afraid to move no one wanted to go for a swim in the river at night with a good chance of drowning in the bargain bantor watched the shoreline and soon the dark outlines of hargars farmhouse slid past he saw no one and anyone watching the river would have to be standing at the edge of the riverbank to notice the vessels silent passing the moon rose climbed and began to fall as they made their way down the tigris bantor guessed they still had another hour or so before dawn when the boatman called out that they were approaching akkad bantor couldnt see anything except the river glinting in the moonlight no lights showed anywhere along the river he knew all the farmers would be fast asleep thriftily saving their oil and candles torches would be burning in akkad but bantor knew they would have to be farther downriver to see those the boat edged closer to the eastern shore though he couldnt make out anything and had no idea what landmarks the boatmen recognized though hed lived near akkad all his life the river remained a mystery to him bantor flinched when the bottom grated on the sand then thumped against a small wooden jetty protruding a few feet into the river in the faint moonlight he could see another boat tied up there as well the boatmen swung onto the jetty and secured the boats fast the men disembarked one at a time taking care not to swamp the listing riverboats bantor climbed ashore last breathing thanks to the gods that he his men and their weapons stood on solid earth again the soldiers moved inland stringing their bows as they went noble rebbas farm a combination of houses and corrals lay a few hundred paces from the river they stopped a good distance from the nearest house crouching down behind an irrigation ditch the farm one of several that noble rebba owned was a rich one and he had both dogs and men to protect his herds and crops from petty thieves and robbers it would be too dangerous to approach at night bantor decided to wait there until dawn he told the men to take what rest they could but to keep their bows strung and at the ready for any confrontation when the suns first rays crossed the horizon bantor advanced toward the farmhouse he had grown up on a farm much smaller than this one of course but he remembered the ways of dogs and animals so he headed first to the path that led to akkad then followed that toward the main house a dog barked joined at once by another and bantor saw two men step into the sunlight in front of the main house they looked at him in surprise as he approached and in a moment a third man appeared carrying swords that he handed to the others bantor knew he looked like a bandit in his ripped and tattered garment that showed the mud of the river the dogs surrounded him growling and sniffing but one of the men called them off and bantor walked right up to the door where is noble rebba master of the house i am bantor commander of the guard of akkad rebba appeared at the door an old man already past his sixtieth season he had long white hair that flowed past his shoulders his wits remained sharp despite his years however and rebba looked keenly at bantor then stepped closer as if to make sure his tired eyes had seen correctly so it is you you look very well for a dead man he smiled at bantors reaction come in inside the main house two frightened women and three small girls with big eyes huddled together they stared at bantor for a few moments before resuming their preparations for the morning meal bantor frowned at them and rebba interpreted the glance adana take miriani and the girls outside with the women gone bantor examined the main room hand on the hilt of his sword then moved to the other rooms looking inside to make sure they were empty satisfied he went back to the doorway and checked that all of rebbas people had moved out of earshot before turning back to the old noble well rebba can you tell me what is going on on my way to akkad yesterday my men were attacked by a group of bandits they were led by ariamus you remember that coward im sure bandits well i wouldnt call them bandits exactly rebba said with a grim laugh and ariamus hes one of the new rulers of akkad not too long ago such words would have infuriated bantor but too many men had died in the siege and death had brushed by him too many times to worry him now is he so who else rules in akkad something in bantors tone gave rebba pause until he remembered that this man had been away trailing the barbarians for more than a month who else but korthac rebba noted the puzzled look ah yes thats right korthac arrived after you left for the south he claims hes a merchant a trader but he has the look of a soldier about him he arrived about six weeks ago just after eskkar headed north korthac comes from the distant west possibly even from the land of egypt hes taken control of akkad it seems that trellas spies failed to uncover the plot and when did all this happen right now bantor had no interest in anyones spies two nights ago just after sunset ariamus rode up to the river gate from the south korthac had men waiting inside near the gate with weapons hidden in bundles they killed the gatekeepers and captured the gate without anyone raising the alarm ariamus and more than a hundred men ran in uncontested joining with korthacs egyptians they attacked the barracks and caught many of the soldiers asleep at the same time they overpowered trellas guards and seized her house by now korthac has at least a hundred and fifty bandits and thieves in his service with more swearing allegiance to him every day hes paying well for men willing to follow orders and killing anyone who disobeys his commands only a hundred and fifty bantor exclaimed there are more than three thousand people in akkad surely they wont submit to this korthac and a few bandits most of the soldiers are dead or captured bantor a few may be in hiding anyone who speaks out or even raises his eyes is killed korthac holds trella prisoner in her own house korthacs house now i suppose i dont know what happened to gatus my grandson brought word of all this last night along with a midmorning summons for me all the big farm holders are ordered to come into akkad today to meet with our new master korthac will you still go of course i must go i was getting ready to leave when you arrived i want to get there early to see nicar first and find out what he thinks hell know more of what is happening rebba looked closely at his visitor who stood there looking blindsided at all these happenings are you alone the question brought bantor back to the present no im not alone i have sixteen men with me and theyre all looking for vengeance so go to the city rebba and talk to nicar but dont tell anyone were here not even nicar not if you want to keep your family alive he fingered his sword ariamus will die and any that stand with him ive sent word to eskkar he will be here in a few days with his seventy men well brush aside this korthac like a fly they say eskkars dead and his men butchered even if hes alive hell be outside the walls the same walls that just held off thousands of barbarians bantor laughed throwing his head back but the sound had a trace of danger in it eskkars not easy to kill besides do you think the wall will stop him he smiled grimly at the old nobles reaction tell me who would you rather have as your enemy eskkar or this korthac do you really think these bandits will stand up to eskkars soldiers didnt these bandits kill most of your men rebba countered we were ambushed by sixty or seventy men caught by surprise on tired horses even so we killed more of them than we lost we drove them away rebba they ran from us remember that thats not how ariamus described the battle rebba sighed anyway many in akkad have no love for eskkar and trella the noble paused considering his words but many more will follow him thats true enough if hes still alive he sat down on a stool let me think a moment bantor bided his time gripping his sword hilt and staring at the master farmer as the moments passed you have forced the choice on me bantor i was going to akkad to find out which way the wind blew now i must throw in my lot with you and eskkar even if you didnt hold my family hostage korthac would never trust me again once he finds out you and your men came to me hell be looking for any excuse to confiscate land and property to execute a few landowners as an example so i cant tell him youre here he shook his head at his predicament then stood i have to go the sooner i know whats going on the better well know what to do bantor didnt like having to trust the old noble but this korthac had summoned rebba so he must go before someone came out looking for him no important landowner could ignore such a summons and korthac would certainly notice if noble rebba didnt appear as ordered gather your family fi rst rebba and talk to them ill keep all of the women and children here in the house ill kill them myself rebba if you betray me save your threats bantor i know what must be done still the women and children will be safer indoors for the next few days anyway im sure ariamuss men will be wandering the countryside looking for loot and women then ill make sure theyre safe rebba bantor said and ill explain everything to my sons rebba started toward the door then stopped to stand directly before bantor ill assure them youre here to protect them remember that before you do anything foolish i think you would be wise to wait for eskkar if indeed he is coming without pausing for a reply or approval he walked past bantor and stepped outside calling to his sons and grandsons bantor followed him and waved his arms toward the river his men appeared alert with their bows strung and moved toward the house as bantor stood there rebba explained the situation to his family his sons and grandsons their women and the frightened servants all glanced apprehensively first at bantor then at the dirty hardlooking armed men striding past them hands on their weapons every mans eyes remained watchful and wary rebba fi nishing with his sons called the older women to his side and spoke to them as well when he fi nished the women gathered up the children and moved back toward the house rebba accompanied by two of his sons began his journey toward akkad the city lay just beyond the curve of the river little more than two miles away but it would take them most of an hour to reach it at the old mans slow pace as he watched them depart bantor felt the helplessness that comes when another controls your fate then a young girl barely old enough to walk on her own and oblivious of his frown slipped away from her mother and ran up to him the mother carrying another child on her hip looked at bantor nervously as he scooped the giggling girl up and carried her into the house inside another girl a few years older asked him if he and his men had eaten this morning no girl weve not eaten since last night bantor lowered the little girl to the floor and let himself relax he glanced down the trail through the doorway and took one last look at rebba walking south bantor had done all he could do and would just have to wait the last of his men filed into the house the siege of akkad had begun bantor tried to rest as the long day dragged by one of the women examined his shoulder and declared nothing broken though the pain felt as sharp as ever he spent most of the afternoon pacing back and forth between the main house and the sentries hed posted around the farms outskirts watching the path to akkad hed expected rebba to return by midafternoon but as the sun began to set the noble hadnt returned and bantor wondered if the old man had betrayed him he met with klexor they spoke about what theyd do if attacked and how theyd fight their way to the boats and cross the river his men taking their cue from their commander waited weapons at hand worry spread to the rest of the household everyone grew more frightened with each passing hour as dusk descended the dogs gave the first sign of someone approaching they began barking before the sentry caught sight of the returning men bantor recognized the yapping of dogs welcoming their masters return not the deep growls that would warn of strangers prowling about in the night nevertheless bantor ordered klexor to take some men and scout the fields to make sure no one followed rebba bantor had been ambushed once hed not be caught a second time rebba slow of step and tired from a long day reached his house to the joy of his family bantor stood by and watched in silence as rebba greeted his kin and accepted a cup of wine to refresh himself at last rebba told everyone to go inside the house he and bantor walked a few steps to the big willow tree that grew alongside the house they sat on benches facing each other in the gathering darkness across a table its top scarred and rough from years of chopping vegetables and small game two dogs their masters favorites arranged themselves at his feet the news is bad bantor rebba began reaching down to stroke one of the dogs he kept his voice low though no one stood close enough to hear their words the dogs would alert them if anyone tried to approach them in the darkness korthac controls the city his men have killed or captured most of the soldiers bantor expected that news if this demon korthac didnt control the city bantor wouldnt be here hiding in the dark how many men does he have rebba not many i think though ariamus claims to have hundreds of men under his command both korthac and ariamus are offering silver to any man who follows their orders and already some have joined him either for the silver or to take part in future lootings that also ariamus has promised to them bantor ground his teeth at ariamuss name but then repeated his question how many men id say a hundred and twenty at most apparently you did kill many of them and others died fighting the soldiers at the barracks i think he had less than a hundred and fifty when he attacked of course others have joined up with him bantor relaxed for the first time all day a hundred bandits even a few more would not stop the trained soldiers who had beaten the alur meriki once eskkar gets here with his men if we can get into akkad we have more than enough to fight them as soon as we begin the villagers will join us rebba shook his head dont be so sure the rumor is true eskkar is dead he was killed a few days ago in bisitun by korthacs men without eskkars name to rally the villagers few will join you eskkar dead and trella what would happen to her what about lady trella is she dead too and annoksur no korthac captured trella along with your wife his men stormed the house and killed the guards except for a handful that escaped or surrendered now he resides there with trella and annoksur under guard and confined to the bed chamber and annoksur is she i didnt see her but im sure shes safe korthac has no reason to kill either her or trella that could be the one thing that might inflame the villagers to resist him so hell keep trella alive for now at least bantor felt relief wash over him he and annoksur had suffered many hard years together and it angered him to think that her life depended on another mans whim if anything happened to her hed kill this korthac himself what about gatus is he dead too rebba laughed in the darkness the old soldier slipped past his assassins though one of his men was killed at his side korthacs men claimed they wounded him and that he must be dead by now but they havent found his body yet bantor slumped back on the bench this sounded bad eskkars house and trella captured the barracks stormed gatus wounded or dead and eskkar murdered with eskkar gone the soldiers would not rally around any of the nobles he remembered his wifes words the one thing annoksur had feared more than anythingan attack on trella and eskkar without their protection bantor and his wife would have no future in akkad they would have to flee the city somehow he would have to snatch his wife away from korthac then slip away with his men it would a new thought crossed his mind rebba how did eskkar die the old farmer had to think about that im not sure korthac didnt say much about it i believe ariamus said he was killed by a sword yes thats what he said and the men who brought word of this how many men did ariamus send to kill eskkar just a handful i think he didnt say only that they had killed eskkar a few days ago and just returned from bisitun bantors smile returned eskkar had been declared dead at least three times before well rebba lets talk about that korthac and ariamus sent some men up to bisitun they slipped past grond and sisuthros and all of eskkars hawk clan guards murdered him then escaped back here with the news without being killed or captured by eskkars seventy men did they bring back his head as proof of their story hmm i see what you mean rebba said softly yes that does sound too easy doesnt it how good were the men with eskkar many of them rode against the barbarians it would take more than a halfdozen bandits to escape those men rebba even if eskkar were murdered i dont think any would get away from sisuthros and his men to tell the tale rebba put both hands on the table as if searching for support from the strong wood if eskkar is not dead then he will be here in a week or so with his men with your soldiers he could quickly raise another hundred men who would follow him more than that i think dont be so quick to count your victory bantor you would be outside the walls and in a week ariamus and korthac can enlist plenty of men from among the rogues and villains in the city and countryside korthac has plenty of gold to pay them and despite what you say it will not be easy to get past the gate its guarded even better than before and remember korthac has lady trella if i know eskkar he wont do anything that will get her killed my rider will reach eskkar in two more days bantor said as if thinking out loud even if he has to kill the horses with a forced march eskkar and the men can be here five days later faster if he comes ahead by horseback rebba nodded yes that sounds right so it seems you will be my guest for at least that long what are you planning to do the question caught bantor by surprise so far he hadnt thought about anything other than waiting for eskkar im not sure rebba id like to find gatus if he is still alive but i dare not go into the city yes you would be recognized rebba sighed i cant search akkad in your place besides korthacs men are hunting for gatus and i am sure theyll find him sooner or later what else did you learn bantor asked i learned my future place in korthacs plans i will be allowed to pay an additional tax of gold that will probably ruin me and i am to continue working on the harvest in return my family will be permitted to keep my holdings though i am sure korthac will take most of my crops and livestock i also had to swear on my knees to korthac that i would obey his authority for that he will leave me alone at least for a while hearing about rebbas plight prompted another thought what about nicar rebba and corio what have they agreed to much the same bantor and with as much choice as i did nicar did not like it and ariamus struck him across the mouth when he protested ariamus quartered some of his bandits in nicars house to keep an eye on him we need to know more rebba and youre the only one who can get it in safety you must learn all you can about this korthac and his men bantor leaned across the table toward the old noble well wait here for eskkar to arrive hell know what to do rebba sat back digesting bantors suggestion for a few moments bantor your presence here puts me and my family in great danger for the next two or three days youll be safe enough but after that the risk will grow each day as korthac takes greater control if eskkar does not arrive in seven or eight days or if we hear that he is truly dead then you must take your men and depart bantor heard the force in the old farmers words rebba spoke the truth they couldnt stay here forever if eskkar doesnt come or we havent heard from him by then we will leave in that case bantor decided hed find some way to rescue his wife with as many men as would follow him meanwhile perhaps you can find out about gatus i am to return to akkad the day after tomorrow things should be settling down by then and ill have two wagonloads of fruits and vegetables for my grandson to sell in the market do you have any idea of where gatus might be hiding bantor closed his eyes and let himself think about the old soldier where would the man go to hide ariamus knew the city well enough so all the usual places would be well searched a new place seemed more likely one ariamus wouldnt know then bantor recalled some words that annoksur had spoken once something about a friend of gatus setting up a small alehouse with that thief of a boy tammuz he remembered the look annoksur had given him when he asked about it shed looked away and told him it meant nothing her tone of voice telling him not to probe further he knew his wife kept many secrets perhaps it did mean nothing but he knew all about annoksurs network of spies at least it might be a place to start looking he made an effort to push thoughts of annoksur and her plight from his mind an old friend of gatus was injured during the siege bantor said picking his words with care he couldnt fight any more so after the battle gatus set him up in a small alehouse along with a crippled boy who once rode with eskkar maybe that is where gatus has gone there are many houses that sell ale bantor ill ask around but not until the day after tomorrow and only if gatus isnt discovered before then or found dead i thank you for your efforts rebba gatus is a friend he hesitated then added you know that eskkar will reward you for this when he returns i need no gold from eskkar bantor the old noble stood up stretching to ease the stiffness in his bones but i did not like the way ariamus struck nicar nor did i like groveling on my knees before korthac i will see what i can do bantor realized his mistake i didnt mean to offend you noble but no matter what happens you have already earned my thanks and that of my men just keep them quiet and out of sight for the next seven days bantor i would like to live long enough to earn your thanks eskkar had scarcely noticed the passing of time as days turned into weeks at first the village occupied most of his time however much responsibility he delegated to sisuthros the people of bisitun recovering from ninazus terror soon protested their rule by akkad no matter how reasonable or peaceful the intent it took eskkar more than a week to figure out why when the alur meriki threatened akkad the nobles ruling the city had selected eskkar to save them during the crisis the inhabitants came to know both him and trella as people they could trust with their lives more than that they understood that neither he nor trella valued gold slaves or the other trappings of noble life in short the villagers accepted them as people long before they accepted their rule in bisitun such trust did not come easily even though eskkar and his men rescued the village from bandits no one in bisitun had invited them to do so and more than a few of the villagers longed for the days when they ruled themselves instead they found themselves ruled by distant akkad their daily lives governed by sisuthros and his soldiers even more effectively than ninazu and his bandits the villagers also knew theyd be tithing a portion of their earnings to support akkad and that akkad as the more important of the two villages would always come first that made for plenty of tension between villagers and soldiers incidents soon arose on both sides of the fine line that eskkar trod each day he needed to rule them fairly and justly there could be no accusations that ninazu and his bandits had simply been replaced by another tyrant so the soldiers had to be kept under control eskkar and sisuthros warned each of them time and again not to take advantage of the inhabitants especially their women eskkar reminded them that they had plenty of silver in their pouches they could buy whatever they wished but take only what the villagers offered freely but soldiers he knew acted much like children they nodded in understanding at eskkars words and swore to behave then filled themselves with wine started fights and chased after the women eskkar kept his word he punished offending soldiers in the village square with the elders present he softened the punishments as much as he could he didnt want to alienate his men but he could not afford to offend the villagers so he made the punishment fit the crime as much as possible and eskkar soon found laughter to be as effective as manual labor or the lash one soldier who fondled a girl in the square had to carry water for the villages women for a day another knocked down a farmer and received a days work in the irrigation ditches only one soldier had to be lashed and that for a fight that led to a villagers death although the villager had provoked the conflict and attacked the soldier first eskkars biggest source of friction came from the innkeepers and other sellers of wine they had a penchant for overcharging his soldiers especially those whod drunk too much both innkeepers and shopkeepers often substituted inferior quality goods on the unsuspecting soldiers those merchants found guilty received fines and eskkar turned the gold and silver over to the council of elders to help pay for the rebuilding the elders banished one trader found to be a little too sharp in his dealings watching the unhappy man pack his family and goods then take to the road sent a clear message to all the other merchants to be more honest in their bargaining with both soldiers and villagers by the end of the second week a grudging appreciation of each others roles developed between the two factions during that time eskkar and sisuthros spoke at length to all the merchants in the village listened to their complaints and did what they could to resolve them progress remained slow but steady as the villagers came to accept the fact that sisuthros and his men would remain they settled down and got back to the business of farming trading and shopkeeping every sundown eskkar ceased his role as ruler refusing all requests for his time he spent his evenings with lani during the day she took care of the household smoothing the process for eskkar and sisuthros she arranged food for the men supervised the women hired to cook looked after the cleaning and worked with the two clerks keeping track of all the expenditures after dinner she took her rest bathing and preparing for her nights with eskkar they enjoyed sitting in the square talking about everything that happened during the day other times they went up onto the roof above eskkars house where they could talk with even more privacy they sat holding each other or with lani leaning back against him so that his hands could touch her hair her breasts or other more intimate parts when they retired for the night safe behind the barred door they had little to say speaking only with their bodies before falling into a deep and restful sleep for lani weeks passed before her nightmares ended until then she would wake up in a panic unable to breathe too frightened to scream often unaware of where she was over time those terrors faded away if not gone at least banished from her dreams for longer and longer periods at first those dreams unsettled eskkar hed never helped a woman with her private terrors before trella too had been frightened but trella had never known the horrors of a man like ninazu and trellas fears of the future centered about the unknown for lani the unknown had proven all too terrible in reality a reality that had gone on far too long as he discovered more about her he helped calm her fears it took time for eskkar to comprehend all this but as the weeks drifted by he realized he understood more not only about lani but about trella as well often he found himself comparing the two women their emotions their lovemaking even their hopes and so when lani fell asleep in his arms eskkar often remained awake wondering about himself again and again he cursed his own weakness he loved trella no less and he knew it was only because of her that he could understand lani but as the nights went by he saw his feelings for lani grow not lessen two weeks after its liberation bisitun settled into a routine that let eskkar ride out each morning to inspect the countryside taking along grond and a handful of men they started with the surrounding farms widening the circle around the village for the first few excursions they returned each night but as the circle widened they camped overnight under the stars then continued on their journey the next day after a few such camps eskkar realized how much he missed lanis lovemaking and after that he made sure nearly every days journey ended back at bisitun the next day they would change horses and ride out again one by one eskkar visited every farm and every herdsman within a days journey from bisitun he talked to farmers and their wives asked about the land and the crops and explained akkads role to humble peasants whod never traveled more than a days walk from their place of birth to his surprise eskkar found this more satisfying than capturing a dozen villages everywhere they went eskkar found the farmers and herders much the same at first frightened then curious then eager to talk with the warrior who had beaten the barbarians and driven ninazu away eskkar spoke with all of them and he learned more about the problems of the small farmers and herders than he ever thought he could comprehend thus he gathered ideas from many sources ideas that would make life safer and easier both on the farm and in the village he went over these with sisuthros each night during the evening meal one impressed farmer questioned eskkar asking how a soldier came to know so much about farms and crops eskkar smiled remembering the days when hed known nothing about the mysteries of earth water and seed trella and noble rebba had spent a whole day showing and explaining the secrets needed to bring forth wealth from the earth twice eskkar and his men encountered small parties of men on horseback who took one look at them and fl ed they caught up with one of these three men whose only business looked to be thieving or raiding grond and the soldiers made short work of them and the local people again gave thanks to their deliverer six weeks after ninazus execution peace covered the land around bisitun by then eskkar had met with almost all of the farmers not only met them but hed spoken with them discussed what they needed what they feared what they hoped for no one had ever heard of such encounters before the people were amazed someone from as far away as akkad would not only want to protect them but that he actually listened and showed concern for their lives and their problems of course many complained about the new tax to be charged when they brought their goods to bisitun for sale but most declared themselves willing to pay if eskkar could keep the bandits and raiders away from their farms and families trella had set the amount of the tax set it low enough so as not to cause hardship she had explained to eskkar before he left for the north that the real taxes would be paid by the merchants and traders in bisitun and akkad they would still grow wealthy but they too had to pay for the walls and soldiers who protected them and their dealings in akkad trella had begun changing the customs each week eskkar listened to her messenger describe her plans for establishing new laws creating a new house for the clerks and inventing new symbols to aid the farmers and craftsmen once all this would have overwhelmed eskkar but now he not only saw the need for such changes but understood what impact they would have on akkads inhabitants in the clans of his youth life seldom changed the people knew their role their place in life and the duties they owed to clan and family men hunted and followed their clan leaders into battle women raised children gathered and prepared food and managed the herds and wagons each day resembled the one before and the one to come tomorrow villages eskkar now realized couldnt be ruled like a steppes clan every village changed constantly with new people arriving or departing more people required more food and more craftsmen to serve the surrounding farmers and herders even the crops varied from year to year with abundance often replaced by scarcity akkad with so many more people living within its walls had become ungovernable by the old ways no eskkar knew the old practices must yield to new ways of thinking and what better place to begin than in bisitun and so laws replaced the old and vague customs of the past and the ruling council of bisitun settled disputes fairly without favoring the leading merchant and nobles by now sisuthros governed the village effi ciently and complaints became fewer in number and minor in nature the villagers created a new more permanent council of elders and they worked with sisuthros and his clerks each day to insure farmers sold their produce peacefully craftsmen worked in safety in their shops and merchants resumed trade not only with one another but up and down the great river eskkar had accomplished what hed set out to achieve for the first time in almost a year there were no barbarians to drive off no bandits or marauders to chase and destroy and the people of bisitun had started putting their lives back together with nothing of import to do he took his ease something hed never done before letting himself relax and enjoying the peaceful days eskkar knew he should return to akkad to help trella manage the citys burgeoning growth instead he remained in bisitun watching the days slip by of course he told himself sisuthros still needed him that he stayed in bisitun to help organize the village in truth the thought of returning to akkad with all its scheming and petty problems weighed on him and he wanted to postpone his return as long as possible instead on the days he didnt travel the countryside he spent more and more of his time with lani they started their day after the common breakfast when sisuthros went off to deal with the problems of the day lani and eskkar usually found time to return to their bedroom for a few more hours of ease after the noon meal eskkar would stroll around the village talking to the shopkeepers and craftsmen and more often than not lani would accompany him though she would leave him early enough to prepare for the days supper before the evening meal eskkar and grond would wash up at the well in the square along with their bodyguards all of them getting the dust of the village off their bodies after supper eskkar spent time with his soldiers talking and joking as they too relaxed from their labors but after an hour or two eskkar would leave the men with their ale and their women and he and grond would return to their house and their women lani and tippu would be waiting and the four of them would sit out under the stars facing the square talking laughing or sitting quietly with an occasional sip of wellwatered wine to keep them refreshed the nights had grown cooler but it remained pleasant to sit beneath the starry sky and enjoy the night air eskkar held lani close to him his arm either around her shoulders or slipped inside her dress to enjoy the feel of her skin and just as often her hand would rest between his legs stroking him gently until he grew aroused then whispering promises in his ear for later in the evening sometimes sisuthros or one of the other senior men joined them but mostly eskkar and grond had the nights to themselves as the others sought their own companions at days end as the darkness increased if no one was around or watching too closely lani would kiss him once she even leaned over and took him into her mouth for a few moments a more certain reminder of what would come later during most of those nights another visitor would join them the dark gray cat that had appeared in eskkars room that first night would cautiously prowl its way to their table where it spent its days no one knew lani had befriended the animal weeks before eskkars arrival and now it stayed nearby or came into the bedroom searching for her always alert and constantly looking around the scruffy male cat would search out lanis hand for a brief stroking then poke her with his paw until she gave him something to eat in time the cat permitted eskkar to pet it though the hint of a growl would be heard if eskkar rubbed too hard or too long after the cat had eaten whatever scraps they had to offer it often sat on the table and dozed its legs tucked underneath its body but ready to dart away at any moment if the food had been good and plentiful it might even purr for them the low sound only lasting a few moments before the animal remembered it was supposed to be a fierce hunter eskkar never spent much time with cats as a young boy in his camp dogs had kept his family company but cats were almost unknown in the lives of barbarians cats couldnt follow a wagon a dozen miles each day and eskkar had rarely seen them until he came to the villages nevertheless everyone knew that a cat came blessed from the gods and brought good luck cats were plentiful on the nearby farms and in the villages appreciated for their ability to hunt the rodents that ate and soiled the stored grain lanis cat as eskkar called it seemed sure of its place and in the last few weeks eskkar had come to enjoy its company tonight the stars shone gleaming white overhead eskkar and lani sat side by side facing the square their backs to the wall of the house at a small table grond and tippu had their own table a discreet distance away where they too whispered to each other a single guard watched at the entrance to the house twenty paces away the rest of the square stood empty at this time of night and the incessant creaking sound from the well as people drew up the water had finally stopped lanis cat reclined on the table between them it had dined on chicken scraps then washed its face and paws and now dozed lightly eskkar glanced up at the heavens and knew it would soon be time to go into the warm house and warmer bed to spend another hour making love before falling asleep in each others arms tell me more about akkad lani urged her arm around eskkars neck and one hand stroking his manhood ive already told you everything there is lani he answered she asked the same question every night tell me something new then she insisted her hand tightening around him eskkar sighed then found some new detail to talk about she listened carefully as he spoke about the city its people the farms the traders even the wall surrounding it whatever he told her sooner or later involved trella and then more questions would arise do you miss your wife so much eskkar are you not happy here i have to go back to akkad lani you know that my son will be born soon and i must be there ive already stayed away longer than i planned in another two or three days well start for akkad you will take us with you she asked that question often yes lani you will come with me though im not sure what i will do with you there trella will not be pleased with you as long as you do not forget me eskkar i could not bear that trellas reception of lani had bothered him more than he admitted he needed to keep seeing lani but wanted trella as well as the time to return to akkad grew closer the problem had become more confusing now even talking about trella made him uncomfortable i will take care of you and your sister he kissed her cheek and her ear and i will come to visit you as often as i can do you promise eskkar i dont want to be apart from you he reassured her again and finally she seemed satisfied the questions stopped and she relaxed snuggling against him her head on his shoulder his right arm reached around her his hand inside her dress as he held onto her breast he rolled her nipple between his fingers and felt her shiver from his touch she had very sensitive breasts and he had discovered that he could sometimes bring her to arousal merely by playing with them it was a new and erotic experience that never failed to excite him now he leaned back enjoying her presence and her touch his head resting against the rough mudbrick of the house he reached out slowly with his left hand and gently stroked the cats neck just behind its ear eskkar had learned not to make any sudden movements around the animal not much tamer than a wild creature even after all this time it remained skittish and always ready to show its claws tonight it let him stroke its rough fur though the cat lifted its head toward him as if to reassure itself before lowering its head once again before settling down its feet folded under its chest eskkars hand was knocked aside as the cats head snapped up and to its left before eskkar could follow the movement the cat launched itself off the table with a blur of motion too quick to be seen eskkar turned toward whatever had alarmed the cat though used to the darkness he saw nothing at first then a faint reflection of something silvery moving toward him for a big man eskkar could move rapidly when he needed to he shoved lani away with his right hand using his left to reach under the table and fling it up and between him and his attacker grond he shouted at the top of his lungs and then dropped to a crouch as the sword slashed the air where his head had been an instant ago chunks of dried mud sprayed from the wall where the blade struck the table had hindered the stroke not by much but just enough to buy one extra moment of precious time eskkar threw himself to the left away from lani and found himself at the feet of another assailant that mans sword missed as well an overhand swing that sliced into the air where eskkar had just been the attacker expecting eskkar to move away not at him before the man could thrust down with the weapon eskkar gathered his feet under him and drove his shoulder into the mans stomach and this time they both went down the attacker attempted to use his sword but eskkar rolled away with two quick turns regained his footing and made sure the wall protected his back on his left he heard grond shouting for the guards not that eskkar had time to worry about grond eskkar saw two shadows advancing toward him but at least he had time to draw his sword he used the motion to move back to his right closing in with the closest of his attackers the blade slashing at the man nearest the wall bronze clashed on bronze and eskkar felt something burn against his left arm again he used his body moving forward lowering his shoulder and thrusting himself into the man before he could recover and swing again as eskkar rebounded from his assailant he flung himself back into the first attacker again ducking under another cut and pinning the man to the wall for an instant with his body the second man proved quick in his reactions a hand struck eskkar in the face a thumb nearly in his eye and eskkar was pushed back before he could thrust with his own blade he dropped to his knees swinging his sword as he did so the attacker grunted as eskkars blade struck the man across the leg but the tip of the sword struck the wall weakening the blow still it did enough damage to allow eskkar to dart away this time back toward grond the shouting and clash of swords in the square had raised the alarm and even in the confusion eskkar heard men stumbling about inside the house behind him he half expected the assailants to flee but these two men were determined and they again pressed the attack from the darkness lani threw herself in front of one of them tripping him up that one cursed as he stumbled and fell though lanis cry mixed with the assassins oaths the other man kept coming and eskkar swung his sword at the assailants head the man parried the blade but eskkar took control now his feet firmly planted as he disengaged his blade rolling it around his opponents weapon with a motion trained in hundreds of hours of practice and thrust hard brushing aside the parry and sinking the blade deep into the mans chest he didnt dare risk a moment to withdraw it just ducked immediately to his right half expecting another blow from the other man but grond arrived now he had no weapon in his hand but he caught the second man from behind his arm around the mans neck grond twisted him against his hip and flipped the man over the sound of the mans neck breaking carried over the rising din in the square eskkar wrenched his sword free and looked up as a tiny bit more light filtered into the square from the main house as the door flung open another assailant stood there backing away from the opening as men stumbled out swords in their hands the man looked toward his fallen companions then turned and raced away but sisuthros and two men burst from the house and pursued him the assassin ran for his life dropping his sword and taking to his heels with a burst of speed he darted down one of the lanes but a doorway opened ahead of him and a woman stepped out to see about all the commotion they collided both crashing to the ground the man got up in a moment but sisuthros had closed the gap and flung his sword at the running mans back the blade landed nearly true and the blow while not deep enough to be mortal made the runner cry out and stumble drakis and another man dashed past sisuthros and even across the square eskkar heard the sound of the blade as it crunched into the mans shoulder a scream rent the air cut short by another blow and then it was over eskkar stood in the same spot breathing heavily his back to the wall the great sword held out in front of him he heard lani crying on the ground and remembered that she had managed to trip one of his attackers grond moved toward him gathering up lani as he came to eskkars side then pushed her roughly behind them hed picked up the fallen mans sword and the two of them stood in front of lani swords glinting in the starlight as the blades weaved back and forth in the empty space before them another soldier came out of the house a newly lit torch in his hand its flame reaching full illumination as he raised it above his head in the flickering light eskkar could see the bodies of three men he saw tippu huddled against the next house her hands up over her head more of eskkars soldiers rushed into the square those who had not gone to the local taverns and alehouses rushing out of the nearby houses where they were quartered swords or knives in their hands in a moment a line of men stood in front of eskkar and he allowed himself to relax a little he turned and found lani slumped to the ground her back against the wall he reached down and picked her up with one hand then pulled her along the wall until they reached the houses entrance she stumbled and would have fallen if he hadnt clasped her around the waist inside he saw blood oozing from her forehead and cheek someone lit another lamp inside the house and it gave him enough light to see he pushed her hair aside to examine her injury eskkar found a welt and a bloody scratch but no wound so he carried her into the bedroom someone brought tippu inside and she rushed to join her sister take care of her tippu close the door when eskkar went back outside sisuthros rushed up to him his subcommander had recovered his sword and eskkar saw blood still on it drakis a few steps behind him dragged the body of the assassin who had nearly escaped eskkar remembered that drakis had been the first one out of the house at the sound of the attack he hadnt bothered with any clothes more torches flamed up and hamati arrived at a run from the local alehouse with another dozen men sisuthros shouted an order and the trumpet rang out its notes summoning every soldier to the house lamps and candles started to burn in all the houses around the square adding their light to that of the flickering torches soldiers dragged the four bodies from where they had fallen and lined them up next to the table eskkar had fl ipped over another body lay near the doorway that of the guard stationed at the door to the house hed attempted to reach eskkar but had been struck down from behind by the fourth assassin eskkar grabbed the arm of a soldier bearing a torch and ordered him to hold the light over the bodies eskkar studied each face closely as did grond and sisuthros but they recognized none of them the torchlight showed that all the dead men looked hard and fit they certainly had not backed off in their attempt to kill him even after their initial attempt had failed sisuthros get men out on horseback they must have had horses hidden somewhere find them use torches to check for fresh tracks around the village and secure every horse in bisitun i dont want anyone getting away if any have left the village ride them down at first light if you have to kill every horse ill do it hamati said he issued orders to his men and they all raced off toward the stable eskkar nodded and turned back to sisuthros have the rest of the men take a look at the bodies see if anyone recognizes them first thing in the morning get every innkeeper shopkeeper no get everyone in the village to look at these bodies somebody must know who they are or where they stayed yes captain he hurried off giving orders to waken every member of the village council the sound of hoofbeats rang out and a single rider came back into the square shouting for torches he took two in his hand struggling to keep control of the nervous horse spooked by the crackling and flickering torches but the man retained his seat and in a moment the horse steadied and they galloped off down the lane grond have a guard stationed behind the house tonight and search inside to make sure no ones hiding with the women drakis came from the house now dressed with his sword belted at his waist captain why dont you go back inside and let the women look at that arm theres nothing more you can do out here ill send a healer to you eskkar stared down at his left arm and found it dripping blood hed moved aside but not quite fast enough and the thrusting sword had lanced the outside of his arm looking at the wound eskkar realized it stung painfully ill go inside he looked at the other guards their eyes wide with excitement you men sweep the square and the nearby houses make sure there are no others hiding inside grond followed him into the house and once there eskkar saw that the palm of gronds left hand was bleeding as well he must have grasped a blade during the struggle lani came out of the bedroom still shaking a little but insisting she was all right and sat down at the table tippu followed her trying to wash the cut on her sisters head another woman came up and ordered all of them to sit in a moment shed brought wine and cups for the four of them eskkar took two mouthfuls of wine then set the cup back down he needed to think clearly and hed already had one cup of wine during his dinner the healer arrived rubbing the sleep from his eyes a big wooden box of implements slung from his shoulder an old man hed no doubt gone to bed early and heard nothing of the disturbance he attended to eskkar fi rst i need more light lord eskkar he announced another woman fetched a lamp from sisuthross room and placed it on the table and a cup of wine if i may and a bucket of fresh water from the well now lord eskkar put your arm on the table while the healer spoke he pulled the two lamps close to eskkars left side eskkar leaned forward his arm outstretched and flat on the table pushing up the tunics sleeve the healer looked closely at the wound moving the separated skin around and causing eskkar to flinch though he made no sound its nothing serious lord eskkar let me look at the others he spent more time with grond and a few moments with lani as he finished with them a soldier came in carrying a bucket of water the healer took an empty wine cup from the table filled it with water then poured the contents over eskkars arm dribbling the water into the wound his face inches above the gash as he examined it the blade had sliced along the outer forearm carving a furrow nearly a hands width long nothing inside the flesh lord thats good i dont think it will even need to be stitched binding will do a clean wound bound up in its own blood should heal quickly enough eskkar felt relieved though the gash stung even more after the healers examination the old man dipped another cup of water from the bucket and again washed the blood away another woman arrived with clean binding strips and the healer looked at them carefully before selecting one then he took the cup of wine that had been poured for him and clasped his other hand firmly on eskkars wrist dont move now this will sting a lance of pain went through eskkar as the wine trickled into the wound and he had to bite down hard to keep his arm immobile the pain faded after a moment but the healer continued until he emptied the cup he wiped the excess from eskkars arm and with considerable dexterity for an old man tightly bound the long cloth around the lower arm pulling firmly as he did so ill need to change that in the morning lord eskkar he said try to move the arm as little as possible until the flesh has time to heal eskkar grunted at the mans advice lani came over and sat next to eskkar holding on to his hand while the healer examined her head when he finished he merely washed it out with water from the bucket nothing to do here he said just a bad bruise gronds hand didnt take long the healer rinsed it clean with a cup of water inspected it carefully then made grond open and close his fingers several times the healer treated the cut with water and wine then bound it up using enough wrapping to make sure grond wouldnt move it for a few hours keep it bandaged until it heals the healer ordered and change the bandage every day the healer finished up and slung his unneeded box of instruments back over his shoulder while he was doing this lani went into eskkars room she returned in a moment with two silver coins in her hand the healer took up the wine cup and refilled it this time it didnt go to waste as he drank it down in four loud gulps that was good wine lord eskkar perhaps i should have spilled less on the floor he took the silver coins from lani and bowed thankfully ill return first thing in the morning to see to the wound and change the bindings you should be more careful in the future lord it would be a shame for you to be killed so soon after having rescued us eskkar thanked the man but didnt say anything else until the healer had left when the door closed eskkar turned to grond well what do you think those men they were good very quick if you hadnt shouted id have been butchered and probably tippu too dont thank me grond i never heard a thing those men knew how to move quietly the damned cat heard them creeping up eskkar shook his head in disgust angry now he cursed himself for a fool taking his ease his hands on a woman while two men with naked swords in their hands walked within six paces without him noticing he turned to lani put his good arm around her and pulled her to him for a moment tomorrow i want you to feed that cat a whole chicken lani youd better sacrifice something to ishtar then for sending the creature to guard you grond answered everyone knew he didnt care much for animals now ill have to bow politely the next time it hisses at me no ill thank lani instead she threw herself in front of one and tripped him up he kissed the top of her head we were lucky captain weve been idling and careless i should have been more alert shouts from the square made both men look up and in a moment sisuthros came striding into the room hamati found the horses there were four of them tied up about two hundred paces from the palisade near the river near the southern road and one of the guards found a rope fastened to the fence just opposite where the horses were could there have been more men there might have been one with the horses hamati didnt think so the horses were well tied hes still out there looking well know for sure in the morning its too dark to see tracks now he noticed the bandages for the first time are you well well enough eskkar answered now we have to find out who to kill for this that reminded sisuthros of something i found gold on the men captain on all of them one man had ten gold coins the other three had five each someone with wealth wanted you dead it seems more than enough gold to buy anyones death eskkar knew and that meant what did it mean he didnt know thats a lot of gold for anyone in bisitun to pay for a murder sisuthros picked up eskkars empty wine cup poured himself some wine and sat down facing his captain twentyfive gold coins nobody in bisitun has that kind of gold captain not after the alur meriki and ninazu believe me ive worked with every merchant and trader in the village even if someone wanted you dead besides youve treated everyone here fairly more than fairly he shrugged theyd be more likely to try and kill me and ninazu didnt have any other kin grond offered and even if he did they wouldnt be the kind to spend gold to get their revenge theyd do it themselves akkad that much gold had to come from akkad eskkar said with understanding his lips tightening what about the marks on the gold sisuthros shook his head at least ten different merchants and i only recognized about half of them no way to tell from that something must be going on there eskkar said theres nothing happening in akkad captain sisuthros said yesterdays messenger said the city was quiet and bantor is due back any day he might even be back by now eskkar had talked to the messenger himself it had been one of the regular couriers carrying routine messages even a personal message from trella sisuthros make a head count see if anyone is missing check the scribes and traders too the sons of akkads merchants that accompanied them to keep the records might be involved in some scheme or another damn the gods that they hadnt taken one of the attackers alive even one would have been enough sisuthros got up ill take the count is there anything else we can do before daylight grond looked at eskkar and shook his head no i cant think of anything else eskkar said well know more in the morning he stood up as well i need to think about this wake me an hour before dawn when he and lani were alone in the bedroom the door barred lani sat on the bed trembling and he saw the tears glistening in her eyes dont be afraid lani he said were safe enough there are two men standing guard right outside the door i am not afraid eskkar but now the fighting will start again you will go off to kill your enemies thats what i have to do he sat beside her and put his arm around her shoulders ill take care of whatever has happened in akkad then ill send for you you saved my life tonight lani i wont forget that now put out the lamp and lie beside me i need to think and ill do it better in the dark eskkar had already finished dressing when the guard knocked on the door lani had cried herself to sleep while eskkar lay beside her questions churning in his head he hadnt slept much dozing and waking throughout the night in the end he couldnt wait for the summons to arise in the outer room one lamp burned sisuthros sat at the table talking to grond and hamati sisuthros looked weary and eskkar knew hed stayed awake all night as well one of lanis women had built a fire and heated water so the men would have something warm with their dayold bread glancing out through the open door eskkar saw half a dozen soldiers gathered beneath a flickering torch all of them alert and ready taking a seat eskkar faced sisuthros across the table anything new not much sisuthros answered with a yawn we didnt find any more horses and there was no sign of a trail heading south i had men walking patrols throughout the village well do another sweep at dawn when we round up the villagers that should turn up something eskkar said whoever else wanted me dead might still be in bisitun and if there are more outside the village they might not know the attack failed that news helped eskkar breathe a little easier and he forced himself to eat some bread by the time hed finished the sun had risen taking a piece of bread with him eskkar walked out into the square grond and two soldiers stayed beside him as the first villagers arrived to view the bodies eskkar insisted they wait until the sun had cleared the horizon and the torches could be put out in the daylight eskkar stared at the dead men again but neither he nor any of his soldiers recognized anyone the village elders came next and eskkar and sisuthros watched their faces carefully looking for any indication of nervousness or recognition but no one claimed to know the men the first sign came from one of the innkeepers who identified the men as having stayed at his inn for the last two nights the tavern owner had provided food and quarters for them but he insisted he knew nothing else about either them or their business thats all i know the innkeeper repeated in a highpitched voice except for that ones name he gave a kick to one of the bodies the man whod come straight at eskkar he called himself ziusudra the four of them sat in my inn yesterday afternoon and he was the one doing all the talking and complaining about having to sleep on the floor they had plenty of silver for wine and food but they said nothing about themselves or their business he shook his head they werent even interested in any of my girls sisuthros questioned the man further as eskkar watched looking for any hint the man might be lying but the innkeeper had nothing else for them the line of villagers passing the bodies moved forward again trickling by the bodies until an old man his grandson at his side for support stopped and announced that these men had quartered their horses in his corral but he too could divulge nothing except that theyd possessed four good mounts after a few more questions sisuthros sent him on his way by the time the last of the villagers left the square eskkar knew only that the men had arrived three days ago spent two nights at an inn then rode out of bisitun just before sundown theyd slipped back into the village somehow but no one admitted either seeing or helping them the stable owners words gave eskkar an idea but he kept silent until all of the villagers disappeared bring their horses around sisuthros and lets see if any of the soldiers recognize them good horseflesh required plenty of care and such animals would be noticed two of eskkars men thought one of the horses marked with a stripe of white across its shoulders came from akkad but didnt know the owner he grunted at the news and went back into the house sisuthros grond hamati and drakis went with him and they took seats at the table in the common room there must be trouble in akkad eskkar began quietly ill take half the men and horses and start back i should have returned there ten days ago if those men came up from akkad sisuthros pointed out and theyve been here three days they must have left eight or nine days ago if youd been in the city they might have had better luck those men were determined grond added they didnt run after the first rush failed not even after the alarm was raised well they had bad luck eskkar said but it doesnt matter ill take the men and start back to akkad today if i push the pace i can be there in four or five days he turned to hamati can we get half the men ready by noon half the men sisuthros looked surprised why only half if theres fighting in akkad youll need all of us we just fought a major battle to capture this place and pacify the countryside eskkar answered a hint of anger in his voice im not going to walk away from this place and let some other bandit take it over again he shook his head besides the people here need to feel safe and to accept the authority of akkad if we abandon them at the fi rst sign of trouble theyll never trust us again sisuthros opened his mouth then closed it again he looked around the table but no one said anything well why dont we leave just enough men here to keep order say a dozen or so and take the rest back with us youre not going back sisuthros eskkar said fi rmly youre needed here youve worked long and hard to get the villagers trust and were not going to undo that besides if there is an armed enemy in akkad we may need a secure base back here captain sisuthros began his voice rising let me come back with you hamati can a shout from the square interrupted him on their feet in a moment they pushed through the doorway just as one of the soldiers from the main gate reached them wheeling his horse to stop its movements captain he called out as soon as he caught his breath theres a rider coming from the south riding hard bring him here as soon as he arrives eskkar said no sense in rushing down to the gate theyd be surrounded by a crowd of excited villagers and couldnt talk privately there besides the man would probably need food and water the guard nodded then rode off to meet the oncoming rider no one moved or left the square and the time seemed to drag before three men arrived two soldiers from the gate halfcarrying a dirty and ragged man between them reached the doorway before eskkar recognized the one in the middle he hadnt seen alexar in almost two months they brought him into the house and lani put a cup of watered wine into his hand alexar emptied it in one draught then slumped back on the bench resting his head and shoulders against the wall his eyes drooped and he seemed to have trouble focusing lani took the cup and refilled it for him alexar looked up at the fi ve men standing around him but didnt say anything until he had drained a second cup eskkar sat down next to him on the bench and put his hand on the mans shoulder can you talk alexar yes captain he answered his voice hoarse i havent stopped for anything since noon yesterday ive ridden five horses into the ground in three days to get here three days sisuthros exclaimed from akkad from just south of akkad i was with bantor we were ambushed just a few hours from the city the alur meriki attacked you so close to akkad eskkars fear welled up at the thought of the barbarians return by the gods it wasnt the alur meriki captain alexar interrupted bantor said it was someone named ariamus he said youd know the name we were surprised by sixty or seventy riders and they killed half of us before we drove them away no one said anything for a moment thinking about friends who might be dead grond broke the silence whos ariamus eskkar ignored the question and bantor bantor survived he sent me and another rider with extra horses to find you here i left the other man behind me on the road when i needed his horse i was to tell you that bantor would be at rebbas farmhouse waiting for you how many men are with bantor sixteen we sent a few wounded men south to hide but thats all that survived the ambush we lost most of our horses and gave the rest to the wounded so bantor klexor everyones on foot whats going on in akkad eskkar asked alexar shook his head dont know captain we thought everything was fine until the ambush bantor thinks ariamus must have already seized control of the city they headed that way after we drove them off there must be more men in akkad helping him akkad trella waited there with a baby due any day eskkars fist clenched and he tapped it slowly on his leg hed wasted time here and left trella in danger not only trella but others as well his men had kin and friends in the city too no one said anything but the unsaid thought remained lani returned with a plate of bread and cheese that she handed to alexar the man held it in his hand but didnt eat anything bantor was sure it was ariamus eskkars voice was grim when alexar nodded he went on and he thought he could reach rebbas place in safety yes bantor said he would march north then cross the river and double back to rebbas farm he expected to find a boat somewhere along the tigris to take him there bantor has done well sisuthros said hes kept his men together and brought them somewhere safe at least for a time yes he has unless they track him down eskkar agreed someone has tried to seize control of akkad in our absence that means theres been fighting in the city as well trella must have if anyone has injured trella theyll pay for it he tightened his lips well well just have to move faster when we march lets start picking the men well leave at noon we can still cover plenty of ground before it gets too dark sisuthros glanced up at the sun captain you dont know what youre facing down there you may need every man let me go with you i need you here sisuthros besides ill have bantor and his men that should be enough to take care of ariamus if not then what i said before is even more important now we may need bisitun as a secure place behind us if we need a refuge no one will want to stay behind grond said most of the men have wives and families in akkad that started another argument no one wanted to remain in bisitun but eskkar wouldnt change his mind now lets get the horses and men ready to go they rose from the table then stopped when lani spoke up her voice firm lord eskkar may i say something yes lani what is it shed sat quietly away from the table and eskkar had forgotten her presence all his thoughts turning to trella have you thought about the river the river eskkar answered a touch of annoyance in his voice what about the river sisuthros picked up her idea right away of course shes right you can be there in less than three days if you take the boats and we have plenty of vessels here more than enough to hold forty men a horseman first and last the thought of using the tigris to transport soldiers had never occurred to eskkar rebbas farm has its own jetty he mused as he thought about the idea can we put the men and arms on the boats yes but you wont be able to bring the horses still if you reach akkad you wont need them what youll need is a way to get into the city maybe rebba and bantor will have figured out something we dont know how to sail the boats eskkar said still not sure about this new mode of travel he had journeyed on a boat for a day once before and hadnt liked the experience he knew the small craft built mostly of reeds capsized easily cargoes got lost and men drowned often enough for gold the boat captains will take you anywhere sisuthros said his voice rising in excitement with extra boatmen along the boats could go day and night youd travel much faster than by horseback the thought of being on the river at night made eskkar nervous but if it would get him and his men there in two or three days instead of five he made up his mind you know the rivermen sisuthros get them here and arrange for use of their boats he thought of something else and make sure no boat has left since last night i dont want word of the attack or our coming downriver to get ahead of us youll need to pack the weapons the bows the arrows and food sisuthros went on expanding on the idea youll probably want men who can swim just in case and youll need a way to keep the bowstrings dry mitrac will know about that eskkar looked around the table grond nodded but hamati said i cant swim i can said alexar but even if i couldnt im going back to help bantor even if i have to walk the whole distance eskkar put both hands down on the table then well leave as soon as possible sisuthros start with the boats and get some men on the docks to guard them hamati line up the men and find out who can swim grond figure out what well have to carry ask mitrac what else the archers will need make sure we have everything we wont be stopping along the way eskkar strode out of the house and into the market his subcommanders trailing behind him the rest of his men waited there all regular duties forgotten one glance at their leaders grim faces warned them that bad news was coming sisuthros are all the men here everyone except for those posted at the gates get them i want everyone to hear the news better they should hear it from him rather than picking it up in bits and pieces from each other it took only moments the men guarding the gates arrived at a run bunching up along with the rest of the troop that had marched here from akkad even the scribes and merchants waited to hear eskkars words eskkar stepped to the nearest merchants cart and climbed onto it letting his eyes sweep the gathering you know what happened here last night this morning word came that bantor has been ambushed and half his men killed it may be that some enemy has seized control of akkad his words shocked them into silence he went on before the questions could start im taking forty men with me to akkad all volunteers i intend to kill whoever started this the rest of you will stay here with sisuthros and shouts rose up everyone speaking they all wanted to go silence eskkar put all the force he could into the word listen to me men i know you all want to go but you cant first of all there arent enough boats and im only taking men who can swim the rest of you will have to stay here and fortify the village there may be more attacks here and the villagers will need your protection sisuthros and hamati will be staying in bisitun and will need your help but what about my family the voice came from one of the younger archers my wife and the men i bring with me will protect all your families i promise you that youll have to trust them as youve always trusted each other they wont fail you and i pledge that we will do everything we can youve trusted me before dont fail me now when i need your loyalty and courage groans of disappointment filled the market as the men realized that some would have to stay behind eskkar let the rumblings go on for a few moments then raised his hand whatever has happened in akkad will be dealt with i swear it eskkar said our city will not fall into an enemys hands a shout of approval echoed around the square the time for talk is over he said now its time to avenge bantors dead and rescue our kin the faster we can get started the sooner well reach the city are you with me a roar of assent followed his words and for a moment eskkar thought five hundred men had answered him and the clamor continued until he held up both hands then lets begin sisuthros secure the boats and crews hamati start gathering supplies mitrac see to the weapons grond find out who can swim and who knows the river drakis get what we need from the villagers start moving soldiers and villagers worked like slaves for the rest of the morning eskkar and his commanders selected the men who would accompany him a process that took longer than he expected because a few soldiers tried to claim they could swim everyone wanted to join him and recapture akkad to his surprise many of the soldiers had lived on and around the river for most of their lives and more than a few knew how to swim obtaining the boats proved more difficult even for gold two boat owners refused to help and sisuthros simply commandeered their boats in the end sisuthros selected six boats each vessel would need a crew of two and could carry at least half a dozen men plus their equipment crewmen utilized every rope and cord they could find in bisitun to lash down swords knives sandals food anything that could be lost that way even if the boat capsized a not unexpected event the food and weapons would be secure mitrac ordered the bows coated with grease then wrapped in rags and bound with cords a short immersion in the water wouldnt weaken them too much the master archer packed all the bowstrings into two small clay jars then sealed them with plenty of wax and bundled them with blankets and straw much the way the traders shipped beer or wine the jars too were fastened down throughout the craft in the safest and most secure places the bowstrings had to be kept dry at all cost if they got wet it would take most of a day to dry them out and the bows would be useless during that time a little water wouldnt hurt the arrows mitrac decided nevertheless they stored them in jars as well though they didnt bother sealing these as tightly all this took time the village square and the docks looked like a serpents pit with everyone scurrying around lani organized the women to cook as much food as possible every chicken they could lay their hands on ended up on a spit and the aroma of roasting meat wafted throughout the dockside the men would eat a big meal before they left and have more to take with them the women fired up the morning ovens once again and began baking more bread lani supervised the collection of fruits dates and any other edible items that wouldnt be ruined by water gathered them together and sent them to the boats counting eskkar grond and alexar thirtynine men assembled at the jetty ready to board eskkar mustered all those selected quiet now he ordered yavtar will speak to you listen carefully to what he says yavtar owned two of the boats and would command one of them sisuthros had dealt with the ship owner turned trader several times during the last month and suggested yavtar be put in charge of the whole expedition a big man with thick arms from years of handling an oar yavtar pushed his way into the center of the akkadians he had dirty blond hair tied at the back of his neck and wore nothing but a skirt and a belt holding a knife when he spoke his deep voice carried across the docks you men are going on my boats he began and youll follow my orders exactly anyone who doesnt will find themselves swimming my orders remember that not lord eskkars not anyone elses on the river youll answer only to me he paused to stare at eskkar who nodded agreement all these boats will be heavily loaded yavtar continued and i dont want some fool tipping one over no one is to move without asking permission of the boat captain all of you will be given paddles and youll be expected to use them your lord here yavtar pointed to eskkar with his thumb has promised me a bonus if i get all of you to akkad as soon as possible so youll paddle when i tell you youll sleep where when and if i tell you and you will not move about unless i tell you yavtar turned back to eskkar is that as weve agreed lord eskkar eskkar raised up his voice all of us will do what were told by the boat captains obey them as you would me we want to get to akkad as soon as possible yavtar glanced at the sun already approaching its high point then turned to his men who stood lined up against the waters edge get the men onboard he ordered and walked off the embarkation of the soldiers began the boatmen had already stowed and lashed down the food and weapons eskkar felt a hand on his arm and turned to find lani there lord eskkar take this with you you may want it later the basket held more food collected at the last moment eskkar hadnt spoken to her since early morning taking her hand he led her away from the jetty the sounds of activity rose up all around them but no one paid any attention to the couple lani he began i dont know what will happen at akkad but ill send for you as soon as i can otherwise sisuthros will make sure youre cared for and lani shook her head eskkar you neednt worry about me secure your wifes safety she needs you now do what you must ill wait for your summons he pulled her to him for a moment felt her hands go around his back as she pressed herself to him then he stepped back and met her wet eyes i will take care of you lani for as long as you want me to remember that you have my word he turned and returned to the boats yavtar stood waiting for him and the sailor extended his hand to guide eskkar down into a rocking craft the largest of the six vessels can you swim lord eskkar well enough eskkar said grateful for the skill learned as a boy but i prefer to do my swimming near the riverbank not out in the current then ill make sure we only capsize near the shore yavtar said with a laugh with eskkar aboard and seated yavtar took one last check to ensure that the heavily loaded craft rode evenly in the water he took his position at the stern and gave orders to those still standing on the docks the boatman at the prow cast loose the last of the ropes and coiled it back into the boat even as the men left behind waded into the water pushing the boat out into the rivers current eskkar breathed a sigh of relief under way at last half the men with eskkar had some experience with boats another quality sisuthros searched for while sorting out those who would go these men at yavtars order began paddling using slow and even strokes yavtars crewman hauled up the small sail the vessel carried amidships grunting until hed raised the heavy linen to its full extent before lashing it in place gradually the boat began to speed up as it edged into the middle of the river well be safer here yavtar explained where the current is swiftest there arent many rapids between bisitun and akkad and its easier to control the boat once in the center of the channel they glided along and eskkar reckoned the pace to be equivalent to a horses fast walk glancing behind he saw the other five boats strung out each raising its own sails yavtar spent plenty of time inspecting the sail and gauging the trim of the boat moving the men around slightly and showing them how and when to row the experienced rivermen didnt need the lesson but no one said anything yavtar didnt trust any of them to hold on to a paddle he made sure a rope fastened each oar to the boat by the end of the first hour they began to settle down everyone soon learned not to make any rapid movements and if one man had to change positions the others held still to eskkars relief the boat seemed stable enough and he gradually stopped worrying about capsizing the desultory wind blew from the north helping to push the boats downstream and they cut through the water at a steady pace though the boat held nine men it carried little cargo so the craft responded well to yavtars handling with everyone paddling even with light strokes the boat fairly flew along picking up more speed when helped by the wind which held steady until sundown then it changed direction and yavtar ordered the sail lowered eskkar opened his mouth then shut it again yavtar saw the look its too dangerous at night captain he explained a little more talkative now that he knew the soldiers could follow orders hard to see rocks or anything else floating in the water we would have lowered it anyway well paddle easy until moonrise eskkar grunted a little at that news by now he knew that even light strokes moved the boat at a good pace he learned to use a smooth feathering stroke that took little effort the paddling served as much to guide the boat and keep it centered in the river as to move it along when the moon rose yavtar picked up the pace ive never sailed through a whole night before lord eskkar itll be interesting to see how much river we can cover by dawn in the moonlight eskkar could scarcely make out the boat behind them still keeping its station and holding its distance he hoped the other boats followed behind all at their proper intervals whether he rowed or rested eskkar kept his thoughts fixed on akkad the possibility that trella might be dead kept disturbing his thoughts filling him with anger and anguish he remembered the fear that had numbed him when shed been stabbed in the street she had almost died that day he remembered how hed turned away as the healer dressed her wound unable to watch her suffering at least then he could turn his thoughts to vengeance now he faulted his own actions for whatever might have befallen her eskkar had overstayed his trip to bisitun hed taken his pleasure with lani with hardly a thought to trella her wellbeing or even the coming child whatever fate had befallen her it would not have happened if he had returned earlier instead hed postponed his return again and again telling himself trella had everything under control that he could do more good in bisitun staring down at the river he blamed himself for whatever evil had arisen his thoughts as black as the parting water grond must have known what thoughts troubled his leader captain there was nothing you could have done the assassins left akkad ten days ago if wed been in akkad if four men suddenly attacked you in the street we might both be dead staying in bisitun may have saved your life and what of trella i dont know if shes alive or dead i just hope shes still safe what you should be thinking about is how this plot came about grond countered how did this happen without trellas spies learning of it who could put such a plan together gather enough men ambush bantor and send assassins after you none of the messengers including the hawk clan riders had mentioned even a rumor of a problem those same thoughts had plagued eskkar it takes gold to bring that many men together even with such a prize as akkad at stake i know of no one in akkad who could devise such a plan and i dont think anyone in akkad could do this without some word getting to lady trella grond offered perhaps its this ariamus who is he he told grond about ariamus and the gloomy days in akkad before the alur meriki grond grunted when eskkar finished but said nothing nevertheless talking it all over with grond helped clear eskkars mind for perhaps the first time since the attack last night he started thinking clearly he kept paddling the slow deep strokes occupying his muscles and soothing his mind while he began running what little he knew in his head bantor attacked on the road a few hours from reaching akkad that would destroy any organized force of soldiers outside the city assassins trying to kill him in bisitun eskkars death would certainly have disrupted the soldiers and might have slowed down any response to word of trouble in akkad so someone wanted to keep soldiers away from the city no doubt while they consolidated their control his death even the ambush of bantors men meant nothing without taking power in the city and grond spoke the truth little went on in akkad that trella didnt learn of sooner or later ariamus wouldnt dare show his face in the city despite the former captain of the guards fi ghting skills he wasnt capable of outwitting trella ariamus eskkar decided would need an ally inside the city someone who could put together a grand scheme to seize power over the thousands that now lived there that meant there must be someone else in akkad a disgruntled noble or wealthy merchant even possibly a newcomer eskkar swore under his breath he needed more information there is nothing to do now captain grond said hearing the curse except get to bantor and rebba theyll tell us whats been going on so grond had come to the same conclusion well need to be careful grond when we get to rebbas place there might be a trap bantor and his men might have been captured days ago and put to the torture yavtar called out from the stern telling them to take a break eskkar lifted the wet paddle and rested it across his knees he wanted to keep rowing to not waste a moment in delay but the others needed their rest the boat kept moving gliding with the current every moment bringing him closer to akkad the night passed quickly enough when the men didnt row they slept at the oars eskkar checked his wound several times but noticed no signs of bleeding the pain had gone though the arm felt stiff and sore dawn found them many miles downstream from bisitun when yavtar worked out how much they had traveled he smiled for the first time since the voyage began were doing well lord he announced more important we havent capsized lost any paddles or drowned anyone at least not yet your men arent bad sailors i think we can pick up the pace after the men have eaten they ate without leaving their positions hunks of dry sausage washed down with water scooped directly from the river bread completed the meal yavtar slowed the boat and waited until all the other craft had caught up with his after checking with the other shipmasters he shouted out some incomprehensible orders about how much faster they would travel today his voice booming over the river he ordered the sail raised and the men back to their paddles eskkar scarcely noticed the extra effort demanded by yavtar but the boat moved much more rapidly the morning sun brought a slight but steady breeze from the east so they quartered the sail in the winds direction and that alone would have kept them going at a good pace with six men working the oars the boat appeared to move twice as fast as yesterday afternoon the water curling noisily from its prow he asked yavtar about their speed wondering if they could move even faster not likely lord yavtar answered sitting back in the stern with the steering oar under his arm everyone will be tired enough by the end of the day at this pace i promise you better pray the gods dont shift the wind any further or it will hold us back instead of pushing us along to keep his mind occupied eskkar studied the wind noticing how yavtars sailor kept adjusting the sail to meet the breeze by noon eskkar thought he had the knack of it and could have handled the sail himself even without yavtars orders the midday sun slackened the wind yavtar began eying the riverbank searching for landmarks until he found what he sought a small island appeared near the west bank with two poplar trees growing on it yavtar turned his rudder and put the boat directly into a sand spit that hissed beneath eskkar as the boat ground to halt the sudden cessation of movement felt unnatural after being in constant motion for over a day before eskkar could question the delay yavtar spoke well rest here while i check the other boats and rearrange our cargo we can all stretch our legs one by one the other boats beached themselves on the soft sand as they pulled alongside yavtars craft as soon as the men settled onshore yavtar called the boat captains together and spoke with each of them when he finished the boatmen went into the water checking the hulls for leaks tipping each craft from one side to the other to inspect all they could see afterward yavtar made sure each boat captain had what he needed and understood his orders as soon as his men had checked the boats and made any needed repairs yavtar ordered the food unpacked the constant labor in the fresh air had given all of them a huge appetite and they devoured nearly half their food after they fi nished eating they had to wait until the sailors rearranged the goods and weapons lashing everything securely only then did the soldiers climb back aboard the boats to take their carefully arranged positions with a single grunt yavtar ordered them downstream weve had our big meal for the day lord yavtar said a little later still chewing on a piece of bread supper tonight will be dayold bread as we row and well try to keep this pace how far have we come yavtar eskkar asked farther than i thought we could your men have strong backs ill say that for them i always wondered how fast a trip could be made by sailing through the night but i never thought id make such a voyage too risky for the cargo he laughed at that thought but then lapsed into silence the land on either side of them flowed steadily by and those on the land took little if any notice of their passage a handful of farmers paused to stare at them with open mouths and once some shepherds tending a small flock of sheep ran along the riverbank calling out greetings and shouting in excitement as the ships glided by those on the shore had probably never seen so many boats passing at one time nevertheless except for some women gathering water or washing clothes not many people labored at the rivers edge eskkar tried to see the trail that paralleled the river but in most locations it ran nearly half a mile away hopefully eskkar told himself no travelers journeying on horseback would pay much attention to their passage if someone saw them by the time the tale could be told the boats would be far down the tigris moving faster than any horse they didnt stop again until dusk yavtar used the last of the days light to beach his boat once again this time on the eastern bank while he inspected the craft eskkar checked the casks that held the bowstrings to make sure the seals looked dry and tight one of the smaller boats had capsized earlier in the afternoon after brushing against some rocks the men had righted it soon enough and managed to catch up with the others none the worse for the experience other than that no mishaps had occurred make sure the men finish the food grond eskkar ordered thered be plenty to eat at rebbas farm either that or theyd be fighting for their lives they ate in silence this time eskkar and the others forced themselves to swallow as much of the food as they could they might be fighting before they got to eat again and only a few loaves of bread remained when the men reboarded the crafts they hadnt stopped for longer than needed and darkness again covered the river as they pushed off this time yavtar slackened the pace at the oars a bit the river narrowed somewhat as they drew closer to akkad and the current speeded up still eskkar felt his arms aching from the constant strain they rowed steadily picking up the pace again when the moon rose and yavtar raised the sail the boat captain kept his crewman attending to the sail ready to drop it to the deck should any problem arise they rowed for nearly four hours before yavtar called for another break this time he moved down the boat to squat next to eskkar lord i think were a little more than three hours from rebbas jetty if nothing goes wrong youll be ashore not long after midnight that should give you enough time to rest and stretch your limbs my thanks to you yavtar i still cannot believe we covered so much distance so quickly it would have taken days on the road to reach akkad yavtars teeth flashed in the moonlight ive enjoyed the trip more than you know i always wanted to race the river and youve given me the chance and paid me for it as well in less than two days weve covered nearly a hundred and thirty miles no man no river captain has ever accomplished such a thing youve made me think about using the river to move men in the future yavtar ill not forget what ive seen and learned on this trip the boat captain focused his attention on the river for a few moments and eskkar thought the conversation ended lord eskkar yavtar said when you go ashore i want to come with you eskkar blinked in surprise i thought you planned to return to bisitun well be fighting for our lives at akkad i was going to but ive changed my mind yavtar grunted as if surprised at his own decision in my years ive seen more bandits brigands robbers and thieves up and down the length of the tigris than you could imagine sometimes i ferried them from place to place and i fought them off more than once but your soldiers are different ive watched you and your men for the last two days they show no fear no doubt they dont brag about what theyve done or what theyll do they follow your orders without thinking or worrying about the danger theyre good men eskkar answered trying to understand the meaning behind yavtars words and theyre well trained perhaps that is the difference yes perhaps but you trained them didnt you and gave them a home and a clan thats why i think youll win at akkad captain no matter what the odds and thats why i want to fi ght with you i think i want to be part of your victory and it would be nice to have a clan of my own for when i get too old to ride the river eskkar considered the mans words for a moment yavtar didnt look much older than himself so the sailor could be sailing the tigris for many more years still every man wanted a home somewhere a place of safety to raise his family and spend his declining years i welcome you to the fight yavtar eskkar said using what he thought of as his formal voice the hawk clan always needs good men thank you lord eskkar he moved back toward the stern keep rowing men we dont want to lose any time true to his word before three hours had passed yavtar started guiding the boat closer to the eastern bank he ordered the pace slackened and the other boats soon caught up with them staying just far enough apart to avoid a collision eskkar wondered how yavtar could be certain of their location the deeper darkness of the land looked the same to him even with the moon up moments later yavtar angled the boat toward the riverbank eskkar still couldnt see anything and yavtars mate had caught the jetty before eskkar even saw it both yavtar and the crewman slipped over the side into the river ropes in their hands and lashed the craft tightly to the jetty the jetty had room for only the one vessel two small boats no doubt belonging to rebba occupied the remaining space so the other craft moved carefully alongside until men could push them ashore struggling in the current to move the nowclumsy boats as far up onto the bank as possible the moment each ship came to rest men with their gear climbed carefully over the side and started moving inshore until every man had landed grond slipped away first and had already moved inland for a big man he could move without a sound when need be all the men from eskkars boat followed armed only with their swords and fading into the darkness to make sure no one lurked in ambush eskkar swore at the noise they made the men stumbled about in the dark he hoped the river muffled the sounds and maybe the din wouldnt be heard above the normal bubbling of the flowing water at last everyone stood on firm ground once again though now it felt strange enough to eskkars shaky legs the boat crews passed out the bows all bundled together and then handed out the jars containing the bowstrings eskkar cursed again as the sound echoed out over the river he felt certain they could be heard all the way to akkad at last all the weapons had landed the soldiers spread out all the men stringing their bows and readying their arrows and swords by then grond returned captain nothing suspicious i went as close as i dared any closer and i would have awakened the dogs but there was nothing no sentries no guards no horses no no horses except the three or four that rebba would have in his corral well well have to chance it ill go ahead and see what no captain grond interrupted ive thought about this lets send alexar and have him approach as if he came from akkad if alls well he can report back to us if not we can still use the boats eskkar bit his lip grond spoke the truth eskkars old instincts made him want to rush ahead but grond and the others wouldnt let him go and there was no sense arguing over it im ready to go captain alexar whispered he had seen grond come back and stepped over to join them ill know if theres anything wrong ill bring bantor back with me you know about the dogs eskkar asked the dogs will start barking as soon as they hear you yes it cant be helped alexar answered but theyd waken anyway so we might as well get it over with the sound wont carry to the next farmhouse be careful eskkar said putting his hand on alexars arm the moment the words left his mouth he swore at himself for wasting his breath no one needed any orders to take care he watched them disappear into the darkness grond leading the way to show alexar the location of the road and the farmhouse clenching his fist at the inaction eskkar moved forward until he could make out the cluster of buildings that made up rebbas farmstead moments later the dogs began barking the noise went on and on for what seemed like far too long before a light appeared in the window of the main house but the glow went out almost immediately and the dogs stopped their challenge after what seemed like a lifetime he saw two men looming in the darkness heading toward the jetty still worried about an ambush eskkar squinted against the darkness looking for any other movement his hand resting on his sword hilt relief flooded over him when he heard a familiar voice call out then bantor rushed the last few steps and wrapped his arms around eskkar hugging him tight and pounding on his back thank the gods captain but im glad to see you lets move up to the house with alexar and bantor leading the way eskkar gave the orders and started the soldiers moving toward the farmhouse they went in single file to leave as little trace of their passing as possible the dogs barked a few more times nervous at the approach of so many men eskkar heard voices no doubt rebbas farmers chiding the watchdogs to keep silent and keeping them away from the soldiers approach bantor guided his captain and grond to the main house while alexar led the rest to another building when the door opened eskkar saw that a small lamp burned heavy leather strips covered the windows and prevented the light from showing rebba stood there waiting he had already sent the rest of his family to the other house inside rebba motioned them to the benches at the big table lighting a second lamp a larger one that provided plenty of light though it smoked quite a bit rebba sat at one end while eskkar sat at the other by then mitrac alexar and klexor had joined them and to eskkars surprise yavtar the sailor had followed silently behind the soldiers eskkar noticed that yavtar had laced sandals on his usually bare feet and carried a short sword at his waist is trella all right eskkar had to know though he dreaded what he might hear shes alive a prisoner in your house rebba answered eskkar felt relief wash over him he still had time to save her how many men have you brought lord eskkar rebbas voice sounded frail but the urgency of his question took eskkars mind off trella one of rebbas daughters came into the house carrying a fresh jug of water she began pouring it looking nervously about the table as the men eased themselves down shoulder to shoulder around the table thirtynine no forty now counting me noble rebba eskkar answered he saw the looks of disappointment on rebba and bantors faces we came by riverboat and it would have taken us another three or four days to march here with more men rebba shook his head you dont have enough soldiers there are many men inside akkad who now follow korthac he saw the question on eskkars face ah yes you dont know the man he came less than a week after you left for dilgarth he looked at bantor for a moment perhaps we should start when you left akkad eskkar held his tongue as much as possible resisting the urge to interrupt with questions the telling of the events took nearly an hour with rebba speaking of what had happened in the city and then bantor describing the ambush on the road rebba fi nished with what had happened since so now rebba said as he wound up his tale the forty or so soldiers still alive are used as slaves and kept under guard at the old barracks korthacs men and now he has close to two hundred of them terrorize the villagers there have been many rapes and much looting any that resist are killed horribly in the marketplace all the merchants and craftsmen must pay a tax just to stay alive and remain in business he looked across the flickering lamp at eskkar you must gather more men then find a way to drive them out i intend to do that rebba eskkar said but you havent seen trella no but she is in her room with annoksur giving birth rebba saw the look on eskkars face and realized he had left something out lady trella went into labor this afternoon i dont know how trella is well you say yes thats what i heard today rebba replied but we hear only rumors from the servants trella and annoksur are confined to the upper rooms of your home korthac uses the outer room during the day but sleeps downstairs at night he has taken a few young boys and girls as bedmates they say i dont care who he sleeps with eskkar said his hands clenching into fists hell be dead as soon as i get my hands on his throat it wont be easy eskkar rebba shook his head the gates are heavily guarded and the walls are patrolled day and night as much to keep the people in as intruders out bantor rapped his fist on the table we just need to get inside captain ariamuss men spend their nights in the alehouses drinking their fill well kill them easy enough my men have practiced each day with bow and sword you said gatus is in hiding with tammuz yes rebbas men found him there two days ago bantor said gatus sent three men out here as soon as he learned we were here what else did he say eskkar knew gatus well enough two days ago he sent word that tammuz has been watching the sentries gatus says that butchers lane is the way in hell help us if we send word eskkar smiled at that butchers lane was where during the siege the alur meriki had almost carried the wall in a night attack hed considered using the same location to scale the wall on the journey downriver but there was no time to send word they could be discovered at any moment he counted the men he had at his command so we have your twenty men bantor and my thirtynine that gives us sixtytwo men captain yavtar broke in before eskkar could complete the sum in his head that includes me and two of my boatmen willing to gamble their miserable lives for a fistful of gold the rest will stay with the boats in case we need them i told you i intend to fight with you i know how to swing a sword im sure you do yavtar eskkar said then he stopped for a moment he had been struggling with ideas about how to get into akkad how to climb the wall he doubted he could get sixty men inside without alerting korthacs sentries no matter how many throats they slit in the darkness yavtars presence suggested another better way then yavtar i have a task for you if youre willing a dangerous task he looked around the table heres what i want you to do he explained his plan his men leaning closer intent on every word eskkar had thought about little else most of the day and now bantor and rebba had supplied the final bits of information he needed yavtars volunteering to join the battle provided yet another option when eskkar finished his commanders began to fill in their parts they had all fought together before working on defenses during the siege and planning attacks on barbarians and bandits they knew what to do and what to suggest to each other eskkar said little while they spoke and bantor alexar and mitrac all made their suggestions and asked their questions the whole process didnt take long the subcommanders knew how to prepare their men in less than an hour they were all ready rebba listened without speaking during the process now he shook his head as they began to get up from the table you really think this plan will work why dont you wait until tomorrow night that way we can get some help from gatus and others inside the city who are willing to fight bantor answered even before eskkar could speak no eskkar is right we must go now anything can happen in a day we might be discovered here or word might reach korthac that eskkar is on the way if they suspect were here no we must attack tonight it will work rebba klexor added those men are bandits and theyre not even from the same clan half of them will run at the first sign of trouble even if half do run rebba answered youll still be outnumbered and korthacs men are trained fighters not bandits they wont run if we wait another day or two we can get many of the citizens to join with us well be discovered bantor said his fist again striking the table besides we dont need them we just have to get over the walls and when we do i will put my sword in ariamuss guts and watch him die for what he did to my men eskkar stared at his subcommander surprised at bantors intensity he remembered the gossip about ariamus and annoksur hed forgotten about it until now eskkar realized the anger that must still burn inside the mans heart at least keep your forces together eskkar rebba pleaded splitting them up will no rebba whats important is to get inside akkad eskkar spoke with certainty if we stay together and cant get in then weve failed this way even if only half of us succeed we can rouse the city besides you say that korthacs men are scattered all over akkad the more places we attack the greater their confusion and gives me the best chance to rescue trella eskkar had made that decision on the river too if he could get her out safely he didnt care if the rest of the attack failed the people of akkad could live with the demon korthac for all he cared silence settled over the table either none of eskkars commanders found fault with his plan or they just wanted to get on with the fight then i will go with you rebba said the sound of resignation in his voice no matter what happens im committed if you fail i will be killed and my estates confiscated so ill walk the streets to rally the people behind you even as you fight korthacs soldiers the people will recognize me and many will heed my words when i tell them eskkar has returned to free them eskkar understood rebbas situation if eskkar failed korthac would learn of rebbas involvement they would all risk their lives tonight he looked about the table but no one said anything further tell your men to kill the egyptian soldiers first eskkar said picking his words carefully the rest of the rabble will break make sure our soldiers shout their heads off let your battle cry be let none escape that will strike fear into the hearts of these bandits we need another one klexor offered eskkar has returned i think that will rouse the people eskkar nodded his approval good two battle cries will make us sound even stronger the night was slipping by and the time for words had passed then let us begin we still have things to prepare and i dont want our enemies enjoying too much sleep before we awaken them korthac woke a few hours after hed finished taking his pleasure with the young girl who still lay in a heap on the floor her legs streaked with blood hed told her not to move and enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing shed learned obedience too young for the love act she had sobbed at the pain hed enjoyed that too watching the fright in her eyes that terrorized her as much as the suffering for the last four nights hed taken a fresh young bedmate alternating between sexes enjoying at last the opportunity to satisfy himself without restraint not that korthac ever felt driven by such basic needs as most men were hed spent months in the desert without companionship of any kind and considered it only a minor inconvenience nevertheless now that he had all of akkad at his feet and eager to please him he intended to make up for being deprived when he grew bored with the young children of the nobles and richer traders he would start with their daughters and wives keeping a halfdozen or so on hand as concubines until they became pregnant when that happened he would send them home to their families and watch their faces as they reared his children korthac determined to fill the city with his offspring so that in the years to come everyone could see the power of his conquest tonights diversion had been less than satisfying the room hed taken on the lower floor of eskkars house two days ago had no door just a heavy curtain for privacy in another day or so he would move into the upper rooms and banish trella to this humble chamber she would sleep on the floor sharing a blanket with her servant annoksur after a few days trella would have the blanket for herself korthac planned to hand over annoksur to his men before putting her to the torture he had let trella keep her quarters more as a gesture to the people than out of any concern for her comfort korthac knew that many in akkad felt compassion for trella his men controlled the city but there was no reason to give its inhabitants something else to complain about at least not for another few days though tonight korthac felt tempted to order trella out earlier in the day hed visited her again and decided her eyes still showed traces of disrespect hed slapped her hard a few times until real pain showed in her face and blood flowed from her mouth when she assumed a properly servile manner he ran his finger through her hair enjoying the fear that she could no longer conceal on her knees and in tears shed scarcely crawled back to her room when her labor began since then through the evening meal and continuing long into the night servants had crept past korthacs room moving up and down the stairs to her quarters even now her muffled groans echoed throughout the house diluting his pleasure and upsetting his sleep hed be glad when she dropped the babe or died in the delivery not that he wanted her to die he planned to keep her beside him to show the citys inhabitants that he possessed complete control over their lives perhaps he wouldnt need her for much longer since hed seized power three days ago his men had killed more than a hundred people and the brutal lessons appeared to be working the last two nights had seen akkad quiet down anyone who protested anyone who failed to show proper respect anyone who failed to yield to his men as they walked the street all met the same fate torture and death in the citys marketplace the people of akkad had taken the first step to their proper place in his worldon their knees and at his feet as for trella he would wait until she became fit to bed he wanted to enjoy the look in her eyes when he took her her child would be the means to keep her respectful and he intended to turn her into the most obedient and pleasuregiving slave in the city yes that would satisfy him for some time perhaps even a few months when he grew tired of trella she would pleasure every one of his men only then would he toss the child into the flames in front of her unable to sleep korthac rose from his bed as he contemplated that pleasant future he often went through days when he found it difficult to sleep at night and had learned not to fight against it better to just get up and walk around another muffled moan from upstairs recalled trella to his thoughts as soon as she gave birth hed move her out of her quarters and into this room then at last he would have privacy and a quiet place to sleep at night korthac had examined all of the larger residences in akkad and eskkars home came closest to his ideal it would do for a few months until his new slaves built him a much grander residence he frowned at the faint voices drifting down from above the lamp burned low and he ordered the guard standing just outside his door to refill it fully awake korthac pulled on his tunic and belted the sword around his waist the guard returned with more oil and the room brightened again korthac wide awake now noticed the forgotten child still staring at him from the floor her tearstreaked face showing both fear and pain go home he ordered tell your family that you failed to please me that would bring terror to her parents who would wonder what horror would befall them next he went outside taking a deep breath of the fresh night air his room had only a small aperture high in the wall for ventilation and its air easily grew stale a glance at the heavens told him midnight had already passed korthac walked around the compound checking the guards at the courtyard gate and stopping at the soldiers quarters to make sure they stood ready not that he expected trouble after the bloodbath of the first day he had crushed every look or word of opposition his men executed two entire families dragging them to the marketplace so that all could witness his power one man dared to protest the new tax and the other had struck one of his egyptians korthac determined to kill any that failed to show respect meanwhile his followers grew more numerous with each day paid for with the tax he demanded from the nobles most of his newest followers appeared little better than rabble once again he wished for another hundred of his egyptian fighters not that it mattered he had enough men and ariamus continued to gather more in three or four weeks all in akkad would have forgotten all about their previous lives feeling refreshed by the night air korthac sat at the big table in the garden glancing up at the starry sky a nervous servant brought water and wine out to him and korthac listened with halfinterest to the report of the nightwatch commander the city remained quiet its inhabitants in their homes where they belonged afraid to step out on the streets at night since the first day of the citys capture he had given his men free rein after darkness fell that meant they could stop any man or woman they encountered away from their homes after that first night the streets and lanes were deserted as families huddled together in their huts that didnt protect them for long his men soon began entering houses at random pulling wives and daughters from their families arms korthac knew that he would have to restrain his men somewhat after a few more days but for now they kept the inhabitants paralyzed with fear while they indulged themselves in the spoils of war another cry came from the house annoyed korthac finished his wine and went back inside he climbed the stairs and entered the outer room one of his egyptians waited there detailed to guard trella and keep her in her chamber korthac paused at the bedroom door two lamps burned inside adding the bitter tang of heated oil to the dank warm air that smelled of sweat and birthing blood annoksur sat on a stool next to the bed holding trellas hand she lay there legs apart moaning in pain sweat covered her naked body and her hair hung limply over her face even in her suffering trella knew better than to try and cover her body from her masters eyes two other women attended her one of them he recognized as the midwife korthac remembered how annoksur on her knees before him begged him to grant the midwife safe passage into akkad and back to her home after the birth it had pleased him to agree trellas body contracted her back arched as she struggled to force the child from her womb eyes wide she looked at him unable to control either her body or the pain youre keeping the household awake lady trella korthac enjoyed using her former title he leaned against the doorway enjoying her helplessness how much longer will i have to hear your whining the child is coming master drusala said her voice humble it wont be long now please forgive us at least the midwife knew her place korthac decided not that he intended to keep his promise of safe passage back to the countryside his men wanted women and soon there would be plenty of need for her skill in akkad trellas body heaved again the contraction forced another moan of pain from her clenched lips despite her effort to remain silent korthac peered at her belly yes the infants bloody head now showed the birthing had started without a word he turned away from the oppressive atmosphere call me when the child is born he said to the guard i want to see it to make sure its fit to live he went downstairs and back outside to the fresh air the servant brought more wine but he took only a sip if the child survived hed let trella nurse it for a few days just long enough for her to grow attached to it before he took it from her her milk would dry up after that say in another week or so and shed be ready to begin serving him properly not that he intended to wait that long to begin her training hed already thought of many things she could do to please him as eskkar and his men slipped through the darkness and approached akkads north wall he refused to dwell on the countless things that could go wrong he had to get into akkad if he could accomplish that task the most difficult part of the plan would be behind them to scale the wall eskkar brought with him grond mitrac alexar and two of mitracs best archers the same bowmen who had followed him over the palisade at bisitun mitrac with his keen eyesight led the group down into the ditch they crept in silence across the empty space bent over as much as possible to reduce their silhouette a hundred paces behind them drakis waited out of sight and hopefully out of earshot with twentyeight more soldiers they would approach the wall only when eskkar and his own group reached the top bantor had taken the rest of the men leading them off toward the river gate ready to support the handful whod gone ahead with yavtar eskkar put everything out of his mind except the need to move without making a sound and without stumbling over some obstacle hidden by the darkness he couldnt see any sentries on the wall above him but they would be there with his handful of men eskkar reached the base of the wall at the exact spot where the alur meriki had launched their night attack months earlier eskkar led the way out of the ditch and one by one they spread out along the base of the wall hugging its rough surface as much as possible except for the three archers with their bows neither eskkar alexar or grond carried any ready weapons that might clink against the wall and give them away all their swords and knives had been wrapped in a blanket alexar carried eskkar bore a ladder and grond had two coils of rope slung around his neck the ladder and ropes had come from rebbas farm they had gotten this far without seeing anyone following the riverbank from rebbas house before cutting across the fields now eskkar and his men knelt in the dirt freezing into immobility when they heard the sentrys footsteps above their heads time dragged by as they waited listening to the sentrys tread as he walked along the parapet above them he strolled back and forth a few times then the sounds faded away eskkar couldnt tell if the guard had moved along or simply sat down to rest his feet no doubt leaning his back against the wall only mitrac waiting in the center of the ditch and covered with a dark cloak could see the sentry eskkar and the others waited still pressed flat against the wall as long as they made no noise they wouldnt be discovered the guard would have to lean out over the wall to see directly beneath it eskkar heard footsteps again as the sentry returned walking slowly until once again his footfalls faded away still they waited and eskkar stared into the ditch looking for mitracs signal in the heavens the threequarter moon had begun to descend but it would still shed some light until nearly dawn gronds hand suddenly tightened on eskkars arm the signal captain eskkar swore to himself he hadnt seen mitrac give the sign but that didnt matter any more hurry then the moon is sinking fast grond took the ladder hidden beneath them and leaned it up against the wall taking care not to make any sound eskkar grabbed one side of it alexar grasped the other and between them they held it firmly against the fifteenfoothigh wall eskkar had measured the ladder before they left and found it just short of ten feet rebbas men used it mainly for picking fruit from trees the soldiers had selected the sturdiest one on the farm then tightened and reinforced its bindings and steps a snapped rung might ruin the attempt to scale the wall under gronds weight the ladder sank a little into the sandy soil and eskkar leaned on it with all his weight to keep it from twisting grond mounted the rungs until he reached the highest place on the ladder then reached up with his arms with his head twisted upright eskkar saw that gronds fingers were still short of the top by nearly an arms length grond merely bent his knees taking care not to disturb his balance then straightened them with a rush for a moment eskkar thought the man had missed and would come tumbling back down on top of them but grond caught one hand on the top then the other he hung for a moment before pulling himself up once he had an elbow atop the wall he jerked his body and swung a leg up and over the top grond disappeared from sight no one had raised an alarm and eskkar breathed a sigh of relief he let go of the ladder and stepped back glancing along the wall in both directions he heard no sound or outcry grond carried no weapon with him nothing but his bare hands but eskkar had no doubt as to the outcome if a sentry encountered grond the faint rasp of a bow being drawn made him turn around mitrac had moved forward and joined the others at the base of the wall his bow ready by now all three archers knelt in the dirt arrows pointed toward the top of the wall grond called down to them in a whisper and alexar straightened up and threw the first rope up and over the wall as eskkar watched the rope and grond vanished from sight a moment later the rest of the rope slithered up the mudbricks the thick hemp strand knotted every arms length would making climbing easier gronds head reappeared and he waved his hand instantly mitrac replaced his arrow back into his quiver climbed up out of the ditch and stepped up to the ladder he handed his bow and quiver to eskkar who took them in one hand as his weight leaned against the ladder the young archer moved nimbly up the ladder then took hold of the rope and pulled himself up the last few feet the rope made a rubbing noise against the wall loud to eskkars ears but slight enough not to be noticed from above the instant mitrac went over the top the next archer started moving clutching bow and quiver in one hand reaching the top of the ladder he paused and handed up his weapon then reached down took mitracs from eskkar and passed that one up as well when the archer started up the rope he slipped for a moment he hung there his feet scratching the wall for purchase until grond leaned down and caught the mans arm and pulled him up the last few feet the third archer had already reached the ladder and began climbing the tip of his bow nearly poking eskkar in the eye as he handed it up before seizing the rope at last it was eskkars turn with alexar holding the ladder eskkar pulled himself up the rope though he welcomed gronds help when his friend reached down and caught him under the arm once over the wall eskkar found no one there but grond the archers had disappeared along the parapet following mitracs orders to eliminate any sentries leaving grond and eskkar to work the rope they called down softly and alexar tossed up one end of the second rope attached to the other end was the blanket containing their weapons it too was quickly drawn up the wall the mens swords and knives had been carefully rolled inside as well as alexars bow and quiver only alexar remained on the ground he lowered the ladder too unsteady to use without being braced against the base of the wall then wrapped the first rope around his waist a moment later eskkar and grond pulled him up and over the wall to stand beside them on the parapet the first part of the plan had succeededsix men had scaled the wall and no one had detected them eskkars eyes searched the parapet as grond untied the bundle and distributed the weapons the three men crouched low against the wall alexar took his bow and vanished down the steps and into the darkness to watch the lane leaving grond and eskkar alone on the parapet eskkar breathed a thanks to the gods then dangled his sword carefully alongside the wall and waved it back and forth there would be just enough moonlight for drakis to see the signal meanwhile grond fastened the second rope to a wooden brace a dozen paces away from the first one then tossed the trailing end over the wall eskkar looked up and down the parapet but saw nothing turning toward the ditch he watched as drakis urged his men forward and began sending them across the ditch ten at a time they lined up five to each rope and began pulling themselves up the wall eskkar ground his teeth at every noise certain they would be discovered at any moment the head of the first soldier appeared over the wall and eskkar dragged him up and over with all his strength both of them almost falling to the parapet from the effort but with the two of them working together the next man came over easier and with less noise eskkar took a moment to make sure he had his bearings and that no one wandered the lanes reassuringly the lane remained empty he whispered to the soldier to make sure the man knew where to send the men when they climbed the wall before eskkar left the parapet he glanced out over the ditch but he could scarcely see drakiss men as they slipped across the open space facing the wall turning toward the village he heard only silence the sentry would be dead by now killed by one of mitracs arrows or he would have returned making his rounds stepping away from the edge of the wall eskkar descended the steps from the parapet and entered the city of akkad he crossed the space at the bottom of the wall during the siege this open area once measured about thirty paces wide but since the alur meriki had been driven off villagers had rebuilt or extended their houses once again encroaching on the wall less than a dozen paces of open space remained at the base of the parapet butchers lane ended there its familiar smells recalled the memory of how they had ambushed the alur meriki exactly at this spot slaughtering their proud warriors like sheep caught in a pen eskkar went to the end of the lane and waited for his men to catch up his eyes strained in the darkness and he listened for every sound then grond reached his side with three more men looking back toward the wall eskkar could just make out the moving shadows as they climbed over the wall to his ears they sounded as loud as a herd of horses but so far no one had raised an alarm mitrac returned along with his two archers at the same time that drakis breathing hard came down the steps to join him eskkar put his hand on drakiss shoulder you know what to do drakis wait here until all your men are with you then get to the gate as quickly as possible yes captain the man replied in a whisper well be there good hunting then eskkar clasped his arm then turned away grond mitrac and five more hawk clan following all of them experienced archers eskkar resisted the urge to rush forcing himself to walk along at a regular pace counting himself he had eight men not as many as he preferred but bantor and drakis would need every man besides if eskkar had to fight his way into his house trella would likely be dead before he could reach her they had several streets to cross as they turned and twisted their passage toward their destination he glanced up at the fading moon it would be dawn soon the light of the moon had almost disappeared at last eskkar reached the lane where he lived spacious structures lined both sides of the street almost all of them hidden behind manhigh irregular walls that formed the passage his house by far the largest loomed above the others near the center of the lane a faint glow emanated from the upper story and he wondered who guarded his workroom mitrac touched his shoulder and eskkar let the master archer slip past mitracs eyes would be almost as keen at night and he had the hunters ability to move noiselessly only moments went by before he stepped back to eskkars side there are two of them captain ones leaning against the wall i think the gate is open but i cant be sure the gate should have been closed but of course these bandits had already grown careless quickly then mitrac get your men in position he watched as the archer eased across the lane to the side opposite eskkars house and then walked slowly down that side of the street eskkar could scarcely see mitracs path in the darkness the archer disappeared from sight vanished into a doorway two archers followed his lead one by one as soon as the last man reached his position eskkar turned to the others grond and i will start in you three wait until were at the gate make sure no one comes up behind us eskkar turned the corner and started moving toward the house grond at his side they walked slowly talking loudly to each other weaving every few steps as if from too much ale eskkar wanted to draw all attention to themselves to keep the guards eyes focused on them not the shadowy figures on the other side of the lane the guards heard them and straightened up but did not draw their swords they had no worries in the last few days akkads inhabitants had learned their place besides behind these sentinels in the two houses that made up eskkars residence more than twenty of korthacs desert fighters took their rest rebba said hed seen at least that many there as eskkar approached he saw that the gate indeed stood ajar a closed and fastened gate would have been another problem he guessed that more men would be in the courtyard probably taking their ease at the table helped by an occasional drink from a wineskin the rest of korthacs men would be asleep inside but the nighttime watch would end soon and these guards would be looking forward to getting some sleep of their own eskkar stopped about ten feet away from the guards just then a muffled shout reached his ears from its direction he guessed that bantors men had reached the river gate hopefully the guards would not know what it meant before the men could react eskkar turned to grond raising his voice did you hear that sounds like women screaming maybe we should go and see if theres room for two more no we have to get back before ariamus finds us were in enough trouble already the distant shouting faded away and the two guards seemed confused one took a step toward them but the other turned in the direction of the noise i think im going to be sick eskkar said loudly and dropped down to one knee by now only a few paces from the sentries let me help you grond said slurring the words and stooping down beside him the instant he was down three arrows flashed out of the darkness and struck korthacs men one of them made a strangled gasp but eskkar laughed to cover the sound he and grond reached the men catching them before they could fall neither guard had a weapon in his hand making it easy to lower them silently to the ground a bench scraped in the courtyard and eskkar began speaking again raising his voice to cover the small sounds as mitrac and his two archers slipped up beside them maybe we should wake korthac and tell him thats good lets ask him to settle it the words meant nothing but korthacs name should give the guards inside pause one arm around gronds shoulders eskkar pushed the gate inward keeping his other arm extended to make sure the gate stayed wide open as he weaved drunkenly into the courtyard who are you came a voice from the darkness we come from ariamus eskkar said slurring his words as if from too much wine get out of here you drunken akkadian scum come back after dawn the words spoken with a strong accent came from the big plank table placed between the two dwellings so at least that hadnt been moved ariamus sent us eskkar said humbly bowing his head we have a message for korthac looking up he saw faint flickers of light coming from the upper story from both rooms but we cant remember what it was laughed grond and slapped eskkar on the back moving forward as he spoke eskkar saw the guards two darker shadows sitting at the table one with his feet up on its surface the other leaning back with his hands behind his head their eyes shone whitely in the faint light glancing around the garden he saw no one else eskkar stepped away from the gate moving sideways toward the main house is korthac awake yet we have a message the sound of many voices shouting at the tops of their lungs interrupted him this time eskkar realized the noise came from the west not the river gate that meant bantor had entered the city and reached the barracks the two men at the table started to move one dropping his water cup but they were already falling three arrows flashing into their bodies as mitrac and his archers stepped in from the gate nevertheless one of the egyptians cried out as the arrow struck him loud enough to give a warning eskkar ignored the dead or dying guards certain mitracs mens arrows would finish them or anyone else issuing from the soldiers quarters instead eskkar burst into a run and in three giant strides reached the main entrance and flung himself with all his weight against the door but the portal built to withstand just such an attack held firm and he bounced back his left shoulder tingling from the impact hed hoped the door might not be barred or securely fastened to his left he heard another crash as grond hurled himself at the kitchen entrance but that doorway too was closed and instead of a quick entry all theyd managed to accomplish was to awaken those sleeping within hail akkad yavtars voice carried easily over the black water alerting the guards at the river gate well before they saw or heard the boats approach the current pulled at the craft and he had to lean hard on the steering oar while his two crewmen paddled furiously to bring the vessel alongside the jetty out of the rivers rush ignoring the questions from the men guarding the gate yavtar leapt onto the dock and secured the stern when he straightened up and looked toward the gate a halfdozen heads appeared atop the wall on either side and one of them held a torch over the wall casting just enough light to reach the boat rocking against the wharf who goes there ignoring the challenge yavtar waited until his crewmen had hooked on the bowline leaving the craft securely moored to the dock that done he turned to face the gate where twice as many men now stood watching even before yavtar finished his count the men had bows in their hands arrows at the ready and a second torch appeared and added its light to the scene who goes there answer or ill cut you down im yavtar shipmaster and ive a message for korthac pass me in or send someone to fetch him he strolled down the jetty as he replied a third torch joined the others this last one held forward from the wall illuminating the base of the gate more men appeared atop the walls on either side of the opening these newest arrivals shaking the sleep from their eyes yavtars count now estimated about fifteen defenders you know the gate is closed until dawn get back in your boat and stay there until then if you step off the dock ill have my men put an arrow into you yavtar had reached the end of the jetty so he stopped and put his hands on his hips its nearly dawn what does it matter when you open the gate behind him the boat rocked loudly against one of the wooden support piles sunk into the riverbed yavtar had deliberately used more rope than needed to fasten the stern leaving plenty of slack the noise of the boat slapping against the jetty might help conceal any other sounds no ones admitted until dawn and then only if fine ill stay here until korthac arrives send someone to bring him here i have a message for him from ziusudra it will wait until morning stay on your boat until then it will not wait until morning yavtar spoke loud enough to waken half the city send word to korthac now or ill make sure youll find the lash on your back since taking power korthac had applied his favorite punishment to many including a few of his own men back at the farm rebba had described korthacs wrath at any that annoyed him and his favorite punishment the watchkeeper thought about it for a moment wheres ziusudra yavtar smiled at that bit of luck so this man knew ziusudra but not likely his mission ziusudras dead youd better hurry man or korthac will be very angry i promise you hell want to hear my words and see what i have for him tell me the message whats your name yavtar shipmaster yavtar as you should know ive delivered cargo here often enough and my message is for your master not you without waiting for a reply yavtar turned back toward the boat and spoke to his crewmen after a moment he walked back toward the dock stay on the jetty a voice shouted but it was not the watchkeepers voice again yavtar stopped at the docks edge and let out a loud sigh that carried all the way to the gate im sorry me and my two men frighten you so much but weve been on the river for days coming from bisitun anyway ive got three prisoners for korthac and you might as well take charge of them he turned back toward the boat bring the slaves to the gate during this exchange the watchkeeper had returned hed checked his men making sure all of them were at their posts weapons ready ive sent word to korthac he called out fine ill stay here you can watch these slaves for me just as well from up there yavtar turned back to his men and they pushed forward three men each with their hands bound in front of them their ragged clothes hung loosely about them covered with dirt their heads hung slackly on their necks get forward and stand at the foot of the gate yavtar ordered hoping no one would shoot them for a moment the prisoners did nothing so yavtar grabbed the nearest by the shoulder and shoved him roughly on his way the other two followed when they reached the base of the gate they sank wearily to the ground heads still downcast on the wall the watch commander saw yavtar taking his ease the gatekeeper worried about what to do a glance down at the three slaves showed them to be harmless unarmed and beaten men when the messenger from korthac arrived yavtar would likely be summoned to korthacs house and that would be the end of it perhaps it might be better to bring them inside the gate then escort this yavtar directly to korthac himself that way he might earn a silver coin himself or at least korthacs gratitude the watchkeeper took a torch from one of his men and leaned out over the top of the gate then looked up and down the length of the wall he saw nothing unusual and the jetty showed only yavtar and his two boatmen dawn approached and hed be opening the gate soon enough anyway he might as well open it early for this yavtar he turned away from the river open the gate bring yavtar in alexar had never run so hard in his life but now he waited in the darkness his men beside him the first five men who climbed over the wall after eskkar and his archers had joined alexar in his race to the river gate they knew they had to hurry even if yavtar talked the gate open hed need their help theyd rushed through the lanes making as little noise as possible until breathing hard they reached their destination the huts here encroached closer to the portal than at akkads main entrance hidden in the deeper shadow cast by a house wall alexar and his men stood close enough to the rear of the gate to hear every exchange theyd reached their position only moments after yavtar docked his boat and now alexar still breathing hard stood listening staring up at the guards manning the gate waiting for the commander of the watch to react the gatekeeper took his time talking to his men and ordering extra torches lit rebba had told eskkar that the river gate wasnt as well guarded as akkads main entrance using his fingers alexar counted sixteen men as they took their stations on either side of the gate sixteen against six even with surprise it was going to be bloody if yavtar couldnt convince the watchmaster to open the gate alexar knew it took at least two men to lift the heavy beams that secured the gate closed and if they had to fi ght off anyone if they dont open the gate alexar said well have to kill them all keep shooting no matter what then make sure that gate gets opened gripping his bow he listened as yavtar and the chief guard exchanged words then the watchkeeper grabbed one of his men by the arm and spoke to him before returning to the top of the gate the man nodded then began jogging toward the lane stand ready alexar ordered and moved to his right staying in the shadow of the houses and converging on the same lane the messenger would take eskkar had warned alexar about the possibility of the watch commander dispatching a messenger hugging the wall alexar watched as the messenger turned the corner once out of sight of the gate and its commander the man slowed to a walk and started up the lane heading toward eskkars house when alexar turned the same corner only a few paces separated him from the shadowy messenger alexar drew his bow and sent an arrow into the mans back his target knocked to his knees by the force of the shaft gasped in surprise as he pitched forward by then alexar had reached the dying mans side drawn his sword and pushed it into the mans neck ending any possibility of a call for help snapping off the arrow he rolled the body against the nearest wall he paused to look about everything seemed quiet and perhaps no one had heard or seen anything alexar returned to his men just in time to hear the watchkeeper give the order to open the gate alexar breathed a sigh of relief yavtar must have succeeded in convincing the watchmaster half a dozen guards put down their bows and descended the steps to the base of the gate in moments they struggled with the heavy wooden beams that secured the portal with a loud creak the right side of the gate began to swing inward then yavtar stood in the opening scratching his head thats the signal alexar whispered bantors men are ready take the guards on the wall first anyone with a bow in his hands alexar nocked a shaft to his bow by now the other half of the gate began to swing open as well the firelight showed yavtar stepping forward he paused remaining one stride from the opening still talking to the gatekeeper who stood there with four of his men fire six arrows flashed out of the darkness striking at the men looking out over the wall or down at the everwidening opening before anyone could react the second wave of shafts flew toward the gate taking almost half their enemies by surprise the gatekeeper died crying out in surprise as two arrows knocked him from his feet a guard atop the wall shouted a warning but more arrows flew and he pitched forward falling with a loud crash onto a small cart beneath the wall by then yavtar and the three slaves knives in hand had forced their way through the opening striking down two more men and making sure the heavy gate stayed open still hidden in the shadows alexar and his men picked their targets selecting anyone attempting to close the gate or trying to give the alarm a few shouted for help but the heavy shafts whistling through the air soon silenced the voices an arrow skipped off the wall behind alexar the guards first attempt to strike back but the gates defenders couldnt see their targets well while the dropped torches and watch fire gave alexar and his men plenty of light for shooting then it was too late the heavy portal once opened couldnt be easily closed yavtars two crewmen rushed to his side carrying extra swords but they werent needed both sides of the gate burst apart pushed aside by a wall of men bantor and his thirty men hidden less than a hundred paces away from the gate had sprinted forward the moment yavtar gave the signal the few surviving guards turned and ran scattering in all directions alexar and his men shooting as fast as they could dropped a few more but darkness soon hid their targets and at least two or three escaped into the night alexar stepped forward holding his bow above his head eskkar has returned he called out just loud enough to be heard bantor recognized him and the two forces joined together yavtar bantor said without stopping you and alexar must hold the gate bantor had no more time for words at a run he and his men departed for the barracks less than four lanes away their feet pounding against the dirt the only sound to mark their departure yavtar strode over to alexar his two boatmen following together they watched the last of bantors men disappear up the street i dont want to stay here alexar there wont be any more fighting in this place alexar didnt want to miss the fighting either were supposed to make sure no one gets away thats what eskkar said no one will try to escape this way theyll go over the wall yavtar countered besides eskkar is going to need every man the more alexar thought about it the more he decided yavtar was right we could bar the gate and hammer it shut that should keep it sealed yavtar frowned where would we get the tools alexar turned to the crowd of onlookers gathering about them sleepy citizens from adjacent houses had heard or seen the fight and now peered out from doorways the braver ones stepping forth cautiously from their houses their voices contributed to the babble of sound that increased every moment we wont need tools alexar said he raised his voice just enough to carry to those nearby the time for silence had passed akkadians eskkar has returned to bring vengeance to korthac keep silent and bar the gate hammer it shut find weapons and keep the gate closed make sure no one leaves the city get moving eskkar has returned eskkars name emptied the nearby houses and a few cheers from the rooftops floated into the night praising eskkars return keep silent you fools alexars voice stopped the cheering should we go to the barracks yavtar glanced up at the night sky itll be dawn soon no bantor has enough men for that lets head for the main gate maybe we can help drakis lead the way yavtar said fingering his sword one fight was as good as another drakis led his men at a fast walk enkidu brought up the rear spacing the men five paces apart to keep their passage as quiet as possible with luck no one would hear them pass along the dark lanes if he were going to surprise the defenders at the main gate drakis needed to get there without arousing attention fortune had favored them so far first theyd slipped over the wall with scarcely a delay and without alerting korthacs men a feat thousands of alur meriki warriors had failed to accomplish in more than a months fighting earlier drakis worried that he might be fighting his way up this very street instead he strode purposefully his bow held close against his side if the gods smiled a little longer hed have the chance to strike first luck in battle drakis like everyone else knew eskkar had more than his fair share of it the warrior gods always seemed to smile on him and of course he had lady trella at his side to whisper in his ear drakis would have preferred going with eskkar to rescue her but his own mission might prove just as important and probably more dangerous eskkar had given him twenty men never before had drakis commanded so many and this time he would be on his own he vowed to succeed even if he and every one of his men died doing so shaking away the dark thought he quickened his pace recalling his meeting with eskkar right after they left rebbas house with bantor at his side eskkar had asked drakis to choose one of his twenty men to be second in command drakis had immediately named enkidu eskkar nodded approvingly then called out for enkidu to join them drakis you and enkidu must plan everything as best you can in the little time you have i want you both to think of what can go wrong and how youll respond each of you must choose another to replace you should you be killed at every step make sure your men know what they are to do and how they are to do it think now about what you will do when you reach the towers how you will attack them and how you will defend them where you will position your men and when you attack remember to scream your heads off as the barbarians do you must make your twenty men sound like a hundred nothing frightens men more at night than shouts of death and destruction eskkar had spoken for only a few moments but drakis and enkidu still struggled to resolve all the questions and decisions their leader raised drakis recalled his captains final words hold the gate drakis itll take the backbone out of our enemies if they think were trying to keep them trapped in akkad keep shouting those words that none must escape alive that will send half of them scurrying across the wall fleeing for their lives drakis nodded his understanding and put his hand on his leaders shoulder ill hold the gate captain it wont be easy but if you can hold drakis no one on horseback will be able to get away and those who go over the walls will be easy prey to mounted men in the morning but your danger will be great if bantor and i succeed every bandit in akkad will be rushing toward you trying to escape and desperate to fight their way past you and your men to reach the safety of the countryside stop them drakis kill them all thinking back drakis realized that eskkar had paid him quite a compliment giving him a command and assuming that drakis could work out the rest of the details himself hed watched as eskkar next went to talk with bantor klexor and yavtar their assignment was to force and capture the river gate afterward they would attack the barracks to endeavor to liberate the soldiers held captive there if bantor succeeded hed drive the rest of korthacs men toward the main gate straight at drakis whod have to keep them at bay until help arrived if he lived that long drakis lengthened his stride he and his men had the greatest distance to cover nearly the width of akkad and he wanted to get there before the alarm was given but hed lived in the city for years and knew its winding lanes and streets even in the dark with one lane to go drakis muttered a curse when he heard a rush of noise from the direction of the river gate it lasted only moments stopping almost as soon as it began and silence again settled over the darkened city more important no trumpet no general alarm sounded perhaps the inhabitants had grown used to screams and the sound of fighting even after dark the streets were deserted at this time of night but anyone might be awake and see them from a doorway or rooftop rebba had assured eskkar that the towns people wouldnt give them away but it would take only one enemy or some stupid fool to raise a cry clenching his teeth drakis prayed to the gods asking for a bit more time and held his bow tighter to his side lengthening his stride he felt his heart thumping at last he saw the lane widen in front of him turning slightly into the broad space empty now behind the gates hed reached his objective the two tall wooden portals faced him closed and barred flanked by square towers that rose above the highest part of the gate by another fifteen feet each tower had an opening at the base that provided access to the interior but had no connection to the wall that extended away on either side the towers themselves were mostly empty space with a few cots for guards to sleep on and weaponsstorage areas under the steps that hugged the walls as they rose to the battlement the open space at the top of the tower drakis stopped and held up his hand in moments his men took their positions on either side lining up facing the gate readying their bows and waiting for the order to attack they didnt have much time left the moon had faded to a dim barely noticeable glow in the sky but the tower guards had built a small fire at the base of the left tower about seventy paces away more than enough light for night archery at that distance he knew his mens arrows would strike from the darkness three of korthacs men stood around the flickering fire drakis didnt know how many more guards would be inside the towers but rebba had guessed that twenty or thirty men attended akkads main entrance day and night more to stop anyone from leaving than to protect the citys inhabitants from outside marauders the alarm might sound at any moment and the sooner drakis captured the two towers the better from their vantage his archers would make sure the gate stayed closed so far they hadnt been discovered and he wanted to keep that advantage as long as possible at least until he had drawn first blood and a roar went up into the night behind him a din that reached even where they stood the sound followed by the piercing note of a trumpet that lingered faintly in the night air drakis ground his teeth in anger they had been so close to surprise and now they would have to fight their way in well take the left tower first spread out and stay even with me lets go no one had noticed them yet another guard stepped out of the right tower looking about and calling out to those tending the fire fortunately one fool started tossing more fuel on the fi re and the flames shot up providing even more light for drakiss archers he nocked an arrow to his bowstring as he stepped forward into the cleared ground alongside him his men did the same spreading out to either side as they advanced in moments his men stretched across the open space all striding swiftly toward the gate drakis took a dozen steps before he gave the order to halt and fire the line stopped ready arrows were drawn to each mans eye and the flight of shafts flew on its way even as he issued the order a shout from one of the towers rang out to warn the defenders of the approaching archers and several peered toward the street just as the arrows struck the stillconfused men too late for them those tending the fire died riddled with arrows more guards stumbled out of both towers looking stupidly around them trying to understand what had happened before drakiss shaft reached its target he started jogging forward his men taking their lead from him halt he nocked the shaft hed drawn fire another wave of arrows swept toward the gates defenders more men went down pierced by the heavy shafts powerful enough to knock a man off his feet at this distance the screams of wounded men added to the confused shouting by now drakis had crossed more than half the distance to the gate again he halted just out of the fires light halt the dragging rasp of arrow against bow sounded loud to his ears as he drew back the shaft fire this time he aimed high at the man shouting atop the tower the shaft whistled up into the night but he didnt bother to see if hed struck his target all those guards caught outside the towers died in the third flight of shafts launched from less than forty paces the instant his shaft had flown drakis burst into a run heading directly toward the left tower gripping his bow in his left hand and drawing his short sword with the other eskkar eskkar has returned drakis shouted letting the name no one had dared speak aloud echo around the walls let none of the traitors escape angry and confused outcries came from the men atop the towers and a shaft from above hissed past him now drakis and his men showed clearly in the firelight splitting into two groups as they charged toward the towers they needed to get inside before they became targets themselves panic and confusion took control of the defenders at the sound of drakiss war cry for nearly a week theyd lorded it over the city laughing and taunting those who dared to speak eskkars name now accompanied by hissing arrows that name struck fear into their hearts many forgot their orders others abandoned their duties a few broke and ran disappearing into the darkness along the walls escape the only thought in their heads drakis kept shouting at the top of his lungs eskkar has returned death to all traitors his men took up the cry screaming the words into the darkness as they raced to the leftmost tower drakis raising his sword as he ran he hurtled over the dead bodies just as four men burst out of the towers entrance swords in their hands but two of them saw what looked like a hundred demon shadows rushing at them and darted back inside the tower the others raised their swords and one swung his blade at drakiss head drakis screamed his war cry even as he parried the thrust then he let his momentum carry him into the mans chest and he used his shoulder to knock the man to the ground then thrust hard with his sword wrenching his sword free drakis flung himself inside the towers dark opening a shadow moved before him and he struck at it screaming eskkar eskkar the words rang up into the darkness here deep within the towers base almost no light penetrated normally a torch burned inside the doorway to light the steps that led to the top the careless guards had let it go out too lazy to replace it with dawn approaching drakis pushed forward he needed to destroy the defenders as quickly as possible before they could regroup before they realized that they still outnumbered their attackers the guards inside the tower reacted slowly theyd been caught relaxing most of them asleep jolted awake unsure of what was happening the gatekeepers fumbled for their swords trying to fend off what seemed like a horde of ferocious attackers some fled up the stone steps bumping into those trying to come down drakis reached the base of the steps and saw a man coming at him stumbling in the dark drakis had the advantageanyone in front of him must be an enemy he lunged upward arm extended and felt the sword bite deep into muscle his victim screamed as the blade pierced his thigh and drakis felt hot blood splatter his arm and chest the stabbed man tried to step back but the wounded leg failed him and he pitched off the steps crying out as he fell the other defenders stopped their descent bunching up at the first landing drakis never hesitated pushed on by his men sounding their war cries behind him he hurled himself up the steps toward the guards still screaming eskkars name the confines of the tower amplifying his voice into something inhuman something full of menace another guard turned away to scramble back up the steps but lost his footing and fell to the stairs drakis swung his sword down viciously at the mans back ignored the scream as the blade cut deep into the mans shoulder knocking his opponent to the steps the rest of the guards fled back the way they came anything to get away from the demons charging at them drakis stepped on the wounded mans back and raced up the stairs two at a time behind him his men filled the tower with a wall of sound an arrow launched by one of drakiss men hissed by followed by a scream as another guard pitched off the steps falling heavily to the ground below drakis ignored it all shouting his war cry and sprinting up the last stairway until he reached the opening at the top of the stairs another guard met drakis at the top of the stairs a sword in his hand but drakis struck at him so quickly that the man didnt even have time to attempt to parry the stroke knocking the wounded man aside drakis breathing hard pushed his way out of the darkness and onto the towers battlement he saw shadows moving about and naked blades glinting in the starlight as the towers defenders rallied their forces eskkar has returned he shouted and charged straight at his opponents ariamus woke before dawn a lifetime habit that had served him well whether for fighting or fleeing hed gone to sleep late last night once again in korthacs new residence ariamus would have preferred sleeping in his own house the one hed appropriated for himself nicar the former ruler of akkad had lived there for more than ten years ariamus had enjoyed ordering him out now the wealthiest noble in the city and his entire family lived in a wretched oneroom mud hut and counted themselves lucky to have even that unfortunately korthac wanted ariamus close by and ariamus had swallowed his objections and accepted his leaders invitation to take a room in the big house in many ways it had turned out to be a good idea ariamus had a halfdozen subcommanders who pestered him constantly with questions and petty problems having to pass by korthacs egyptians grim men who spoke little and fingered their sword hilts often helped ariamus avoid his men in the evenings he thanked all the gods hed ever heard of that korthac didnt have a few dozen more egyptians instead korthac needed ariamus and the men hed recruited not that korthac trusted ariamus or his men ariamus didnt have much faith in them either he had few enough experienced fighters men who could do more than follow orders and swing a sword in a few more days it wouldnt matter hed be riding out into the countryside recruiting more displaced and desperate men willing to do whatever he told them for a chance to eat and earn some silver with enough followers even inexperienced ones they could hold the city indefinitely dawn still hadnt risen when ariamus finished dressing and stepped out of his room the one closest to the kitchen to his surprise he heard korthacs voice coming from the upper rooms climbing the stairs he found the egyptian seated at the big table a lamp casting a soft glow around the big room the everpresent guard stood a few steps behind his master watching the inner room but keeping one eye on ariamus as well did the slave deliver her child yes about an hour ago korthac frowned at him you havent heard her screams she woke the whole house when she finally delivered a woman screaming in the night ariamus laughed a booming noise that filled the room never keeps me awake korthac cut the laughter short with a look are you ready to ride out today yes lord ariamus managed to look properly subservient ill ride to the east i should be able to get another ten or twenty farm boys to join up with us one way or another ariamus planned to take a dozen men and begin visiting the big farmhouses surrounding akkad the local farmholders had plenty of silver women and other valuables and korthac wanted to make sure they felt no safer on their farms than did the citys inhabitants ariamus intended to pick up some more booty along with the recruits after enjoying their women make sure youre back by sunset korthac said and i want you to ride north toward dilgarth not east i havent heard from ziusudra but i expect this eskkar is dead by now just in case he isnt i want more patrols along the road if he tries to move against us ariamus shrugged even if hes alive what can he do with less than seventy men i wouldnt be surprised if he stays where he is or runs to the west korthac sighed a long breath that made ariamus regret his lighthearted words no the barbarian will come here ive learned much about him in the last few weeks he wont give up such power without a fight and there is something about his whorekorthac inclined his head toward the bedroomthat will bring him back ziusudras a good man more than good enough to take care of eskkar ariamus said shifting his feet and wishing hed been invited to sit down youve promised him plenty of gold for the job even if he fails it will take eskkar a few days to figure out whats happened so well have plenty of time to prepare annoksur appeared at the bedroom door and bowed low keeping her eyes on the floor master may i fetch fresh water for trella ariamus looked at her and grinned maybe you can carry something for a crashing sound echoed throughout the house coming from below for a moment ariamus and korthac looked at each other then a shout in egyptian came from the courtyard and even ariamus had no trouble understanding the message he moved to the landing and looked down into the darkened room below the main door remained closed then heavy steps echoed from the kitchen area and again he heard men shouting eskkars name louder footsteps sounded below and ariamus ground his teeth with an oath stepping back from the landing he yanked the door shut then dropped the heavy wooden bar across the braces what is it korthac rose to his feet though he remained behind the table the guard moved beside him hand on his sword were under attack eskkar has returned ariamus heard heavy footsteps on the stairs then the door shuddered a voice he recognized called out trella again and again ariamus backed away from the door its eskkar hes here something heavy pounded on the door making it shake against the braces ariamus pulled his sword from its sheath damn the barbarian how had he managed to get into the city inside the compound not that it mattered he turned to face the egyptian where are your men korthac almost in answer the sound of men fighting rose up from the courtyard stop her korthacs voice made ariamus turn he saw annoksur whod shrunk against the wall when the noise started dart past him toward the door ariamus lunged to catch her but she slipped beneath his arm reached the doorway and flipped the bar up from its catches shouting eskkars name ariamus caught her by the hair and dragged her back but the door burst open crashing against the wall and outlining a looming shadow holding a long sword cries of alarm sounded across the courtyard eskkar knew korthacs men would be spilling from the doors behind him swords in their hands keep them pinned inside eskkar shouted hoping mitracs archers could contain that threat then over all the clamor eskkar heard gronds voice bellowing out to him captain come here hearing the urgency eskkar abandoned his assault on the main entrance and rushed to his bodyguards side the kitchen door stood open a halfasleep servant had opened it either to let the attackers in or just to find out about the commotion whatever the motive grond had already pushed his way inside and eskkar followed behind him the two men rushed through the kitchen knocking a stool aside toward the dark corridor that led to the main room theyd barely cleared the cooking area when two shadows stumbled into the hallway from one of the sleeping chambers one of them cried out as grond struck the first man down and grappled with the other eskkar ignored them pushing both men aside he knew the house even in darkness and he ran past the other two doorways turned the corner and took the steps that hugged the wall two a time at the landing he pushed against the door to the workroom but found it too fastened nevertheless he flung his weight against it but this barrier as strong as the one below scarcely budged calling out trellas name at the top of his lungs he pounded on it with the hilt of his sword to his surprise he heard a womans voice call his name the sound of the bar rasping against the door caught his ear and he shoved the thick planks pushing the door open light from the upper room illuminated the landing and he saw annoksur there struggling with someone who reached out to slam the door closed eskkar shoved his shoulder against the thick wood and forced his way in the man stepped back knocking annoksur down with his fist even as he raised a sword in the other only a single oil lamp burned in the outer chamber but the wavering flame gave more than enough light for eskkar to recognize his opponent ariamus all of eskkars anger and hatred went into the name hed despised the man every day that he served under him and now ariamus stood here in eskkars private room his sword lunged out a straight quick thrust that should have pierced his enemys heart but ariamus sprang back then countered with a powerful thrust of his own another man black bearded and dark skinned no doubt one of korthacs guards appeared at ariamuss side and thrust his sword as well eskkar knocked it aside but yielded a step the long sword cumbersome in this kind of fight with no room to swing the blade both his attackers pressed forward and eskkar weaving the blade between them had to take another step backward as he fended them off one more step and he would be back on the landing the door closed in his face again suddenly ariamus cried out in pain stumbled and fell to his knees with a curse annoksur clung to ariamuss leg her teeth fastened to his calf the distraction gave eskkar the moment he needed he took a halfstep back ducked down then lunged forward the foreigner shifted to parry the blow but eskkar stretched out his arm and extended his body into the thrust the guard managed to deflect the point from his stomach but the blade buried itself in the mans side and he gasped in pain eskkar tried to free the sword but the man staggered against the wall his body holding the blade fast eskkar twisted the hilt and the man shrieked in agony dropping his sword as his hands clasped the blade that burned within him eskkar rushed forward lowering his shoulder into the wounded guard and knocking him backward at the same moment ariamus smashed the hilt of his sword on annoksurs head freeing himself from her clutch he drew back his sword but before he could thrust forward eskkar leapt toward him he slammed into ariamus pulling the big sword free from the dying egyptian as he did so they grappled too close to use his sword eskkar dropped his weapon and seized ariamus in both arms pinning the writhing ariamus before his enemy could bring his weapon into play something blocked the light for an instant and eskkar knew someone moved behind him keeping his arms locked around ariamus eskkar whirled around keeping ariamus between him and whatever danger threatened eskkar caught the flickering flash of the blade in the lamplight and ariamus screamed as a sword pierced his upper arm lifting ariamus off the floor in a burst of rage eskkar threw the man at this new attacker stopping the third mans advance for an instant until he shoved ariamus hard against the wall the former captain of the guard slid to the floor dazed and clutching at his arm by then eskkar had reached down and scooped up his sword this must be korthac no one else would be in these rooms only korthac stood between him and trella but the door stood open behind him and korthacs men might be here at any moment eskkar raised his bloody blade and moved forward atop the tower the stars and moon provided barely enough light for drakis to see his enemies milling shadows outlined against the night sky screaming like a demon he hacked left and right striking at anyone who wasnt shouting eskkars name his men burst through the opening behind him shouting their war cries theyd driven the confused defenders up the steps out of the tower and onto the battlement but korthacs followers still had to be killed drakis had no thought except to swing his sword yelling eskkars name at the top of his lungs as he struck and struck at the enemy before him not caring where his blade landed the defenders panicked and thinking themselves outnumbered lost the will to fight caught by surprise in the night their thoughts turned to flight one man died then another before the rest dropped their swords and fled they scrambled to get away shouting for mercy and leaping to the parapet that butted against the side of the tower a fifteenfoot drop to the parapet below those who managed it ran for their lives thanking their gods for their escape one man went over the outer wall into the ditch falling nearly twentyfive feet a scream of pain announced his landing gulping air into his lungs his chest heaving drakis shook his head to clear his mind hed taken the tower looking around he saw bodies strewn about an arrow whistled past his head and he realized that it came from the other tower his excitement disappeared as he ducked down the other tower still remained in enemy hands guarded by men with bows of their own more battle sounds came from below by now most of his men had reached the towers top get down watch for enemy bowmen on the other tower drakis called out as he grabbed one of his men and yanked him to safety below the rampart frustration set in an instant later when he realized enkidu had failed to take the right tower use your bows to clear the top of the other tower then cover the gate make sure it stays closed im going back down shoving his way back into the towers blackness drakis trod carefully down the nowbloody stairs making sure of his footing he reached the bottom in a rush stumbling over the last few steps the base of the tower had no door and little in it except for the steps that wound their way along the walls and up to the battlement he found enkidu and his men standing beside the entrance using their bows shooting at anything that moved what happened why didnt you they blocked the doorway with a table before we could reach it drakis they spoke a strange language must be korthacs men i lost two men trying to force it enkidu paused to take a breath so i ordered the men here damn the gods grunting in rage drakis peered out into the open the plan to take both towers had failed but he could still control the gate with one tower if he could hold it at least he would have all his men together the fire outside still burned but the flames had started to die down enkidu had given him an idea if he could barricade the door with something they could hold both the tower and the gate this tower had no table nothing in fact except for a few blankets strewn on the floor drakis peered out the doorway down the street following the wall toward the north he could just make out the usual carts and tables pushed against their owners houses for the night one object loomed up larger even in the dim lighta country wagon with its wheels nearly as tall as a man if he could bring it here it would make a formidable barrier see that wagon up the lane well drag it here and use it to block the doorway enkidu looked out the opening theyll be shooting at us korthacs fighters are gathering near the other tower their archers are already targeting this entrance as if to give emphasis to enkidus word an arrow clattered off the side of the opening ill go for it ill take three men send some of your men to the top cover us from there hurry ignoring enkidus protests drakis grabbed three men and told them what he planned putting down his bow he stepped close to the doorway and studied the lane confused shouts sounded everywhere and men darted about the cleared space but no one had dared to approach the tower as yet and the lane to the north appeared empty still it wouldnt be long before someone took charge and the counterattack began come he said and burst through the opening running as fast as he could glancing behind him drakis saw his men following and even caught sight of enkidu and another man standing inside the doorway arrows at the ready the wagon stood a good hundred paces from the tower and once there theyd have to push the cumbersome vehicle back breathing hard he reached the wagon and found it facing the wrong direction theyd have to turn it around or it would be even more difficult to get moving drakis ran past the back end of the wagon then knelt and lifted the long wooden tongue grunting at its weight one of his men joined him and together they lifted the heavy wooden trace from the ground and pushed it higher and higher until it fell backward landing on the top of the wagon with a loud crash his other men had already slipped alongside the house wall and started shoving drakis grasped the edge of the front wheel and added his weight slowly with much squeaking and protesting the heavy conveyance began to move as soon as they cleared it from the wall drakis called his men to the rear of the wagon all four of them picked up the back end straining under the weight and simply walked it around so that the wagons front pointed toward the tower put your shoulders into it drakis said his breathing labored from the effort and shoved his body against the rear of the clumsy wagon creaking loudly it started to move drakis cursed himself for not bringing more men two fullgrown oxen normally moved a wagon this size after a few steps it rolled more easily but they couldnt get it going faster than a slow walk and no amount of effort seemed to increase its speed still theyd covered half the distance to the tower before the first sign of anyone noticing their movement an arrow slammed into the wagon with a twang and from its angle drakis guessed it had come from the other tower keep the wagon between us and the tower he commanded and his men shifted a little more to the left another arrow whistled over their heads then a voice cried out from above them look out behind you the warning came from the rooftop beside them where the still halfasleep citizens of akkad had retreated some for safety others to watch the spectacle drakis glanced over his shoulder and saw four men nearly upon them swords flashing as they ran behind us he pulled his sword from its scabbard and lifted it high as he readied himself a few steps before the attackers reached them one of them stumbled and went down a cry of pain echoing through the night drakis saw an arrow sticking in the mans leg it meant one less man and it gave the attackers a moment of hesitation before they struck and by then drakis and his men stood ready swords clashed drakis the fighting madness still on him screamed eskkars name with all his might swinging his sword as he struck back at his attacker mixing thrust and cut with a savagery that put fear into his opponents heart his opponent broke off and ran another lay dead or dying and the last attacker turned and fled into the darkness drakis didnt even pause for breath sword in hand he lowered his back against the wagon and pushed with his legs his heels dug deep ruts into the dirt and he slipped again and again but at least he could watch their rear it took a long moment to get the wagon moving again and now they had to guide it slightly to the left in order to point it toward the towers opening the wagon slowed even more as it turned suddenly it began to move faster and drakis realized two more archers had come from the tower and started pulling on the left front wheel helping the unwieldy wagon along and guiding it straight at the towers entrance that made them easy targets the front of the wagon stood exposed not only to korthacs bowmen in the other tower but to those men drakis saw assembling on the other side of the square he heard an arrow glance off the base of the tower then felt two more shafts strike into the wagon itself then the wagon wheezed past the opening everyone inside drakis followed them in his legs trembling so much from the exertions that he stumbled and nearly fell the fighting and the heavy wagon had drained his strength and he needed a moment to catch his breath he heard enkidu giving orders so he just watched for a moment his second in command had six men struggling with the wagon this time using their efforts to tug one of its great wooden wheels into the doorway one man crawled under the wagon and back out into the lane then swung himself up and into the wagons bed drakis had expected the cart to be empty but now he saw two thick stakes stored there no doubt used to lever the wagon out of mud or soft sand the quickthinking soldier handed them down to enkidu arrows whistling about him before diving headfi rst back into the tower the two lengths of wood as tall as a man would help jam the wagon against the wall drakis leaned against the doorway the wagon blocked the entrance and provided a shield wall to protect his archers his men could defend the tower for now at least he dragged more air into his lungs ready your bowmen enkidu drakis said unlike the rabble hed caught by surprise and driven from this tower drakis knew hed next be facing disciplined egyptian fighters and that real fighting had just begun theyll be coming for us soon unlike the rest of the alehouse patrons enhedu awoke well before the dawn the habit acquired since shed first started watching korthacs house since the egyptian had left that house behind the day he took power enhedu had given up selling her wares the need to watch korthac had passed he ruled here now at least until eskkar returned until then tammuz and she waited glad for the first time that almost no one knew of his real activities nevertheless the habit of early rising remained though now she used the brief interval for another purpose enhedu turned on her side facing tammuz who still slept soundly she couldnt get out of the bed without crawling over him so she decided to wake him that had become a new experience for her not waking a man shed done that often enough for her former master waking tammuz in the last few weeks had become a pleasure instead of the start of a days new degradations she moved closer to him raising herself on one elbow and letting her breast fall upon his bare chest he stirred but didnt wake so she reached between his legs and began stroking him still asleep in moments he grew hard and when she grasped his rising manhood he moaned in pleasure wake up master she said whispering the words into his ear its almost dawn startled he lifted his head but her hand still holding him fast kept him from rising what enhedu he sighed in contentment and let his head fall back on the bed she tightened her grip and began moving her hand up and down since shed saved his life that day when korthac took over her feelings for him had changed grown even deeper and stronger now she wanted to please him care for him keep him as close as possible she still felt the wonder at his gentleness and shed grown bolder and bolder each time they made love unlike her former master tammuz felt different tasted different what had been degrading before had turned into something as exciting as it was pleasurable after a few days of lovemaking she found herself so moist that her juices ran down her thigh now she squeezed him again then leaned over him pushing the blanket away she kissed his erection brushing it with her lips before taking him in her mouth the sounds he made when she did that always excited her and she thrilled at her power over him at his need for her touch and her body this morning would be special she decided and she felt herself growing excited in anticipation suddenly she stopped and sat up in the bed what was that what nothing nothing dont stop no its something she insisted letting go of tammuz men shouting the noise came again louder this time tammuz sat up pushing the blanket to the floor both of them now clearly hearing a clamor of men followed by the blare of a distant trumpet sounding its alarm overhead they heard gatus moving about and knew hed heard the same sounds tammuz swung his legs down and moved away from the bed gatus he called out softly toward the loft what is it she heard the ladder creak then the stars disappeared as the soldiers bulk blocked the opening for a moment before gatus descended the ladder into their room fighting gatus said as he stepped from the fi nal rung men fi ghting near the barracks i heard some calling eskkars name that name had not been spoken aloud in days not since korthacs bloody edict by the time gatus reached their midst enhedu had risen from the bed fumbling in the darkness she found the knife tammuz had given her the thin copper blade sheathed in soft leather fitted to a belt she fastened around her body just under her breasts then she pulled her dress over her head if she walked with her arms crossed the knife was well concealed can he have returned so soon tammuz asked slipping on his tunic and taking up his own blade gatus laughed as he bent down and fastened his sandals eskkar knows how to move fast when he has to no one else could rouse these cowards he must have been on his way here when word reached him korthac has men watching the roads enhedu said they would have sent warning eskkar could have slipped by them gatus grunted he knows the countryside better than anyone as long as hes here it doesnt matter how its time to fight im heading toward the barracks you two stay here he opened the door to the common room and moved rapidly to the alehouse entrance not likely tammuz said behind the old soldiers back already lacing on his own sandals enhedu helped tammuz fasten his belt around his waist by the time tammuz and enhedu left their room half the sleepers had departed awakened by the steadily rising sounds of battle that nearly masked the shouts of eskkars name only the drunks remained still in their stupor from too much ale outside several of tammuzs customers stood beside the alehouse door asking each other what all the commotion was about and talking excitedly to anyone who would listen where shall we go enhedu brushed against tammuz as they stood in the doorway to trellas house we may be of some help there you should stay im going with you enhedu said she knew tammuz didnt want her to come but theyd already discussed that before wherever he went she was determined to be at his side without another word she pushed past him and began walking down the lane heading toward lady trellas house any of you rogues want to fight follow me tammuz called out over his shoulder as he followed after his woman dawn would be upon them soon enhedu realized looking at the fading stars overhead all around them she heard the sounds of people jabbering to each other asking what was happening what they should do over all the noise they heard the sound of people cheering and shouting eskkars name and the occasional clash of weapons tammuz caught up with enhedu taking the lead and weaving his way through the growing crowd three of korthacs men burst out of an alehouse in front of them and stumbled down the lane heading in the same direction the lane soon crossed another and the first man turned left toward the barracks to the right lay the way to eskkars house she watched in horror as tammuz put on a burst of speed overtook the last of the three and plunged his knife into the mans back without pausing tammuz turned to the right leaving the wounded man stumbling along for a few paces before he fell to the earth crying out in pain his two companions disappearing into the darkness never even noticed enhedu ran as fast as she could and managed to keep on tammuzs heels together they turned into the lane to see eskkars house just ahead tammuz stopped suddenly the street was filled with korthacs men most of them egyptians roused from the nearby houses where theyd been housed she watched them rush into eskkars courtyard and the sounds of fighting and men shouting rang out over the walls she caught tammuz by the arm and held him with all her strength you cant there are too many of them she felt frightened that he would rush headlong against them his knife useless against so many swords i see them he said with a curse lets go back they turned and retraced their steps down the lane away from the house overhead the stars were winking out as the first rays of true dawn began to break above them men milled about and she saw two more of the invaders swords in their hands pushing their way through the crowd heading toward eskkars stay behind me tammuz ordered enhedu reached inside her dress pulled the knife from its scabbard and held it against her thigh she felt her heart beating wildly against her ribs tammuz shrank against the wall as the first of korthacs men ran past but pushed himself out into the lane into the second mans path before the cursing egyptian could shove tammuz aside or raise his sword tammuzs knife flashed upward into the mans stomach penetrating just under the rib cage the man grunted as much in surprise as pain at the unexpected blow before the man slid to the ground tammuz had already slipped beyond him rushing down the lane enhedu at his side looking back over her shoulder to make sure no one followed they found an open doorway and stepped within watching the crowd move back and forth everyone shouting and asking each other what to do sounds of fighting increased and enhedu realized the noise was coming from several different directions then she heard furious voices shouting in egyptian and she peered out to see a band of men moving down the lane heading toward the gate she recognized hathors voice rising above the din the mans speech seemed calm and controlled despite the chaos as he gave orders and pushed the men along someone is ordering them toward the gate she said there must be fighting there as well they crouched down as the force of invaders pushed by their doorway breathing hard cursing and yelling at each other before they could do anything another halfdozen or so men ran past following the first group and heading to the gate tammuz pulled his hand free and enhedu knew what he planned when the last of korthacs men passed by tammuz slipped out behind the straggler caught up with him in three strides and struck him down with enough light to see now and to her horror she realized more foreigners were still coming tammuz saw the first one who shouted out in egyptian as he raised his sword and struck tammuz ducked away from the blow took another step back and when the man moved toward him raising his sword with a shout tammuz lunged forward with a blur of motion extending his right arm and burying the knife into the mans chest the man cried out in pain as the sword fell from his grasp tammuzs knife striking true beneath the breastbone but the mortally wounded man collapsed forward his momentum taking him into tammuz and knocking her master backward to the ground enhedu heard the crunch as tammuzs head struck against the base of the wall as he landed stunned with the dead or dying mans body nearly covering him two more egyptians ran up one shouting something incomprehensible to the other one swerved around his fallen comrades and kept going she saw tammuz dazed trying to push the dead man off his chest with his one good hand the second egyptian raised his sword as tammuz still clutching his knife struggled to free himself from beneath the body the collision with the mud wall had stunned him and the knife slipped from his trembling fingers enhedu screamed as she jumped forward raising her knife the man saw her and dodged aside he swung around the sword cutting toward her head she threw herself beneath it rolling in the dirt and landing beside tammuz losing her grip on her own knife in the process she twisted to her knees and threw herself across tammuz getting between him and the egyptian he would have to kill her first she reached for the knife shed dropped but fumbled with the hilt her eyes locked in horror on the man above her watching as the sword swung down toward her head as grond raced up the stairs he heard the clash of swords and the sounds of fi ghting rising from the upper room hed killed two men on the lower floor wasting precious time as his captain disappeared up the stairs luckily he didnt encounter any more guards now reaching the top of the landing grond found the door nearly closed but ajar just as he reached for it the door flew open jerked wide by someone within before grond could react a body slammed into him knocking him backward onto the landing to keep from falling off grond grappled with the man who struggled with surprising strength dropping underneath gronds arms and trying to push him off the landing and break free at the same time grunting grond dropped his sword unable to use it effectively and wrapped both arms around the man they spun around perilously close to the landings edge each man trying to twist free neither able to use a weapon behind him grond heard footsteps on the stairs and men shouting in egyptian enemy soldiers must have gotten past mitrac and entered into the house grond redoubled his efforts to break free instead his foot tripped on something and he fell to his knees his attacker broke his grip and lurched toward the stairs grond flung himself at the man caught his arm and jerked him back wrapping an arm about him off balance the man stumbled but managed to drive a fist into gronds face with a shout of rage grond reached out to grasp his assailant who twisted violently the effort took grond past the edge of the landing and he lost his balance he fell clutching his assailant and taking him with him holding each other they dropped nearly six feet they crashed together onto the long table below its solid planks doing little to break their fall momentum carried them off the table and they rolled onto a bench and then to the floor grond taking most of the impact he felt his breath knocked from his body by the time grond could move his attacker had trod on his chest and reached the front door the man unbarred it shouted for help and vanished into the courtyard cursing the evil luck that took him off the landing he untangled himself from the bench grond struggled to his feet and pulled the knife from his belt to see three egyptians burst through the nowopen front door but an arrow struck the first down he saw mitrac nocking another shaft at the foot of the stairs ignoring this fresh wave of foes grond swung himself onto the steps cover me he could just make out two more of korthacs men on the top landing one of them pounding on the door with his sword hilt and shouting in egyptian they must have rushed up the stairs while he and the unknown man had fallen from the landing for the first time grond realized that someone had secured the door again the other man heard gronds footsteps and turned toward him swinging his sword with a swift motion no doubt expecting to strike before grond could get close enough to use the knife instead one of mitracs arrows feathered itself in the mans shoulder knocking him off balance and the sword dropped from his hand grond scooped the bronze blade up with his left hand and stepped over the dying man grond thrust low with the sword his face brushing the topmost step as the other egyptian deflected the blade aside still moving forward grond shoved his knife into the mans leg eliciting a grunt of pain the mans counterthrust met only air as grond jerked his body away the egyptian took a step back but his leg gave way and he tumbled down right in front of gronds knife a quick stab finished the man grond give us room mitrac had climbed the landing and now stood beside grond but turned his attention downward toward the main entrance grond saw mitrac had to tilt his long bow to the side as he attempted to notch another arrow a second archer stood on a lower step and two more of eskkars men began backing slowly up the stairs as dark shadows slipped through the outer doorway toward them gathering for the attack grond moved aside to give mitrac room then bent over and pitched the dead bodies off the landing with two quick heaves before turning his gaze back to the door open the door he heard the rasp of bronze from within its grond he pounded on the door with his sword hilt then threw his shoulder against it but the door held firm hed seen the thick panels enough times to know it couldnt be forced not without tools or more men an arrow thudded into the wood beside gronds head ripping out a lock of hair as it passed and he heard mitracs bowstring twang in response grond knew he didnt have time to force the door not with all these egyptians rushing toward him eskkar had found a way inside somehow and might be trapped there but grond couldnt do anything about it he looked down toward the dim chamber below gray silhouettes milled about just outside the houses entrance shouting in the language of egypt theyd be joining those inside soon he knew grond and mitrac would have to hold the stairs until help came take the top mitrac he ordered and moved down the steps past his men his sword in one hand the knife in the other let them come to their deaths he repeated the words in egyptian this time as he tightened his grip on the sword a fresh wave of men burst into the house from the courtyard as grond reached the bottom of the steps some carried spears deadly weapons at close quarters especially against swordsmen packed together one of mitracs arrows struck down the leading spearman the spear fell from its owners dying hand and skidded along the floor to land at gronds feet dropping his sword he scooped it up just in time to meet the charge eskkar has returned he shouted lunging forward with the weapon and mitracs archers took up the cry firing arrows as fast as they could fit them to their strings as the battle for eskkars house began inside the workroom eskkar lunged with his sword but korthac knocked the blade aside and in the same motion drove his blade toward eskkars face surprised at the speed and strength of korthacs arm eskkar barely managed to jerk his head aside as the weapons point stung its way past his ear he moved back a step recovering his guard and keeping his sword in front of him the clash of swords behind him reminded eskkar he had little time my men are behind you barbarian youll be dead soon like your ignoring korthacs words eskkar lunged again this time trying to thrust low under korthacs guard but korthac countered the stroke easily and for a second time eskkar barely managed to avoid being skewered by the counterstroke and again he moved back half a step he realized that he faced a master swordsman you fight like a clumsy ox barbarian outlined against the flickering lamp korthacs face was a dark shadow and his voice sounded like that of a demon from the underworld eskkar knew better than to listen to his opponent to let himself be distracted by the mans words then cut down by a sudden thrust man or demon the sword would finish him moving to the side eskkar snapped the long sword out thrusting with every muscle to keep his arm rigid and the blade straight korthac parried the lunge but had to move aside to do so eskkar never paused he thrust again and again short quick jabs aiming for the mans face his stomach even his legs any part of the body using the sword like a lance striking as fast and hard as he could at any opening never stopping never giving his adversary the chance to counterattack it was the way to beat a superior swordsman and here inside the house and with no space to swing the long horse sword he knew korthac had the edge so instead of trying for a killing blow eskkar used his blades tip jabbing it at his opponent so fast that korthac had no time to strike back wound and weaken your enemy a dozen cuts would bring down any man as sure as one fatal thrust his clan fought that way the barbarian way your slut begged at my feet for a chance to pleasure me this time the words sounded rushed the foreign accent stronger eskkar shook the sweat from his eyes watching his foe for any weakness korthac retreated a step weaving lightly from side to side striving to get past the sword tip that kept jabbing at his face and neck waiting for eskkar to tire and leave himself vulnerable to a solid counterstroke eskkar kept advancing taking small steps and keeping his balance sliding his feet across the floor to avoid stumbling on something jabbing and lunging turning aside korthacs counters and gradually forcing his enemy back toward the center of the room suddenly korthac dropped low swinging his sword at eskkars legs the unexpected maneuver stopped eskkars advance for a moment and in that instant korthac leapt backward abandoning the attack and darting through the door that led into the bedchamber the egyptian slipped through the opening and tried to fling the door shut but eskkar reacting almost as fast as his enemy rammed his blade into the door keeping it open before korthac could bring his weight to bear and seal the door then eskkar threw his shoulder and all his weight against the panel just as korthacs second effort tried to force the door shut eskkars bulk and momentum drove the door back into korthacs face the egyptian staggered back with a curse knocking over a small table and sending a water jar crashing to the floor as eskkar struggled to force his way inside the bedroom off balance korthac brought up his sword but with no time to swing the blade he tried to hammer the hilt into eskkars face eskkar caught his attackers wrist in his left hand enough to deflect the blow but the pommels rough edge ripped along eskkars head and a splash of blood spattered against the doorjamb eskkar dropped his useless sword and reached for korthacs throat with his right hand before eskkar could grasp korthacs neck the egyptian caught his hand and held it with a grip of bronze struggling and twisting they stumbled back into the outer room grunting and gasping for breath as they fought they thudded hard into the wall sliding along its smooth surface the egyptian moving so quickly that eskkar couldnt get any leverage korthac still held his sword in his right hand and he kept trying to free his wrist from eskkars grasp korthac stood a good foot shorter in height but to eskkars surprise the egyptians muscles not only resisted his own but nearly managed to bring the blade back into play they crashed against the table sending it skidding across the floor with a loud screech eskkars leg took the brunt of the collision but he shouted in rage and forced the smaller man back by sheer strength suddenly korthac smashed his forehead into eskkars cheek with such force that eskkar almost let his grip slip on the mans sword arm eskkar knew hed be dead the instant his enemy got the sword into play turning his face away to avoid another headbutt they struggled again twisting and grunting eskkar spun on his heel using all his strength to unbalance korthac nevertheless korthac kept his feet and the two of them slammed into the wall bounced off then crashed back into the halfopen door of the inner room this time they fell through the opening and landed in a heap on the floor another lamp burned here giving off a dimmer light that barely illuminated the smaller room eskkar caught sight of trella crawling on the floor eskkar the baby she cried out pain sounding in her voice trella said something more but eskkar couldnt make out her words the babys wailing added to the confusion eskkar rammed korthacs hand against the doorframe and grunted in satisfaction when he heard the mans sword clatter on the floor eskkar must have loosed his grip on korthacs wrist for in the next moment the egyptian had twisted his wrist from eskkars grasp and lunged away eskkar tried to rise but he slipped on the wet floor korthac reached his feet first a knife appearing in his hand as he moved forward weaving quickly from side to side like a snake readying to strike reaching for his knife eskkar found the sheath empty the blade lost in the struggle weaponless eskkar moved back his hands extended but he found himself forced backward into a corner now youll die barbarian korthac said his voice hoarse from effort but as korthac stepped past trellas prone body she lifted herself on one hand and eskkar saw her drive a small knife into korthacs calf korthac flinched in pain he looked down then slashed at trella with the knife but eskkar needed no better opening the instant trella struck he rushed the man covering the short distance between them so fast that korthac couldnt react fast enough once again eskkar caught korthacs wrist as their bodies crashed together and they tumbled heavily to the floor and this time it was korthac who landed on his back eskkar found his face pressed against korthacs stomach as the man squirmed writhing along the floor striving to get away and at the same time attempting to force his knife into eskkars side they struggled rolling back and forth across the floor eskkar lunged forward and clamped his right hand on korthacs neck and squeezed trying to choke the man enough to weaken his hold on the knife theyd jammed themselves against the wall near trellas dressing table from above their heads the baby continued to cry its tiny wails competing with the mens grunts of rage korthacs free hand searched eskkars face trying to find his eyes but eskkar ground his face deeper into the mans stomach as he dragged himself up the shifting body and closer to korthacs face the egyptian used his feet and knees snapping them up and down with all the force he could muster searching for eskkars groin all the while trying to dislodge eskkars hold on his knife hand with a savage heave korthac loosened eskkars grip enough to bring the knife into play the egyptians blade seared along eskkars arm but the pain only enraged eskkar and he redoubled his efforts against the man whod seized his wife and threatened his child eskkar tightened his grip on korthacs right wrist putting all his force into squeezing the mans bones together harder and harder as the blood pounded in eskkars ears korthac twisted and jerked his arm but he couldnt break eskkars grip and with a low gasp his fingers dropped the knife instantly eskkar released his grip on the mans neck and levered himself up onto korthacs chest using his weight to keep the man pinned to the floor korthacs fingers groped for the knife and managed to grasp it but eskkar with a brutal surge slammed his knee onto korthacs forearm pinning his foes right arm against the floor eskkar shifted his weight caught korthacs other wrist then raised his fist and struck the egyptian in the face with his left hand once twice a third time the third blow slowed his opponent and gave eskkar the chance he needed he heaved his other leg up and used it to pin korthacs free arm the smaller man now had eskkars full weight upon his body and eskkar took only a moment to draw back his fist and strike korthac with his right fi st this blow driven with all eskkars pentup rage stunned his opponent before the man could recover eskkar seized korthac by the hair pinning korthacs head to the floor while with his other hand eskkar smashed him again and again aiming each blow at korthacs left eye putting all his force and hatred into the attack at the fifth blow the man went limp taking no chances that his opponent feigned unconsciousness eskkar raised his fist like a hammer and pounded the heel of his hand against korthacs forehead a burst of blood splattered up but the man lay still eskkar gasped for breath the blood pounding in his head every muscle trembling with exhaustion never had he fought such an enemy before he searched for korthacs knife groping along the floor with clumsy fingers until he found it then grabbed it by the bloody blade the weapon shook in his hand eskkar reversed it and put the tip against korthacs throat only then did he lean back and gulp air into his lungs still astride korthacs chest he took a quick look over his shoulder their bedroom still lit by the oil lamp that somehow remained upright during the struggle showed trella on the floor a few feet away her body shuddering she pulled herself toward eskkar a tiny bloody dagger still in her hand but she could scarcely move and her sobs had joined with the sounds of the baby crying the sight of her made eskkar want to plunge the blade into korthacs throat but the thought that he might need the egyptian alive stayed his hand korthac appeared unconscious but eskkar wanted to make certain he jabbed the tip of the knife into korthacs throat just enough to draw blood the man didnt react so eskkar raised the weapon and struck down on the mans forehead with the hilt the egyptians body stayed limp satisfied that his enemy wouldnt be moving for at least a few moments eskkar pushed himself to his feet his legs trembled and blood from the side of his head still dripped on his chest joining with the blood that fl owed from the cut on his arm and all the scratches on his face from korthacs efforts to gouge out his eyes eskkar lifted his shoulder to wipe the blood from his face on his tunic and felt the muscles in his arms twitch from the strain of the fight it took a moment before he could see clearly taking a deep breath he reached down and gathered trella with one arm and lifted her from the floor keeping his eyes on korthac he guided trella back onto the bed easing her down she struggled to speak but her body shook as much from the tears as from her wound blood flowed from an ugly cut above her hip and he took her hand and pressed it against the wound keep your hand steady trella he said ill get help looking around the room he saw the stool that normally sat before trellas dressing table knocked on its side it lay against the wall he scooped it up and keeping it on its side lifted korthacs left foot and slid the stool underneath it then eskkar raised his sandal and smashed it down on the mans shin eskkar grunted with satisfaction as he heard the bones break thats for trella and my child egyptian he said for the first time eskkar felt certain korthac wouldnt be doing any more fighting tonight even if he regained consciousness any time soon eskkar eskkar is the child all right he had to strain to make out the words but he understood her uplifted arm that pointed toward the stillwailing child he realized she still held the small knife covered with korthacs blood in her hand taking it from her fingers eskkar dropped it next to her on the bed his breathing slowed and he started moving with more confidence eskkar stepped over to the cradle he picked up his crying child hands still clumsy with fatigue keeping korthacs knife in his hand eskkar carried the infant carefully to trella stay here dont try to move looking down at her stomach and legs he saw more blood and fear went through him are you wounded where else no not wounded the baby your son he came only a few hours ago i was she hadnt realized that she had taken a cut across her hip from korthacs blade blood oozed from the cut seeping between her fingers but she kept her hand pressed tight against her side where hed placed it she sounded weak and the wound needed bandaging dont get up he repeated ill be back korthacs knife still clutched in his hand he stepped into the workroom the fl ame from the lamp in the outer room burned low and didnt provide much light but eskkar picked it up and held it aloft only two bodies greeted his eyes the dead egyptian bodyguard lay where hed fallen but annoksurs body had moved she lay motionless directly in front of the outer door now shut and bolted ariamus had vanished annoksur must have closed and barred the door with the last of her strength before she passed out eskkar set the lamp down retrieved his sword from the floor and put it on the table sounds of fighting came from beyond the door and reminded him that he had left grond and the others behind and that he might not have much time he lifted annoksur from the floor and she groaned at his touch as he carried her back to the bedroom she started to struggle in his arms rest easy annoksur its eskkar can you stand yes i think yes he felt her relax saw her head start to sag dont faint yet he ordered practically shouting the words into her face as he lowered her feet to the floor he needed her conscious annoksur nodded and eskkar set her down inside the bedroom and let her lean against the wall bar the door and dont open it bandage trellas wound before she bleeds to death eskkar put korthacs knife in her hand and watched her eyes narrow at the sight of the prone egyptian no not until weve finished killing these vermin can you do that just watch korthac after youve tended to trella keep the knife at his throat if he moves or anyone tries to force the door then kill him he pulled the door shut behind him and scooped up his sword before crossing the outer room behind him he heard annoksur drop the wooden bar into place the women would be safe in there for now ariamuss sword lay near the entrance annoksurs body had hidden it he picked it up with his left hand and went to the door taking a deep breath he lifted up the thick bar and yanked the door open shouts and the twang of a bowstring sounded through the doorway and the backs of mitrac and another archer filled the opening both heads swiveled just long enough to see who stood behind them he had to squeeze behind mitrac to get out onto the landing dawn had arrived and light filtered through the open doorway and windows to illuminate the scene below the landing had barely enough space to hold the three of them mitrac stood beside eskkar bow drawn blood pouring down his left arm eskkar saw that only two arrows remained in his quiver on the top steps two more archers crouched extending swords that passed on either side of gronds body for protection empty quivers on their belts explained the swords his bodyguard wielded a sword and a spear and kept at bay three or four rogues on the lower steps five or six more foes waited below just inside the door to the courtyard preparing for another rush bodies lay strewn about on the floor and steps arrows protruding from most of them eskkar took another quick look down as the others below looked up one of them called out something in egyptian but all eskkar understood was korthacs name korthac is dead eskkar snarled putting all his rage into the words everyone froze at the news eskkar raised his voice even louder and bellowed out his words so that even those outside the house would hear them korthac is dead eskkar extended the long sword in his right hand pointing at those beneath him the blade stained with blood as if in proof fury possessed him the same emotion that had filled him as he fought against the egyptian korthac is dead and now you will all die as well without any hesitation he ducked underneath mitracs arm and jumped off the landing his feet aiming for a clear space directly under the stairs eskkar went to one knee from the jump but he rose up swinging the big sword as the fi rst of korthacs men rushed toward him grond shouted a war cry and led the way down the steps the others following with a weapon in each hand and the battle frenzy upon him eskkar attacked korthacs suddenly disheartened followers the long sword struck one man across the face and eskkar parried a counterstroke from another attacker with the short sword in his left hand then struck again with his right wielding the heavy blade with renewed energy the unexpected counterattack unnerved the egyptians despite their greater numbers two of them bolted for the open door and the rest hesitated gronds war cry boomed again within the room and eskkar heard the snaphiss as the last of mitracs arrows struck his target within a dozen heartbeats four men had died and the rest of korthacs men fled into the courtyard driven back by half their number more men gathered there getting ready to join the assault nevertheless many heard eskkars words and more than a few of korthacs men began repeating that korthac was dead one of the akkadians took advantage of the enemys confusion to slam the front door shut and drop the bar across it the servants entrance secure the door grond gave the order though his voice sounded weak eskkar faced grond and saw blood covering his bodyguards neck and chest the man was swaying on his feet mitrac eskkar said the other door better see if its closed and barred the master archer raced down the corridor to bar the second entrance while the other two archers moved from body to body wrenching arrows out of the dead to replenish their quivers eskkar put his arm around gronds waist and guided him toward the stairs rest here a moment eskkar ordered taking a deep breath eskkar forced himself to control his shaking arms he had only three men who could still fight if the egyptians forced the outer door eskkar could retreat to the upper rooms he took stock of the situation hed reached trella and both she and the baby were safe and captured korthac they could hold the house for the moment now everything depended on bantor and his men if they failed if they couldnt come to eskkars rescue in time eskkar planned to use korthac to bargain his way out if that didnt work if the egyptians broke in eskkar would kill trella and the child with his own hand before falling on his sword no matter what happened he couldnt let either of them fall into these foreigners hands alive he shook the gloomy thought away he wasnt dead yet theyd just have to hold out until help arrived shove that table against the door eskkar ordered reaching down to pick up a spear it was time to get ready for the next fight hathor woke with a start the unexpected but always familiar sound still echoing in his ears instinctively he grasped the sword that lay on the bed next to him the noise that had awakened him resolved itself into a mixture of men shouting and the occasional clash of bronze on bronze the din rising and falling but steadily growing louder and more urgent already on his feet he moved to the window leaning outside to hear what was happening the last of his sleep disappeared as he peered through the darkness toward the adjoining dwelling the noise came from korthacs courtyard separated from the one hathor and takany occupied by only a single high wall that extended to either side of the main structure a man screamed in pain the cry of agony rising up over the shouts and curses men were dying just beyond the wall and that meant someone had attacked korthac and his guards no alarm had sounded but fighting had erupted his mind finally made sense of the shouts eskkar has returned hathor felt a chill pass over him eskkar he was supposed to be dead osiris take us all he swore pausing only to pull on his tunic before dashing out of the bedroom eskkar has returned let none escape the shouts from korthacs courtyard could now be heard even inside the dwelling takany hathor shouted stepping into the common room korthacs second in command slept in the next bedroom takany get up hathor shouted into the darkness moving inside the mans chamber takany lay in his bed still snoring and besotted from last nights drinking and wenching hed spent the first part of the evening at zenobias terrorizing her and her women and forcing all of them to pleasure him hathor had to remain awake until his superior returned and takany had brought one of zenobias women with him leading the shivering girl naked through the streets now she sat up no doubt frightened and confused by hathors interruption and the noise outside what whats happening fear sounded in her voice ignoring the wideeyed girl hathor grabbed takanys arm shaking the man out of his sleep get up theres fighting next door without waiting hathor moved toward the doorway the halfdozen soldiers sleeping in the house had already gotten to their feet fumbling for weapons in the dark and asking each other what to do sound the alarm hathor ordered pushing his way through the gathering crowd get your swords and follow me to korthacs the front entrance of this residence opened directly into the lane that provided access to korthacs compound hathor ran down the passage stumbling once in the darkness and wishing hed had time to put on his sandals behind him a trumpet at last began to sound its warning the shrill blast repeating the notes that would summon every soldier the guards supposed to be standing sentry at korthacs gate were lying in the dust arrows protruding from their bodies clenching his sword hathor pushed his way through the gate someone had lit a torch and in its flickering light hathor saw half a dozen bodies strewn about the courtyard arrows jutting out at odd angles hathor a soldier called out amuns dead men forced their way through the gate they got inside the house and drove us out theyve archers amun had been in charge of the soldiers stationed in the courtyard enough hathor said get your men together and make sure theyve all their weapons guard the doors dont let anyone leave whats going on takanys booming voice cut through the confusion he hadnt bothered to put on a tunic and now he stood naked and barefoot a sword in his hand the soldier had to repeat the story while hathor twitched with impatience you say this eskkar is inside alone with korthac yes thats what he just said hathor wanted to shout but he knew better than to challenge takanys authority even if the mans thought process was as slow as an ox precious moments passed while takany sorted things out you fools takany said his rage displacing any remaining trace of last nights wine you let a handful of men drive you from the house he grabbed a man backing away from the house and struck him with the flat of his sword get in there and fight he ordered hathor gather the men well break down the door to the upper room and free korthac before anyone could start moving a man burst in through the gate and every mans eyes turned toward him takany hathor he shouted stumbling as he reached their side and trying to catch his breath men are attacking the main gate theyve captured one of the towers and barricaded themselves in theyre shouting that eskkar has returned to kill us all order the men from the gate to fall back and meet us at the barracks hathor said facing takany we should head there as well we need to collect all our forces in one place then we can leave korthac abandon the gate takany shouted as if disbelieving his ears if they get the gate open well have a horde of men pouring into the city eskkars soldiers are already in the city hathor countered and our men are scattered all about we need to get the men together and no we need to rescue korthac now takany snapped he grabbed hathor by the arm you take a dozen men and go to the gate take ariamus takany pointed with his sword across the courtyard and half his scum with you too if he and his men wont fight kill him ill recapture the house and free korthac you make sure the gate stays shut hathor looked across the courtyard to where ariamus stood surrounded by a dozen of his men getting his arm bandaged ariamus is it really eskkar hathor had to raise his voice to carry over the babble of noise though ariamus stood only a dozen paces away yes its him ariamus said he was fighting korthac and his guard when i saw them last takany was right about ariamus and his men hathor realized the traitor had recruited most of these boasting thieves and bandits and the weaklings wouldnt charge into battle without ariamuss orders hathor wanted to know more about eskkar and ariamus but couldnt take the time now hathor hesitated but one look told him it would be futile to argue takanys decision might be wrong but theyd wasted too much precious time arguing over what to do next the man feared nothing that walked the earth or under it for that matter except korthac takany knew his masters wrath would be on him for this failure only this evening at dinner hathor had listened while takany assured korthac of the citys complete submission now korthac might already be dead according to ariamus the upper door was bolted and unknown archers defended the steps to the bedroom by now the whole city had awakened and half of them had already taken to the rooftops to shout eskkars name better a bad plan than none at all hathor decided knowing there was nothing he could do all right takany you free korthac hathor turned to the messenger still awaiting instructions get back to the gate tell them im bringing reinforcements and to make ready to recapture the tower make sure the gate stays closed no matter what the man nodded and ran out of the courtyard ill take my men to the barracks ariamus had joined them a fresh bandage on his arm how did this happen takany shouted pushing himself right in ariamuss face how did you dont try and blame this on me your egyptians were supposed to be guarding korthac ariamus yelled right back when eskkar walked right into the workroom your men are the ones who failed stop it hathor said forcing his way between the two of them weve no time for this korthacs either trapped inside or hes dead either way weve got to put down this uprising he pushed ariamus away from takany no doubt saving the mans life one more word and takany would have gutted him hathor had witnessed takanys rage before we should go to the barracks ariamus said the extra weapons are stored there hathor detected a hint of fear in ariamuss voice something had unhinged the man made him eager to get away from this house take half your men to the gate hathor said tell the rest to obey takany no arguing just go ariamus opened his mouth as if to argue then shrugged ill get them moving he strode off shouting out orders to his men and dividing them up in moments they started gathering at the entrance to the courtyard takany had heard something in ariamuss voice too kill him when this is over takany ordered his voice cold with fury i dont want to see him alive again understand the coward will sell us out the first chance he gets takany turned away and readied his own fighters for the push to regain the house hathor did the same grabbing the first twelve men he saw and ordering them to follow he performed a quick check to see that they carried bows as well as their swords by then ariamuss men had departed disappearing out into the lane hathor ordered his own men to follow before he passed through the gate he took one last look at the courtyard takany had organized his force of about twenty men in a few moments hed begin the assault on the house hathor stepped out into the lane and began running he hoped he wouldnt need those twenty men at the gate bantor raced toward the barracks days of being cooped up hiding from his enemies and unsure of what to do had filled him with rage thoughts of ariamus tormented his mind day and night since the ambush ariamus who had taken his wife for an afternoons diversion ariamus who ambushed and embarrassed him in front of his men ariamus who had laughed at him a dozen times in the old days bantor swore once again to see his nemesis dead preferably by slow roasting over hot coals the man must die and more with him bantor planned to avenge himself and his men killed in the ambush the faster he liberated the barracks the sooner he could begin hunting ariamus bantor had been the first man to reach the river gate but by then yavtar and alexar had taken care of most of those guarding it bantors men finished off the rest leaving him no one to kill he waited but a moment until certain all of his men passed inside before moving ahead through the twisted lanes straight toward the barracks his sword clenched tight in his hand he yearned to encounter his enemy halting before the last turn he let his men catch up counting himself bantor only had twentyfour soldiers since hed left alexar and yavtar to hold the river gate according to rebba there were at least forty or fifty egyptians at the barracks along with another twenty or thirty misfits recruited by ariamus to have any chance against such odds bantor needed not only to set free the prisoners but to capture the weapons storehouse as much to deny korthacs men access to them for all this to work bantor had to catch his enemy by surprise keeping within the shadows he peered around the corner the soldiers barracks a collection of low huts formed into a halfcircle around the training ground looked peaceful enough the remains of a watch fire flickered a few paces outside the leftmost structure a handful of guards standing around it farthest away and facing him he could just make out at least four guards walking posts at the smaller barracks the building that according to rebba held the prisoners most of korthacs men slept in the main barracks the only structure large enough in akkad to hold so many men bantor saw three more guards a few paces from the barracks entrance tending the fire that now barely glowed as soon as dawn rose those guards would wake the sleeping foreigners inside so bantor had to move now one guard looked toward the lane that led to the river gate no doubt curious about the occasional shout coming from that direction but not yet curious enough to sound the alarm were ready klexor said moments later his voice a whisper in bantors ear take your men straight to the small barracks bantor said free the prisoners ignore everything else ill take care of the egyptians bantor had given klexor ten of the men leaving himself with only fourteen to face the egyptians good hunting then klexor whispered as he strung a shaft to his bow bantor took a deep breath and broke into a run heading straight at the fire the moment the first guard looked up bantor voiced his battle cry eskkar has returned death to the invaders behind him his men took up the war cry heavy feet pounding the dirt in the lane the guard tending the fire reacted slowly staring wideeyed into the darkness for a moment before fumbling for his weapon the mans sword hadnt even cleared its scabbard when bantor cut him down feeling the blade hed sharpened each day bite deep into the mans shoulder wrenching it free he whirled on the next man blocking his stroke and slashing at his face the first screams of the night pierced the air mixing with the confused shouts of disoriented men bantors soldiers pushed past him and the last guard broke and ran ducking back into the barracks the main barracks capable of domiciling forty men housed korthacs foreigners bantor ran toward the opening just as a handful of men stumbled out the door weapons in hand an arrow killed one in the doorway then bantor reached the egyptians swinging his sword with fury and striking at every man in his path the foreigners still half asleep pushed their way through the barracks door by sheer force of numbers and attempted to form a line but arrows fl ew from out of the shadows cutting them down before they could organize themselves at such close range the archers had little need to aim and the lethal shafts flew off their bowstrings with such rapidity that the egyptians thought they faced a hundred archers his fury raging and ignoring the arrows flashing past his head bantor fought his way through determined to fight his way into the barracks with each kill he shouted eskkars name the egyptians recoiled before battlecrazed bantor and his men abandoning the effort to form a battle line five more of the enemy died before they managed to retreat back into the barracks and slam the door shut cursing bantor threw himself against the door but it didnt move and he knew at least half a dozen men stood behind it holding it fast he heard the sounds of pallets being shoved against the door from within a trumpet rang out sending its muffled warning notes into the night waking the city and announcing to all that akkad was under attack bantor glanced about him as his men bows drawn watched the two narrow ventilation windows set high in the wall the surprise attack had trapped the egyptian fighters inside and now bantor was determined to keep these foes penned in stepping away from the barracks entrance he looked first down the lane then at klexors men in the lane he saw no one certainly no armed and trained reinforcements rushing to aid korthacs men less than fifty paces away klexor and his bowmen poured arrows into anything that moved attacking the smaller barracks bantor saw men running away into the darkness a good sign for now bantor had to hope that klexors force succeeded hed felt certain that at least half of the bandits and farmers recruited from the countryside by ariamus and quartered in the two smaller structures would flee at the first sign of trouble some toward eskkars house others toward the main gate they didnt matter not right now bantor had to destroy these egyptians before they could organize a defense or escape surround the barracks they may try to break through the wall get to the roof bantor shouted use fire on the roof burn them out dont let any escape hurry a soldier raced to the fire pit and began tossing more wood on the fire the low flames dimmed for a few moments then the fresh wood caught and the flames began to build the archers fanned out all of them facing the structure with their bows ready the barracks had only the one entrance and the single window on the opposite side was too small for a man to climb through shouts of rage came from within the barracks bantor couldnt believe his luck hed trapped forty or so of these egyptians in a single building if he could hold them there a few moments longer cover the door he shouted and get some archers on that roof he pointed with his sword at the soldiers storehouse a smaller structure open on two sides battleaxes shields spears and other weapons were stacked within only a few paces away from the main barracks meanwhile the watch fire crackled under its load of fresh fuel and thick smoke began to trail up into the sky already showing a rosy glow to the east it wouldnt be long before the flames took hold the barracks door suddenly flew open three arrows flashed out into the akkadian line one shaft flew right past bantors ear and an archer two steps away groaned and fell to the ground his men returned the fi re but the door had already been pulled closed leaving nearly a dozen shafts protruding from the wooden portal bantor opened his mouth to berate his men but theyd already adjusted some cursing at themselves others shifting positions and readying for the next attack theyd not be caught so easily next time bantor is it you he turned to find three men stumbling toward him it took a moment before he recognized jarack and two other hawk clan members from eskkars household guard they appeared unsteady and marks from the lash covered their nearly naked bodies give us weapons bantor jarack demanded his hand on bantors arm we can fight take charge of those weve freed bantor said arm yourself from the storehouse bring out shields and spears for my men well need them in a moment no we want bantor grabbed jarack by the arm and pushed him toward the storehouse go the barracks door flew open again but this time bantors archers were ready their arrows flew into the darkened interior only one shaft aimed high came out but a wave of men burst out the ones in front carrying shields and they hurled themselves toward the akkadians shouting war cries from the storehouse roof above them four archers who had just reached their positions fi red their shafts into the korthacs fi ghters backs knocking down the first two shielded men emerging from the barracks that gave bantors archers more targets they brought down another two men before the leader of the charging egyptians reached bantors sword he caught the savage overhand thrust on his own weapon then used one of eskkars favorite tactics stepping forward and slamming his shoulder in the mans shield halting the mans advance before the man could regain either his balance or his momentum bantors short sword swept over the top of the shield and thrust deep into the mans chest at the base of the neck with a scream the man dropped his sword clutching at his wound wrenching his blade free bantor faced another attacker but this man was already dying another shaft flashing down from the storehouse roof into the mans back their charge broken before most of them got clear of the doorway and their leader dead the egyptians fell back once again to their barracks again the door slammed shut leaving one cursing man trapped outside pounding on the door for entry before two shafts in his back brought him down the body slumped directly before the opening and bantor grunted in satisfaction the egyptians would have to step over their own dead to reach his men next time bantor the fires ready a voice called out burn the roof then jarack returned carrying a large wooden shield and three spears another three or four former prisoners carrying similar burdens behind him more men appeared all carrying weapons of one sort or another and bantor realized some villagers had entered the compound and helped themselves to the same weapons supply the first firebrand mounted up into the sky to fall downward onto the barracks roof another followed in its trail then more smoked their way onto the roof flung by the hands of arriving villagers these alighted on the structure and the mix of wood and straw ignited almost at once fresh fire shot up into the sky bantor glanced down at the ground before him counting the dead egyptians eight bodies lay in the dirt most with arrows protruding from them three carried shields something that wouldnt normally be kept in the crowded barracks so the egyptians had their swords and knives a few bows and not much else another villager arrived this one carrying a spear he knelt on the ground right beside an archer angling the spear point up protecting the bowman and no doubt well trained in how to rise up and thrust the weapon at any charging foe another villager arrived and did the same and bantor saw jarack standing back at the storehouse directing more villagers while he handed out more weapons with a loud snapping noise a wave of fire engulfed the barracks roof and the bright flames added their light to the deepening dawn klexor arrived bringing most of his archers with him the prisoners are free bantor he shouted already having to raise his voice over the crackle of flames we lost a few men but the rabble fled spread your men out bantor ordered get a few more up on the storehouse roof the egyptians will be coming out soon bantor saw nearly twenty liberated soldiers stumbling behind alexar most of them looked exhausted and scarcely able to stand weakened by long hours of slave labor with little food give them your bows bantor ordered even in their weakened condition these men would still be able to loose a shaft at this distance a bowman didnt need to draw back an arrow very far he stepped away from the front line and took a moment to look around him more towns people were joining the fi ght carrying makeshift weapons or swords they obtained one way or another the freed prisoners would help too if the blaze didnt roast the egyptians alive his men shooting down into the house would start killing them korthacs vaunted fighters were going to be slaughtered klexor finish off the ones here ill take my men and head toward eskkars house follow when you can calling out to his men bantor turned and jogged off half the soldiers falling in reluctantly behind him they wanted to see the egyptians burn the first section of the roof fell into the barracks mixing with the screams of men trapped beneath the burning sections from the rooftops the archers began firing shooting at anything that moved inside bantor ignored it all shouting for his men to follow him ariamus wasnt inside bantor would have recognized the mans bellow anywhere this time bantor ran as hard as he could twelve of his original fourteen men close on his heels the alarm had sounded and now speed mattered more than anything else men would be fighting at eskkars house and korthacs men would be rallying there bantor hoped he had enough men a man sword in hand stepped out of a house into his path bantor struck him down hardly slowing and not caring if he were friend or foe every moment counted he must get to eskkars house if ariamus wasnt at the barracks he would be there or nearby bantor knew the mans character ariamus would look to his leader korthac for direction hed fight hard enough but only while he felt certain he could win the moment the fight became too risky ariamus would do what he always did when danger got too closemelt away into the darkness this time bantor intended to make sure the wily former captain of the guard didnt get away so bantor pushed the pace covering the narrow lanes his sword flashing up and down in the moonlight while behind him his men filled the streets with their battle cries eskkar has returned let none escape eskkar counted on him to break into the compound eskkar and his handful of men if they still lived couldnt hold out long not against all of korthacs fighters quartered there faster men he shouted lifting the sword high to lead the way drakis watched as enkidu and his men used the stakes taken from the wagon to brace the bottom of the carts wheel levering it halfway into the opening creating an effective barrier against anyone trying to enter satisfied that the wagon couldnt simply be pulled aside enkidu turned toward him are you wounded drakis no just out of breath can you hold the base of the tower yes for now theyll not be able to force it easily if our archers can cover us from the top of the tower leave me five men and take the rest up top is that enough to hold here any more would just get in the way enkidu said and we found some spears in the corner spears could be even more effective than swords at closequarters fighting taking a precious moment to clasp enkidu on the shoulder drakis turned toward the steps as enkidus men kept shoving and pushing trying to wedge the wagon tighter into the tower entrance by now most of the front wheel stood inside the opening enkidu was right even with plenty of men the wagon wouldnt be easy to drag aside especially if defended already two men had taken up their bows standing ready on either side of the barricade searching for targets another returned lugging an armful of spears then leaned them against the wall ready for use hold them off enkidu send word if you need help leaving five men with enkidu drakis led the rest back up the stairs warning them to keep their heads low when they emerged on the battlement to his surprise the nights darkness had given way to dawns first light and he looked toward the east to see rays of gold pushing up into the sky the sun itself just below the horizon the streets below remained dark sheltered from the rising sun by the wall and tower an arrow hissed over his head on the battlement tarok drakiss second in command and a seasoned veteran had organized the men all of them crouched below the battlement facing the opposite tower weve lost two men drakis one dead and the other has an arrow in his arm useless but weve killed five or six of them they must be korthacs egyptians tarok sneaked a quick look over the battlement for a moment then turned back to his leader whats happening below weve blocked the entrance with a wagon enkidu will hold the doorway if we can support him from here were almost ready to begin tarok said ive been waiting for dawn so we could see them better theyll make easy targets you keep watching the ones below drakis looked eastward a rosy red glow lit the horizon and the suns edge would be flooding the land with light any moment now he took a quick count of the men counting himself he had fifteen archers who could draw a bow in a soft voice tarok explained to the latest arrivals what he planned to do then he arranged the men in two ranks of seven arrows strung waiting for the order to attack tarok nocked his own shaft and readied himself alongside the first rank now tarok said the first rank rose up as one man picked their targets and fired ducking back down as soon as the shafts flew free in the same motion the second rank stood arrows already drawn to their ears these men searched for targets before shooting the first volley disrupted the men in the other tower now the second volley carefully aimed at any target that showed itself targets less than thirty paces away snapped out across the gate drakis had under his command most of the best archers in akkad second only to mitrac and his chosen few drakiss marksmen had no trouble hitting a mans head at that distance even at fi rst light he peered across the wall the first volley might not have struck anyone but the second killed two or three of the enemy again the first rank rose up shafts drawn but found nothing to shoot at korthacs soldiers might be fierce fighters they might even be using the same bows that drakiss men carried but the egyptians hadnt practiced hours each day for months today they faced archers schooled in volley firing with muscles strong enough to hold an arrow to the ear while counting to fifty if necessary more important months of training had given the akkadians pride in their skills and they werent about to cower before some foreigners holding bows drakis saw something move on the other tower and heard the snapping of bowstrings as seven arrows flashed across the open space between them the archers ducked down again to nock another shaft the second rank took their place without a word searching for targets but there werent any and drakis gave a sigh of relief perhaps this would be easy enough after all tarok can you sweep the tower with half the men i need the rest to cover the entrance and the gate yes for now if i need help youll have it drakis said in a moment he had his men moving shifting them to the rear of the battlement where they could look down into the square because their flank would be exposed to fire from the other tower they would have to depend on taroks bowmen to protect them drakis didnt like fighting like this with his flank unprotected but at least he could cover the approach to the tower as drakis searched for enemies below an arrow struck the wall a foot beneath his head before glancing off the tower below him a mix of bowmen and men carrying swords jostled about getting ready to rush his position gathering in nearly the same spot drakis had used to launch his own assault we have to hold them off keep them from forcing the entrance below drakis said as he lined up his men on either side aim for the archers first picking up his bow and stringing a shaft he gave one last look toward the other tower now they rose up together and loosed eight arrows into the bandits assembling below some fired back a few arrows rattled against the wall but most flew overhead it would take them a shot or two to find the range and drakis like every archer knew how difficult it was to shoot uphill his men ignored the counterfire and kept launching shafts into the enemy fighters pouring shafts down as fast as they could and trying to kill off anyone carrying a bow under that rapid fire the exposed men below scattered some running back down the street others ducking into houses or hiding behind anything they could find the akkadians fired a few more arrows at anything that moved finally drakis saw nothing to shoot at and he let his bow go slack as he studied the square beneath him he couldnt see anyone but knew his enemy was gathering just out of sight if hed captured both towers his archers could have swept the lane with arrows again he cursed the fates that hadnt let him arrive a few moments earlier still he thanked the gods that only bandits had defended this tower not korthacs desert fighters he wondered about eskkar in the distance he could hear the shouts and battle cries rising and falling most of them coming from the direction of the barracks hopefully bantor and his men would be in the city if things did not go well for bantor drakis and his men would be trapped up here cut off with no way to escape he tightened his grip on his bow hed know about that soon enough right now there was nothing drakis could do except wait for the next attack takany watched ariamus and hathor leave the courtyard glad to be rid of both of them if ariamus survived this night if hathor didnt kill the man takany vowed to kill both of them himself even if hathor did kill ariamus takany decided he wanted hathor dead anyway the man had questioned his decisions before and now wanted to leave korthac behind takany knew one thing the gate must be defended without control of the gate they couldnt stop more troops from entering akkad this eskkar might have hundreds of men out there just waiting for the gate to open shaking his head he put both men out of his mind instead he cursed the evil demons whod attacked the house at night catching everyone still asleep or lax at their posts these akkadians were too cowardly to challenge his men in daylight when his men could slaughter them with ease looking about takany found the last handful of men still gathering up weapons and lacing on sandals to his satisfaction with the number of men in the courtyard halved the situation improved the twenty or so fighters remaining knew their work theyd recapture the house soon enough takany knew he had to move quickly before something happened to korthac though in the back of his mind takany started considering life without korthac if these weaklings had killed korthac takany would take charge of akkad and he swore a curse on the citys inhabitants for this attack hed kill so many that none of them would ever dare rise from their knees again leaving a handful of soldiers to guard the kitchen door and prevent any escape that way takany readied his men moving those carrying shields to the forefront spearmen followed behind them and six or seven archers would bring up the rear hathor had taken most of the bowmen with him bows wouldnt be of much use inside the house once we start in takany shouted moving up and down in front of his men there must be no hesitation go straight up the landing and kill everyone in your path he took a deep breath hefted his shield now six men stood ready with the courtyard table theyd positioned it a few paces from the door now they picked it up and charged the door using it as a battering ram and smashing it against the door with all their strength the heavy table made of thick planks split part of the doorway with the fi rst attempt takany heard men shouting behind the door they knew what was coming good takany yelled hit it again the men battered the door again the sound of ripping wood adding to the din the third time smashed the door open snapping the bar that braced it and knocking aside a table the defenders had shoved up against it arrows flew through the splintered doorway one of the men closest to the door sank to his knees a shaft in his chest the rest of takanys soldiers moved back shields get those shields up front takany shouted other men moved forward carrying shields and holding swords ready to face the danger they knew lay within a few carried the heavy akkadian bows once inside if they could get their weapons in play theyd wreak havoc on any defenders trapped on the landing attack the men surged forward the human wedge knocking the last of the door from the frame as they rushed inside arrows struck down the first two men through the doorway head shots that slowed the egyptians only for a moment they knew the fastest way to end the battle was to rush in and kill everyone so the egyptians ignored their losses standing just outside takany made sure the last of his fighters had surged through the door before following him inside raising his shield takany followed his fighters in shouting at them to push ahead kill them all he roared get close and finish them his men took up the cry the fearful words echoing throughout the chamber kill them all muttering a curse at takanys stupidity hathor stepped through the courtyard gate pushing along the last straggler of those hed ordered to the main gate the fool had knelt in the dirt to fasten his sandal leave that you ox hathor ordered shoving the man into a run hed sent ahead more than twentyfive men more than enough to recapture the tower unlike takany hathor had decided that eskkar and his men numbered far fewer than the supposed hundreds that takany feared lurked outside the gate otherwise eskkar wouldnt have let himself get trapped inside korthacs house probably eskkar had slipped into the city with a few men and hoped to raise the inhabitants by the time hathor broke into a run most of his men had already disappeared up the lane he wanted to catch up before anything else went wrong turning the corner hathor and the soldier nearly stumbled over the dead body of one of his men lying in the lane hathor slowed for a moment looking down at the body but a shout raised hathors eyes and he saw another of his soldiers take down some akkadians both of them falling against the side of a house look hes killed one of our forget him hathor ordered get to the gate he shoved the man ahead with one hand and drew his sword with the other as he approached the two bodies the downed egyptian appeared dead or unconscious but the weight of his body still pinned his stunned attacker to the ground hathor raised his sword but someone screamed behind him whirling around he saw a young woman a knife in her hand rushing at him off balance he swung the sword at her head but she ducked beneath darting past him and throwing herself across both bodies trying to protect her man the knife had fallen from her hand as she landed and now she fumbled in the dirt trying to recover it although surprised at her courage hathor didnt care they would both die he took a step and raised the sword as he did so the woman gazed up at him her eyes wide with fear enhedu he said recognizing the leather seller from korthacs lane he even remembered her name hathor no she raised her arm to protect herself as her eyes locked on to his speaking his name wouldnt save her the sword came down at the last moment however he turned the blade aside striking the ground a finger width from her ear and knocking the dirt of the lane into her face and hair for an instant they stared at each other hathor broke the spell get back to your house you fool the words surprised him as much as enhedu who looked up at him in bewilderment her mouth open then a stone flung by someone in the crowd flew past his head and rattled against the wall a few villagers approached shouting curses and threats at him another stone cracked against the wall he had no more time to waste cursing himself for a softhearted fool he raced away heading toward the gate behind him cheers arose as the crowd saw the egyptian running away shocked enhedu watched him go her heart still pounding with fear she knew how close to death shed come a man and a woman reached her side and lifted her up her legs felt weak and she could scarcely stand together they pushed the dead egyptian aside the one tammuz had killed enhedu wrapped her arms around tammuz more people joined her rescuers and two men gathered up tammuz blood flowed from a large gash over her masters temple a woman beckoned them from the doorway of the nearest house and in a moment enhedu and tammuz found themselves dragged inside its cool walls for tammuz and enhedu the fighting had ended inside eskkars house mitrac fired shafts as fast as his fingers could snatch the arrows from his quiver and fit them to the string the enemy had burst in and driven them back to the landing already grond was hardpressed at the base of the stairs an arrow smacked into the door just missing mitracs face and another struck one of his archers on the step below mitrac heard the man cry out as he fell from the steps but forced back onto the stairs his back to the door to eskkars private quarters mitrac had nowhere to hide he knew his only chance lay in killing all the egyptian archers before they killed him so mitrac picked his targets carefully first selecting the enemy archers making sure they launched no arrows of their own but still shooting so fast that he and his last two men seemed like a dozen despite his haste eskkars words always rang in his thoughts shoot the leaders mitrac and the men will lose heart another shadow blocked the entrance to the house for a moment mitrac glanced up just as the doorway cleared a lone warrior a man as tall as eskkar stood behind the attackers shouting in a booming voice and driving them onward ordering them to press the attack without hesitation mitrac shifted his aim from the spearman hed been about to kill to the enemy leader that warrior carried a shield held high just below his eyes without conscious thought the shaft flew from the twanging string the arrow gliding a hands width over the lucky spearmans head and slipping under the upraised shield by a fingers breadth before burying itself into the mans belly just beside the hip bone before the shaft landed mitrac had drawn another killing a man with a spear trying to skewer grond at the foot of the stairs mitrac never noticed the egyptian commander stagger back against the doorframe dropping his sword to grasp at the arrow feathered low in his belly with a scream of pain and rage takany bent double trying to grip the heavy shaft that clutched and burned at his insides as if someone had shoved a torch deep within his body he stumbled back through the door into the courtyard then tripped and fell the shaft brushing against the dirt and sending another wave of pain through his body agony seized him and he cried out for help but his words disappeared in the confusion as inside the house his men still sought to fight their way up the stairs most of them unaware of their leaders wound takany tasted dirt of the earth in his mouth even as he breathed its dust into his lungs the pain increased and a wave of dizziness went over him his own blood as hot as if it came from a fire covered his hands the gods of the underworld had called out for his spirit demanding that he come to them takany knew he was dying here in this foreign place after all the fights and all the years of killing dying with the strange taste of an unfamiliar land in his mouth he opened his mouth to call out but he could no longer control his voice despite the dawns growing light his eyes refused to focus he stopped moving suddenly lightheaded as if he were falling from a great height all he could do was gaze upward toward the sky unable even to blink watching the dawn beginning to burst over the city he felt his blood soaking his hands and stomach pooling between his naked legs his lifes blood pouring out into the dirt it was the last thought he ever had takany died unnoticed by his men who fought on against the few akkadians still standing between them and the doorway they could feel the defense weakening and only two bowmen remained on the landing the storm of arrows had nearly ended as the akkadians emptied their quivers step by step the egyptians fought their way up the stairs sensing victory within their grasp suddenly the door behind the archers opened a rectangle of soft light illuminating the landing everyones eyes lifted to see who stood there one glance answered the question a tall bloodspattered warrior holding two swords that glinted in the growing light appeared slipping behind the archers and pointing a long horsemans sword at them korthac is dead the warrior roared the words filling the room the fighting paused for a moment just long enough for the warrior to repeat his words korthac is dead every egyptian flinched at the sound knowing an evil omen filled the house korthac is dead and now you will all die as well not all the egyptians understood the meaning but all of them recognized korthacs name and they all comprehended the truth of the message korthac must be dead or he not this barbarian demon would stand before them the warrior bellowed something unintelligible then jumped off the landing practically in the midst of the egyptians attacking them with a fury that saw two men struck down in as many heartbeats the akkadians arrows exhausted and about to be overwhelmed took heart and began their own counterattack disheartened the egyptians fell back the battle gods had turned against them no one wanted to face the certain death awaiting anyone who dared to challenge their battleenraged opponent in moments the common room emptied as the egyptians shoved and pushed their way through the outer door and into the courtyard the last man had barely cleared the door when someone picked up the table knocked over when the door was forced and shoved it upright against the doorway blocking the opening in the courtyard less than a dozen of korthacs fighters remained alive plus an equal number of ariamuss men theyd seen eskkar come out of korthacs room alone proclaiming their leaders death a handful of battlecrazed archers had somehow driven them from the house shooting shafts so quickly that they seemed like twice their number the egyptians shouted at each other in confusion meanwhile the sound of eskkars name rang through the city taken up by hundreds of voices a nonstop chant that filled the lanes and echoed across the rooftops rattling their nerves takany in a pool of blood lay dead at their feet an arrow buried in his stomach hathor and ariamus had departed for the gate nebibi was at the barracks most of the senior men were dead without anyone to give orders the egyptians began to argue some wanted to charge the house once again others wanted to link up with hathor at the gate more than a few just wanted to flee korthacs death unnerved them korthac had survived a hundred fights if he could be killed then who might be next without a leader they started drifting toward the courtyard gate and in a moment all of them began moving they rushed out of the courtyard and into the lane heading for the main gate before theyd taken a dozen steps they ran directly into bantor and his men charging up the lane the street outside eskkars courtyard erupted with the akkadians battle cry bantor led his men up the lane his bloody sword flashing in the morning sun his men strung out behind him the charging akkadians in front had no time to draw their bows instead they snatched swords from scabbards and smashed into the surprised egyptians before they could form a line for a moment bantors attack slowed as bronze clashed upon bronze men cursing as they fought korthacs men still outnumbered their attackers bantor engaged in a furious sword fight with a thickset egyptian lifted his voice archers aim for their faces the archer struggling behind bantor fi nally got his bow in play the shaft nearly took off bantors ear but the egyptian screamed as the arrow took him in the mouth the wounded man staggered back with a scream of satisfaction bantor pushed ahead aim for their faces kill them all another arrow struck then another rapidly fi red arrows launched at pointblank range struck down the egyptians while bantor and a handful of men up front protected the bowmen from assault the shafts many launched directly into the enemys faces took the fight out of them unable to close with the archers some of korthacs men abandoned the fight and started to retreat up the lane already more than half of them had taken wounds or been struck down the rest broke turned and ran back toward eskkars courtyard some fled past eskkars gate disappearing from sight as the lane twisted and turned but others ducked back inside seeking safety before they could shut the gate an arrow brought down the last straggler an egyptian already wounded and the mans dead body blocked the opening bantor his face covered in blood splatter flung his shoulder against the gate even as the surviving egyptians struggled to shut it in a moment the rest of bantors men added their weight and forced the gate open bantor stumbled through ducking under a wildly swung blade and falling to his knees before his attacker could recover bantor had thrust his sword into the mans stomach bows were forgotten as the akkadians forced their way in sword clashing against sword outnumbered now for the first time the egyptians fought back knowing their fate should they be defeated for a moment they stopped bantors advance and the sound of clashing arms rose up throughout the courtyard eskkar annoksur bantor bellowed the words echoing off the compounds walls he wanted those in the house to know that help had arrived eskkar he yelled again as he redoubled his efforts against those facing him arrows began killing korthacs followers from behind most of the egyptians fought to the end but those recruited by ariamus had no stomach for this kind of closein fighting they ran throwing away their weapons and scrambling up and over the courtyard wall desperate to escape they fled through lanes and even houses searching for any path as long as it led away from the fighting bantor killed the last egyptian facing him glancing around the courtyard his eyes searched the dead looking for ariamus ariamus he shouted where are you it must be bantor eskkar said the clash of men fighting out in the lane sounded clearly even inside the house shove that table aside with mitracs help eskkar cleared the hasty barricade erected only moments ago from the door while the two surviving archers stood behind bows at the ready grond tried to move to eskkars side but slipped to the floor his wounds weakening him mitrac nocked his bow as eskkar lifted his sword then shoved the table clear ducking back as he did so one glance told eskkar all he needed to know the courtyard was filled with men fighting some bellowed war cries and others screamed in pain from their wounds but this time more than half the combatants were shouting akkadian war cries he started forward but mitrac caught his tunic no stay here mitrac said pulling eskkar away from the doorway he stood just inside the doorway and fired an arrow into the back of an egyptian standing only a few paces away the other two archers moved up behind him and added their shafts shooting over mitracs head standing with his sword ready eskkar watched as mitrac and his bowmen started the final slaughter the three of them picking off targets with every shot an enemy died as the carefully aimed shafts took down any who still sought to stand their ground a voice rose up over the clamor eskkar annoksur eskkar saw bantor leading the attack his sword slashing at everyone before him cover him he ordered mitrac who shifted his bow to put a shaft into bantors opponent a few more shots from the doorway and the egyptians broke unable to withstand swordsmen in front and archers behind the last of the enemy ran for the rear frantic to scale the courtyard wall before an arrow took them a few attempted to make a stand in the quarters across from eskkars house but without solid doors the soldiers quarters provided only temporary security more of bantors men brought their bows back into play shooting through the doorways and windows overwhelmed the last few egyptians died or threw down their swords calling out for mercy their cries for leniency barely audible against the roar of cheering men a few ran back into their quarters desperate to regroup but most dropped to their knees pleading for mercy begging to be spared anything to avoid being killed by their battlemad opponents eskkar stepped out from the doorway mitrac at his side an arrow still nocked on his string his eyes searching for danger the courtyard seemed covered in bodies most of them with arrows sticking out of them nearly all seemed to be egyptians bantor his chest heaving and his eyes wild from the battle madness finally recognized his leader bantor stood there blood covering his right arm and splattered all over his face and chest but his smile belied the blood and he raised his sword high as the cheering men rushed past him to eskkars side their jubilation turned into a deafening roar at the sight of their commander with the fighting ended at least at eskkars house the dirty bloody and battleweary men looked at each other in the bright morning light their voices turned into a chant that grew in volume as the men shouted eskkar eskkar eskkar at the top of their lungs the cheer went on and on until eskkar thought it would never end half the city could hear the words and would know that korthac had been defeated the wounded needed to be tended and the fighting wasnt over yet eskkar saw klexor whod just reached the house and pulled him away from the delirious soldiers take charge here eskkar ordered get the men organized and secure the courtyard his smile never changing klexor nodded and began bellowing orders eskkar grabbed bantors arm and led him back inside the house mitrac was already there tending gronds wounds covered in blood most of it his own eskkars bodyguard appeared ready to collapse the fighting had raged back and forth across the room wreckage of the big table littered the fl oor and one of the benches had been smashed but eskkar found one still whole and righted it as mitrac and bantor lifted grond up and laid him out on the bench just enough light filtered in to show three separate wounds find the women and the healers eskkar said they must be nearby get them here at once he grabbed one of bantors men stand here and guard these steps trella and annoksur are above bantor his bloody sword held loosely in his hand approached annoksur where is she is she shes upstairs with trella guarding korthac shes all right only a knock on the head eskkar said did you find ariamus isnt he dead bantors voice hardened and he straightened up the fatigue dropping from his shoulders he stopped moving toward the steps tell annoksur ill be back ill take some men and start hunting ariamus down eskkars eyes narrowed at the tone of bantors voice no ariamus can wait whats happened to drakis is he still holding the towers bantor hesitated then shook his head i dont know take your men to the main gate eskkar ordered his voice firm drakis may need you if some of these egyptians escape he saw bantor hesitating and shook his head ariamus is wounded in an hour the whole city will be looking for him drakis needs you now cant you go no im staying here with korthac upstairs and this place recaptured eskkar knew his remaining soldiers would be coming to him looking for orders besides he didnt want to leave trella and the child hed left trella alone for weeks he didnt plan to leave her again not to chase down a handful of foreign fighters whose cause was lost damn the gods bantor said rage back in his voice ill go to the gate but i swear ariamus wont get away from me this time bantor shouted for klexor they collected their men nearly twenty of them and jogged out into the lane heading for the gate as eskkar turned back toward the stairs ventor the healer entered the house his eyes wide in amazement as he took in the carnage and death his frightened apprentice glancing nervously in every direction followed carefully behind carrying his masters box of instruments eskkar took ventor by the arm and guided him toward the steps have your apprentice care for grond you attend to trella shes upstairs wounded eskkar took the instrument box from the apprentice and used his other hand to halfcarry the old healer up the stairs and into the outer room annoksur eskkar shouted the sound filling the now quiet workroom its eskkar open the door he heard the bar scrape then fall to the floor with a thud the door swung open the lamp still burned but the sun provided more than enough light the baby had stopped crying held close and nursing in his mothers bloody arms korthac lay where eskkar had left him still unconscious annoksur looked weak but she still held korthacs knife over his motionless body she nodded to eskkar and moved back to the foot of the bed to maintain her watch on the egyptian trellas eyes looked up at him she seemed to have trouble focusing but then she recognized eskkar and smiled youre safe now trella he said kneeling next to the bed and taking her hand korthac is taken and his men are being hunted down she nodded and her body seemed to relax tears formed in the corners of her eyes stay with me eskkar ill not leave you again trella i swear it now let ventor tend to you is bantor alive annoksur asked leaning over and holding her head with both hands still holding the bloody knife very alive eskkar said hes gone off to hunt down ariamus look at your son eskkar trella said her words calling him back to her side ventor moved to the other side of the bed give me the child for a moment lady trella he gently lifted the child from her arms then offered the babe to annoksur she handed the knife to eskkar then took and held the infant close to her breast let ventor tend to your wound trella eskkar said stroking her hair for a moment she nodded and her head fell back onto the bed look at your son eskkar took a step to annoksurs side and peered down at the infant for a few moments the child its cheeks red and eyes screwed shut looked very small he looks well trella eskkar said not sure what to say a moan from the floor turned his attention to korthac still lying there unmoving eskkar reached down and grasped the unconscious man by the shoulders and dragged him out of the bedroom pulling him across the workroom until he reached the top of the stairs the soldier eskkar had ordered to guard the stairs still held his post at the foot of the stairs just then two of the households servants stepped through the remains of the door moving gingerly past the bodies of the dead their eyes wide at the sight of all that blood and death get this filth out of my house eskkar said letting korthac slump to the landing eskkar resisted the urge to roll korthac off the landing the fall might kill him and that would be too easy a death find three men to guard him theyre to stay within arms length of the egyptian if he gives you any trouble or anyone tries to rescue him kill him the soldier nodded eskkar called down to the servants and told them to bring fresh blankets water and anything else they thought trella and annoksur would need he turned back inside pushing the door closed to lessen the noise from the courtyard annoksur didnt even look up when he returned just rocked slowly back and forth trying to soothe the baby ventor had pulled back the blanket from trellas hips and leaned over to examine her wound his face inches from the stilloozing cut im afraid youll need to change the bedding when im done lord eskkar the old man said there must have been much blood lost during the birthing another woman one of the regular servants came into the room but left almost immediately as ventor called for bandages and fresh water eskkar stood there unsure of what to do he wanted to ask ventor if trella would live but he knew better than to interrupt the healer with questions the man would tell him as soon as he knew the baby began to cry and annoksur whispered soothingly to the infant ventor began wiping the blood from trellas side and eskkar saw the wound from korthacs knife the slashing blow had struck a little above her hip the servant returned with water and linen ventor washed the gash then wiped the blood from trellas body before pressing the cloth against the wound shes still bleeding from the birthing but not heavily the wound is only a deep cut and she wont be walking for a few days i believe she will recover eskkar exhaled a long sigh of relief his wife would live that was all that mattered ventors touch calmed trella almost as much as his words her eyes closed and she seemed to fall into a light sleep the healer worked swiftly he cut up a clean part of the blanket and used it to bind trellas wound then he washed the rest of the blood from her body eskkar handed him the second blanket and ventor draped it gently over her leaving only her head and shoulders exposed she needs to rest for a few hours ventor said well know more then ill go tend to the other wounded he stood and went to annoksur gazing down at the child the baby seems healthy though a bit small the child is safe eskkar annoksur said ignoring ventors comment and so is trella the wound is not deep but shes lost a lot of blood eskkar muttered thanks to the gods his wife would live and he had a son hed captured korthac broken his men and retaken akkad eskkar started to shake as much a reaction from worrying about trella as from all the fighting suddenly his legs felt weary annoksur recognized the signs wincing from the effort she lifted the baby up onto her shoulder come outside eskkar you can do nothing here let her rest for a few moments to regain her strength giving trella one last look eskkar followed annoksur out of the bedroom peering over her shoulder at his sons tiny face for the first time eskkar felt the stirring of pride hed fathered a son sargon who would carry on not only eskkars name but his descendants those who would come afterward down through the ages the thought surprised him eskkar had never thought more than a few days ahead before but now the future appeared to stretch before him the child showing the way somehow that seemed more important than korthacs defeat hathor and his egyptians had finally gained control of the mob milling about the main gate a handful of the cursed akkadian archers had slipped into the city and captured the left tower but his men still held the right they reported no activity in the countryside outside the gate no horde of fighters waiting for the gate to be flung open once again takany had chosen an unwise course of action for a moment hathor felt tempted to take his men and return to korthacs house but that would have provoked takany beyond all reason better to fi nish the business here and then return with the gate safe and under hathors control he had a rough count of the enemy whod taken refuge in the tower and knew he faced less than twenty men now hathor needed to come to grips with them to kill these intruders before the city turned against him he didnt have much time eskkars name sounded everywhere around him growing louder every minute as more and more people of akkad took up the cry dawn had broken over the citys walls exposing the full extent of the carnage at the gate bodies littered the open area most with arrows protruding wounded men cried out for help or tried to crawl to nearby houses seeking safety hathor didnt know how korthac had lost control of the city so quickly no word had come from nebibi whod slept at the barracks or from takany since hed ordered hathor to the gate hed dispatched two runners one to the barracks and one back to korthacs house but neither had returned and hathor had no idea whether korthacs men remained in control at either location not that it mattered right now and for his own protection hathor needed to retake the gate from these akkadians he had more than enough men but the longer eskkars men could hold hathor at bay the greater the danger to all of them one loud voice kept bellowing out eskkars name as a battle cry from the towers top the mans powerful lungs sending the name over half the city the booming voice rattled his men another evil omen that weakened their nerve hathor knew it wouldnt be long before all these cursed akkadians rose up against them if he failed to destroy these men in the next few moments he korthac all of them might be overwhelmed by the citys enraged citizens the last thing hathor wanted was to be trapped inside akkad reinforcements kept arriving swelling the number of fighters under his command that would have reassured him until hathor discovered most of them had fled from fighting elsewhere apparently battles had been fought at the barracks as well as at korthacs house hathor swore briefly at this demon eskkar and wondered how he and so many men had sneaked into the city nevertheless hathors veterans gathered all of korthacs remaining followers who arrived forced them to stand ready and ordered them to obey his commands hathor striding up and down before them promised to kill any man who started to flee or who refused to fight already he had more than fifty men half of them carrying bows and the number continued to grow we must recapture the tower he called out in the language of akkad from there well control the city in egyptian he gave different orders drive the cowards toward the gate let them take the arrows then well force the doorway he still had men in the other tower and they would add their efforts to his hathor took one last look he had enough men and his own bowmen would at least keep the archers atop the tower pinned down the suns rays bathed the towers in a golden light he gave the order and with a shout they charged around the corner everyone racing as fast as they could across the killing ground men fell struck down by arrows but only a few and hathors fighters surged across the open space calling out korthacs name the battle for the gates of akkad had begun drakis swore when he saw them coming a horde of armed men that vastly outnumbered his force at least the waiting had ended his archers arrows flashed out over the cart behind him enkidu waited on the first landing with four archers standing single file on the steps below him hugging the wall if the egyptians forced the opening drakis planned to retreat up the stairs fighting every step of the way using bowmen to cover his retreat theyd make their last stand atop the tower where they could still control the gate the enemy surged across the open space and succeeded in reaching the base of the tower ignoring their losses the wagon shuddered in the opening as the first of the attackers reached it bodies slamming against its sides arrows flew spear points flashed in the evergrowing sunrise and wood creaked as a dozen of korthacs men made every effort to muscle the wagon aside but the thick wheel filled the entryway and the strakes that braced it held fast a spear hurtled through the opening and one of drakiss men screamed as the weapon took him in the chest another akkadian wrenched the spear from the dying man and flung the weapon back through the opening the archers fired at any targetexposed faces hands that tried to push the wagon aside even their enemys legs but more took the place of those that fell wounded or dying and drakis realized that the barrier wouldnt keep them out much longer the wagon moved stopped and moved again drakis heard wood snapping and knew the men outside were tearing the wagon to shreds with their bare hands using force of numbers to pry it loose the smell of blood rose up in the confi ned space mixed with the heavy breath of men shouting and cursing at their enemies the akkadians shot at anything that moved any target they could see killing shots at such close range but despite the havoc his archers inflicted another man always took the place of those who died with a lurch the clumsy cart shifted a moment later the last brace tore loose and the rear of the cart wagon lurched a pace forward dragged away from the opening with a loud screech of wood on wood for a moment that gave his archers better targets and even as the opening grew wider they poured arrows into the crowd of men outside snapping shafts into their ranks drakis had no idea how many they killed but the attackers began to waver shouting encouragement at his men he urged them to hold the barrier even as he plied his bow shooting at any target that offered itself but by now hathors bowmen had reached the base of the tower more than anyone they understood that safety lay in forcing the entrance they began shooting shafts through every opening the man beside drakis dropped without a sound an arrow through his eye drakis stepped up into the breach and shot three arrows as fast as he could a scream of pain rewarded him and he kept firing shooting at anything he could see an arm a leg even a sword he had to hold these men off drive them back hold until relieved nevertheless half his men had fallen or taken wounds those unable to draw a bow moving up the stairs to safety with a loud cracking sound the wagon lurched away from the tower and daylight filled the opening arrows from the stairs held them for a moment but the attackers driven from behind by hathor had taken on a blood rage of their own they pressed forward into the doorway climbing over the bodies of their own dead drakis shot his last arrow then dropped his bow and drew his sword fall back he shouted and struck aside a spear thrust toward him fall back swinging the sword like a madman knocking away spears and swords drakis retreated slowly found the first step with his heel and started climbing upward for a moment enkidus archers farther up the steps held the enemy back but then an arrow flashed into the tower and an akkadian archer fell off the steps groaning from his wound to his dismay drakis realized the situation had worsened the sun rays now reached the towers arrow slits illuminating the interior from the cover of the doorway the enemy archers could fire at his men exposed on the steps theyd be picked off one by one if they continued to fight like this up the stairs everyone up the stairs two arrows struck him as he continued to back up the steps one grazing his ribs and the other ripping into his left arm just above the elbow he stumbled and would have fallen off the steps but enkidu reached down and grabbed him they scrambled up the steps to the second landing out of sight of the doorway for a moment cursing at his wound and shaking off weakness drakis kept his feet moving upward he heard enkidu directing the men telling them to form another line even as his subcommander pushed him up the steps get to the top enkidu shouted see whats happening there ill hold them here wincing with pain drakis climbed the steps practically falling as he reached the battlement atop the tower the sun had cleared the horizon and the blue sky shimmered in the morning air the fresh scent of the morning river washed over him driving the stench of blood away for a moment he slipped to his knees and leaned back against the wall sit still tarok said kneeling beside him while he took a quick look at the arrow protruding from drakiss arm its in the bone stay here and ill bandage rip it out drakis ordered his eyes shut tight against the pain washing over him he opened them and stared at taroks sweating face a hands breadth from his own rip it out now tarok didnt argue with a grunt he put his knee against drakiss shoulder then took the wounded arm in one hand and pushed it against the wall tarok grasped the arrow with his other hand drakis flinched when tarok gripped the shaft but before the pain could mount tarok twisted the arrow and yanked on it with all his strength a wave of agony shut out the sunlight and drakis couldnt hold back the moan of anguish that forced itself from his lips but the bloody shaft came free bits of flesh still clinging to the arrowhead still good tarok said tossing the arrow toward the archers behind him dont move ive got to bind it up or youll bleed to death using his knife tarok cut open drakiss tunic tore a long strip from it and used it to bandage the wounded arm stretching the cloth tight to stop the bleeding drakis blacked out for a few moments when he opened his eyes tarok had gone and enkidu blood streaming from his leg had backed the men into the opening at the top of the battlement drakis struggled to his knees found his sword and crawled beside enkidu one man had found a shield and they used that to cover themselves as they dared quick looks down the steps were killing them enkidu said the stairs are covered with bodies but they keep coming these egyptians know how to fight how goes it up here drakis glanced about him for the first time i dont know can you hold ill hold them see if helps coming tarok his red hair glinting in the sunlight had returned to his men drakis saw that less than half of his original force remained and most of those had taken wounds using his good hand on the top of the battlement he pulled himself over the rough surface toward the archers still facing the other tower a loud booming noise told him something had just struck the gate shivering the massive wood logs risking a look over the wall drakis saw a halfdozen men trying to unbar the gate tarok stop those men the gate must not open drakis had lost his bow but he picked up one lying under the battlement when he attempted to draw it his wounded arm refused to bear the strain and he dropped the weapon cursing at his own weakness he drew his sword again tarok recognized the danger dont let them open the gate pin those archers down he shouted jerking his head toward the enemy archers in the opposite tower then he stood leaned over the wall and began firing he emptied his quiver shooting his last six arrows so rapidly that drakis could scarcely follow his movements ducking back down tarok moved to drakiss side i drove them off but theyll be back do what you can keep the gate closed his left arm was useless but drakis could still hold a sword keeping low he crawled back toward the towers entrance enkidu and four men defended the doorway all of them bleeding from one wound or another theyre getting ready to rush us enkidu said any sign of help drakis had forgotten to look toward the barracks he moved to the other wall pulled himself up and endeavored to focus on the lanes leading to the gate an arrow flew past his head but he ignored it a plume of thick black smoke wavering in the morning sun trailed up into the sky from what appeared to be the barracks that must mean bantor had broken through the river gate and attacked from his vantage point drakis could see two of the lanes that fed into the expanse behind the gate men ran toward the gate but whether friend or foe he couldnt tell he went back to enkidus side kneeling next to the opening men are coming but a roar went up from inside the tower as four or five arrows flashed through the opening miraculously striking none of the defenders then the egyptians shouting their war cries rushed the last few steps separating them from their enemies staying on his knees drakis used his sword thrusting at anything that appeared on the landing taroks men crouched over to avoid arrows from the other tower took their time using the last of their arrows against those attackers trying to force their way onto the battlement swords clashed spears shoved and prodded and men screamed in each others faces the attackers surged toward the opening again and again but each time they faltered only a few men could approach on the stairs at one time after the third attempt the egyptians halted their efforts returning to the safety of the landing to regroup drakis looked about enkidu had taken another wound and leaned against the battlement trying to catch his breath tarok sword in his hand had taken his place it took only a moment to count those able to fight five men remained and only one had a bow in his hands that one scrambled about picking up any stray shafts that lay about one more attack drakis decided one more rush and theyd be finished overwhelmed he heard the attackers gathering inside the tower taking their time now that the akkadians had exhausted their arrows suddenly korthacs war cry echoed eerily throughout the tower as the egyptians followers raced up the last flight of steps and hurled themselves at the opening alexar paused when he reached the main gate studying the situation while he struggled to catch his breath the sounds of battle echoed from the left tower and he guessed that drakis and his men had taken refuge in there no doubt fighting for their lives the expanse now held plenty of panicky men most of them heading toward the gate itself in a few moments theyd have the gate open the right tower only a few dozen paces away seemed deserted except for some of korthacs bowmen on the battlement above he made up his mind eskkar had said to keep the gate shut and clearly drakis didnt have enough men well take the other tower lets go alexar yavtar and their men burst out of the lane running at full speed toward the towers entrance mixing in with the crowd of frightened villagers and bandits rushing toward the gate alexar never hesitated or slowed he dashed into the tower sword in his right hand bow in his left no one challenged him so he sprinted up the stairs expecting resistance at each landing but finding no one to oppose him at the top he broke into full daylight never stopping almost a dozen men bows in their hands faced away from him searching for targets on the opposite tower alexar was on them before they knew he was there dropping his bow and striking at a darkskinned egyptian at such close range swords were more useful than bows and he had two men down before they could react by then yavtar and the others were beside him all of them hacking and shouting eskkars name making the battle cry again echo over the city the egyptian archers taken by surprise and with their bows in their hands couldnt react fast enough they clutched at their swords but by then alexar and his seven men had joined the fight pinning their opponents to the tower wall the akkadians wielded their swords like men possessed by demons two men fell screaming over the wall to land with a loud thud just in front of the gate in a few savage moments alexars men swept the battlement clean alexars lungs burned with every breath the dash up the tower steps the furious closein fighting had sapped his strength gathering his bow from where hed dropped it alexar peered over the wall toward the other tower he saw men struggling there and picked out tarok his red hair waving fighting with a sword drakis must have retreated to the top of the battlement and the egyptians must be about to swarm over the akkadians men get your bows ready stop those men before they slaughter drakis alexar launched the first arrow the shaft clearing taroks head by a hands span and flashing into the opening two more arrows snapped across the space between the towers just as tarok and those defending the doorway were about to be pushed aside alexars next volley stopped the assault five men firing together pinning two bodies in the opening the egyptians disappeared back into the towers confines enkidus face appeared above the wall a bloody sword in his hand he shouted something and it took alexar a moment to comprehend the words yavtar take half the men to the other tower help them yavtar nodded he and his men carried no bows and they could do nothing more from up here alexar moved to the corner of the tower and glanced down at the gate just in time to see the last of the huge beams that barred it shut come down a crowd of men massed against the wide wooden strakes in their panic for a moment the press of their own bodies the only thing keeping the gate closed alexar jumped onto the battlement directly above the gate placing his feet with care he drew a shaft and picked his target an egyptian trying to get the mob to move back died first a second foreigner followed then another this one waving a sword at such close range shooting straight down from less than twenty paces alexar could scarcely miss he stood alone exposed on the battlement but no bowmen opposed him and he kept shooting whipping the arrows from quiver to string to his ear so fast his movements never seemed to stop and with each twang of the bowstring a man died or fell wounded panic erupted below some still worked to force the gate open but others turned and ran desperate to escape the deadly arrows that hissed down upon them one of alexars men joined him adding his shafts to the carnage below bodies lay atop one another forming a fresh barrier to anyone striving to open the gate just as he nocked his last arrow alexar realized he had no targets below the mob had broken and turned back keep watch kill anyone that tries to get out alexar ordered then jumped down and went back to where the three archers stood bows drawn still waiting for targets to appear in the doorway opposite them across the open space the doorway to the other tower stood empty a man leaned on the wall waving a redstained sword at him alexar had to stare before he recognized the bloody figure of drakis before alexar could wave his bow in reply he heard a rush of noise from below moving to the towers edge he leaned over and saw bantor and more than twenty soldiers jogging into the open space bows ready looking for targets following them was a wall of men hundreds of them all shouting eskkars name and waving whatever they could find as a weapon filling the lanes the inhabitants of akkad had finally rallied in force to support their liberators the last of korthacs fighters threw down their weapons and dropped to their knees crying for mercy alexar laid his bow across the battlement and stared down at the sight the battle for the gate had ended the soldiers and the people of akkad once again ruled their city bantor and ten men galloped through the main gate heading south all were boneweary after a long night without sleep but no one complained every one of them had a score to settle with ariamus and bantor had no trouble finding volunteers each man led a spare horse and carried his bow slung across his back after bantor put down the last resistance at the gate the city had gone wild with all the inhabitants out in the streets cheering and praising their deliverers and generally getting in the way he wasted close to an hour before he fi nished searching the dead and wounded that surrounded the towers looking for ariamus bantor even spoke with the prisoners wounded or those who surrendered asking for ariamus but no one knew the whereabouts of the former captain of the guard ariamus had vanished like a night demon with the coming of dawn when hed learned that no one had seen ariamus alive or dead bantor knew the man would run making his break over the wall little more than an hour after the last of the fi ghting bantor stood in eskkars courtyard surrounded by the pandemonium of rowdy soldiers and exuberant citizens celebrating their deliverance hell head south eskkar said raising his voice over the din he wont chance encountering anyone coming down the northern road not if hes got any of the egyptians with him hell want to cross the river as soon as he can take whatever men you need and go after him ill run him down bantor said hed already worked through what ariamus must be thinking and had come to the same conclusion moving through the crowd bantor found klexor sitting on the ground feet sprawled out in front of him his back against the house and drinking wine straight from a jug were going after ariamus get nine men who can ride and meet me at the stable klexors eyes widened in surprise but he put down the jug the chance to pay back ariamus pushed all thoughts of rest and merrymaking aside bantor cursed the time wasted to round up enough horses wrench the men away from their celebrations and move his force through the celebrating crowds that filled the lanes on foot ariamus would head south following the river the land there contained many farms and some of those farms might have a plough horse or two hidden away once mounted ariamus would disappear eventually crossing the river to head west he would expect pursuit but maybe not this fast and not supplied with extra mounts once outside the city walls the quiet sounds of the countryside returned at first bantor didnt bother looking for tracks ariamus would have followed the endless interconnected canals moving slower through the water channels but leaving no obvious trail instead bantor followed the main road south for a mile until the farms began to spread out before he moved his men toward the river at the riverbank bantor spread his line of men wide looking for tracks as they moved southward and anchoring the line at the river himself searching the ground for any sign of a group of men entering the water he stopped every confused and stillfrightened farmer they encountered had anyone seen fugitives running from akkad anyone missed any horses no one had seen a band of men on foot but the farmers all wanted to know what had happened in akkad except for a brief statement that eskkar had returned bantor refused to answer any questions about what had happened to korthac and his men all this took time and bantor grew more and more impatient as he swept his men back and forth across the most likely routes bantor this way klexor shouted his bellow covering a quarter mile of wheat and barley fields that separated the two bantor turned the horse and applied his heels racing through the crops until he joined his subcommander atop a low rise by now theyd traveled about three miles from akkad up ahead a goodsized farm nestled in a grove of palm trees near a broad canal that carried water from the river thin wisps of smoke rose from one of the three structures bantor saw the roof missing from one and guessed what had happened he waved his bow to show his men the way taking care they converged on the farmhouse weapons at the ready bantor did not intend to be ambushed again as he drew closer bantor saw the tracks of men for the first time fresh mud showing where theyd come out of the canal approaching the farm they saw no one no farmer wife or child not even a dog bows strung and arrows nocked they covered the last hundred paces stopping when they reached the first body it was a young boy an arrow protruding from his back shot down trying to escape to the fields by then bantor knew theyd find the farmhouse empty except for the dead he sent his men to circle the farm looking for fresh tracks over here men and horses going south commander klexor dismounted dropping to his knees and studying the ground with care looks like eight or ten men but i only see tracks for two horses how long ago not long maybe an hour less than two theyre moving at a run following the horses bantor thought it over the horse trail went southwest slightly away from the river that meant ariamus led the men only he would be crafty enough to head somewhat away from the river knowing that boats might have already been dispatched north and south to give warning of what had happened in akkad and alerting every village to hunt down any escaping fugitives so ariamus would be riding one of those horses and probably leading these fugitives if there were any egyptians among them they would need someone who knew the land follow their trail klexor bantor said they watered the horses at the canal then resumed the pursuit following the recent tracks these renegades desperate for horses food and weapons would kill anyone in their path if they managed to pick up more horses the whole lot might scatter and ariamus might yet escape bantor set the pace at a strong canter his men spread out with a clear trail to follow the sun marched across the sky as morning prepared to give way to noon they pushed the horses hard changing mounts often but always studying the land to make sure they didnt ride into an ambush the tracks grew fresher bantor looked up at the sun theyd have them all by early afternoon he decided fresh tracks here klexor said halting the men and again dismounting to study the ground his fingers traced the hoofprint in the dirt getting the feel of the dirt as it hardened theyre not far ahead now they rode on passing fewer farms as they moved farther away from the river the land became brown the grasses sparse with more rocks and gullies to slow them down but the hoofprints and sandal tracks grew fresher with every stride and klexor no longer needed to dismount to read its message they rode until the horses needed changing then rested while bantor talked to the men when we catch up with them ill take naramtanni and go after ariamus and whoevers riding the other horse naramtanni shot an excellent shaft bantor figured that would be all the help he needed klexor you take charge of the rest of the men kill all the egyptians not long afterward bantor and his soldiers crested a hill and saw the enemy more than a mile away walking now heads down with fatigue plodding a hundred paces behind two horsemen bantor grunted in satisfaction he kept to a steady pace not pushing the horses waiting until theyd been spotted and using the time to study his quarry as far as he could tell only two of the fugitives carried bows and both bowmen were on foot the akkadians closed the distance to less than a mile before anyone turned around to spot them the fugitives broke into a run while the two horsemen after watching for a moment put their horses to a gallop bantor held his men to a trot and the gap between the two groups briefly widened but the men on foot couldnt keep up the pace and the group began to straggle out as the weaker men trailed behind the stronger bantor grunted in satisfaction hed learned that alur meriki tactic from eskkar if hed rushed down on the men at first sight theyd have banded together to resist if they thought they could get away theyd keep running exhausting themselves at the same time fear gnawed at their insides bantors men spread out into a wide line that stretched a hundred paces across the hindmost of the fugitives ahead of them stumbled and fell he got to his feet and staggered on but couldnt keep up the pace he turned to face his pursuers sword in hand bantors horsemen closed in their larger bows couldnt be used effectively from horseback but they could still be drawn though not fully extended or aimed accurately nevertheless at such short range it didnt matter a hail of arrows flew at korthacs man and he went down his body riddled with shafts another straggler died the same way by then the egyptians realized they couldnt escape the last six stopped and turned to face their enemy finish them klexor bantor shouted then he and naramtanni each still leading an extra horse swung wide around the fugitives and galloped on since two of the egyptians carried bows klexor decided to take no chances he called out new orders the akkadian line compacted and they dismounted a hundred paces from the egyptians three of klexors men gathered up the horses and held them fast while the others started shooting the egyptians tired from the days running and not used to the heavy bows couldnt find the range one enemy bowman went down in the first volley another took up the fallen mans weapon but klexors five archers poured volley after volley of arrows at them both enemy bowmen went down by the third volley the next volley struck down two more one egyptian killed himself falling on his sword rather than be captured the last three one of them wounded charged at their attackers and died the deadly shafts taking them down long before they could close the distance bantor and naramtanni ignored the fighting behind them they kept moving racing at full speed after the two horsemen by now almost out of sight the gap began to close bantors horses might not be as fresh as the ones ariamus rode but the best horseflesh always wound up in akkad and these mounts now proved their quality over the stolen farm animals when the horse bantor rode started to tire he slowed to a walk and leaped onto the second animal without dismounting and broke into a gallop abandoning the tired horse to be recovered by klexors men the distance had closed to less than three hundred paces when one of the horses ahead of bantor stumbled and went down the rider caught looking behind at his pursuers landed hard bantor saw the mans dark skin and galloped ahead kill the egyptian naramtanni bantor said as he swung wide around the dismounted man and galloped after ariamus naramtanni pulled his horse to a stop about a hundred paces away nocked an arrow and waited watching his quarry the egyptian looked fit and hard and naramtanni didnt want to waste shafts trying to hit a dodging target he decided to wait klexor and the rest of the soldiers would be arriving soon the egyptian drew his sword and stood there waiting for naramtanni to advance moments passed until he realized the horseman wasnt attacking suddenly he burst into a run coming straight toward the mounted archer before the egyptian had covered half the distance between them naramtanni turned his horse aside and cantered off glancing back to make sure he stayed just ahead of the egyptian exhausted by the chase the egyptian stopped and waited naramtanni guided his horse back until another hundred paces separated them he sat there staring naramtanni had plenty of time and the egyptian wasnt going anywhere the sound of hoofbeats floated over the grass and klexor and two other men rode into view each of them leading a spare horse the other bandits are all dead klexor said when he reached naramtannis side lets take this one alive i dont think this one is going to throw down his sword naramtanni said put a shaft into him klexor ordered readying his own bow thatll change his mind looking a little dubious naramtanni dismounted he handed the halter to klexor and started walking forward the egyptian determined to sell his life charged again lifting his sword and shouting something incomprehensible naramtanni waited until the man closed to within a dozen paces before shooting his shaft flew at the mans legs but the egyptian leapt aside and the arrow hissed by but before he could change his path again a shaft from klexors bow followed this one reaching the charging man a moment before he could close the gap between him and naramtanni struck in the leg the egyptian went down he struggled to stand but his leg gave way before he could recover naramtanni sword in hand closed in with a savage overhand thrust naramtanni knocked the egyptians weapon from his hand with naramtannis swords tip at his chest the exhausted and wounded man yielded naramtanni held the prisoner that way until klexor joined him whats your name egyptian klexor put his sword point at the mans throat as naramtanni sheathed his weapon took a halter rope and moved toward the prisoner he pushed the egyptian down and began tying his hands in front of him i asked you for your name klexor repeated this time jabbing the sword tip into the mans chest just enough to draw blood and loosen his tongue hathor leader of thirty in the service of korthac you speak our language well egyptian dog klexor complimented him and youll get to see your korthac soon enough korthac is alive we thought oh hes alive lord eskkar broke his nose halfblinded him and cracked his leg klexor laughed when he saw that the man didnt believe him by himself they fought man to man in the upper room your korthac didnt fare too well in the encounter for the first time klexor saw defeat in the mans face by then the rest of the men had reached them pull that arrow out of his leg and bind it up then put him on a horse eskkar may want to talk to him so make sure he stays alive picking up his bow naramtanni mounted his horse ill go after bantor he may need help klexor grinned wait for me bantor rode steadily carefully watching the ground before him a misstep a broken leg and ariamus might get away the distance narrowed faster now as ariamuss weary horse stumbled more and more often bantor saw ariamus glancing behind every few paces when the gap shrank to less than a hundred paces ariamus gave up he slowed the tired horse to a stop and drew his sword well wheres eskkar he called out was he afraid to face me himself or did the egyptian kill him at twenty paces bantor pulled up his horse and drew his own sword noting the bloody bandage wrapped around ariamuss left arm eskkar is well and sends his greetings he asked me to bring you back alive but i think id rather kill you myself im here bantor waiting for you or are you afraid too even your wife wasnt afraid she got down on her knees fast enough and begged for more your horse is finished ariamus ill fight you on foot if you win you can take my horse before my men get here otherwise ill wait and well bring you down like any jackal with arrows ariamus looked around he didnt like the offer but he had no choice bantors men couldnt be far behind he slid off the horse in a fit of anger ariamus smacked the sweatsoaked animal with the flat of his blade and the startled horse lumbered off a few steps before halting again its weary legs splayed out blowing air from its nose dropping his bow bantor dismounted he tossed the halter rope to the ground and walked toward the former captain of the guard youre an even bigger fool than eskkar ariamus said baring his teeth in a wide grin there never was a day you could beat me with a sword with a shout of rage ariamus closed the distance swinging the sword high in a feint then sweeping the blade low toward bantors legs bantor moved a step to the side letting ariamuss blade pass within a handsbreadth and countered with his own stroke the clash of bronze rolled over the land sending a flock of birds squawking into the sky ariamus fought with the desperation of a wounded animal trying to escape a trap determined to get rid of his opponent he knew the rest of bantors men would be close behind if ariamus hadnt taken a wound he might have done better but bantor met every stroke and knew every trick like all the akkadian subcommanders during the siege hed practiced against eskkar and other top swordsmen for months the minute he sensed ariamus tiring bantor swung wide leaving an opening for his opponent but when the blade flashed at his stomach bantor slipped aside and hammered down aiming not at his opponents body but where the sword arm would be in a gush of blood the blade clove deep into the forearm bone ariamus screamed and his weapon fell from his nerveless fingers bantor never stopped another stroke took ariamus in the knee staggering him to the ground a hammer blow descended on the mans collarbone shattering that then a low thrust into his right side pierced his lung ariamus blood gushing from his mouth fell onto his back eyes bulging unable even to cry out in pain standing over his opponent bantor spat in his face he put his own sword aside and picked up ariamuss this is for annoksur and for me holding the hilt with both hands bantor raised the weapon up then thrust it down with all his strength shoving the point into the mans groin driving it right through his body and deep into the earth that elicited a lingering scream that echoed over the empty countryside bantor let go of the sword and watched the former captain of the guard of the village of orak bleed to death as he writhed in agony clutching at his own blade with hands already streaked with blood eskkar spent the first part of the morning making sure his compound stood ready for any further attack when he felt certain that the house and trella would be safe he moved to the barracks seeing to the wounded men recovering there and making sure the soldiers had regained control of the weapons then he took a quick tour of the city before finally returning to his courtyard by then it was apparent the resistance had collapsed eskkar set up a command center to direct the soldiers and citizens clamoring for his attention everyone claimed an urgent need to see him and this time eskkar had no one available to sort out the trivial from the more urgent bantor had ridden out to hunt down ariamus at midmorning and only the gods knew when he would be back gatus arrived and sought to help but he still hadnt fully recovered from his own wound that left alexar as the only senior man still standing eskkar promoted him to subcommander and ordered him to take charge of the gates the three of them spent the morning organizing the soldiers issuing weapons to the nobles guards establishing patrols and directing the search for any remnants of korthacs force fortunately the stables and horses survived intact and alexar soon had mounted parties of men searching the countryside looking for those who escaped over the wall finally things quieted down enough for eskkar to slip away an hour before noon he left gatus in charge and climbed the stairs to his quarters standing in the bedroom doorway he saw trella and annoksur lying side by side on the bed both asleep trella looked pale from loss of blood korthacs cut and the ordeal of childbirth had exhausted even her sturdy frame most of trellas servants had returned including those driven off by korthac already they had replaced the broken furniture and exchanged the bloody blankets for clean ones the room looked almost the same as the day eskkar rode north except for the cradle hed visited the bedroom several times before just quick checks to reassure himself of trellas wellbeing and to make sure she and annoksur had everything they needed on the last visit trella took his hand she tried to speak but he knew she needed rest so he simply squeezed her hand and told her to sleep now eskkar looked into the bedroom and saw an unknown woman with a large bruise on her cheek sitting beside the cradle rocking it gently her eyes on the infant she rose and came toward him motioning him to follow her through the doorway your wife needs her sleep lord eskkar she whispered the babe needed to be fed and his crying woke her now they both need their rest for the first time eskkar noticed how quiet the house was even the soldiers in the courtyard kept their voices low out of concern for his wife you are my name is drusala i was midwife to lady trella she stepped back inside picked up the cradle and returned holding the cradle in both arms and turning it so he could see the childs face this is your son he was born last night a few hours past midnight eskkar stared in fascination at the tiny infant his eyes shut and face still red from crying eskkar had scarcely had time to look at him since hed carried the babe to trella after the fight this time he gazed not at a baby but at his son his heir that trella had promised him months ago have you decided on a name lord eskkar spoke without hesitation sargon his name is sargon of akkad eskkar and trella had chosen the name months ago in fact the very day the alur meriki were driven off now he looked in wonderment at the heir who would bring the city together in a way that even eskkar and trella both strangers to akkad never could his son would become part of that future would carry eskkars line down through the ages the child he seems so small eskkar reached out and touched the infants fingers amazed at their softness the babe sargon came earlier than we expected thats why he is so small but he is healthy and i expect he will grow as tall and strong as his father was the birth difficult drusala i mean did trella suffer much the presence of korthac made it he complained about the noise he threatened he said that hell make no more threats drusala eskkar said is there anything you need anything at all no lord ill stay and watch over your son lady trella will need to feed sargon again soon enough we will have to find someone to help nurse the child the early birth caught us unaware and we didnt have time to arrange a wet nurse right now its best to let lady trella sleep as much as she can the mention of korthacs name reminded eskkar of his prisoner keep my son safe drusala he reached out and gently touched the childs cheek again a strange feeling passed over him as if the gods chose that moment to forge a bond between the child and the father eskkar found himself smiling send word when trella wakens he left the room descending the stairs and crossing the courtyard to the smaller house three soldiers guarded the room that held korthac they stepped aside as eskkar entered he looked down at the figure lying on the floor the sun didnt provide much light in the lowceilinged chamber but he saw blood still covered the egyptians face theyd bound his hands behind him eskkar considered having the man dragged outside but didnt want another spectacle bring a torch he commanded he found a stool and moved it closer to korthac eying the man whod nearly killed him a soldier returned carrying the torch and handed it to eskkar leave us and draw the curtain when they were alone eskkar lowered the torch and used its light to examine his prisoners face korthac glowered back at him using his one good eye blood had crusted over the other the one eskkar had smashed during the fight korthac struggled to breathe thanks to the broken nose his lower lip was swollen and split and he squinted up at the torch held just above his face you are eskkar yes korthac im the man whose wife you tried to steal eskkar has returned korthac tried to laugh but the sound turned into a painful fit of coughing and it took a few moments before he could stop you fought well for an ignorant barbarian and you should have died on my blade no man ever defeated me in battle only your slave saved your life the words came out slowly each one spoken with care even through the mans pain the voice sounded melodious with just the trace of an accent perhaps eskkar said but i remember you running into the bedroom trying to put the door between us korthac grimaced at the reminder you handled your long sword well enough did you never lose a fight barbarian just once that i recall eskkar said but fortune favored me and i survived you should have died in bisitun this time korthacs voice held a trace of bitterness that he couldnt conceal yes your assassins missed their chance there so i see you must tell me what happened i was supposed to get word even if they failed ariamus swore they would kill you but you made it so easy for me you divided your forces while you enjoyed your pleasures in the north a child could have taken your city eskkar felt a pang of anger at the truth of the remark everyone seemed to know about his dalliance in bisitun rebba told me much about you egyptian trellas asleep now but when she awakens ill hear the rest the torch sputtered and eskkar moved it away from korthacs face most of your men are dead or prisoners only ariamus got away with a handful of others but bantor will run them down soon enough in a few days the city will be cleansed of your memory akkad will be a great city someday it was worth the gamble if that were the only thing between us id give you a quick death but you terrorized trella and threatened even my son youll take the torture for that tomorrow will be your last day of life korthac youll be weak from your wounds and youll suffer greatly youll get no satisfaction from torturing me korthac struggled to keep his voice firm and his words even your slavewife and her whelp were mine she knelt before me begged for my mercy i only regret that i didnt kill her when i had the chance eskkar reached out with his foot and gave korthacs broken leg a shove the injured man couldnt control the gasp of pain that wrenched from his mouth i think korthac that you should have stayed in egypt you wont rule here long barbarian youre not wise enough even with your slave woman whispering in your ear the words hung in the air as if in prophecy and eskkar felt a chill pass over him he took his time thinking about them he knew that korthac still fought that he still searched for any way to inflict harm on his captor that made him a worthy opponent fighting to the last breath seeking to give some worry to his enemy perhaps what you say will happen but trella says i learn from my mistakes and the people of akkad have learned something too well be more careful in the future eskkar stood up and pushed the stool away he paused in the doorway and turned back toward his prisoner i know one thing korthac my son will rule here after i am gone that the gods have promised think of that when you take the torture outside alexar and a handful of soldiers stood there curiosity on their faces no doubt wondering about what had passed inside eskkar shoved the torch into the dirt to extinguish it then handed the stillsmoking stick to the nearest man watch him closely no one is to visit him or hurt him keep two men with him at all times he must not kill himself we want him alive to take the torture in the morning give him plenty of water and a few mouthfuls of wine food if he wants any i dont want him passing out too soon well watch him dont worry about that alexar said eskkar went to the well at the back of the house drew up a bucket of water and washed his hands and face by the time he finished a servant joined him carrying a clean tunic a soldier drew up more water and eskkar washed the rest of his body taking his time and scrubbing away the last traces of blood and dirt feeling refreshed and dressed in a clean tunic for the first time in days eskkar returned to the workroom and sat down the first chance hed had to take some rest since leaving rebbas farm hed hardly slept from the time he left bisitun the servants had left pitchers of wine and water on the table next to dayold bread no one in akkad had the thought or time to bake this morning eskkar soaked the bread in his wine cup before eating but drank only water to wash it down too much wine and hed be of little use to anyone for the first few hours after the fighting ended everyone sought to speak plead or advise eskkar but as soon as he knew akkad had been secured he refused to deal further with anyone he ordered gatus and alexar to keep everyone but the subcommanders healers and servants away from the upper rooms a dozen hawk clan guards released from the barracks and still weak from their ordeal stood guard over the house directed by mitrac whose arrows had brought down the last of the insurgents within akkad an hour after sunrise with something in his stomach eskkar felt himself relaxing it was good to just sit and rest steps sounded on the stairs and gatus limped into the room and closed the door behind him he took the seat across the table a fresh bandage wrapped around his body above his sword belt how are they he kept his voice low and inclined his head toward the bedroom good both asleep along with the child thank the gods for that eskkar gatus kept his voice low even though the door stood closed i wanted to help her but i couldnt even get word to her there was nothing you could do the old soldier picked up a cup with hands that trembled a little filled it with wine and took a sip if it werent for tammuz and his woman id be twice dead now we both owe him his woman he remembered seeing tammuz and a girl earlier in the day just a glimpse in the lane outside the house gatus laughed you remember the slave girl trella rescued the one being beaten half to death by her master she gave the girl to tammuz you should have seen the boys face he was more scared of her than any three barbarians she killed at least one bandit that i know of maybe two tammuz killed a few more during the confusion ill have to thank him then there are so many to thank especially you then drakis annoksur even rebba they all put their lives at stake gatus ignored the praise not me all i did was hide then kill a few rogues in the confusion by the time i got to the barracks klexor had fi nished off most of the egyptians the rest surrendered he sighed anyway i set up a command post at the barracks corio is there working with rebba and the nobles still alive theyre finding those who collaborated with korthac and locking them in the same prison the egyptian kept our men what will you do to them eskkar shrugged the traitors could be dealt with later when order was established and the council reconvened when trella recovers shell decide who should be punished how is nicar he took a nasty knock from ariamus but hes back in his house carried there by his friends and family hell be up and about in a few days what else eskkars legs ached from weariness his eyes felt heavy again and the need for sleep passed over him like a wave theres been at least a dozen murders since the fighting stopped people taking their revenge against those who supported korthac to be expected i suppose eskkar said anyone i should be concerned about no not really just i did recognize one of the dead a tanner who also happened to be the former owner of tammuzs new slave old kuri found the body it seems eskkar shrugged no one would concern themselves over a drunken and unpopular tanner drakis lost most of his men gatus went on he took several wounds but seized and held the gate despite being greatly outnumbered he had the worst of the fi ghting but because of him bantor slaughtered most of korthacs men and captured the rest they never got the gate open and the ground there was covered with bodies will drakis live so ventor says and grond is resting downstairs he should recover in a few weeks the mans made of bronze he not only saved my life he found the way into the house gatus youll have to raise his pay again i suppose eskkar smiled for a moment before he drained his water cup and refilled it i told alexar to take charge here hes organizing the search parties looking for any of korthacs stragglers gatus shook his head in admiration not a scratch on the man fought at both gates killed at least a dozen men and didnt even get his tunic dirty did you meet yavtar i gave him some men and told him to guard the docks and to make sure that no boats leave akkad yes he fought at the main gate too ive given the same order to those at the main gate no one is to leave until weve rounded up all of korthacs men and our own traitors ive got men riding around the walls looking for anyone trying to slip away hundreds of angry akkadians seeking revenge had joined in the search for the remnants of korthacs men the egyptians recognizable by their darker skin color proved easy to find some of the men who ariamus had brought into the city still had to be unearthed together soldiers and citizens searched house by house and one by one were rounding up the bandits who had terrorized akkad good when bantor returns we can start patrolling the countryside the soldiers searched akkad for ariamus but no one saw the traitorous filth his body wasnt among the dead finally a boy came forward and said that he saw ariamus and some egyptians go over the south wall eskkar yawned the battle rage is still on bantor he wont be back until he finds ariamus i told him to bring him back alive if he could gatus finished his wine and ripped a handful of bread from the loaf bantor fought well do you think hell catch ariamus the mans like a snake in a swamp for hiding you wouldnt ask that if youd seen bantor ill be just as happy to piss on his body gatus said ariamus strutted around akkad looking pleased as any rich merchant with three fat wives gatus leaned across the table your eyes are closing why dont you get some sleep ill relieve alexar and keep watch downstairs before eskkar could argue gatus was on his way closing the door to the upper chamber behind him eskkar tried to finish his bread but he had no appetite his thoughts wandered so he lowered his head on his arms and closed his eyes to rest for a few moments he fell into a deep sleep within a dozen heartbeats so deep that he didnt hear the servants passing to and from the inner room nor his son waking and crying to be fed when he awoke his neck and arms felt stiff and his back complained when he straightened up his throat felt parched and he drained his water cup then stretched his arms until the stiffness went away rested now a glance at the window told him hed slept for more than an hour the door to the bedroom stood open and he heard trellas voice the chair scraped loudly when he arose and in a moment drusala appeared lady trella is asking for you lord eskkar can you come to her trella her head propped up by a cushion smiled at him when he approached annoksur had gone sargon nestled in trellas arm nursing and a bandage covered her side drusala slipped out of the room leaving the two of them alone have you seen your son eskkar her voice sounded stronger and she reached out toward him with her hand he sat on the edge of the bed taking care not to disturb the child yes the midwife told me of his delivery and what you suffered are you in pain he took her hand in his ventor and drusala say i will recover the pain is passing now that you and sargon are both here trella im sorry i should have come sooner the words came out in a rush well speak of it later husband all that matters is that you returned to save akkad i didnt come back for akkad i came for you the moment i heard i came as fast as i could she squeezed his hand and tears formed in her eyes you saved our sons life thats all that matters korthac would have killed us both soon enough after hed taken his pleasures the thought of the humiliation shed endured wrenched at him and he held her hand tighter as korthac reminded me you saved my life last night without your little knife thrust where did you get such a thing the birthing knife a gift from drusala well have to repay that debt the baby squirmed at her breast for a moment before settling down again and she stroked his head we knew korthac was concealing something but i never thought none of us suspected anything like this she shook her head at her failure he laughed at me said i was just an ignorant girl trying to play at ruling men he made me i had to eskkar reached out to touch her lips with his finger stopping the flow of words ive fought many men trella but no one with korthacs skills never but for the luck of the gods and your help he might have won its no disgrace to battle a worthy opponent she blinked back the tears your luck still runs true then the gods continue to favor you the gods favor me because of you he gazed down at the child in wonder and his voice softened now theyll have to watch over sargon as well he seems so small and helpless eskkar touched the childs cheek with his finger fascinated by the boys soft skin sargon will need your protection and strength for many years husband he will rule over our city someday who knows what he will accomplish he and akkad will need your wisdom just as it needs corios new walls to defend it long after we are gone our voices will linger in these walls for as long as this place remains let us hope our son honors us both the child had stopped nursing and fallen asleep eskkar stroked its fi ne black hair feeling a pride grow inside him that hed never known before his son the son who would carry on his line who would make eskkar live on through the ages to come lay before him nestled safely in his mothers arms you seem pleased with our son i hope you will teach him many things how to rule how to fight how to lead he will learn more from you than i can ever teach him you speak of fighting but fighting a war is easy destroying is easy building a new way of life out of what is left is hard thats what he will learn from his mother then we will teach him together husband yes together he leaned down and kissed her taking care not to awaken the child but her lips were warm and still held the promise hed always found there the gift of love and tenderness that had won him over months ago eskkar put his arms around both of them holding them close trella had more tears on her face but this time he knew they were tears of happiness and he kissed them away hathor woke to pain pain that possessed every part of his body it had started yesterday with the arrow in his leg the heavy shaft tearing into hard muscle above the knee before lodging in bone but thankfully missing the big blood carrier hed fainted for a few moments when they held him down and tore the shaft from his body when hathor regained consciousness he found his wound bound with a piece of tunic taken from one of the dead rough hands lifted him onto a horse dazed from the wound he clutched at the horses mane with both hands struggling to stay on if they thought he couldnt ride theyd tie him across the animals back and the pain would be even worse one man held the halter while another rode alongside in case hathor started to fall off they rode at an easy pace laughing and talking among themselves all except for their leader named bantor who rode at their head in silence another horse carried the corpse of ariamus the only body the akkadians bothered to bring back with them this bantor apparently had some personal grudge against the traitor ariamus no doubt ariamuss body would be displayed next to that of korthac the bodies of hathors men remained where they had fallen left to animals and carrion eaters thinking of korthac made the anger bubble up inside hathor hed seen the wave of akkadian soldiers jogging down the lane to attack the main gate followed by hundreds of the citys inhabitants one look at their sheer number had stopped him in his tracks hathor had nearly recaptured the gate but the sight of hundreds of angry citizens carrying makeshift weapons and rushing to support their liberators told him the effort had failed sounds of battle from the other tower made hathor look up and he saw that more akkadians had captured that one as well ariamus had seen the same thing and reached the same conclusion even faster all was lost the wily bandit deserted first slipping away running toward the southern wall escape the only thought in his head at that moment a chill of fear had come over hathor the first time hed felt fear in years of fighting as he thought about his fate ariamus could possibly escape he could blend in with his countrymen but the egyptians wearing the mark of the west on their features and in their speech had no place to hide hathor knew his only hope was to run with that realization hathor turned and sprinted after ariamus cursing himself as a coward for abandoning his men and refusing to fight to the end without a word of protest the handful of men standing alongside hathor followed korthac even if he still lived had lost the city and everyone knew it now they had to save themselves ariamus had dodged through the back lanes leading them away from the fighting their swords clearing the path they reached an unguarded portion of the south wall they climbed the parapet and hung from the wall before dropping to the ground then they ran as hard and fast as they could in an hour theyd managed to cover more than three miles and reached countryside untouched by the chaos behind them they kept moving and with every step hathor felt more confident when ariamus led them to the farmhouse he shouted that everyone must die lest anyone give the alarm hathors men without even a glance to their former leader obeyed the akkadian slaughtering the family in moments nevertheless after they secured the two brokendown plough horses ariamus handed the halter of one of them to hathor once mounted hathor felt certain they would be safe ariamus knew where to flee and how to hide it would be days before the troubles in akkad settled down if anyone even bothered to chase after them hathor remembered the shock that went through him when he turned and saw the horsemen riding purposefully after them somehow in spite of all the confusion and fighting in akkad the cursed soldiers had managed to find men and horses organize pursuit and pick up their trail less than an hour after catching sight of his pursuers the akkadians had run him down contemptuously theyd refused his attempt to die fighting the arrow had taken the strength from his body and before hathor could even kill himself theyd captured him from what he heard spoken by the riders around him this eskkar had taken korthac just as easily the barbarian had stormed korthac in his house surrounded by his egyptians and made him a prisoner hathor still found it hard to believe his cunning leader had been defeated not only defeated but captured alive nevertheless as hathor clung to his horse he slowly realized that what his captors said must certainly be true these men rode too relaxed unconcerned about any danger they must have retaken akkad and killed all those whod opposed them thoughts of how swiftly theyd killed his men still rankled hathor the akkadians hadnt lost a man not even taken a wound and theyd fi nished off his egyptians and taken him prisoner bantor had personally killed ariamus with scarcely a fight then stood over his victim to watch his death throes hathor knew ariamus could handle a sword better than most and yet the leader of these men by himself had challenged ariamus without hesitation and this bantor according to ariamus was reckoned to be the slowest of eskkars subcommanders hathor nearly wept in shame but the thought of humiliating himself further in front of these warriors halted his tears they stopped twice on the return journey a burly soldier named klexor checked hathors bandage each time and gave him water a gesture that worried hathor even as he gulped it down unable to resist the need to quench his thirst by the time they reached akkad the sun had started to touch the horizon marking the end of a long day of fighting and running hathor growing weaker with each step of his horse remembered moving through streets and lanes already lit by torches and filled with revelers people shouted and cheered at the sight of bantor and his riders that turned into a roar of approval as one of the soldiers reached down and lifted ariamuss head into view its mouth hanging slack in the torchlight some akkadians even recognized hathor and yelled curses in his direction bantors men kept them away and the soldiers led him back to korthacs house when the soldiers pulled him down from the horse hathor was unable to stand and he fell to the ground helpless laughing the soldiers lifted him and carried him to one of the soldiers rooms across from the main house hathor filled with shame and weakened from loss of blood had collapsed grateful only for the end of the punishing ride his hands still tied in front of him the celebrating soldiers dropped him to the floor and went off to join the festivities the celebrations went on and on long into the night while hathor lay in the dirt fi ghting the throbbing in his leg and contemplating the torture that awaited him when he woke not sure if hed fallen asleep or passed out from the pain hathor found a yawning guard watching him outlined against a low fire in its dying throes burning in the courtyard twisting his head hathor caught a glimpse of the night sky and realized dawn approached at first he couldnt believe that hed slept through most of the night but his wound must have exhausted him more than he realized the coming dawn explained the silence surrounding the house and the city the inhabitants must have celebrated their liberation long into the night before finally returning to their beds aside from the occasional crackling of the fire hathor heard nothing the sky began to lighten and thoughts of what the day would bring shook the last remnant of sleep from hathors mind today would be the last day of his life in a few hours the torture would begin today he would die the laughter the jeers of the onlookers would fill his ears as they enjoyed the spectacle of his torment hathor would make every effort to be strong but he knew a wounded man rarely kept his courage and his strength the pain they would inflict would join with that already flaring in his leg and he would soon beg for mercy the torture would increase until he begged them to kill him they wouldnt of course and that would make the pain and humiliation truly unbearable the courtyard fire died out but moments later the first rays of the sun brushed aside the last of the darkness hathor swallowed his throat dry again as he attempted to prepare himself for the ordeal to come the household stirred with people getting up and about he heard someone moaning a low sound he could barely detect he struggled to sit up finally leaning his back against the wall facing the doorway and the soldier watching him the low murmuring sound continued and hathor realized it had been going on for some time whos that he muttered at the guard a dry rasp in his throat the guard whod sat there watching him without expression broke into a smirk thats korthac your leader hes in the room next to yours you two are the last egyptians alive in akkad the words sent another tremor through him if korthac was already unable to control his pain hathor too would soon be screaming for death which of us he wondered would scream louder when eskkar woke the morning sun had already climbed well over the horizon hed slept in fits and snatches during the night despite the tiredness in his body the tension of the last few days couldnt be erased in a single night celebrating citizens and soldiers had filled the streets shouting drinking and singing for much of the nighttime hours the unusual noises had troubled him the middle of the night had long passed before eskkar finally fell into a deep sleep then he slept right through sunup waking to the sound of a baby crying for its mother he hadnt wanted to disturb trella and the child hed slept in the outer room on a blanket trella and the baby slept together both under the watchful eye of drusala who apparently stayed awake throughout the night as shed explained to eskkar earlier because sargon came before his time he needed to be watched constantly entering the bedroom with a yawn he found trella nursing the babe he put his arm around her shoulders and felt a thrill when she leaned against him then reached up and touched his cheek you look terrible husband she said her voice still weak your face korthacs fists had bruised and bloodied eskkars face leaving it swollen and covered with scratches he could only imagine what he looked like you look beautiful wife he answered she smiled at him the way she always did when he told her how beautiful she was how is the pain better but i feel so weak like i could sleep the whole day she touched the infant at her breast but sargon has other ideas so i see annoksur arrived a bandage wrapped around her head carrying breakfast for them both gatus is looking for you eskkar she informed him setting the tray down on the bed he wants to know if you plan to sleep the whole day away you should eat something now before he takes up all your time id better go see what he wants eskkar said ill come back as soon as i can he tore off a hunk of bread and filled a cup with watered ale from the tray and went downstairs by the time he reached the courtyard the cup was empty eskkar found gatus sitting at the head of the table hard at work apparently the captain of the guard had taken his post well before sunrise about time you woke up and got to work gatus said you look terrible how are you feeling eskkar sat down and helped himself to the water jug resting on the table not too bad i could use some more sleep but theres time for that whats happened during the night ive put klexor in command of the walls gates and docks gatus said hes to make sure no one leaves the city without our approval alexar took twenty men and as many horses and is already patrolling the walls looking for any of the rabble that escaped mitrac is going housetohouse searching the city and making sure none are still hiding under some old womans bed well have to promote them to commanders then eskkar said already did that told them youd confirm it when you finally woke up at least that was one less task to do today eskkar thought to himself with a smile i just sent bantor down to the barracks gatus went on hes taken charge of the prisoners those guarding them and the horses hes working with rebba and the other nobles to make sure the dead get buried too bad he had to burn the egyptians out of the barracks we could use the space howd he look bantor had returned last night with ariamuss body bantor hadnt said much just a quick report of the number of egyptian dead before he went to annoksur they closed the door to their room and hadnt ventured out all night better than he did when he got back gatus said the look on his face couldve shattered stones youd think killing ariamus would have cheered him up eskkar knew the story about annoksur and the gods only knew what other deviltry ariamus had done under korthacs protection and the wounded eskkar glanced around the courtyard the soldiers quarters held most of the wounded with others put up in nearby houses even now more than a halfdozen bandaged men rested in the courtyard most of them watching eskkar ventors with them now gatus said got here a few moments ago hell do what he can some are going to die those egyptians were tough fi ghters korthac trained his killers well eskkar said thinking that if the egyptians were half as skillful as their master they would indeed have made formidable fighters only one thing left to do gatus said as he fi nished reporting and here they come he added the distaste sounding in his voice eskkar looked up to see corio and rebba enter the courtyard corios right arm hung in a sling and a large bruise covered the left side of his face rebba looked old and tired but had a warm smile for everyone good morning lord eskkar corio said speaking first and in a loud voice once again let me offer praise to the gods for your return you were sorely missed the gods favored us noble corio he answered smiling at the architects obviously insincere words corio believed in the gods about as much as eskkar did weve come for the usurper korthac rebba said weve been meeting at nicars house with the other nobles nicar is still unable to get about but he sends his thanks and his greetings as do the others and korthac eskkar looked at rebba unless you want the pleasure of killing him yourself corio said hes to die under the torture in the marketplace to pay for his crimes against all of us the nobles and rich merchants had suffered greatly in the last few days eskkar knew and theyd lost most of whatever gold they had hoarded fortunately korthac had stored most of the loot right here in the house still it would take weeks to sort it all out and this time eskkar would have to arbitrate the distribution take korthac whenever you want he said nodding toward the guards watching the egyptian also we need your soldiers to arrest the others corio interrupted the men who joined up with korthac who willingly took part in his schemes and whats to become of them theyre to die with their leader curse them all corio answered they deserve to take the torture but ill be satisfied just to see them all dead eskkar had never seen the master builder in such a bloodthirsty mood and nicar and you rebba you all agree to this rebba nodded we spent most of yesterday arguing over their fates five are to die their property confiscated another seven will have their property taken and then be exiled from akkad more blood to be shed eskkar thought for this decision however there was no urgency gatus have your men take these twelve men prisoner send them down to the barracks and tell bantor to guard them well he turned to corio in a few days when trella is well enough well review the charges against these men both men started to protest but eskkar cut them off theres no need to rush their punishment better to let them worry about their fate while we make sure each one gets exactly what he deserves remember trella was here and she heard every word korthac said shell know who merits what punishment eskkar stood and faced gatus whod remained expressionless during the discussion round up those twelve then take charge of korthac and make sure he gets to the marketplace the sooner he begins his journey to the underworld the better what about the other one that hathor him too eskkar said all the egyptians deserve the torture gatus stood as well lets go corio the sooner we catch up with the men on your list the happier well both be eskkar left the table and walked over to check on korthac the man looked even worse today than he had yesterday korthac glared at him but said nothing eskkar glanced in on hathor but had nothing to say to the egyptian subcommander he didnt know the man and hadnt encountered him during the fight but hed fled with ariamus and that alone was enough to condemn him as he turned away from hathor mitrac and a few others from the hawk clan entered the courtyard they surrounded eskkar eager for news and equally eager to tell him what theyd accomplished eskkar spoke with them for some time answering questions laughing and listening to the latest rumors from the streets they left him still laughing proud men who knew theyd won a great victory ignoring the other activity around him eskkar washed himself at the well then visited the kitchen to find something more to eat his appetite had returned a good sign he knew he leaned against the wall out of the way of the cook and munched on some bread and sausage enjoying the idle moment lord lady trella asks for you he turned to see drusala bowing to him is everything all right oh yes lord but she asked if you could attend her wiping his fingers on his tunic he climbed the stairs drusala following behind but she stopped at the landing and shut the door as soon as he passed through surprised eskkar crossed the empty workroom and entered the bedroom annoksur waited there along with another woman a young girl really her plain face marred by a broken nose eskkar had to stare at her for a moment before he recognized her the girl trella had rescued and brought to the house a few days before hed left for bisitun trella sat up in the bed the baby asleep beside her eskkar we have a favor to ask of you a very great favor she kept her voice soft so as not to waken the child trellas use of we warned him something unusual was coming he looked closer at the girl struggling to remember her name this is enhedu trella went on soon to be wife to tammuz at least as soon as we set her free from her servitude enhedu bowed deeply to him but said nothing when she lifted her head he saw the worry in her face tammuz gatus told me hed taken a woman i gave enhedu to tammuz more than a month ago shes been helping him all that time they both risked their lives trying to learn more about korthac they helped hide gatus and she and tammuz both fought in the battle against korthac then you have my thanks enhedu eskkar said bowing his head to her i will tell you all about it later husband trella said but for now enhedu wishes to ask a favor enhedu bowed again her hands clenched together nervously lord please can you spare the life of the egyptian hathor he saved my life and the life of tammuz as well we would both be dead if he hadnt spared us hathor is to die with korthac eskkar said shock and surprise in his voice he was one of korthacs subcommanders he escaped with ariamus hathor came from the desert with korthac its true annoksur said but i didnt see him kill or do injury to anyone here in akkad please lord enhedu rushed the words his men would have killed tammuz and myself hathor stayed his hand against us can you not spare his life for that what does tammuz say eskkar asked does he want this man to live yes lord eskkar enhedu said but he will not ask for hathors life he is too loyal to you and lady trella in serving korthac who knows how many evil deeds hathor may have accomplished in the past he may have trella dropped her eyes and eskkars voice trailed off without saying anything she reminded him of another who had done things in the past things better forgotten no one has accused hathor of evil deeds annoksur said filling in the silence not yet eskkar countered today in the marketplace im sure many will come forth to confront him he shook his head still i have no quarrel with him he can spend the rest of his days as a slave working on the wall when korthac amused himself at my expense trella said hathor was the only one who looked away he did not take pleasure in my suffering her words told him she wanted hathor to live and not as a slave perhaps there is another way trella continued perhaps you can make use of him use him you always say how you look for men who can command hathor is one such even korthac thought so with korthac gone and the rest of the egyptians dead hathor has no one else to turn to in akkad every mans hand will be against him such a man might prove useful to you eskkar if you held his loyalty eskkar looked from one woman to the other annoksur nodded slightly to show her approval enhedus lip trembled as she watched him as if fearful of an outburst of anger trella stroked little sargon tracing his cheek with her finger for a moment then lifting her eyes to eskkars it is something to think about husband there is no rush to put him to death as always she gave him time to make up his mind to think things through in his own way ill consider it he answered is there anything else no nothing youll do whats best the words sounded humble but he caught the gleam in her eye but perhaps it would be good to speak to him yourself trella added can you have him brought here up here now he regretted the words the moment he uttered them he knew trella too well once she made up her mind she always acted quickly i can have him brought up lord eskkar annoksur offered now bantors wife was calling him lord no ill bring him eskkar needed the time to think and he certainly wasnt going to win any arguments here not with the three of them united against him shaking his head he turned and left the room wondering what they would say with him gone in the courtyard the command table stood empty he knew gatus had gone with the council members to gather up the traitors eskkar walked over to the guards he nodded to the one watching hathor and ducked his head as he entered inside hathor looked up when he entered but said nothing do you know who i am you are lord eskkar i saw you yesterday when i was brought here the man spoke with a strong accent but eskkar had no difficulty understanding his words are you ready to die hathor as ready as any man lord he pushed himself up a little straighter against the wall i would have killed myself rather than been captured but your men took me before i could fall on my sword eskkar grunted at that news so this all could have been avoided if bantors men hadnt been so efficient he stared at hathor despite the egyptians strong words eskkar saw the trembling in his hands that betrayed his fear no man wants to die alone surrounded by enemies and strangers a warrior expected to die in battle often looked forward to it better to end that way than a lingering death from illness or old age alone perhaps begging in the streets another longforgotten memory returned of a time many years ago when eskkar had sat bound and bloody against a cave wall death pricking the skin at his throat afraid yet too proud to beg for his life while a group of women decided his fate women had spared him then and now women wanted him to spare this man perhaps eskkar owed the gods a debt one that must be repaid ishtar the earth goddess was a woman after all guard get some water for the prisoner eskkar used the time to think the guard returned with a skin filled with water eskkar took it from his hands cursing at the old memories he should feel hate for the egyptian not pity he handed the skin to the surprised hathor and let him drink his fill much of the water dribbling down his chest as the man held the skin clumsily with his bound hands eskkar turned to the guard still standing in the doorway bring him to the workroom and wash the blood from his hands and face first ignoring the soldiers surprised look eskkar returned to the upper rooms he sat down at the big table and waited annoksur summoned drusala to watch the baby the midwife closed the door to the inner room after trella and enhedu joined eskkar in the workroom the two women guided trella to the seat beside her husband then stood behind her it took two men to bring hathor up the stairs and by the time he stood in front of eskkar a sheen of perspiration covered his face at least theyd cleaned most of the blood off put him on the stool eskkar ordered then leave us lord one of us should stay in case ill watch him myself eskkar cut the man off he stood up and moved to the other side of the table then sat on the corner between hathor and the women fingering the knife on his belt trella waited until the guards had left closing the door behind them do you remember me her voice once again held the power of command no matter how weak she might feel hathor nodded his eyes darting from husband to wife tell me of korthac trella said tell me what he did in egypt the question caught hathor by surprise why do you wish to know about korthac it cannot matter now to answer my questions trella kept her voice even a polite request to a guest eskkar said nothing just stared at the man if hathor refused to speak he would go to the marketplace and suffer with his leader hathor dropped his eyes it matters not i suppose lady trella so the egyptian wasnt a complete fool eskkar thought hathors story came out haltingly the years spent pillaging the land gathering forces two mighty armies battling to control the land of egypt the conquests the battles the villages taken and burned the lands devastated the final conflict that saw korthac defeated and driven into the desert with the last of his men all of them lucky to escape with their lives to his surprise eskkar found himself listening with interest when the man ended his tale eskkar had a question of his own tell me about the battle here in akkad hathor made a noise that might have been a laugh you were too clever for korthac he knew you didnt have enough men he never thought you would divide what little you had to slip inside and raise the city or that akkad would rise up even for you my men didnt think much of the idea at the time eskkar said remembering the arguments at rebbas farmhouse your men follow where you lead lord eskkar i see that they dont fear you the way we all feared korthac you speak to them as an equal you must be a great warrior to hold so much loyalty eskkar stared at the man not sure what to make of the words of praise go on hathor tell me of the battle the egyptian began again relating how theyd been surprised at the strike here at the house how they hadnt expected eskkar to arrive so soon and the confusion that broke out among them even the hatred takany felt for ariamus hathor spoke for some time but then his voice gave out he tried to continue but eskkar held up his hand enough for now then he leaned closer to the helpless man would you like to live hathor as a slave no better to die and get it over with you might change your mind when the torture begins but i meant something else my wife has asked me to spare your life a look of shock came over the egyptians face and this girl enhedu pleaded with trella do you know enhedu yes i know her the seller of trinkets outside korthacs house his eyes widened in comprehension was she one of trellas lady trellas spies why did you spare her life and the boys she was ready to die to protect her man i thought shed spoken kindly to me often enough he shrugged lifting his bound hands i thought thered been enough killing of women and helpless men whether we won or lost their deaths wouldnt have mattered yes theres been enough of killing eskkar agreed now there must be a time of building the land must be freed of bandits and the people protected from the clans of the steppes people i need men who can help me build hathor as well as fight my enemies loyal men hathor stared not at eskkar but at enhedu unable to speak or when youve recovered from your wound trella said we can give you a horse and let you depart you can even return to egypt the choice is yours you would give me my life eskkar nodded a life for a life yours for enhedu and tammuzs you did no hurt to trella and no one has come forth to accuse you of murder or rape if you had it might be different i have nothing to return to in egypt he lifted his eyes to eskkar then to trella the vow i swore to korthac ends with his death if you will accept my oath i will serve you faithfully lord i swear it the egyptian meant his words eskkar decided he looked at trella who nodded taking his knife from his belt eskkar cut the knot from hathors bonds ill take him downstairs lord eskkar annoksur said putting her arm around his shoulders and summon the healer for his wounds a knock on the door sounded and gatus pushed his way into the room ive got three of the men denounced by corio gatus said the others his eyes widened in surprise at the prisoner ah gatus its good that youve returned eskkar interrupted enjoying the look of confusion on the old soldiers face as he stared at hathor his hands untied leaning on annoksur for support ive something to tell you epilogue nine days later yavtar once again guided his boat toward the dock at akkad though this time he arrived just after midday instead of the dead of night he captained a different ship as well a fine vessel newly purchased and one of the largest that plied the river it boasted a bright white sail twice as tall as a man a long steering oar extending from the stern and carried a crew of two men and a boy to work the ship today yavtars cargo differed as well instead of grim fighting men and their weapons he carried passengers and trade goods only a single berthing place stood empty at akkads dock and another boat this one coming upriver also wanted to land yavtars curses echoed across the rapidly diminishing gap between the two ships as both captains sought to secure the berth the two craft nearly collided before the other vessels captain yielded as much to yavtars bellowing as to the hawk clan banner flying from the masthead the wet oars flashed in the bubbling current as they caught the sunlight struggling against the rivers force as the boat crept closer to the shore with one last frantic pull of the oars yavtars boat slid into the berth its journey ended yavtar grunted in satisfaction when his new ship bumped against the jetty safe at last from the rivers motion one crewman leaped nimbly onto the wharf and fastened the holding ropes fore and aft to the wellworn stanchions the other crewmen stowed the sail around the mast clearing the way to unload passengers and cargo his latest voyage completed successfully yavtar intended to get decently drunk for a few days while he enjoyed the spoils of war the great battle to liberate akkad had proved lucrative to the old sailor he alone of eskkars force had entered akkad with a wellfilled sack of gold payment received in advance for the use of his ships and for transporting the soldiers the day after the battle while most of the soldiers fi lled the alehouses and rejoiced at their victory yavtar had visited the countryside and used his new riches to buy a goodsized farm a few miles outside the city he then traded one of his two ships plus a stash of gold and silver coins hed managed to loot unnoticed from a dead egyptian in the tower for the proud craft he now commanded if nothing else this war had made yavtar a wealthy man safe and sound a smooth voyage just as i promised yavtar said his voice brimming with pride so you did master boatman alexar agreed standing in the prow of the craft and trying to stay out of the crews way but id rather travel by horseback any day or even walk the more fool you then yavtar said his smile softening his words ill see you tonight at zenobias you can pay for the wine too he leapt lightly to the dock and searched for the dockmaster to declare his cargo and complete his business the crowded dockside bustled with afternoon trading traffic busier than usual since korthacs attempted coup yavtar had purchased two dozen sacks of grain while in bisitun and he expected to sell them for a good profit an extra bonus to supplement the generous fee lord eskkar offered for the boats hire alexar shaking his head watched yavtar disappear into the throng of activity for a moment he ignored the crowd of idlers enjoying the spectacle of the river and the men working it and stared at the city wall and gate from here no sign of the recent confl ict remained already the fighting seemed something from long ago alexar had dwelled in akkad for the last two years laboring at any task he could find and more often than not going to bed hungry when the alur meriki swept toward the city he joined eskkars soldiers as much to secure a steady source of food as to fi ght against the barbarians to his surprise alexar found that soldiering agreed with him he trained hard and listened to his instructors in little more than six months hed risen from recruit to soldier to leader of ten and now to the lofty position of commander one of those reporting directly to lord eskkar and a member of the elite hawk clan like many of his hawk clan brothers alexar had wandered through many lands before he settled in akkad now he thought of the city as his home and knew he would never leave its crowded and noisy lanes always bustling with activity and purpose unlike most of the other villages hed seen dreary places where most people struggled even to survive here in akkad a man could improve his life plan for the future and perhaps leave something of himself behind someday whatever the coming years might bring he would follow eskkars path no matter where it led for now however alexar followed yavtars example he too jumped onto the jetty grateful to feel something solid underfoot then looked down into the boat to inspect those entrusted to his care up you go then a crewman said as he guided lani up onto the narrow plank pushed into place by the ships boy and connecting the boat with the shore alexar extended his hand and took lanis as she stepped cautiously onto the shifting gangplank thank you lani said when she reached the safety of dockside alexar repeated the process for tippu who gazed nervously at the raucous villagers after both women disembarked he relaxed for the fi rst time since leaving bisitun with his charges grateful that the voyage had ended alexars first assignment after his promotion to commander took him to bisitun eskkar had asked him to escort lani and her sister to akkad as soon as a suitable vessel could be found the easy errand gave alexar the chance to rest for a few days he knew his new duties in akkad would soon occupy all his time eskkar had an army to rebuild and a city to defend and alexar knew much would be expected of him the two soldiers whod accompanied him upriver followed the two women ashore each soldier carrying a large cloth sack that contained the womens belongings in addition to their own weapons the everhelpful crewman leaned over the boats side and handed up the last piece of cargo to alexar a goodsized cage containing a miserablelooking cat that hissed at its latest indignity with a prayer of thanks to the river gods for his safe deliverance alexar led the little cavalcade off the jetty the trip downriver from bisitun had gone without incident but it had still taken three days and alexar felt anxious to deliver his charges to eskkars house and start his new duties after he finished his commission alexar too intended to spend the rest of the day and evening drinking wine at zenobias pleasure house for the first time in his life he had enough gold in his pouch to pay for the exotic services zenobias girls provided zenobia had just opened her business when korthac seized the city and his egyptians had commandeered the establishment for their own gratification takany one of korthacs commanders had forced zenobia to service him before taking most of the other girls alexar found the egyptian second in command dead in eskkars courtyard one of mitracs arrows in his belly despite all the chaos zenobia had somehow reopened her pleasure house for business the day after eskkars return after gathering her girls and spending a whole day cleaning her establishment of its egyptian stink that was the same day the council put korthac and the other traitors to the torture and alexar had commanded the soldiers who guarded the egyptian zenobia accompanied by three of her girls had joined the chorus of those denouncing korthac though she and her girls would have preferred torturing takany one of the girls a brownhaired beauty named malika winked enticingly at the newly promoted alexar so that evening he visited zenobias for the first time malika kept him awake most of the night and in the morning hed barely reached the dock before yavtar sailed his pouch considerably lighter after enjoying the good food fi ne wine and malikas pleasant and energetic company thinking of malika made him quicken his steps the sooner he delivered his passengers the sooner he could avail himself of her services on the riverbank an old woman sat in the shade of the wall and watched the passengers disembark for two days uvela had waited there observing boats come and go an agreeable enough assignment from lady trella uvelas daughter shubure stopped by occasionally to keep her company uvela was proud of shubure the very first person in akkad to acknowledge trella as the head of eskkars household shubure now pregnant and married to a prosperous shopkeeper still worked in secret for lady trella gathering information uvela had never met the two women who walked together holding hands and glancing around in fascination at all the activity nevertheless she recognized the hawk clan emblem on alexars shoulder and knew these must be the passengers lady trella sought before alexar and his charges reached the gate uvela stood in his path good day commander alexar she said with a bow her voice quavering a little a scarf struggled to contain the long gray hair that flowed around her head but her lively eyes more than made up for a weak voice my name is uvela are these the women from bisitun summoned by lord eskkar yes elder alexar replied politely surprised that anyone at the dock would know his business why do you ask a place has been prepared for them by lady trella i am to take you there alexar looked more closely at the woman hed never seen her before but guessed she must be one of the many women working for lady trella then well follow you elder alexar said giving her a nod he trailed uvela away from the docks through the rear gate and into the city of akkad the women and soldiers following behind they wound their way through the narrow lanes passing the barracks area before moving into the better quarter of the city toward eskkars house as they drew closer alexar thought uvela intended to take them to eskkars home but a few doors away the old woman turned left instead of right and passed into a walled courtyard a bored young soldier stood guard a step inside the narrow gate he smiled at uvela then straightened up and greeted alexar respectfully when he recognized him they entered a private garden scented with jasmine and scarcely big enough to hold all six of them despite the diminutive garden alexar knew this must be one of the better houses in the city he didnt see a private well but that minor inconvenience didnt detract from the house in this part of akkad with living quarters scarce and expensive his charges would enjoy pleasant surroundings alexar put down the cage and dismissed his men he escorted lani and tippu inside carrying their possessions himself and depositing their sacks in the chamber uvela indicated the residence a mediumsized singlestory structure enclosed four small bedrooms set off from a comfortablesized communal room goodbye lani tippu he said i must report to lord eskkar my sister and i thank you for your help alexar lani said you have been more than kind may the gods keep you in their favor lord eskkar is not in the city uvela offered but at this hour captain gatus should still be at the council house then i will find him there alexar bowed to all of them and disappeared into the garden these two will be your rooms uvela began as soon as alexar left indicating two adjoining rooms farthest away from the kitchen area i suggest you take the larger one lani so uvela knew who eskkar had chosen lani wondered what else the people here knew about her and tippu this house is owned by lady trella uvela went on and is reserved for important visitors and guests one room is vacant and the other is occupied by a trader from the south he will be leaving in a few days so you should have the house to yourselves lady trella asked me to meet your boat bring you here and help with whatever you need you are most kind uvela lani answered courteously but what we both need more than anything is a bath if such a thing is possible we have been journeying in the company of men for more than three days uvela nodded her understanding traveling for women remained a difficult and dangerous task even by river its best to bathe in the tigris she gathered up two blankets from a small table next to the bed leave your things here they will be safe the guard is always here and no thief would touch the property of lord eskkar follow me the cat lani said lord eskkar said to bring the animal can we get food and water for the poor creature its been caged up the whole trip uvela nodded ill tell the guard but it might be better to keep it in the cage for a few more days until it gets used to its new surroundings and learns its new home she told the guard what was needed and they left the garden as the three women walked back toward the river gate lani looked about at the crowded lanes fi lled with people and animals all busy about their own business shed never seen a city so large how many people live here elder they say almost five thousand now uvela answered moving steadily through the throngs lani wanted to know more about akkad but that could wait until later how long have you served lady trella since she first came to live here lani it was called orak then my husband died my only granddaughter fell ill and we had nothing to pay a healer we couldnt even feed ourselves lady trella sent a healer to us and paid the bill herself thanks to her my granddaughter recovered lady trella must be a great lady does she help many in the city uvela slowed and turned to meet lanis eyes she looks after those who are her friends those she dislikes find it better to leave plain enough lani decided but she had one more question and where is lord eskkar today lord eskkar rode out with some soldiers this morning uvela saw the disappointment on lanis face and softened her next words i dont know where he is but i think hes expected back tonight or tomorrow lani felt her sisters hand tighten it took only a glance at tippu to know what she wanted uvela do you know anything about grond lord eskkars guard my sister we heard he was wounded in the fighting alexar had known of gronds wounds but could only tell tippu that grond was still alive when he left for bisitun uvela saw the look of worry on tippus face grond lost much blood but he is recovering from his wounds the healer said grond would heal faster away from the city so lord eskkar had him carried to noble rebbas farm to recover its just a short distance from the city uvela added and im sure you can visit him tomorrow if you like thank you tippu said the relief plain in her voice but her hand still clutched lanis by then they had returned to the river gate once past it uvela turned to the left away from the crowded docks and guided the women about two hundred paces downriver the tigris turned in here out of sight of the docks and an eddy pool bounded with hedges that marked the womens area provided a somewhat private place to bathe a halfdozen women stood in the water washing themselves their children and even some clothes no one took any particular notice of uvela or her companions leaving uvela on the bank lani and tippu disrobed and entered the water both girls could swim but heeding uvelas warning they stayed close to the riverbank and within the eddy pool when they finished cleaning themselves uvela helped rub them dry with the blankets after the sisters dressed uvela guided them back to the house lani realized she could never have found the place by herself her mind couldnt comprehend akkads size in such a short time you both should remain inside until you are summoned uvela said i will return shortly the old woman left stopping at the gate to speak to the guard so they would be summoned lani expected it wherever eskkar might be lani realized that she and her sister were in lady trellas power for weeks she had asked everyone she met about akkad eskkar and of course trella all accounted trella as being a fair and decent woman and more than a few depicted her as the citys real ruler and soon lani eskkars new concubine would be presented to the second most powerful person in the city lani did not think she would be welcomed with open arms by her lovers wife nevertheless she and tippu made good use of their time vigorous toweling with another set of blankets lani found within the house dried their hair and tippu used the big wooden comb to arrange her sisters soft brown tresses lani clothed herself in her best gown the one she had worn the first night for eskkar from her bag lani extracted her pot of ochre and she and tippu took turns applying the stain to their eyes another vial provided perfume for each and a small sachet held a store of mint leaves that they both chewed to sweeten their breath lani added a simple ring to each hand and a single gold pin in her hair tippu examined her sister and proclaimed her ready as for tippu she needed little artifice to enhance her own beauty they fi nished their preparations just as they heard uvelas voice outside speaking to the guard lani saw the look of fear in tippus eyes dont worry tippu lani said whatever happens eskkar will see you safely to grond and you what will happen to you whatever is meant to happen lani answered trying to sound more confident than she felt remember eskkar sent for us by then uvela had entered their room lady trella wishes to see you both uvela said ill take you there lani didnt know what to say so she forced a smile to her lips as they stepped into the lane every mans eyes turned toward them admiring their beauty and wondering who these unfamiliar women might be it took only a few steps before they reached the courtyard of trellas home lani could not help but be impressed at the size of the house almost hidden behind a wall taller than her own height two soldiers guarded the big wooden gate freshly painted and decorated it swung open for them and they passed into an expansive courtyard that seemed large enough to hold half a hundred people uvela gestured them toward the main house they entered into a large communal room empty now except for two servants who stared curiously at them lani looked in wonder at the stairs that led to the upper chambers shed never entered a house with a second story single file lani and tippu followed uvela up those stairs and into a spacious and wellventilated room that held two beautifully carved tables and a halfdozen chairs three walls showed fresh plaster a soft white color that soothed the eyes while the fourth wall with its door leading to another room had been colored a pale blue two women sat behind the larger table their backs to the second doorway waiting for a brief moment lani could not trust her eyes the darkhaired girl looked so young that lani found it hard to believe this was lady trella she didnt even look as old as tippu lady trella wore only a silver fillet to hold back her hair but her dress boasted a soft weave as fine as the one lani wore a deep crimson that complimented trellas hair and skin she wore no makeup of any kind no rings or bracelets but her tresses had been combed and brushed into a lustrous wave that cascaded about her shoulders and onto her full breasts trella stood as the three women approached the table my thanks to you uvela you have done well please wait downstairs trella sat back down but did not offer chairs to her guests lani realized the gesture of respect had been intended for uvela not as a greeting to her visitors trellas voice surprised lani not the voice of a girl but of a woman full grown one with the force and habit of command uvela left the room closing the door behind her lani felt trellas gaze upon her akkads ruler took her time examining lani at length before she turned to study tippu an inspection that lasted only a few moments trella returned her eyes to lani you are lani from bisitun lani bowed respectfully yes lady trella and this is my sister tippu may we give thanks to you for the rooms you provided for the first time lani looked directly into trellas eyes and lani saw this was no mere girl who faced her trellas face revealed no trace of emotion instead lani saw strength there and power but no hint of what she might be thinking and whatever trellas age might be her eyes announced that she saw everything knew everything trella ignored the polite question this is my friend and advisor annoksur she is also the wife of bantor commander of the gate annoksur did not stand but nodded her head the slightest amount she is still recovering from a wound she received in the struggle bowing to annoksur lani saw no kindness there only determination and toughness she recalled the story she had heard from alexar about the fighting that had taken place in this house in this very room annoksur too had fought against the usurper lani looked around for any signs of the struggle but nothing remained still korthac had been wounded and taken captive right in this very spot i heard there was a great fi ght in the house of eskkar alexar said that lady trella was also injured trella smiled briefly yes it is twice now that i have been stabbed since i came to akkad soon i will have as many scars on my body as eskkar lani saw no sign of any wound but trellas loosefitting gown revealed little though she did look a bit pale alexar had mentioned that lady trella had lost a lot of blood during the birthing in addition to the wound still the battle had ended ten days ago and both women had time to heal lani started to speak but the soft cry of a baby in another room interrupted her annoksur rose from her seat wincing as she did so ill tend the child lady trella she passed behind trellas chair and went into the other room may i offer felicitations on the birth of your son lady trella trella acknowledged the compliment with another brief smile sargon grows in strength each day he will bring honor to his father i am sure for a moment she turned toward the inner room but the crying stopped so she again faced the two sisters eskkar has told me the story of your plight lani and you tippu she said acknowledging the younger sister for the first time you both have suffered much at the hands of villains and im glad eskkar was able to release you from your captivity lani lowered her eyes at the mention of her past but quickly lifted them again lord eskkar freed us from our captor and protected us from the wrath of the villagers we owe him our lives you seemed to have repaid him well enough lani i learned of your activities weeks ago lani lifted her head a little higher i do not regret what i have done lady trella lord eskkar had fought a hard battle he needed someone to look after him and take charge of his household it is not so strange that he should want a woman to comfort him trella sighed and pursed her lips for a moment a woman to comfort him i can understand lani but somehow you managed to do more than that not to mention that you saved his life so trella knew about the fight in bisitun lani shook her head it was little enough that i did lady trella i fell to the ground and one of his attackers tripped over me eskkar described it somewhat differently and he also told me that he cared for you a thrill went through lani at the words as i care for him lady trella he saved more than our lives lani bit her lip then decided she might as well say everything on her mind you are the one he loves lady trella the moment he heard that you might be in danger he had no thoughts for me or anyone else she paused he has never told me that he loves me and what do you feel toward my husband lani do you merely seek his protection perhaps you just wanted someone to comfort you in the night or do you love him when i was with ninazu i swore that if i escaped somehow i would never let a man touch me again when the soldiers came and i pleaded for mercy lord eskkar looked at me the way any man looks at a woman but instead of taking me or tippu or giving us to his men he put his protection around us that surprised me lady trella that a great warrior could want someone but not take advantage of our weakness so i went to him just to serve him and he was tired and dirty and somehow i knew he was different from the others her voice trailed off and lani realized she had avoided answering trellas question she lifted her chin and spoke firmly yes lady trella i do love your husband she watched trella shake her head as if in disbelief but then trella smiled and for the first time her face showed the warmth of a young woman a man should be more than just an animal isnt that right lani lani felt confused both by trellas smile and her strange words i do not understand lady trella i no of course not but i do understand lani i once had much the same feelings toward eskkar myself i think its the barbarian in him that appeals to women the savage horse fighters apparently honor and respect their women more than city dwellers who seem to be crueler and harsher to us than any barbarian annoksur slipped back into the room partially closing the inner door so that the conversation would not wake the child sargon is asleep trella but i think he will need to nurse again soon she stared at lani but said nothing trellas eyes brightened at the thought of feeding her child we will be finished soon annoksur then she turned to lani again do you have any children lani the question caught lani by surprise no lady trella ishtar has never blessed me with a child though i sacrificed to her often when when i was married perhaps the fault was with your husband trella offered lanis eyes widened the scandalous words could never be said in front of a man every husband knew that if a woman didnt conceive a child it was her fault no i was his second wife his first wife died in childbirth and the babe was lost then lani understood trella wanted to know if she might be carrying eskkars child i carry no child lady trella the moon has risen for me since lord eskkar left bisitun trella said nothing just sat there for a long moment staring down at the table when she spoke her voice took on a gentler tone i am sorry to have kept you standing lani and you too tippu you must both be tired after your long voyage please sit down she turned to annoksur give our guests some wine annoksur and a small cup for me the other table held two pitchers and a halfdozen dark green glass goblets lani and tippu glanced at each other then took seats across the table from trella something must have satisfied trella lani decided servants and inferiors stood in the presence of their betters annoksur poured wine into a pair of goblets diluted them with water and handed them to lani and her sister before pouring a third glass for trella welcome to akkad lani tippu trella said her voice low lani looked down at the dark wine glinting in the green glass and wondered if it contained poison she saw tippus hand trembling with the same thought trella had not raised her glass still lani had no choice not really if lady trella wished them both dead they would die one way or another lani lifted the glass to her hostess to akkad and drank deeply emptying half the contents before she put the goblet back on the table tippu watched her for a moment then took a small sip from her own glass drink up tippu lani said the wine is very good you do not fear poison then trella asked drily no lady trella if you wish to kill me then i am in your power and at your mercy but i would remind you that my sister has done nothing to offend you you are both safe lani though i must admit there were nights when i was jealous of my husband in your arms would you like to know what i did about it did about it i dont understand no you could not as soon as i learned you were more than a casual bed partner and that eskkar was growing attached to you i sent a rider to your birthplace i wanted to learn about you the rider returned only three days ago do you know what he told me i my land is very far away how could you send i dont know what to say lady trella he reported to me that your husband was an honorable man of a respected family and that you were reputed to be a good and decent wife who prayed each day at ishtars feet for a child your whole village mourned when they heard of namtars death and your capture they thought you dead as well the mention of her husbands name sent a tremor through lanis body then she understood the full import of trellas words this girl had dispatched a rider on a long and dangerous journey of nearly three hundred miles simply to gather information all this at the merest hint of a rival for her husbands affections for the first time lani realized that all she had heard about trella must be true that the ruler of akkad had sharp wits and would be dangerous to offend more important she had the power to do whatever she wished even to send forth a man on such a difficult errand lani recalled how easily alexar had turned her and her sister over to trellas woman he had done it without question so certain of her authority and ive spoken to many from bisitun about you lani trella went on when lani didnt answer you are important to my husband so i needed to learn as much about you as i could trella paused for a moment giving lani time to comprehend now i have some questions for you lani and let me say that eskkar and i have spoken much about you and he asked me to make whatever arrangements for you that i saw fit lani nodded her head in understanding as soon as alexar turned her over to trellas woman she knew her fate rested in trellas hands not eskkars he had risked his life to rescue his wife and his newborn son he wasnt likely to offend her now not over some captive ill used by ninazu for his amusement so what is it you wish to do now that you are in akkad would you have me find you a new husband there are many good men in akkad who would look with favor on you and you could have your pick of several or do you want to live by yourself for a time that too can be arranged eskkar has set aside enough gold for you to do whatever you choose gold meant freedom protection even for two women alone lani could get a house servants she could choose her own life it sounded too good to be true and yet trella waited a moment but lani said nothing or do you wish to remain as eskkars concubine lani didnt hesitate lady trella if i could be permitted to remain as lord eskkars concubine i would pay anything do anything there is nothing to pay lani and the gold is yours already however there are rules if you are to be his concubine so you must think hard about this trella leaned forward and her voice took on a harder edge there must be no issue from your womb lani if you become with child you must take the herbs to force the child from your body if that fails and a boy is born you must give it up sargon is to be the only heir to his father she waited for lani to speak that is very hard lady trella lani felt the tears start and bit her lip to stop them she would not cry in front of this girl but i do not think i will conceive no lani that is not what you must say trella cut in her voice firm you will not be a wife and there will not be a son you must agree to that if you hope for a child of your own then you must give up eskkar and seek another man to father it the tears started and this time lani couldnt stop them to never have a child was a terrible curse for a woman the only thing worse than such an evil would be to give a child away she looked up at trella surprised to see sadness and sympathy in her eyes trella had just delivered her own baby and knew what she asked but lani hesitated only a moment i will take the herbs lady trella if i bear a son i will give him up i am sorry to do this to you lani but i must sargon needs protection as do eskkar and i as will you if you are to be his companion we still have many enemies you must swear to do all that you can to protect and serve all three of us what can i do to protect you and eskkar lani heard the confusion in her voice how could she do anything to protect anyone more than you realize lani much is at stake here too much to tell you about now but you know we barely survived a siege by the barbarians and then this attempt by korthac to kill us all and seize control of akkad there will be more such strife in the future and i we will need all the help we can find i will do whatever you ask whatever i can to protect all of you what else must i do as eskkars concubine you will see no other man only him and you will only see him once or twice a week or when the moon does not permit me to be with him your role will be to share pleasure with him to soothe and comfort his body and ease his mind i love him too much to give up more of his spirit so lani would become a consort a pleasure girl little better than a hired prostitute or slave whose only business would be to please and satisfy her lover it would be a bittersweet role to play trella would be his wife his lover his companion the mother of his children lani would be almost nothing have nothing trella saw the struggle in lanis eyes and leaned forward across the table you do not need to accept this lani i know this is very hard to bear all i can say is that if you do accept you will be helping eskkar and myself if this role becomes too difficult you can stop being his concubine and we will find another place for you another task or a husband of your own lani heard the words more important she realized that for some unknown reason trella wanted lani to agree to this wanted her to continue as eskkars concubine it must mean a great deal to trella though lani didnt understand why she could turn down this role but that thought was too awful to bear lani remembered the pain in her breast as eskkar sailed away from bisitun likely going to his death shed been willing to kill herself at that moment rather than face life without him at least this would be better than that fate and if it helped eskkar i will do whatever you ask i will be his concubine if he so chooses the words came out almost without volition lanis love for eskkar gave her no choice she watched trella lean back in her seat a hint of fatigue in her face lani remembered that in the last few days this girl had delivered a baby practically in the midst of a battle been wounded and then had to fight to save her own life and the life of her child then im glad youre here lani i welcome you to eskkars household there will be much for you to do and much to learn we will speak often in the coming days go now and rest tonight when eskkar returns from the countryside i will send him to you now dry your eyes lanis tears came without stopping she felt tippus arm around her shoulders but still lani found it difficult to stand trella turned to annoksur can you help her while i attend to sargon annoksur arose and took a square of linen from her dress your eyes are very beautiful lani she said her voice surprisingly gentle the hardness gone from her face your tears will spoil your eye coloring she dabbed gently at lanis cheeks ill take you back to uvela somehow lani got to her feet and let herself be escorted to the door blurred by tears her eyes refused to focus properly she had to hold on to annoksurs arm to make sure she did not fall going down the stairs tippu following anxiously behind them lani struggled to hold back most of her tears until they left the house keeping only one thought in her mindthat eskkar would come to her bed tonight and that once again she would be safe in his arms trella sighed when the door closed she regretted hurting someone like that a good woman who had done nothing wrong but it needed to be done from her own sources from eskkar and from what she had just seen she realized that lani possessed a strong mind with wits sharp enough to see what the future would bring trella didnt like sharing eskkars affections but anyone could see that lani loved eskkar and trella saw just as clearly that eskkar possessed more than a little love for lani even if as she claimed he had never said the words in the coming days as lani learned more about the everpresent dangers that surrounded them all trella knew lani would do everything in her power to protect eskkar and that would soon include trella and the child in a few months lani would become a firm supporter of eskkars house and she would be useful in many other ways eskkar had told her about lanis skills in running the household and of her suggestion that he use the river to return to akkad and for that alone trella might owe lani her own life and the life of her child another few days delay in reaching akkad and korthac might never have been toppled after a time lani might even tire of being eskkars concubine still young she would want children of her own when that day came trella would make sure the right man stood beside her someone who could give lani the happiness she deserved but until that day lani would join with annoksur gatus bantor and even corio and nicar and others all those who depended on eskkars continuing reign over akkad lani would fit in well with trellas plans there were few enough trella could trust and she had to make the most of each of them she searched constantly for sharpwitted women like lani who could think for themselves enhedu gave promise to be another such one and trella had already worked out a new role for her and tammuz and it would be good for eskkar to have another woman once in a while a strong and powerful man her father used to say needed more than one woman anyway but in the future trella would ensure eskkar took only women that she approved of pliable ones that she could bend to her will she would speak with zenobia about supplying just the right kind of woman every few months empty vessels her father called themwomen with beauty but few wits docile and easily forgotten men of power or wealth always found themselves sought after by every woman eager to expand her own prestige or influence with lani this would never happen because her only goal would be to make eskkar happy and eskkar could be truly happy only with his wife and son so even lani would help bring about trellas vision of the future the future that trella and eskkar would build for their son sargon five years she decided in five years their position would be secure akkad would grow great and powerful and everyone in these lands would attribute their wealth and safety to eskkar the expansion and consolidation of all the farms and villages between akkad and bisitun would hasten that process and all would benefit from the new prosperity and security with a code of laws established and honestly enforced the people would soon forget the old and confusing days when powerful merchants ruled unchecked more than half the citys inhabitants had arrived within the last year and had little connection to the old days five years from now everyone would have forgotten about eskkars barbarian origin and her own days as a slave the people of the city would look to sargon as their future ruler one of their own and born in akkad when that day finally arrived she and sargon would be safe surrounded by the new and stillunraised walls and hundreds no thousands of soldiers to protect them from the other room she heard the baby crying she stood stretching her back and went into the bedroom she took the mewing child from its cradle ignoring the pain in her side as she bent over to lift him and sat down on the bed trella slipped one arm out of her dress wiped the tears from sargons eyes and let the boy nurse enjoying the feel of him against her breast as the milk began to flow she gently rocked back and forth thinking about his future tonight she would be alone with sargon and she would spend the time resting and talking to her son tonight eskkar would be with another woman but he would return to her in the morning with a certainty that she couldnt understand she knew he would always come back to her they had been through too much together had fought and bled together the gods had interwoven their lifestrands created an alliance between them stronger than any bonds of family friendship or even the marriage bed the road ahead might be perilous and uncertain but their spirits and blood had strengthened the very walls of akkad and nothing could separate them either from each other or from their fates she and eskkar would rule together or not at all she smiled at the suckling child and leaned down to kiss his head the helpless infant in her arms would reign one day perhaps over an even greater expanse than trella could envision more important sargon would carry their blood down through the ages yet to come shed seen the look in her husbands eyes when he held their child the boys birth had changed eskkar yet again made him stronger even as it drew him closer to her and that was as it should be eskkar had risked his life for her and their son and she knew their love for each other remained strong she would give up one or two nights each week to ensure her husbands love and affections went no further thus she reasoned with herself though she suspected that in the darkness she would awake alone and wish eskkar back in her arms but the morning would come eskkar would return and the new day and those that followed would find them together
