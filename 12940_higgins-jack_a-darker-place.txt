shower monica starling sat at the dressing table in her suite in the pierre and applied her makeup carefully shed dried and arranged her streaked blond hair in her favorite style as she always did and now sat back and gave herself the onceover not bad for forty and she didnt look that ancient even she had to admit that she smiled remembering the remark sean dillon had made on the first occasion they had met lady starling as jane austen would have darcy say its always a pleasure to meet a truly handsome woman the rogue she thought wondering what he was up to this exenforcer with the provisional ira and now an operative in what everyone referred to as the prime ministers private army he was a thoroughly dangerous man and yet he was her lover look at you monica she thought shaking her heada cambridge don with three doctorates falling for a man like that yet there it was she put on a snowwhite blouse beautifully cut in fine egyptian cotton and buttoned it carefully next came a trouser suit as black as night one of valentinos masterpieces simple diamond studs for the ears manolo blahnik shoes and she was finished yes excellent girl she said full marks she smiled thinking of her escort dear sweet old george dunkley professor emeritus at corpus christi college cambridge in european literature bless his cotton socks and all seventy years of him and thrilled out of his mind to be here tonight not that she wasnt a little thrilled herself when shed accepted the united nations invitation to this international scholars weekend shed had no idea who the guest of honor would turn out to be alexander kurbskythe greatest novelist of his generation as far as she was concerned on the death of men and moscow nightsastonishing achievements born out of his experiences as a paratrooper in afghanistan and then the years of hell during the first and second chechen wars and he was still only in his late thirties hardly anyone outside russia had actually met him since the publication of those books the government kept him on such a short leash and yet here he was in new york it was going to be quite an evening she turned from the mirror and the phone rang dillon said i thought id catch you what time is it there just after midnight looking forward to meeting kurbsky i must admit i am ive never seen george so excited for good reason kurbskys an interesting guy in lots of ways his father was kgb you know when his mother died giving birth to his sister an aunt raised them both for several years and then one day kurbsky just up and ran away to london the aunt was living there by then and he stayed with her studied at the london school of economics for two years and thengone again went back joined the paratroops and the rest is history or myth call it what you like i know all that sean its in his publishers handout still it should be quite an evening i imagine so how do you look bloody marvelous thats my girl slay the people ill go now love you she said but he was gone men she thought wryly theyre from a different planet and she got her purse and went to do battle in a room on the floor below alexander kurbsky examined himself in the mirror and ran a comb through his shoulderlength dark hair the tangled beard suggesting a medieval bravo a roisterer promising a kiss for a woman and a blow for a man it was his personal statement a turning against any kind of control after his years in the army he was a shade under five ten much of his face covered by the beard and his eyes were gray like water over stone he was dressed totally in black a kind of jersey with a collar fastened by a single button at the neck black jacket and trousers obviously brioni even his pocket handkerchief was black his mobile phone encrypted buzzed bounine said turn left out of the entrance fifty meters and im waiting black volvo kurbsky didnt reply simply switched off went out found the nearest elevator and descended he went out of the entrance of the hotel ignoring the staff on duty walked his fifty meters found the volvo and got in how far he asked bounine glanced briefly at him and smiled through goldrimmed glasses he had thinning hair and the look of somebodys favorite uncle about him except that he was gru fifteen minutes ive checked it lets get on with it then kurbsky leaned back and closed his eyes igor vronsky was thirtyfive and looked ten years older but that was his drug habit his hair was black and a little too long verging on the unkempt the skin was stretched too tightly across a narrow face with pointed chin a paisley neckerchief at his throat and a midnightblue velvet jacket combined by intention to give him a theatrical look his notoriety in moscow these days didnt worry him the government loathed him for his book on putins time in the kgb but this was america he had a new job writing for the new york times and they couldnt touch him the book had brought him fame money womento hell with moscow he smiled at himself in the bathroom mirror then leaned down to inhale the first of two lines of cocaine that waited it was good stuff absolutely and he followed it with the second line he was dizzy for a moment then slightly chilled in the brain and suddenly very sharp and ready for the great alexander kurbsky there was an old russian saying there is room for only one cock on any dunghill he had no illusions that kurbsky would be the star attraction at this soiree but it might be amusing to knock him off his pedestal he moved into the untidy living room of the small fifthfloor apartment found a raincoat and let himself out he never books a cab bounine had said its only a step into columbus avenue where he can have them by the dozen so kurbsky waited in the shadows for vronsky to emerge stand for a moment under the light of the doorway to his apartment building then advance to the left pulling up his collar against the rain as he passed kurbsky reached out and pulled him close with considerable strength his left arm sliding around the neck in a choke hold the blade of his bonehandled gutting knife springing into action at the touch of the button vronsky was aware of the needle point nudging in through his clothing the hand now clamped over his mouth the blade seeming to know exactly what it was doing as it probed for the heart he slid down in a corner of the doorway and died very quickly on his knees kurbsky took out a fresh handkerchief wiped the knife clean and closed it then he leaned over the body found a wallet and mobile phone turned and walked to where bounine waited he got in the volvo and they drove away its done bounine said kurbsky opened the glove compartment and put the wallet inside plus the mobile phone youll get rid of those just another street mugging he was on coke are you sure im sure he took out a pack of marlboros bounine said does it bother you kurbsky said calmly did chechnya bother you he lit a cigarette anyway im not in the mood for discussion ive got a performance to give lets get the great alexander kurbsky onstage as they moved along columbus avenue bounine said is that all it is to you alex yuri old friend im not into freud at the start of a dark winters evening in good old new york just get me to the pierre where my fans are waiting he leaned back staring out at the sleet and smoked his cigarette when monica starling and professor dunkley went into the reception at the pierre it was awash with people the surroundings magnificent the great and the good well in evidence the us ambassador to the united nations was there and his russian counterpart the champagne flowed monica and dunkley took a glass each moved to one side and simply observed the scene there seem to be a few film stars dunkley said there would be george they like to be seen there seems to be a pop star or two as well i suppose they feel an affair like this touches them with a certain gravitas hes there dunkley said talking to the french ambassador henri guyon and the russianwhats his name again ivan makeev monica told him they seem very enthusiastic about something their heads together except for kurbsky he looks bored if anything monica said well be lucky to get anywhere near him dunkley told her mournfully look at all those people hovering like vultures waiting for the ambassadors to finish with him so they can move in weve had it oh i dont know she stood there her left hand on her hip her black suede purse dangling from it and as he turned she caught his eye and toasted him glass raised and emptied it he knew her of course but she didnt know that and he gave her a lazy and insolent smile as he walked over lady starling a pleasure long overdue he relieved her of her empty glass and waved for a passing waiter how are things in cambridge these days and this will be professor george dunkley am i correct ive read your book on the other alexander dunkley was stunned my dear chap he shook hands obviously deeply affected the other alexander monica inquired an early work dunkley told her an analysis of alexander dumas and his writing salon all those assistants and dumas prowling up and down the aisles like a schoolmaster in a black frock coat kurbsky said he resonated charm throwing it off as if it was of no account his voice pleasantly deep only a hint of a russian accent was it really like that monica asked but of course and look what it produced the three musketeers the man in the iron mask the count of monte cristo dunkley said breathless with enthusiasm the literary establishment in paris in his day treated him abominably i agree on the other hand they really got their faces rubbed in it when his son turned out one of the greatest of french plays la dame aux cam√©llias and then verdi used the story for la traviata dunkley said kurbsky smiled one would hope dumas got a royalty they laughed and dunkley said oh my goodness captain kurbsky my seminars would be so crowded if my students knew you were going to attend thats an enticing prospect but cambridge is not possible im afraidand captain kurbsky belongs to a time long gone im plain alexander now he smiled at monica or alex if you prefer she returned his smile slightly breathless and an aide approached and said formally the ambassador is ready if you would form the party dinner is served yes of course kurbsky said these two will be sitting with me the aide faltered but sir i dont think that would be possible its all arranged then rearrange it he shrugged of course if there is a problem we could sit at another table no of course not sir the aide said hastily no needno need at all ill go and make the necessary changes he departed dunkley said i say old chap we seem to be causing a bit of a problem not at all im their russian frankenstein the great alexander kurbsky led out like a bear on a chain to astonish the world and help make mother russia seem great again all this was delivered with no apparent bitterness and those cold gray eyes gave nothing away they reminded monica uncomfortably of dillon as kurbsky continued taking monicas hand and raising it to his lips if you glance over my shoulder you may see the russian ambassador approaching to see what the fuss is about quite right monica told him is he going to be angry not at all the moment he claps eyes on the most beautiful woman in the room hes going to scramble to make sure you grace his table and no one elses he turned to dunkley isnt that so professor dont ask me dear boy im just going with the flow i havent enjoyed myself so much in years and then the ambassador arrived the diplomat ended up with his wife seated on his right monica on his left and kurbsky opposite dunkley beamed away lower down the table facing the french ambassador and proving that an englishman could speak the language perfectly the whole thing was thoroughly enjoyable but glancing across the table monica was conscious that kurbsky had withdrawn into himself he reminded her once again of dillon in a way for one thing the champagne intake was considerable but there was an air of slight detachment he observed not really taking part but then that was the writer in him judging people constantly assessing the situation in which he found himself he caught her eye smiled slightly and raised his eyebrows as if saying what fools they all were and then silence was called for speeches and the russian ambassador led the way it was as if it were international friendship week nothing unpleasant was happening in the world the wars in iraq and afghanistan had faded into obscurity the only thing of any significance being this dinner in one of new yorks greatest hotels with wonderful food champagne and beautiful women everyone applauded and when monica glanced again at kurbsky he had joined in but with the same weary detachment there as the applause died the french ambassador rose he kept it brief and succinct he was pleased to announce that if alexander kurbsky would make himself available in paris in two weeks time the president of france would have great pleasure in decorating him with the l√©gion dhonneur tumultuous acclaim and kurbsky stood and thanked the ambassador of france in a graceful little speech delivered in fluent french it was a fitting end to a wonderful evening later as people dispersed monica and dunkley hovered there was no sign of kurbsky what an evening dunkley said i havent enjoyed myself so much in years they were on a virgin flight to london in the morning leaving at tenthirty local time weve got an early start so im for bed ill see you in the morning she said he walked away to the elevators monica paused still seeking a sign of kurbsky but there wasnt one in fact he was outside the hotel sitting in the volvo talking to bounine this legion of honor nonsense did you know about it absolutely not but whats wrong alex the legion of honorits the greatest of all french decorations do you ever get a so what feeling yuri ive been there done that are you saying no you cant alex putin wants it the country wants it youll be there in paris in two weeks so will i god help us youve got your own falcon back to moscow in the morning and a falcons as good as a gulfstream is that a fact yes old son ill pick you up at ten sharp kurbsky shrugged yes i suppose you will he got out and bounine drove away kurbsky watched him go turned and went back into the pierre the first thing he saw was monica waiting for an elevator and he approached catching her just in time fancy a nightcap lady she smiled pleased that hed turned up why not he took her arm and they went to the bar there werent too many people they sat in the corner and he had russian vodka ice cold and she contented herself with green tea very healthy of you he told her i wish i could say the same to you but im not sure about that stuff you have to be born to it doesnt it rot the brain not really drunk this way from a glass taken from crushed ice it freezes the brain clears it when problems loom if you believe that youll believe anything no its true now tell me i know about your academic accomplishmentsthe ministry of arts in moscow is very thorough when one is attending affairs like thisbut nothing about you im puzzled that such a woman would not be married im a widow alex have been for some years my husband was a professor at cambridge rather older than me and a knight of the realm so no children no a brother if that helps her smile faltered for a moment as she remembered her brother harry recuperating from the terrible knife wounds he had so recently suffered and even more the terrible psychological wounds to see his wife assassinated after being mistaken for himthe healing process would take a long time she brought the smile back hes a member of parliament she said making no mention of what he really did for the prime minister of course kurbsky actually knew all that but he kept up the subterfuge but there must be a man in your life a woman like you she wasnt offended in the slightest yes there is such a man then he must count himself lucky he poured another vodka and she said what about you good heavens no the occasional relationship but it never lasts im a very difficult man but then ive had a difficult life you know about me a bit your aunt raised you right svetlana was everything i loved her dearly but life in moscow under communism was difficult when i was seventeen she got a chance to travel with a theater group to london she was an actressand she met a professor named patrick kelly a good man for once she had found something for herself so she refused to return to moscow stayed in london and married him how was it you managed to join her that was my father as a kgb colonel he had influence he arranged for me to visit svetlana hoping shed change her mind and your sister tania was at high school and only fifteen shed never been close to svetlana and so she stayed with my father there were servants a couple living in my fathers house to care for her and where did the london school of economics come in he grinned looking different like a boy i always had a love of books and literature so i didnt need to study it i found a new world at the lse svetlana and kelly had a wonderful victorian house in belsize park and they felt i should fill my time for a few months so i took courses sociology psychology philosophy the months stretched out two years what made you return to moscow news from home bad news over fiftyfive thousand dead in afghanistan too many body bags brokenhearted mothers revolting in the streets student groups fighting with the police tania was only seventeen but up to her neck in it pitched battles riot police many casualties he paused his face bleak and tania among them her response was so instinctive as to be almost banal she put a hand on his im so sorry i returned at once a waste of time of courseit was all over just a headstone in minsky park military cemetery my father used his influence to make things look respectable she was already dead when hed got in touch with me in london so hed trapped me into returning i got my revenge on him when i went downtown and joined the paratroopers he was stuck with that to pull me out would have looked bad in communist party circles then what if youve read the opening chapters of on the death of men you already know there was no time to learn how to jump out of a plane with a parachute i got three months basic training then i was off to afghanistan it was eightynine the year everything fell apart the year we scrambled to get out and lucky to make it it must have been hell something like that only we didnt appreciate that chechnya was to come two years of that and that was just the first war there was a long pause and he poured another vodka with a steady hand she said what nowwhat next im not sure only a handful of writers can achieve great success and any writer lucky enough to write the special book will tell you the most urgent question is whether you can do it again or it was just some gigantic fluke but you answered that question for yourself with moscow nights i suppose but i dont know i just feel so claustrophobic now hemmed in by my minders she laughed you mean the bearonthechain thing surely thats up to you when svetlana cast off her chains and refused to return to moscow she had to defect but things are different now the russian federation is not dominated by communism any longer no but it is dominated by vladimir putin i am just as controlled as i would have been in the old days i travel in a jet provided by the ministry of arts i am in the hands of gru minders wherever i go i dont even handle my own passport they would never let me go willingly a terrible pity any of the great universities would love to get their hands on you im biased of course but cambridge would lay out the red carpet for you an enticing prospect he sat there frowning slightly as if considering it she said is there anything particular to hold you in moscow not a thing cancer took my father some years ago there are cousins here and there svetlana is my closest relative no woman in my life he smiled and shrugged not at the moment anyway so she said they watch me closely if they knew i was even talking this way to you theyd lock me up he nodded anyway well see paris in a fortnight something to look forward to you should be proud she opened her purse and produced a card take this my mobile phone number is on it its a codex encrypted and classified you can call me on it whenever you like encrypted im impressed you must be well connected you could say that she stood up and said i mean it call me paris isnt too far from cambridge when you think of it he smiled if it ever happened i wouldnt want an academic career id prefer to leave the stage for a while escape my present masters perhaps but vanish id like to think that my escape would be total so moscow had no clue as to where i had gone i wouldnt appreciate the british press knocking on my door wherever i was i see what you mean but that could be difficult not if i were able to leave quietly no fuss at all moscow would know id gone but the last thing theyd want would be for it to be public knowledge create a scandal theyd keep quiet say i was working in the country or something on a new book and try to hunt me down i take the point and will pass it on to my friends take care he caught her arm these friends of yours they would have to be very special people who knew how to handle this kind of thing she smiled oh they are call me alex when youve had time to think she went to the elevators a door opened at once she stepped in and it closed four oclock in the morning in london but in the holland park safe house giles roper sat as usual in his wheelchair his screens active as he probed cyberspace his bombscarred face restless hed slept in the chair for a couple of hours now doyle the night sergeant had provided him with a bacon sandwich and a mug of tea he ate the sandwich and was pouring a shot of scotch when monicas voice came over the speaker are you there roper where else would i be youre the only fixed point in a troubled universe thats one thing ive learned since getting involved with you people is sean spending the night returned to a bed in staff quarters ages ago how was your evening did kurbsky impress just listen and see what you think it didnt take long in the telling and when she was finished roper said if hes serious i cant see why we couldnt arrange something ill speak to sean and general ferguson first thing in the morning you we should be seeing sometime in the early evening exactly she switched off he sat there thinking about it for a while alexander kurbsky doing a runner to england my god vladimir putin will be furious he put kurbsky up on the screen too goodlooking for his own good he decided morosely then brought up his record and started going through it carefully kurbsky had found bounine in the volvo outside the pierre to bring him up to speed he smoked a cigarette bounine said so far so good its worked she must be quite a lady thats an understatement so if they take the bait we have paris to look forward to colonel luzhkov will be pleased only because he wants to please putin and if paris works you mustnt be a part of it yuri no one should know who you are luzhkov will work out something for you cultural attach√© for instance would do you very well someone i can trust personally when im in london im glad you still do bounine said its been a long time yuri youre the only gru man i know who looks like an accountant no one would ever dream you were in afghanistan and chechnya in the paratroopers whereas you old friend look like they found you in central casting the smiler with the knife they used to call you from that first year remember quite right kurbsky got out and turned holding the door i also write good books great books bounine smiled one thing is certain putin will be happy the way things have gone putin has many reasons to be happy with the way things are going these days kurbsky said night yuri he closed the door and went back into the hotel moscow london it had all started three weeks before with colonel boris luzhkov head of station for the gru at the embassy of the russian federation in london the summons to moscow had come from putin himself and could not be denied although it had surprised luzhkov that it had come from him and not from general ivan volkov of the gru putins security adviser the reason became clear when he was driven to berkley down outside london and found a falcon jet waiting to fly him to moscow a luxury that should have warned him to expect the worst two pilots were on board the aircraft ready to go and a steward who introduced himself as sikov was waiting as he boarded luzhkov seated himself and belted in sikov said a great pleasure colonel the flight time is approximately seven hours i was instructed to give you this from prime minister putins office as soon as you arrived may i offer you a drink a large vodka i hate takeoffs i once crashed in chechnya sikov had given him what looked like a legal file sikov did it old style a bottle in one hand a glass in the other luzhkov tossed it back and coughed holding out his glass sikov poured another then moved up to the small galley luzhkov swallowed the vodka and as the plane started to roll examined the file several typed sheets stapled together and an envelope addressed to him which he opened the letter was headed from the office of the prime minister of the russian federation it went on attention of colonel boris luzhkov you will familiarize yourself with the material contained in the enclosed report and be prepared to discuss it with the prime minister on your arrival luzhkov sat there staring down at the report a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach the falcon had risen fast to thirty thousand and the flight so far was very smooth sikov returned would you like to order colonel business first better get it over with more vodka was indicated he suspected he was going to need it in fact it was worse than he could have imagined although some of it was already familiar to him th e report detailed an operation gone bad general volkov had hired a group of ira heavies to strike at ferguson and his associates but instead it was ferguson who had struck at them killing them all at their base in drumore in the irish republic if that wasnt bad enough general volkov himself and two gru men had disappeared it could only mean one thing on top of that the attempted assassination of harry miller the individual known as the prime ministers rottweiler had been a botched job from the beginning and had succeeded only in killing his wife in error andthe greatest shock of allvolkovs connection to osama bin laden the shadowy man known only as the broker had been unmasked it had turned out to be simon carter the deputy director of the british security services luzhkov could hardly believe his eyeshe had known carter for years needless to say carter was no longer in the picture either millers sister lady monica starling had apparently played a part in the drumore affair too and now she had an apparent relationship with dillon gru agents of whom there were twentyfour at the london embassy had sighted them together on a number of occasions it was all a bit too much for luzhkovs whirling brain but he turned the page and found one that was headed solutions he started to read pouring himself another vodka and gagged on it as his own name came up he read the paper several times phrases like the prime ministers final decision in this matter floating before him finally he came to the last page headed alexander kurbsky it began kurbsky is a man of extraordinary talents who has served his country well in time of war to use these talents again in the present situation would be of great use to the state if he objects in any way the enclosed dvd and the additional attached information should persuade him there was a small dvd screen on the back of the seat in front of luzhkov and after reading the information he inserted the dvd and switched on it lasted only five minutes or so and when it was finished he switched off and removed it holy mother of god he said softly and there was sweat on his brow he took out a handkerchief and mopped it sikov approached something to eat colonel why not boris luzhkov said wearily why not they landed on time and a limousine with a uniformed gru driver at the wheel was waiting the streets were dark frostbound a city of ghosts snow drifting downangels wings his mother used to call them when he was littleand he sat there thinking of what awaited him as they passed the great entrance of the kremlin and moved through narrow streets to the rear paused in a paved yard steps up to an entrance a blue light over it the door swung open and a young lieutenant in gru uniform admitted him please to follow me colonel luzhkov had never been to putins suite in his entire career and he followed in a kind of awe one gloomy corridor after another the decorations finally becoming more ornate oil paintings in gold frames on walls everything was subdued no sign of people not even an echoing voice and then they turned left and discovered two individuals in good suits seated in high chairs on either side of a large gilded door each of them had a machine pistol on a small table by his right hand they showed not the slightest emotion as the lieutenant opened the door and ushered luzhkov through the room was a delight paneled walls painted in seventeenthcentury style heavily gilded furniture of the correct period portraits of what were probably obscure tsars confronting each other across the room a large ornate desk in the center its very beautiful luzhkov said astonishing this was general volkovs private office the lieutenant informed him the use of the past tense confirmed luzhkovs misgivings the prime minister will be with you directly help yourself to a drink he withdrew and luzhkov in a slight daze moved to the sideboard bearing a collection of bottles and vodka in an ice bucket he opened the bottle filled a glass and drank it its going to be all right he murmured just hang on to that thought he turned glass in hand as a secret door in the wall behind the desk opened and vladimir putin entered comrade prime minister luzhkov stammered very oldfashioned of you colonel sit down my time is limited he sat himself and luzhkov faced him youve read my report every word a great tragedy the loss of general volkov my most valued security adviser can he be replaced comrade prime minister i shall handle as much as i can myself but on the ground i need a safe pair of hands particularly in london you will now be reporting directly to me you agree its its an honor luzhkov stammered more and more london is our greatest stumbling block in intelligence matters we must do something about it these people ferguson dillon those london gangsters of theirs the salters what is your opinion of them the london gangster as a species is himself alone comrade prime minister ive employed them myself although they wrap themselves in the union jack and praise the queen at the drop of a hat this miller has suddenly become a major player do you think theyll appoint him to carters post i dont see him wanting the job more likely itll be lord arthur tilsey he held that post years ago and was awarded his peerage for it hes seventytwo but still very sharp and hes old friends with ferguson hell do for the interim at least and millers sister lady starling you think there is something in this attachment with dillon it would seem so putin nodded all right it is clear we need to infiltrate this group people at the highest level of security in the british system youve read my suggestion what do you think alexander kurbsky an astonishing idea comrade prime minister he is so infamous exactly just like in the cold war days he defects who on earth would doubt him it fits like a glove the un wants him for some gathering in new york lady starling will also be there all kurbsky has to do is approach her and turn on the charm a colossal talent a muchdecorated war hero and handsome to boothe cant go wrong shes the key her links to her brother and ferguson and now dillonthey make everything possible if she passes the information to her friends theyll think of paris and the right arrangements will be put in hand im certain of it but luzhkovmake sure you dont tell his gru minders in paris whats going on his escape must at all times appear genuine to the british if the minders fall by the wayside so be it of course luzhkov said hastily finally kurbsky makes it clear that his defection attracts no publicity he will demand a guarantee of that otherwise he wont do it and you think ferguson and company will accept that absolutely because he knows what jackals the british press are we stay quiet about the whole matter but all our security systems go through the motions of trying to recover him as far as the general public knows hes working away somewhere faded from view any questions i was just wondering this suggestion regarding the journalist igor vronsky in new york that kurbsky eliminate him is there a problem no luzhkov said hastily i was just wondering would this set a precedent i mean would that kind of thing be part of his remit if you mean would i expect him to assassinate the queen of england i doubt it on the other hand should a more tempting target present itself who knows i doubt it would bother him too much he was in the death business for long enough and in my experience few people really change in this life was there anything else only that everything hinges on him actually agreeing to this plan comrade prime minister putin smiled oh i dont think that will be a problem luzhkov in fact i expect him any minute now ill leave him to you and he disappeared back behind the secret door moments later the door behind luzhkov opened and alexander kurbsky entered the gru lieutenant hard on his heels an hour earlier kurbsky had been delivered to the same rear door of the kremlin by military police although he had been drinking when they picked him up at his hotel hed been enough in control to realize that when the kremlin was mentioned it meant serious business hed been led into a small anteroom next to the main office with chairs and a tv in the corner he said all right i bore easily so what is this about the lieutenant gave him the dvd watch this ill be back he opened the door and paused im a great fan the door closed behind him kurbsky frowned examining the dvd then he went and inserted it produced a pack of cigarettes lit one and sat down the screen flickered a voice quoted a lengthy number and then said subject tania kurbsky aged seventeen born moscow he straightened stunned as he saw tania his beloved sister gaunt hair closecropped with sunken cheeks the voice droned on about a court case five dead policemen in a riot seven students charged and shot tania kurbsky had been given a special dispensation obtained because of her father colonel ivan kurbsky of the kgb instead of execution shed been sentenced to life irrevocable to be served at station gorky in siberia about as far from civilization as it was possible to get she was still living aged thirtysix there followed a picture that barely resembled her a gaunt careworn woman old before her time the screen went dark kurbsky got up slowly ejected the dvd and stood looking at it then turned went to the door and kicked it after a while it was unlocked and the lieutenant appeared one of the guards stood there machine pistol ready kurbsky said where do i go follow me which kurbsky did in the next room he looked luzhkov over and who would you be behind him the lieutenant smiled colonel boris luzhkov gru im acting under prime minister putins orders youve just missed him how are you for a man whos just discovered that the dead can walk im doing all right ill be better if i have a drink he went to the cabinet and had two large vodka shots then he cursed so get on with it i presume theres a purpose to all this sit down and read this luzhkov pushed the file across the desk and kurbsky started fifteen minutes later he sat back i dont write thrillers it certainly reads like one and this is from the prime minister yes and whats the payoff your sisters released she will be restored to life thats one way of putting it how do i know it will be honored the prime ministers word dont make me laugh hes a politician since when do those guys keep their word and luzhkov said exactly the right thing shes your sister if that means anything this is all you can do its as simple as that better than nothing you have to travel hopefully fuck you kurbsky said and fuck him but there was the hint of despair of a man who knew he had little choice anything else yes igor vronsky does he mean anything to you absolutely the stinking bastard was in chechnya and ran a story about my outfit the fifth paratroop company the black tigers we were pathfinders and special forces he did radio from the front line blew the whistle on a special op we were on and the chechens ambushed us fifteen good men dead its in my book hes working as a journalist in new york now we want you to eliminate him just to prove you mean business just like that i believe you enjoyed a certain reputation in chechnya the smiler with a knife an accomplished sniper and assassin who specialized in that kind of thing a lone wolf as they say at least three highranking chechen generals could testify to that if the dead could speak that story in on the death of men where the hero is parachuted behind the lines when he had never had training as a parachutist was it true did you luzhkov was troubled in some strange way what kind of man would do such a thing one who in the hell that was afghanistan decided he was dead already a walking zombie who survived to go home and found himself a year later kneedeep in blood in chechnya you can make of that what you will ill need to think about it im not sure i understand kurbsky laughed remember the old saying avoid looking into an open grave because you may see yourself in there in those old cold war spy books you always had to have a controller would that be you yes im head of station for gru at the london embassy thats good ill like that i had an old comrade in chechnya who transferred to the gru when i was coming to the end of my army time yuri bounine could you find him and bring him in on this im sure that will be possible excellent so if youre available lets get out of here and go and get something to eat an excellent idea luzhkov led the way and said to the lieutenant the limousine is waiting i presume well go back to my hotel of course colonel they followed him along the interminable corridors they seem to go on forever luzhkov observed a fascinating place the kremlin a rabbit warren kurbsky said a man could lose himself here a smiler with a knife could do well here he turned as they reached the door perhaps the prime minister should consider that he followed the lieutenant down the steps to the limousine and luzhkov troubled went after them over the three weeks that followed things flowed with surprising ease they moved into a gru safe house outside moscow with training facilities on the firing range kurbsky proved his skill and proficiency with every kind of weapon the sergeant major in charge could throw at him kurbsky had forgotten nothing of his old skills yuri bounine by now a gru captain was plucked from the monotony of posing as a commercial attach√© at the russian embassy in dublin where he was promoted to major and assigned to london delighted to be reunited with his old friend kurbsky embraced him warmly when he arrived youve put on weight you bastard he turned to luzhkov look at him gold spectacles always smiling the look of an aging cherub yet we survived afghanistan and chechnya together hes got medals again he hugged bounine who said and you got famous i read on the death of men five times and tried to work out who was me in a way they all were yuri bounine flushed suddenly awkward so whats going on thats for colonel luzhkov to tell you which luzhkov did in a private interview later that day bounine found kurbsky in a corner booth in the officers bar and joined him a bottle of vodka was on the table and several glasses in crushed ice he helped himself luzhkov has filled me in so what do you think kurbsky asked who am i to argue with the prime minister of the russian federation you know everything about my sister bounine nodded may i say one thing on putins behalf he wasnt responsible for what happened to your sister it was before his time he sees an advantage in it thats all a point of view and vronsky a pig id cut his throat myself if i had the chance and you look like such a kind man i am a kind man so tell me yuri hows your wife ah bounine hesitated she died alex leukemia im so sorry to hear that she was a good woman yes she was but its been a while now alex and my sister has produced two lovely girlsso im an uncle excellent lets drink to them and to new york they clinked glasses and to the black tigers may they rest in peace kurbsky said were probably the only two left new york came and new york went the death of igor vronsky received prominent notice in the new york times and other papers but in spite of his books and his vigorous antikremlin stance there was no suspicion that this was a dissidents death it seemed the normal kind of mugging a knife to the chest the body stripped of everything worth having on the day following his death monica starling and george dunkley flew back to heathrow where dunkley had a limousine waiting to take them back to cambridge she hadnt breathed a word about what had happened between her and kurbsky but dunkley hadnt stopped talking about him during the flight it had obviously affected him deeply she kissed him on the cheek off you go george try and make it for high table theyll all be full of envy when they hear of your exploits there was no sign of her brothers official limousine from the cabinet office or of dillon she wasnt pleased and then billy salters scarlet alfa romeo swerved to the curb and he slid from behind the wheel and dillon got out of the passenger seat he came around and embraced her kissing her lightly on the mouth my goodness girl theres a sparkle to you youve obviously had a good time billy was putting her bags in the trunk a hell of a time from what i heard you know she said to dillon about my conversation with kurbsky what roper knows we all end up knowing he ushered her into the backseat of the alfa and followed her dover street billy it was the family house in mayfair where her brother lived is harry okay she asked as they drove away nothing to worry about but hes been overdoing it so the doctor has given him his marching orders hes gone down to the country to stokely hall to stay with aunt mary for a while anyway this kurbsky business has got ferguson all fired up hed like to hear it all from your own fair lips so were going to take you home wait for you to freshen up then join ferguson for dinner at the reform club seventhirty but if were late were late so go on tell us all about it billy said over his shoulder alexander kurbsky was one of the most fascinating men ive ever met she said end of story youll have to wait get out of it youre just trying to make dillon jealous just carry on driver and watch the road she pulled dillons right arm around her and eased into him smiling it was a quiet evening at the reform club the restaurant only half full ferguson had secured a corner table next to a window with no one close which gave them privacy ferguson wore the usual guards tie and pinstriped suit his age still a closely kept secret his hair white face still handsome the surprise was roper in his wheelchair wearing a black velvet jacket and a white shirt with a knotted paisley scarf at the neck well this is nice i must say she kissed roper on the forehead and rumpled his tousled hair are you well all the better for seeing you she wore the valentino suit from new york and ferguson obviously approved my word you must have gone down well at the pierre he kissed her extravagantly on both cheeks youre a charmer charles a trifle glib on occasion but i like it and youll like the champagne its dom p√©rignondillon can argue about his krug another time the wine waiter poured remembering from previous experiences to supply billy with ginger ale laced with lime ferguson raised his glass and toasted her to you my dear and to what seems to have been a job well done he emptied his glass and motioned the wine waiter to refill it now for gods sake tell us what happened when monica was finished there were a few moments of silence and it was billy who spoke first whats he want and i mean really want this guys got everything id have thought fame money genuine respect but is that enough dillon said from what monica says hes lacking genuine freedom so the systems different from the cold war days but is it really i liked his description of himself to you monica about being like a bear on a chain in russia hes trapped by his fame by who he is in the cage if you like the ministry of arts controls his every move because they themselves are controlled right up to the top from a political point of view hes a national symbol ferguson said obviously ive read his work and im familiar with his exploits it all adds up to a human being who hasnt the slightest interest in being a symbol to anyone he just wants to be free monica agreed at present every move he makes is dictated by others hes flown privately when visiting abroad hes carefully watched by gru minders his every move is monitored so let him claim asylum here billy said would he be denied of course not ferguson said but hes got to get here first this paris affair the legion of honor presentation presents an interesting possibility theyd be watching him like a hawk dillon said and theres another problem you know what the french are like very fussy about foreigners causing a problem on their patch and that applies bigtime to brit intelligence still it looks to me like a straightforward kidnap job with a willing victim billy said its once hes here that hed need looking after theyd do something even if they couldnt get him back how many russian dissidents have come to a bad end in london litvinenko poisoned and two cases of guys falling from the terraces of apartment blocks and that was in the same year roper beckoned the wine waiter a very large singlemalt i leave the choice to your own good judgment he smiled at the others sorry but the joys of champagne soon pall for me feel free major ferguson said i notice that you havent made a contribution in this matter concerning kurbsky roper held out his hand and accepted the waiters gift of the singlemalt he savored it for a moment then swallowed it down excellent ill have another dont you have any comment monica asked oh i do id like to meet his aunt this svetlana kelly yes thats what id like to do chamber court a latevictorian house on belsize park i looked it up any particular reason ferguson said to find out what hes like dont you mean was like monica asked as i understand it she last saw him in when you think of what hes gone through since then id suppose him to be completely different on the contrary ive always been of the opinion that people dont really change not in any fundamental way anyway ill go to see her tomorrow if you approve general whatever you say monica jumped in would it be all right if i came with you i dont need to be back in cambridge till friday no thats fine i dont think we should overwhelm her dillon said old victorian houses arent particularly wheelchair friendly ill phone in advance if theres a problem perhaps we can meet somewhere else fine ill leave it in your hands ferguson said now i dont know about you lot but im starving so lets get down to the eating part of the business later they went their separate ways sergeant doyle had waited for roper in the van that held the rear lift for the wheelchair ferguson had his driver and billy gave dillon and monica a lift to dover street in the alfa very useful monica told him as they moved through mayfair you being a nondrinker i get stopped now and then billy said young guy in a flash motor like this ive been breathalyzed plenty its great to see the look on their faces when they check the reading he pulled in outside the dover street house here we are folks youre staying right he asked dillon what do you think youre staying when billy was gone they paused at the top of the steps for monica to find her key and went in she didnt put the light on simply waited for him to lock the door then put her arms around his neck and kissed him quite hard oh my goodness ive missed you youve only been away four days dont you dare she said ten minutes and if you take more therell be trouble and she turned and ran up the stairs he changed in one of the spare bedrooms put on a terrycloth robe and joined her in her suite hed found a tenderness with her that hed never known he hadhed surprised himself as their relationship blossomedand they made slow careful love together afterward she drifted into sleep and he lay there a chink of light coming through the curtains from a lamp in the street on impulse he slipped out of the bed put on the robe padded downstairs to the drawing room took a cigarette from a box on the table lit it then sat by the bow window looking out and thinking about kurbsky after a while monica slipped in wearing a robe so there you are give me one youre supposed to have stopped he said but gave her one anyway what are you thinking of she said kurbsky thats right i thought you might he reminded me of you you liked him i think an easy man to like just as you are an easy man to love sean but like you theres the feeling of the other self always there like a crouching tiger just waiting to spring thanks very much what were you thinking what on earth we are going to do with him if we get him he stubbed his cigarette out and got up come on back to bed with you he put a hand around her waist and they went out it was tenthirty when roper found himself in his chair back in the computer room at holland park sergeant doyle said youve everything you need to hand major so i think ill have a liedown in the duty room you should be entitled to a night off tony what about sergeant henderson hes on ten days leave and the royal military police cant find a replacement but we wouldnt want that would we sir a stranger in the system ill get a bit of shuteye if you need me give me a bell roper lit a cigarette and set his main screen alive bringing up svetlana kelly in her early years shed been a member of the chekhov theatre in moscow which meant she was well grounded in classical theater she hadnt been much of a beauty even when young but he saw handsomeness and strength there there was a selection of photos from the early years and then london in a month in the country at the theatre royal haymarket fiftyfive and never married and then shed met patrick kelly the irish widower and professor of literature at london university roper looked at kellys photoshe was strong too undoubtedly and yet there was a touch of humor about his mouth whatever the attraction it was strong enough for them to marry at westminster registry office within a month of meeting and for svetlana to cut herself free of the soviet union she would be seventyone now it was eleven oclock and yet on sheer impulse roper phoned her he stayed on speakerphone he always did and there was an instant answer who is this it was a whisper in a way and yet clear enough the russian accent undeniable mrs kelly my name is giles ropermajor giles roper he spoke fair russian product of an army totalimmersion course just after sandhurst and hed kept it up since forgive the intrusion at such a time of night you dont know me she cut in but i do i attended a charity dinner for the great ormond street childrens hospital last year you spoke from your wheelchair you are the bombdisposal expert arent you the queen herself pinned the george cross to your lapel youre a hero it was amazing the effect of that voice so soft like a breeze whispering through the leaves on an autumn evening ropers throat turned dry incredibly touched it was like being a child again he said in english youre too kind what can i do for you may i come to see you tomorrow morning for what reason id like to discuss a matter affecting your nephew id have a woman with me a cambridge don who has just met alexander in new york major roper be honest with me what is your interest in my nephew you must know i havent seen him in nearly two decades to this woman one could only tell the truth roper knew that nothing else would do im with the british security services there was a faint chuckle ah what they call a spook these days only on television you intrigue me tell me of your companion roper did she said the lady sounds quite interesting if youre a spook you know where i live chamber court belsize park quite right my husband died ten years ago and left me well provided for here i live in victorian splendor supported by my dear friend and fellow russian katya zorin who takes care of the house and me and manages to find time to teach painting at the slade as well ill see you at tenthirty your chair will not prove a problem the garden is walled but the entrance in the side mews has a path that will give you access to french windows leading into a conservatory ill be waiting thank you very much mrs kelly i must say you seem to be taking me totally on trust you fascinated me at that luncheon your speech was excellent but modest and so afterward i looked you up on the internet it was all there belfast in the portland hotel the huge bomb in the foyer it took you nine hours to render it harmless nine hours on your own how can i not take such a man on trust ill see you in the morning it was quiet sitting there staring up at his screens and he put on some background music just like comfort food only this was cole porter playing softly just as it had been all those years ago in the belfast safe house not far from the royal victoria hospital it was a long time ago a hell of a long time ago and he lit a cigarette and poured a bushmills irish whiskey for a change and remembered roper belfast roper remembered that year well and not just because of his nine hours dismantling the portland hotel bomb there had also been the mortar attack on number downing street the gulf war had been at its height and the target had been the war cabinet meeting at ten am on february an audacious attack and the missiles had landed in the garden just narrowly missing the house it bore all the hallmarks of a classic ira operation although nobody ever claimed responsibility for the attack in belfast meanwhile the war of the bomb continued remorselessly and in spite of all the politicians could do sectarian violence plowed on people butchering each other in the name of religion the british army inured by twentytwo years to the irish troubles as a way of life for giles roper scientific interest in the field of weaponry and explosives had drawn him in even during his training days as an officer cadet at sandhurst and on graduation it had led to an immediate posting to the ordnance corps in ninetyone he was entering his third year as a disposal officer a captain in rank and several hundred explosive devices of one kind or another behind him most people didnt realize that he was married a summer affair with his second cousin a schoolteacher named elizabeth howard during his first year out of sandhurst had turned into a total disaster it was a prime example of going to bed on your wedding night with someone you thought you knew and waking up with a stranger a catholic she didnt believe in divorce and indeed visited his mother on a regular basis he hadnt seen her in years the everpresent risk of death and the casualty rate among his fellows in the bombdisposal business precluded any kind of relationship elsewhere he smoked heavily like most of his kind and drank heavily at the appropriate time like most of his kind it was a strange bizarre existence that produced obsessive patterns of behavior on many occasions hed found himself dealing with a bomb and indulging in conversation obviously onesided demanding answers that werent there it was an extreme example of talking to yourself a bomb after all couldnt talk back except when it exploded and that would probably be the last thing you heard however he still talked to them there seemed some sort of comfort in that his father had died when he was sixteen it was his uncle who had arranged for his schooling and sandhurst and maintained his mother at the extended family home in shropshire she was basically there as unpaid help as far as roper could see but on army pay there wasnt much he could do about it until the unexpected happened his mothers brother uncle arthur a homosexual by nature and a broker in the city with a fortune to prove it had died of aids and lacking any faith in his sisters ability to handle money left a considerable fortune to roper he could have left the army but found that he didnt want to and when he tried to get his mother her own place it turned out she was perfectly happy where she was it had also become apparent that the perils of bomb disposal were beyond her understanding so he settled a hundred thousand pounds on her and the same on his wife and left them to the joys of the countryside before the portland hotel he had been decorated with the military cross for gallantry although the events surrounding it had only a tenuous link with his ordinary duties on standby he had been based in a small market town in county down where there had been a spate of bomb alerts mostly false though one in four was the real thing the unit had five jeeps a driver and guard and a disposal expert on that particular day a call came in over the radio and the jeeps disappeared leaving only roper and his driver the unit being a man short the first call was false also the second there was another this time for roper by name there was something about itthe speaker had a cockney accent that sounded wrong terry his driver started up and roper said no just hang on im not happy something smells he had a browning hipower pistol stuffed in his camouflage shirt he was also wearing courtesy of his newfound wealth a nylonandtitanium vest capable of stopping a magnum at pointblank range terry eased up an uzi machine pistol on his knees there was a nurses hostel to the side of the old folks home across the street and as the voice sounded over the radio again still calling for roper a milk wagon came around the corner it braked to a halt outside the hostel two men were in the cab in dairy company uniform the one on the passenger side dropped out turning suddenly as roper started forward pulled out a pistol and fired he was good the bullet striking roper in the chest and knocking him back against the jeep the man fired again catching terry in the shoulder as he scrambled out with the uzi then fired again at roper as he tried to get up catching him in the left arm before turning and starting to run roper shot him twice in the back shattering his spine the vest had performed perfectly he picked up the uzi terry had dropped got to his feet and walked toward the milk truck the driver had slipped from behind the wheel and was firing through the cab where the passenger door was partially open a bullet plucked ropers shoulder he dropped down on his face and could see directly under the truck where the drivers legs were exposed from the knees down he held the uzi out in front of him and fired two sustained bursts the man screaming in agony and going back against the hotel wall roper found him there sobbing he tapped the muzzle of the uzi against the face where is it in the cab yes the man groaned what kind pencil timer detonators or what go fuck yourself have it your own way well go to hell together he grimaced at the pain of his wounded arm but managed to pull the man up and push him half into the cab there was a large crawfords biscuit can you could get a christmas cake in there or a hell of a lot of semtex anyway lets try again pencil timer detonator he turned the mans face and pushed the muzzle of the uzi between his lips the man wriggled and jerked away pencils lets hope youre right for both our sakes he pulled off the lid and exposed the contents three pencilsthe extras just to make sure oh dear he said fifteen minutes id better move sharpish he pulled them out and tossed them away and eased the man down as he fainted people were emerging from the houses and the local bar now a couple of dogs barked and then there was a sudden roaring of engines as two of the jeeps appeared moving fast here we go the bloody cavalry arriving late as usual he slid down on the pavement his back to the hostel wall scrambled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket fumbled to get one out and failed it didnt make him notable in any way beyond military circles the national newspapers didnt make a fuss simply because death and destruction were so much a part of everyday life in northern ireland that as the old army saying went it was old news before it was news but the portland hotel a year later the lone man facetoface with a terrible death for nine hours really was news although the decision to reward him with the george cross had still not been taken he continued to meet the daily demands of his calling working out of an old state school in byron street that the army had taken over on the safe house principle fortifying it against any kind of attack the many rooms providing accommodation for officers and men with a bar and catering facilities there were places like it all over belfast safe but bleak local women fought for the privilege of working there in the canteen the laundry or as cleaners that many would be republican sympathizers was clear and a rough and ready way of sorting the problem was to try to employ only protestant women on the other hand it was obviously a temptation for catholics who needed work to pretend to be other than they were such women lived locally and came and went through the heavily fortified gates with identity cards often so false they could be bought for a couple of pounds in any local bar roper had been posted to byron street for nine months and in that time had caused something of a stir with his military cross and good looks but his gentlemanly behavior toward the younger women which was conspicuously absent in his fellows had provoked a suggestion that as the local girls put it there had to be something wrong with him on the other hand his incredible bravery was a fact and another was that in those nine months some of his comrades had paid the final price and others had been terribly injured the portland hotel caused many people to look at him differently as if there was something otherworldly about him and there were those who felt uncomfortable in his presence hurrying past him one who did not was a new young cleaner who replaced an older woman whod moved away the girls name was jean murray and she was from a protestant orange background ropers room was on the list and she was resolutely cheerful from the moment she started and knew all his business within two days her mother had been killed in a bombing four years earlier for which she blamed the fugging fenians as she called them her father was a member of the local orange lodge and had a plum job at the port authority there was also a brother of twentyone named kenny in his final year at queens university she extracted as much personal information from roper as she could as long as it wasnt military he didnt mind the truth was that to a certain extent he rather fancied her which gave him pause for thought because it meant the defensive wall hed built around himself was weakening whats it get yer captain the hero bit youre a lonely man thats the truth of it and youve stared death in the face for so long its dried up any juice thats in you well thank you dr freud he said i mean you would know why do you do it its a known fact in this dump that youre well fixed financially okay look at it this way when the troubles started in sixtynine the bomb thing was in its infancy very crude no big deal over the years as the provisional ira has grown in power bombs have become very sophisticated indeed the public image of the ira as a bunch of shavenheaded yobs off a building site is well off the mark plenty of solid middleclass professionals are in the movement schoolteachers lawyers accountants a whole range of ordinary people so what are you saying that the bomb makers these days have got university degrees and theyre very clever and sophisticated consider the portland bomb im an expert and ive dealt with hundreds of bombs over the years but that one took me nine hours and shall i tell you something hell be back that bomb maker hell come with something just a little bit different just for me he cant afford to have me beat him its as simple as that she stared at him pretty and rumpled in her blue uniform dress leaning on her broom no makeup on at all and there was something in her eyes that could have been pity thats terrible what you say still it cant go onthings change what do you mean things change the whole system my kenny says the bombs wont need people like you soon hes read about you in the papers he knows i work for you what does he mean things change hes taking his finals in his degree soon electronics he makes gadgets these days you have a hand control to work your television open your garage doors unlock your car switch on security systems in your house weve only got an ordinary terrace but the gadgets hes created in it are brilliant very interesting but whats this got to do with bombs well its too technical for me but hes been working on a thing he calls a howler it looks like a standard television control but its really different he can turn off security systems and i mean really important ones he demonstrated on our local bank he kept locking the doors as we walked past they didnt know whether they were coming or going does it to peoples cars as we go by turns on store alarms even big shops in town very interesting roper said fascinating but i still dont see the relevance to bombs well thats what hes really been working on he said he can maybe adapt the howler so that even a big sophisticated bomb like your portland hotel job could simply be switched off thats the only way i can describe it she smiled anyway i cant stand around here chattering ive got five other rooms to do no just a minute roper said let me get this straight has kenny really gotten anywhere with his invention hes working at it all the time at the moment he was talking about bombs at the time because of that paradise street bomb the day before yesterday the one in the car that killed the sergeant he said the howler could switch it off at the touch of a button that was what he was working towards roper was cold with excitement he said that did he she laughed i said could it work the other way could what was switched off be switched on he said a howler has two faces what could be switched off could be switched on again she picked up her bucket anyway ill be away now work to do just one more thing could i meet kenny she had moved to the door and turned i dont know about that i mean soldiers are targets at the best of times and you never know whos who these days fenians everywhere i wouldnt be in uniform jean id just like to meet him and discuss his work if hed let me it sounds very interesting and he might find it rewarding to discuss his ideas with someone like me who has spent so much time at the coalface so to speak she looked serious youve got a point i cant speak for him but ill give him a phone call see what he has to say ive got to get moving ill let you know then she was gone and roper sat on the bed and thought about it it wasnt as crazy as it sounded most really sophisticated bombs had multiple electrical circuits of one kind or another intertwining in complicated puzzles feeding into one another often in the most bizarre way the theory behind this howler device of kennys was a kind of holy grail after all if the most complicated of security systems could be neutered at the touch of a button it seemed logical that the right touch of genius could do the same thing to bomb circuits it was a thought that wouldnt go away and he went down to the bar and ordered a large whiskey since he was off duty took a newspaper to a corner table and sat there pretending to read it but thinking major sanderson the commanding officer glanced in i see youve got a night off giles lucky you ive got a general staff meeting at the grand hotel your furloughs been approved by the way starts sunday two weeks so make the most of it he went and for a moment there was no one else in the bar except the corporal behind the counter busying himself cleaning glasses jean murray peered in at the door the corporal said you cant come in here you know that its all right roper told him she wants me he swallowed his whiskey got up and joined her in the corridor what have you got for me ive spoken to kenny and he says hell see you but its got to be tonight because hes starting the practical side of his finals for his degree at queens university tomorrow thats fine by me im finished in an hour ill meet you on the corner by cohans bar and no uniform like i said no problem where are we going not far half a mile maybe you know where the union canal is he has a room he uses for his work in what used to be a flour mill youll need a raincoat its pouring out there sounds good to me roper told her he returned to the bar ordered another whiskey and sat in the corner thinking about it his boss was out of the way at his staff meeting there was no point in discussing his intended adventure on the streets of belfast after dark with anyone else there were risks but risk of any kind had been so much a part of his life for years now that it was second nature he would go armed of course his usual browning hipower but a backup would be a sensible precaution and he drank his whiskey and went along to the weapons store where he found a sergeant clark on duty im going on the town tonight out of uniform special op ill have the hipower but is there anything else you could suggest clark who regarded roper as a true hero was happy to oblige colt captain with hollowpoint cartridges its hard to beat there you go he placed one on the counter and a box of ten cartridges so that will do it roper inquired with this clark produced an ankle holder in soft leather nothings perfect but in a body search when somebody finds an item like a browning they tend to assume thats it he smiled cheerfully you just have to live in hopes sign here sir he pushed a ledger across and offered a pen roper said i knew i could rely on you sergeant take care sir in his room roper changed into a pair of old comfortable trousers not jeans because it made the ankle holder more accessible he carefully loaded the colt with six of the hollowpoints and checked that he could reach it easily he wore the bulletproof vest a dark poloneck sweater and a navy blue slipon raincoat hed had for years he didnt wear a shoulder holster and simply put the browning in his righthand pocket he peered out of the windows oldfashioned streetlights aglow now in the earlyevening darkness rain hammering down although when didnt it in belfast he went through his narrow wardrobe found an old tweed cap pulled it on and went downstairs the guards on either side of the gate stayed in their sentry boxes they knew him well after all everyone did a hell of a night for it sir one of them called cheerfully as he raised the bar whatever it is roper smiled back just as cheerfully pausing for a moment looking out into that belfast street that as far as he was concerned was like no other street in any city in the world all right he murmured to himself lets get moving he slipped out and turned toward cohans jean murray stood in the entrance of the bar sheltering from the rain she had a large oldfashioned umbrella ready and seemed impatient so there you are i was beginning to think you werent coming will i do roper asked she looked him over i suppose so but keep that gob of yours shut you sound as if youve been to eton or somewhere like that she opened the umbrella lets get moving he fell into step beside her as she walked rapidly a rotten night for it dont rub it in ive only had a sandwich all day and im starving he kept up with her obediently passing through one mean street after another the river not far away a hard life living in a place like this well the british government in london never gave a damn about belfast thats for sure the forgotten city did you know the luftwaffe blitzed it worse than liverpool during the war i suppose they were after harland and wolff and the shipyards they built the titanic here didnt they jesus and mary thats history mister she said its what happens now thats real and the future of this country jesus and mary strange on the lips of a young protestant girl and he slipped a hand in his pocket and found the butt of the browning and then she laughed harshly what in the hell is getting into me talking like a fugging fenian it must be the weather they had moved into an area of decaying warehouses and a place where the union canal emptied into the river there were narrow decaying victorian buildings like something out of dickens an old iron footbridge and a sign saying conroys flour mill an oldfashioned lamp was bracketed above the door illuminating the area and there was a light at the window above it here we are she said and led the way up a narrow wooden stairway the door at the top stood open light shining down kenny were here she called paused for a moment so that roper could see the table in the center of a sizable room littered with a variety of technical equipment tools and vises she stepped forward roper following his hand in his pocket on the butt of the browning the door slammed behind him the muzzle of a pistol was rammed against the side of ropers skull and a hard ulster voice said easy now or ill blow your brains out hands high roper did exactly as he was told he was patted the browning soon found a hipower youve got taste he was pushed toward the table over there and turn roper did and found himself facing a small wiry young man hair almost shoulder length a beretta automatic in his left hand he dropped the browning into the right pocket of the old reefer jacket he wore and grinned making him look quite amicable the great man himself and youll be kenny murray as ever was and theres no howler murray laughed not here bomb man not here it exists though im working to perfect it all the time im impressed youd bother roper said after all your purpose is to make bombs explode it is indeed but the scientist in me cant resist a challenge roper turned to jean who had taken a pack of cigarettes out of her pocket and was lighting one oh jean you disappoint me turning out to be a decent catholic girl after all and you thinking i was some prod bitch all the worse for you there was anger there but perhaps at herself so whats the reason for all this if youd wanted to shoot me you would have he said to kenny youre absolutely right id love to have taken care of that but im under orders there are those who would like to have words with you informations the name of the game our bomb makers would appreciate the chance to squeeze you dry so lets get going you first if you say so roper opened the door and stood for a moment at the top of those dark stairs he found the rail with his left hand and started down there was only one thing to do and hed only get one chance so halfway down he slipped deliberately in the shadows cursing and gripping the rail reaching for the colt in the ankle holder in the ensuing scramble he dropped it in his raincoat pocket watch it for christs sake kenny ordered its not my fault the place is a death trap roper hauled himself up and continued kenny laughed did you hear that jean he said to his sister behind him the mans a bloody comic roper went out his right hand in his pocket and started over the bridge halfway across he paused and turned theres just one thing you should know you fenian bastard kenny stood facing him holding the beretta against his right thigh and what would that be bomb man he asked amicably you made a mistake you should have killed me when you had the chance his hand swung up and he shot kenny between the eyes twice the hollowpoint cartridges fragmenting the back of his skull kenny spun around and half fell across the iron rail of the bridge jean screamed roper leaned down caught the body by one ankle and heaved it over into the fastmoving canal there you go roper said are you satisfied now jean she started to back away ah sweet jesus and mother mary what have i done youll be asking yourself that till your dying day roper told her she seemed to suddenly pull herself together youre not going to kill me she whispered he didnt say a word turned and walked away across the bridge and behind him she started to sob bitterly the sound echoing across the waters of the canal that had swept her brother into the river lagan and out to sea he walked all the way back through mean rainwashed streets the sound of shooting in the distance walking carefully on sidewalks scattered with broken glass passing bombedout buildings boarded up all of a sudden it had all caught up with him too many long and weary years too much killing too much death he made it to byron street without getting stopped once which was something of a surprise and ended up back in the bar it was empty the corporal behind the counter fussing around stacking bottles just in time sir im closing in fifteen minutes what can i get you a large scotch thatll do it he sat in the corner his raincoat open thinking of the nice girl whod sold him out and the man hed killed and it didnt worry him as it should have the corporal had the radio on some latenight show and someone was singing a cole porter number they cant take that away from me filled with heartbreaking and melancholic nostalgia and giles roper knew that whatever happened he was through with belfast beyond any argument for the moment he had to return the colt to sergeant clark and report the loss of a browning hipower but not now not tonight he needed sleep he needed peace and he said good night to the corporal and went to bed he took a pill from his emergency kit which knocked him out he slept deeply and came to life again at seven he lay there for a while thinking about things and went and had a hot shower he had a tea maker in his room and he made a cup and stood in his robe thinking of the events of the previous night moving to the window and looking out the rain was worse than ever absolutely pouring and the women coming in for the day shift down below crowded through the entrance many of them with umbrellas he started to turn away and paused to look down there again for a brief moment convinced that hed seen jean murray but he was mistaken had to be the last place shed show her face was byron street on the other hand it would be a long time before he forgot the sight of her standing under the lamp after hed killed her brother he had the day shift starting at nine and he was just about to get dressed in camouflaged overalls when he had a phone call from the orderly room message from major sanderson sir he wants you to join him as soon as possible at the grand hotel general marple flew in from london last night special waysandmeans conference ill see to it he groaned marple from london which meant full uniform he dressed quickly taking it from the drycleaning bag grateful it hadnt been worn it looked rather good when he checked himself in the mirror and the ribbons for ireland and the military cross set things off nicely he adjusted his cap nodded to himself took a military trench coat from the wardrobe and went out he had his own vehicle on allocation a ford pickup painted khaki green it was parked in the officers sector in the corner of the old schoolyard vehicles there were never locked in case of emergencies and the gate sentries were deemed security enough he opened the drivers seat tossed his trench coat into the rear and got behind the wheel he reached the gate and slowed as the sentry stepped out raising the bar you know jean murray dont you fletcher i thought i saw her earlier you did captain but she wasnt around for long and left again in fact i think thats her over there in the church doorway roper was aware of a sudden chill drove out slowly toward the other side of the road and saw her standing there soaked to the skin hair plastered to her skull she was like a corpse walking the moment she saw him she started down the steps he pulled up at the curb and lowered his window what are you doing here jean i wanted to give you a present she produced a black plastic control unit about nine inches long the howler captain kenny did finish it but this isnt your present thats under the passenger seat and remember the howler has two faces it can switch on as well as switch off she laughed and it was like no laugh giles roper had ever heard in his life and as he scrabbled under the seat pulling out the white plastic shopping bag he found there the world became an infinity of white blinding light no pain not at that moment simply enormous energy as the explosion took him into the eye of the storm so jean murray died killed instantly just another bomber a statistic of those terrible years and the howler the holy grail the ultimate answer to the bomb died with her her final act of mad revenge started giles roper on a road that encompassed dozens of operations a time of incredible pain and suffering and yet it was also a journey of selfdiscovery and real achievement as he became one of the most significant figures in the world of cyberspace he never disclosed what took place on that last night in belfast to the authorities jean murray had just been another bomber and over the years roper had come to terms with her and was no longer disturbed by the memory after all what she and her brother had intended for him was kidnap torture and murder what they had given him unintentionally was the wheelchair and the new life that had brought him the george cross had come afterward although it was a year and a half before he could face the queen for her to pin it on by then his mother had died and his wife totally unable to cope had moved on pleaded for a quiet divorce even with all her catholic conviction and finally married a much older man roper was now an indispensable part of fergusons security group spending most of his time at the holland park safe house in front of his computer screens frequently racked with pain that responded only to whiskey and cigarettes his comfort food sleeping only in fits and starts and mainly in his wheelchair indomitable as dillon once said himself alone a force of nature london at tenthirty on the morning following his latenight conversation with svetlana kelly roper accompanied by monica was delivered to the side entrance in the mews beside chamber court off belsize avenue roper was offloaded and a cctv camera beside an ironbound gate in the high wall scanned them a voice not svetlanas said through the speaker would that be major roper and lady starling yes maam doyle told her im katya zorin svetlanas companion the gate will open now tell them to follow the path inside and it will bring them round to the conservatory thank you maam the gate buzzed and opened doyle said ill wait ive got a couple of newspapers roper went through into a quiet ordered world of rhododendron bushes poplars and cypress trees a weeping willow not much color around but it was after all february the path was york stone but expertly laid so that the going was smooth they approached a fountain in granite stone moved on to the large victorian house and there was the terrace of the conservatory a glass door stood open and katya zorin waited roper had looked her up she was forty and unmarried born in brighton to a russian immigrant who had married an english woman a senior lecturer at the slade where she taught painting she was a successful portrait painter and had even had the queen mother sit for her she also had a considerable reputation in the theater as a set designer she had cropped hair a kind of ingrid bergman look and wore khaki overalls its lovely to meet you her handshake was firm just follow me she led the way into a delightful conservatory that was a sort of miniature kew crammed with plants of every description internal folding doors were open disclosing a large drawing room fashioned in period victorian splendor but svetlana kelly sat in the center of the conservatory in a high wicker chair a curved wicker table before her two wicker chairs on the other side of it obviously waiting for them monica had been well prepared by roper in a way she felt she knew them already my dear lady starling how nice to meet you katya and i looked you up on the internet brains and beauty such a wonderful combination and such good bone structure katya actually put a hand under monicas chin i must do a drawing at least svetlana said and major roper a true hero a noble man yes said katya now please let me apologize i must run off to the slade for a seminar so if you would accompany me lady starling i will show you the kitchen and if theres anything youd likecoffee tea something strongerim sure you wont be shy about helping yourselves we dont keep a maid of course monica wasnt in the least put out anything i can do katya kissed svetlana on the forehead later you may tell me all about whatever it is now i must go she and monica went out there was a sideboard loaded with drinks and glasses have a drink my dear what is your pleasure asked svetlana scotch whiskey in large quantities im afraid which helps with the pain you have had so many years of it that many drugs have lost their ability to cope i imagine how on earth do you know that im a sensitive my dear i know the most intimate things about people god blessed me as a child two gifts to actmy abiding joy my passionand to heal come close he eased the chair around and she took his face in her hands you have the pain in your head am i right always my hands are cool very now my fingers on each side of your temples the surge of heat was profound enough to shock him and the usual tension subsided see i told you so now go and get your whiskey and a vodka for me he went to the sideboard poured the drinks and brought them back she raised her glass to life my dear they tossed it down and monica returned katyas coming back we got as far as her mini cooper and her mobile rang it was the slade canceling her seminar a water pipe had burst or something anyway im glad i must say i like her enormously and i like you my dear you are happy at the momentyou are in love i think well it certainly isnt with me roper told her she will tell me in her own time for we shall be good friends back to business and my nephew i know his story you know it so does the whole world so let us start with you my dear having only just seen him as i understand at the gala cultural affair in new york for the united nations katya entering at that moment heard her and monica hesitated glancing at roper look do i tell her where all this is leading i mean the most important thing hes looking for if everything works out is total secrecy svetlana said if you hesitate over katya theres no need she is my most faithful friend and i trust her with my life excellent i hope we havent offended you katya of course not please continue she went to an easel by a window removed a cloth revealing a painting she was obviously working on picked up a palette and brush and started to work roper leaned over and took svetlanas hand when kurbsky was seventeen you came to london to do some chekhov met patrick kelly and decided to defect which was a hell of a decision in communist days did you ever regret it never i fell in love with a good man i fell in love with london life blossomed incredibly but i see the direction youre taking here alexander wishes to leap over the wall too monica said they control his every move he told me he feels like a bear on a chain i see svetlana said calmly then i suggest you tell me everything my dear exactly what he said and what happened when she was finished svetlana smiled you perform well my dear but then you are an academic an actor in a way i feel i know all the people you have mentioned this general ferguson and his people you and your brother the member of parliament such a tragic figure and my nephewhow he feels what he wants its been almost twenty years since he last sat with me here where you are sitting now for years nothing and then later on the books a photo on a cover appearances on television the falsity of the internet to watch him was like watching someone playing him in a movie in fact thats what he looked like to me with that absurdly long hair and that tangled beard tell me about him please you raised him after all my brother was kgb all his life so for his family things were okay in the soviet union his wife was not a healthy woman i came to moscow hoping to act but he agreed to let me come only if i lived with them and supported her she shouldnt have had another child after alexander but my brother insisted two years later tania was born and her mother died we were all trapped i was allowed to act with moscow companies he used his influence but always i had to be a mother to the children not that i objected i loved alex dearly monica said and tania never cared for me but she could do no wrong in her fathers eyes the years passed and he became a colonel in the kgb very important we had a couple living in at the house so i had more freedom when the chekhov theater was invited to london to perform i was one of their lead players so he agreed i could go it was a prestige thing the rest is history i married kelly and refused to return and the children tania wasnt bothered she was fifteen a wild child and as always he doted on her alexander was a brilliant student already at moscow university at seventeen i took a chance and wrote asking that he be permitted to visit his father knowing how close i was to alexander allowed him to come on holiday but ordered him to persuade me to return are you certain of that roper asked yes alexander told me and kelly he liked kelly they practiced judo together kelly was a black belt all this fits not only with what ive found but with what he told monica roper said about being so happy here with you and kelly but then came the serious unrest the battles with the police and student groups over afghanistan hundreds dead in street fighting in moscow and amongst them tania monica said her father contacted us saying she was wounded thats what made alexander return instantly monica said he told me that he arrived too late for the farewell he said she had a headstone at minsky park military cemetery because his father used his influence to somehow make her death respectable that sounds like my brother he lied about her only being wounded just to draw alexander back and when he joined the paratroopers what did you think of that i was horrified but by then wed lost touch all mail was censored so i didnt know about it for a long time he told me he thought hed done it to punish his father who couldnt do anything about it because it would have made him look bad a man of his standing i can believe that but i dont really know everything after that all his army time afghanistan and chechnya i know only from his books i had no contact during all those years and the years after that he covers in moscow nights the years of his antiestablishment activities i envy you for having been in his company and im grateful for what you have told me roper said what do you think about his insistence on total secrecy that it might present difficulties for him but that is a bridge to be crossed at a later date she smiled and said to katya who had been working away quietly have you anything to say katya put down her painting things and wiped her hands let me just mention this svetlana and i first became friends when i was thirtyive never met alex but im a play designer a totalconcept specialist not just sets but people clothes appearance and one thing i can tell you any problem however difficult has a solution as shes proved at the national theatre on many occasions svetlana put in katya found a pack of cigarettes in her smock and lit one think of this whole affair as a theatrical performance alex flies from paris you and your people get him to england in one piece major and then what do you do with him help him vanish roper said thats what he wants and what would you do with someone you really needed to keep safe we have safe houses for situations like that but for kurbsky it would just be a temporary solution here would be an impossibility svetlana said im sure theyd look for him here he couldnt possibly show his face katya went to the sideboard poured a vodka and passed it to svetlana trueif it was his face svetlana looked at her thank you my dear i presume you mean plastic surgery not as such although its a longterm possibility making him a new person totally different in every way thats how i would approach it what is a postman or a policeman a uniform is what we see and accept not so much as the individual take alex his persona is like a hollywood costume actorsthe hair the beard so extravagant svetlana has told me of his love for the three musketeers and captain blood as a boy the swagger the boldness inherent in such costume dramas that is what he projects and what people see in him so how would you change him by cutting his hair monica said if you did that and removed the beard i think you would be amazed they all thought about it and svetlana said he couldnt live in the house of course but kelly used to use the apartment over the garage as a study they practiced judo up there do you still use it roper asked it was katya who answered until three months ago we had a young pole named marek living there taking care of the garden he had a sociology degree but in warsaw that only brought him two pounds an hour as a teacher we let him live in the apartment and as long as he saw to the garden we never queried what else he did he was with us for almost a year before he decided to go home again theres another possibility too svetlana said i have a cottage way down by the thames estuary beyond dartford looking out towards sheerness and the isle of sheppey holly end the place is called marshland wildfowl birds shingle beaches you can breathe there it sounds nice could alex hide himself there monica asked katya its lonely and desolate enough the problem is if its too lonely well take a look at it too monica said we wouldnt want alex going stircrazy though theres an old russian saying katya put in if you want to hide a pine tree put it in a forest of pines whats your point roper asked i may be wrong but i recall a story about an important letter that was the object of a heated search i think i know the one you mean the letter was in plain view all along just another letter roper said and you think that might work for kurbsky yes katya told him let me give it some thought but now its time for lunch she smiled at monica if youd mind helping me only if you call me monica they went out together and svetlana reached and put a hand on ropers knee there is much more going on with alex than it seems im sure of it i dont know what it is but i will find out i promise you my dear so you and katya will come on board help us to find a solution what else would i do alexander is my blood and blood is everything nowim an old woman now and havent time to waste so forgive my directness when monica was telling us the story she mentioned general ferguson and one of his closest associates a sean dillon who used to be with the ira yes when the general persuaded him if you could call it that to join the organization he said it was because he needed someone who could be worse than the bad guys i see and it is this man whom monica favors you could put it that way i look forward to meeting him kelly flirted with the ira when he was a student in dublin he once said it brought out the romantic in him there wasnt anything in the least romantic about the ira in belfast in the years i was there he told her but that is all over now my dear a long long time ago that evening there was a council of war at holland park ferguson was there roper monica dillon and harry and billy salter this is absolutely top security this kurbsky affair ferguson said im not even informing lord arthur tilsey of the matter hes got enough on his plate running the security services in place of the late and unlamented simon carter he turned to monica you havent seen your brother since you got back no his doctor wasnt too happy with him hes gone down to stokely hall to take it easy for a while i must ask you to keep the kurbsky matter to yourself its absolutely essential if were to carry out this operation not only successfully but with total secrecy as kurbsky told you he wants so i dont tell my brother its the name of the game love dillon said so were it ferguson said a nice tight crew the six of us and thats the way we keep it we handle it no one else what about svetlana and katya zorin i classify them as technical backup im particularly interested in the zorin woman and what shes said to you i look forward to hearing from her you gave kurbsky your codex number i thought that was okay i was told it was encrypted it is and you did right but it puts you on the end of the wire were already only twelve days away from when kurbsky will enter the √©lys√©e palace to have his legion of honor pinned to his manly breast by the french president when he calls you monica find out when the ceremony is morning or eveningthey do bothhow much protection he has and whether hes staying at the russian embassy or a hotel ill give you a checklist what are your movements back to cambridge tomorrow long weekend necessary business i could be back in three days i think ill feel more secure when youre back with us theres a real element of danger here look you dont need to worry about me charles im involved by chance but this isnt the first time ive been in a dangerous situation i was at drumore remember during the shootout with those ira thugs and i killed a man you were there he needed killing and i got over it end of story very civil of you ferguson said i think that will do for the moment people harry got up anybody want a bite to eat at the dark man its only eight oclock best pub grub in london and on me monica nudged dillon he said thanks harry another time monicas got an early start in the morning all right lovebirds come on billy and they left ferguson was writing away theres your checklist he handed it to monica and she put it in her purse we could stop in at that french restaurant in shepherds market on the way back she said to dillon why not he turned to roper are you okay ive done enough travel for one day sean a sandwich and the scotch and ill catch up on cyberspace monica said what about you charles he hesitated oh you dont want an old fogey like me at the table her codex went she flicked to see where the call originated her eyes widened and she held it out to roper he took it from her making an adjustment that linked it to his speakers she said whos that monica its alex kurbsky roper put a finger to his lips and waved the others to silence monica said what a surprise alex to hear from you so soon where are you a special hotel the ministry of arts runs but i move soon to a safe house outside moscow where the gru will keep an eye on me until paris where are you staying when you go there they havent decided yet but ive been thinking about what we discussed id like to proceed thats wonderful but on the terms i discussed with you total secrecy you said you knew people in the british security services at the highest level i do and ive spoken to them she took a chance now you can speak to my controller right now i happen to be visiting the london safe house major giles roper put him on roper said mr kurbsky its a great honor one soldier to another monica said her phone was encrypted is that so a work of technical genius what can i do for you as monica knows i wish to fly my cage but my terms are strict i prefer total anonymity certainly for a while roper glanced at ferguson who nodded thats a given totally guaranteed he also took a chance now i spoke with svetlana today monica and i visited her she was thrilled to hear about new york and now paris god in heaven kurbsky said is she well she lives with a woman friend katya zorin in chamber court kelly died years ago but i suppose you knew that not until afterwards so if you talked to my aunt i presume the question of my desire to flee was raised she made an assumption it was impossible to deny so she and her friend are aware of whats intended but obviously theyre trustworthy i accept that i would trust svetlana with my life but i dont want her involved in this business in any way shes an old woman i would not wish to bring any kind of threat to her so you think you can snatch me in paris i fly in privately with three gru minders and theyll dog my every step well think of something is your boss there yes general charles ferguson i sensed there might be somebody put him on ferguson said kurbsky what a pleasure i must go but titbits for you i spoke to putin personally he made it clear how important i am to dear old mother russia i used to be handled by a general volkov who was in charge of security does that mean anything to you it does indeed it seems volkov is no more and putin intends to handle the security side himself does that interest you very much and does the name luzhkov strike a chord certainly station head of gru at the london embassy putin spoke to him in my presence told him that london was the top hot spot and he was promoting him to full colonel and sending him back there that is interesting i must go ive been hiding in the toilet too long ill be in touch i wont give you my number this time i dont want you calling me at an inconvenient moment he was gone and roper was smiling all over his ravaged face well how about that then how about that indeed ferguson turned to dillon and monica thank you and id love to join you for dinner in shepherds market it was eleven oclock at the minsky hotel in moscow and kurbsky was sitting with bounine and luzhkov in a corner by the bar wonderful things mobile phones well if theyre not encrypted they can be a stone in the shoe luzhkov said but ours are good play the recording back kurbsky did as he was told and turned the sound up afterward bounine said hah you must be pleased to hear about your aunt christ you used to talk about her in afghanistan she was the only mother i knew a wonderful person was i okay he asked luzhkov amazing to hear roper and ferguson i know them so well and the information you gave them was harmlesstheyd find out anyway and every little bit helps to establish your credentials the magic name of putin will certainly excite them he turned to bounine i go back to london on thursday nightyou come with me if ferguson s people are keeping an eye out on alexander in paris we cant have you anywhere near him who have you selected for the minders team ivanov kokonin and burlaka im surprised id say theyve got a lot to learn bounine commented and they arent in on the plot thats definite kurbsky asked whatever ferguson s people do theyll expect your minders to defend you if they didnt theyd smell a rat so they could get killed my dear alexander theyre expendable thats the name of the game so they play their part and die for the motherland a great honor bounine said i thought youd have learned that by now he got up its late lets turn in its been a long day th e day bounine and luzhkov boarded their flight for london monica returned from cambridge to dover street her brother was still unwell and remained at stokely in the care of aunt mary and the servants she phoned roper at holland park im back no further word from kurbsky hows sean hes here somewhere ive had a message from katya zorin she wants us to call apparently shes got something she wants to run by us are you doing anything at the moment absolutely not ill come straight round ask sean if he wants to come with us i think he should meet them an hour later tony doyle delivered them to chamber mews three of them this time and they followed the path and found katya waiting on the terrace at the open door inside svetlana sat in her wicker chair like a queen on a throne so this is your irishman she said to monica and held out her hand to dillon for a long moment a good man but two men are inside you and one fights the other however you are better than you think my friend in spite of yourself i should do a tarot reading jesus joseph and mary spare me that maam he turned to katya miss zorin he shook hands i went to rada as a boy and was an actor for a while i admire your work the macbeth you designed the nazi one jesus if ever there was a tour de force it was that we were just having tea russianstyle everyone join in she gestured to the samovar the cups svetlana said what is your birthday mr dillon january the thirteenth capricorn among your aspects you have jupiter in the house of marriage and the moon in good aspect with venus she turned to monica and yet he isnt married this is most unusual perhaps hes just been waiting for me monica said there was general laughter katya said if youd all come into the drawing room id like to show you something which may interest you dillon helped svetlana up and gave her his arm they went through and katya settled them in front of the large television screen she had a keyboard control in one hand roper said before you start i should tell you that alex phoned monica the other night hes confirmed that he wants us to help him defect in paris katya said then it is even more important that i explain what i intend pay attention please she pointed the control pressed a button and the large screen was filled with a fulllength picture of alexander kurbsky in a bomber jacket and jeans hands in his pockets face calm smiling slightly so here we have the man as he is the man the world knows for appearance is everything in this life a gallant soldier a star if you like to put it that way with a swagger to him a sort of renaissance man with the hair almost to his shoulders the beard as if basing himself on the heroes of those books by alexandre dumas we are told he so loved as a boy everything about him says look at me i take your point monica said but couldnt he really be hiding his real self the extravagant appearance would argue that to me possibly there are two sides to any coin but the important thing here is to change him into something else change his appearance dillon said yes but not just that we must change the inner man as well it will require a performance but first the other man she tapped on her keyboard the head moved into full screen and within moments the beard had gonethe mouth area the chin clear of all facial hair there was silence for a moment then dillon said amazing how accurate is this well into the ninetypercent range katya said how different to see the firm chin the mouth svetlana said and the cheeks so hollow a hint of the boy i knew its a revelation monica whispered one can make further adjustmentsand remove the smile for instance katya said and did just that now he is much more somber not quite the alexander kurbsky people are used to roper said id say a great many people looking at him like that wouldnt recognize him at all certainly not the general public dillon said and lets take it further the extravagant hair katya had the head image turning the hair shortening to a neat conservative style and stabilized it now well change clothes from the bomber jacket and jeans she punched away at the keys until the figure on the screen wore a dark singlebreasted suit white shirt and striped tie my god he could be something in the city a banker or accountant monica said he certainly isnt alexander kurbsky dillon said i think youve demonstrated that he looked at roper what about you katya said ninety percent and id accept that even a little more but were up against professionals here id never underestimate russian intelligence the gru are as good as it gets thats something we have to accept so you want more katya asked i thought you might i told you i would treat this as a performance and it will require kurbsky to adopt a new identity so different from his own that anyone would accept him even the most skilled operatives of the gru remember our conversation about the best place to hide the letter major roper in plain sight so what if i suggested that alexander kurbsky be lodged here in plain sight that he use the flat over the garage and work as svetlanas gardener and oddjob man just like marek the pole observe katya manipulated the screen again stripping kurbsky of his clothes substituting loose hospital scrubs for them the hair was removed totally the image now of a gaunt human being with sunken cheeks and a shaved skull thats how chemotherapy leaves you when you have treatment for lung cancer which is why he has been residing at that wonderful hospital the royal marsden hes of french extractionthrough his father perhaps i understand he speaks excellent french but that would be up to you people what do you think youre a genius roper said id defy anyone to look at that man on the screen and identify it in any way with kurbsky i agree monica said what about you sean remarkable i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it myself he turned to svetlana and you i want him safe i want him close to me again and if this is the only way so be it thats it then roper said well report back is there anything else now we wait svetlana said the rest i suppose is up to you ive got time off from the university monica gave her a kiss ill stay in close touch katya came all the way down to the gate with them now comes the hard part i think paris theyll be guarding him closely the russians can be very difficult dont worry we can be difficult too dillon smiled and he and monica followed roper out moscow london on the firing range in the cellars of the gru safe house outside moscow the three men who were to be responsible for kurbskys protection in paris stood facing the target area supervised by a hardened sergeant major with a cropped head named lermov kurbsky dressed in a tracksuit and woolen hat sat on a stool watching and smoked a cigarette the three gru men were in uniform six single shots and take your time kokonin first first two head shots then four in the heart and chest area the lights came on in the gloom the target figure moved from right to left pausing and kokonin loosed his shots his first round chipped an ear the next went through the left cheek the chest grouping was widely dispersed kokonin was a junior lieutenant in rank but lermov didnt take prisoners if thats the best you can do i wonder how you handle your cock sir stand back next which was burlaka who managed to catch the head once but his grouping in the chest was very poor even worse lermov said and called to burlaka just fire six times at the body which burlaka did peppering the torso area lermov shook his head terrible burlaka was angry and said i did the job sergeant majorhit whoever it was six times lermov laughed harshly thats one point of view sir he turned to kurbsky afghanistan chechnya its all gone theyre sitting behind desks these days doing everything by computer whats happened to the world where did it all go were dinosaurs sergeant major the three young gru officers were angry ivanov put his pistol on the table after removing the clip if you can do any better show us im tired of being put down like this if youre so much better lets see it and what about you comrade he said to kurbsky your books make a lot of claims kokonin said maybe thats all it ever was there was a moments silence kurbsky dropped his cigarette on the floor and stood lermov picked up a stechkin ive got a certain affection for this ive had it since afghanistan it should take you back comrade it certainly should kurbsky said he held it against his right thigh two targets swung up he doubletapped shooting the left target twice in the heart then twice in the forehead he swung right doubletapping the heart then a single shot through each eye there was silence kurbsky handed the stechkin back to lermov who was thoroughly enjoying himself i must say you keep it in perfect working order sergeant major my compliments now im going to go for my run he went out and lermov turned to the other three what was it you were saying sir he asked ivanov he shook his head hes not like other people hes a oneoff but dont let it get you down im going to give you your most important lesson he pushed a fresh clip in the butt of the stechkin come with me all of you he led the way down to the range and stopped three paces away from the targets watch this he raised the stechkin and shot the target in the heart then in the forehead he handed the weapon to ivanov now you the shots slammed home and he said let the others do it they obeyed him one after another perfect he held out his hand and burlaka passed him the pistol again now you knowget that close if possible theres only one alternative thats better whats that sergeant major ivanov asked lermov replaced the clip on the stechkin stepped close to the target rammed the muzzle into it and fired several times there you go comrades a job well done but thats enough i believe your task is never to leave alexander kurbsky for a moment and there he is running through the orchards on his own ivanov looked hunted come on you bastards he rushed out followed by the others in fact as they emerged into the entrance hall they discovered kurbsky talking to a man in an oldfashioned fedora and a black leather coat kurbsky turned ah here they are we were just having a little pistol practice on the range this is major gregorovich from moscow good boys this lot major they never leave me for a moment following our orders major thats all ivanov said piously as you should said gregorovich now into the commanding officers office i need to discuss paris with you he didnt even take his coat off but did remove his hat as he sat behind the desk and opened a briefcase and took out some documents there is a copy for each of you including you comrade he said to kurbsky lieutenant ivanov will be in charge kurbsky said so the ceremony is it afternoon or evening seven oclock at the √©lys√©e palace there will be other honoreesscientists academics fifteen in all itll be an exclusive affair government officials a few ministers a buffet will be served he sounded as if he didnt approve i know how it goes kurbsky said the worst excesses of decadent capitalism greatlooking women in gorgeous frocks champagne mountains of caviar they know how to seduce us russians his minders were struggling not to laugh and gregorovich was not amused kurbsky you have a sacred duty to the motherland to serve her at all times but i do i assure you major back to business you will fly by private plane next tuesday afternoon and land at charles de gaulle airport in view of the importance of the affair to our reputation you will stay at the ritz hotel the young men perked up considerably kurbsky said my goodness major are you sure we can afford it such levity does not become you my apologies the ambassador will be there i presume no hes needed at an important meeting in brussels how interesting i didnt realize we were now in the european union that is not amusing you book into the ritz immediately this is to guarantee your presence the next day as ive already made clear the ceremony is at seven you return to moscow in the jet at ten oclock thursday morning from charles de gaulle well there you go lads kurbsky said no chance even to get laid your kind of frivolity does not amuse me kurbsky gregorovich closed his briefcase and put his hat on the motherland has treated you well i would suggest you remember that oh i will i will kurbsky assured him gregorovich got up good morning i cant wait to get back to moscow and sanity he opened the door and paused i dont like you kurbsky i never approved they spoil you too much but what goes around comes around you should remember that he went out ivanov and his friends looked troubled kurbsky stood up dont worry lads hes been a desk man all his career guys like that hate real soldiers for obvious reasons anyway im going for a run i dont know what you lot are going to do but if you want to keep up with me youll have to get your running shoes on he left them there ran through the hall and out across the car park where he saw gregorovich leaving in his limousine went down the terrace steps and ran toward the orchards and the woods in the distance at holland park katya zorin finished demonstrating her reconstruction of alexander kurbsky to the full crew including ferguson and the salters youve got to admit its brilliant harry said absolute genius ive known a lot of villains over the years whod have paid you a fortune to have given them a workover like that he told katya im for it completely ferguson said is everyone agreed they all nodded good now his identity ill give it to the mi office five forgery department a french father an english mother born here parents dead and so on and so on hell need documentation from the royal marsden and insertion into their system london university english degree journalist maybe a war correspondent in the balkans something like that passport filled with all the right stamps henri duvalthat name sound about right youre enjoying this arent you monica said you should have been a writer yourself leave it to that nice lady at office five dillon urged him so can we get down to how we lift him ferguson said a fast flight out id say nothing official if parry and lacey do it its got to be out of the way somewhere certainly no airport in the paris area there are plenty of small airfields in brittany that deal with business clients ill speak to squadron leader lacey and put it in his hands and who goes to paris dillon asked you and billy billy smiled coldly that suits me fine at that moment monicas phone rang it was kurbsky i havent got long listen carefully i fly down to charles de gaulle on tuesday arriving in the evening the ministry has decided to splash out so ill be at the ritz with my three minders the ceremony is at seven on wednesday evening we fly back from charles de gaulle at ten on thursday morning his voice echoed over the speakers roper said weve got that well work out how to snatch you and tell you next time you call have you come up with a way of guaranteeing my anonymity absolutely katya zorin has come up with a most ingenious suggestion it will make you into a totally different personone that no one would recognize as alexander kurbsky you must trust us on this all right but i must go now my minders are looking for me ferguson said the ritz by god he should surely be able to give them the slip from there i would say so dillon told him katya said ill be on my way and left ferguson said there is one other matter now that katyas gone so sit down again for a minute the six of us make a nice tight crew but its starting to go at the edges first katya and svetlana now im going to have to include lacey and parry yes charles but come off it those guys have supported us for years weve been to the war zones with him they brought billy back from hazar shot to pieces if you cant trust them who can you all right i accept that but what im working my way up to saying is that i havent informed the prime minister jesus billy said is that legal harry put in since when have we ever been legal dillon told him so what exactly are you getting at charles if we tell the prime minister we have to tell blake johnson the man who was in kosovo with my brother monica said he does for president cazalet what i do for the prime minister we usually do things in tandem i see she said does that give you a problem i dont know thats why i mention it id appreciate your opinions so just think about it well leave it at that for the moment kurbsky had made his call from an old ruined chapel in the wood beyond the orchard it had a distant view of the house to one side of the track and hed been able to keep an eye out for the three young men as they approached searching for him where is the bastard kokonin was saying hes playing with us im sure of it ivanov told him kurbsky let them pass and vanish into the wood and lit a cigarette so the enterprise was afoot it struck kurbsky as ironic that ferguson and company were going to such trouble to extract him and to protect his identity when his own people were aware of everythinghis new identity where he was living but that of course would depend on him what if he kept his identity completely to himself thanks to the mobile phone the greatest invention of all time in some ways he could receive encrypted calls from people who did not know where he was he could also make calls that could not be traced so he who had been a prisoner of his own people was now in a strange way free to do what his people wanted or to refuse it was absolutely beautiful and then he remembered tania at station gorky and realized that his thoughts of freedom had only been an illusion there were voices down below on the track and he emerged from the ruins and ran down the hill and confronted them were you looking for someone they seemed put out then ivanov laughed damn you youve been playing with us again well there isnt much else to do round here but theres paris to look forward to great chambermaids at the ritz you never know you could get lucky they smiled at that but ivanov said chance would be a fine thing one of us has always got to be on guard in your suite kurbsky who had expected such a thing said amiably and how are you going to manage that i have to work out a rota ivanov said well thats okay it means that when one of you is busy watching me the other two can play he grinned im starving lunchtime lads so race me back he ran away from them very fast the one time he was assured of total privacy was when he stayed in the house using the bar facilities or the gymnasium and swimming pool or the extensive library which included computers luzhkov had provided him with codes offering access to classified gru information and after lunch he sat down brought up a screen and accessed the british security services there was plenty of history therethe traitors who had worked for the kgb for instance philby burgess maclean and many many more than the general public in britain had probably ever known about one thing wasnt there thoughnowhere in the files was there any mention of general charles ferguson and his organization the security force known in the trade as the prime ministers private army simply did not exist he tried another approach accessing individuals and struck it lucky the george cross database came up with major giles roper it was all there the george cross and military cross his service in ireland the portland hotel bomb the final explosion that had left him in a wheelchair apparently he now worked in the computer industry computer industry my arse kurbsky said softly but what a man but that was all he could find on ferguson and his crew for want of something better to do he tapped in monica and reviewed her life her photo was excellent and he smiled a remarkable lady and he liked her finally he typed in svetlana something he had never done and was amazed at the wealth of information there was an early photo from the moscow days of her and kurbsky and tania his father in kgb uniform a few lines on these early days and much more about her defection and london marriage a list of her london stage appearances a photo of kelly a mention that her companion was now the artist katya zorin and then a whole page on her famous nephew kurbsky clicked into katya zorin and discovered her life in theater and art there was a photo of her and svetlana obviously taken recently he smiled touched and switched off lacey and parry appeared at holland park and found roper the boss has filled us in dillon and billy are going to snatch somebody important in paris wednesday night and spirit him away lacey said one henri duval according to the passport parry added though if you believe that youd believe anything absolute top priority lacey said as big as it gets roper drank a little scotch and lit a cigarette well if you say that i really do believe it lacey said so lets look at france roper brought it up on a screen focusing on paris it cant be charles de gaulle or any of the small airfields operating in the paris area look arent you being a bit overcautious parry asked a quick inandout whats wrong with that total anonymity ferguson wants this man swallowed whole it must be as if hes never been its not a kidnapping is it lacey asked absolutely not he wants to disappear into the depths of france that way his own people might think he was still in france simply hidden away somewhere so dillon and billy pick him up by car and whisk him off somewhere lacey said overnight to another part of the country where well be waiting at some suitable airfield to fly out to the uk roper enlarged the map what about brittany lots of places we could use there fly out across the channel islands isle of wight straight up to farley field long way to go brittany not if you went by rail theres a line all the way down to brest marked on the map and brest is a hell of a long way parry said im not suggesting you go all the way the line goes through rennes for example thats not far from saintmalo the channel islands jersey ill bring up flying facilities for that area there were several lacey and parry murmured together and finally made a choice saintdenis theres an excellent flying club there they have a tarmac runway to attract business travel so jets can get in lacey nodded we could do that we could drop dillon and billy at charles de gaulle wednesday morning then fly down to saintdenis and overnight now for the train roper tapped his requirements in and sat back there you are overnight for brest departing midnight apartments available first class can seat four well there you are lacey told him what plane will you use roper asked lacey looked at parry what do you think gulfstreams too flashy lets go for the sober look the old chieftain turboprop plenty of legroom great seats i agree lacey turned to roper a done deal you take care of your end well fix up charles de gaulle and saintdenis and were in business parry added could it get rough in paris for sean and billy lets put it this way theyre up against people who will do everything in their power to stop them duval must be very important when you recognize him remember to forget youve seen him the following day dillon and monica accompanied svetlana on a day out by invitation they went in an old ford station wagon katya driving the weather brooding the time of year my dears svetlana said but i wanted you to see holly end it meant a great deal to alexander when he was here he used to go down for the weekends with kelly all the time katya loves to paint there when the weather is right katya told them they went through the city to greenwich following the river monica said london seems neverending it all changes quite soon now katya said and she was right for beyond gravesend with the rain that had threatened starting to pour they moved into a bleak landscape of fields and marshland edged by mudflats swallowed up by the waters of the thames estuary way beyond half glimpsed through the mist and rain ships moved out to sea katya said look way over there on the horizon is something you seldom see these days a lightship permanently moored on chains so strange this place and so close to the city dillon said there were reeds now higher than a man the road a raised causeway and they came to a village of a dozen oldfashioned seaside wood bungalows mostly painted green with corrugated iron roofs it looked totally desolate not a soul in sight who on earth lives here monica asked no one my dear svetlana told her they are holiday homes for rent people get their supplies from gravesend or perhaps rochester and you must remember to fill up with petrol there too katya said but who on earth would want to holiday here monica laughed oh i dont know dillon said it takes all sorts dickens wrote about gravesend and rochester as i recall birdwatchers come here all the time katya said for people who like that sort of thing its a paradise in the old days very ancient times there were saxons here then outlaws of one kind and another hiding in the marshes closer to our own times certainly in the time dickens knew it there were smugglers they came to a track on the right turned along it and arrived at a fivebarred gate bearing a painted sign holly end they entered a large farmyard surfaced with shingle fronting a barn and a twostory farmhouse that was surprisingly large it had a slate roof and shuttered windows katya turned off the engine got out found a key and opened the blue painted front door im only here to check the place she said but come in by all means theres a pub at all hallows quarter of a mile away well lunch there dillon helped svetlana out gave her his arm and they went inside the hall was dark and there was a smell of damp four bedrooms upstairs katya said sitting room to the left kitchen to the right and bathroom directly ahead its an ugly bitch of a place during the winter and everythings covered so theres not much to see she went upstairs and dillon and svetlana went into the sitting room the furniture had all been covered by oldfashioned gray drapes like shrouds arent they one could imagine a corpse on each chair svetlana said dillon laughed its being so cheerful keeps you going i can see that he helped her across to the kitchen which was normal enough though oldfashioned and she sat at one of four chairs at a large wooden table and kurbsky loved this place always even in weather like this it was the marsh he liked plowing through the reeds he and kelly with shotguns looking for wildfowl they could hear katyas steps upstairs through the ceiling monica said a dead world it makes me uneasy those people who came here in the past must have had little choice in the matter refugees outlaws i think thats what alexander adored about it perhaps the feeling that he resembled in some way all those people who had gone before svetlana said but nothing lives here its a place of shadows quietly passing only an illusion said monica katya had heard her as she came down the stairs and entered the kitchen there is life here and everywhere believe me fish in those creeks in the marsh crabs shellfish geese in the winter from siberia wildfowl in plenty but not to monicas taste i think svetlana told her is all well it would seem so then load up and we shall visit the inn at all hallows typically for such a place the inn called smugglers was a relic of the early eighteenth century crouched on the edge of the estuary it had a weatherbeaten look to it but the bar was friendly enough with a beamed ceiling and a wideopen hearth and a log fire the woman behind the bar was named betty and greeted svetlana warmly both women seemed to be about the same age katya said no visitors around then a few birdwatchers as usual the crazy type who go out in all weathers now whatll it be you know me ladies one dish a day is my limit and being monday its stew and dumplings which will suit us svetlana said and a glass of red wine for me i dont know what the rest of you want thats fine monica said his lordship here will undoubtedly hope for irish whiskey and ill stick to one glass of sherry as im driving katya said they sat there enjoying the warmth waiting for the food and svetlana said do you think your visit here tells you something more about my nephew im not sure monica said the man i met in new york was a handsome devil with a swagger to him someone who seemed to face the world and say i dont give a damn what you think of me take me or leave me i couldnt care less svetlana nodded you must realize i have to see this for myself dillon said what did you think of the boy from moscow who joined you in london but loved to come down here to this desolate world she opened her large handbag rummaged in it and produced a pack of cards tarot she said to monica i discovered i had a gift for these things many years ago as i said i am a sensitive i wont ask you if you believe shuffle the pack and give it back to me with your left hand monica did as she was told and svetlana spread the pack in a halfcircle facedown three cards that is all you need monica eased them out still facedown they looked antique and were green and gold svetlana took monicas left hand in hers you thought you knew yourself but something has happened of late to you that has changed your life irrevocably you are no longer the person that you thought you were now choose one card and turn it over monica did as she was told her stomach hollow with excitement the picture was a pool guarded by a wolf and a dog beyond it were two towers and in the sky above the moon this is good my dear for it is upright it indicates a crisis in your life all is changed utterly reason and intellect have no part in resolving your new situation only your own instincts will bring you through you must at all times flow with the feeling your own feeling this alone will present you with the true solution monica felt drained and weak good god she said faintly and reaching found dillons left hand and held it tight you wouldnt be giving me any answers would you he asked as svetlana picked up the cards and dropped them back in her handbag one at a time is all i am capable of my dear it is so draining but i can speak of the past almost twenty years ago i sat here with kelly and my nephew and alexander asked me and not for the first time to do the cards i had always refused i always had a bad feeling but this time you agreed monica asked yes but he asked for the double one card on another he insisted there was a long pause dillon said gently what was the result the first card was a knight on horseback a baton in his hand a sign of someone who chooses the path of conflict for its own sake and the second card monica felt a strange chill death a skeleton with a scythe mowing not corn but corpses but thats terrible horrible monica was truly upset katya said even worse when they returned to chamber court that evening it was to receive the news from moscow about tania you mean the false report that she was only wounded dillon asked katya nodded and svetlana sighed such is life my dears betty chose that moment to come in from the kitchen a plate in each hand and put them on the bar get it while its hot she said and returned to the kitchen katya got them and handed them down betty came back with two more the outside door opened and three men with hooded anoraks entered binoculars around their necks they moved down to the other end of the bar by the fireplace and ordered beer eat up my dears svetlana said and dont be depressed for all will be resolved in the end on the way back to london monica received another call from kurbsky who was in the bathroom in his apartment at the safe house can you talk just a moment monica asked katya to pull in at the side of the road and got out of the station wagon you can speak now ive enjoyed looking at you on the internet i found your major roper too tell him ill call at midnight my time tonight nine yours this isnt a request i need answers the line went dead and monica got back in the station wagon and told dillon he said well it would be difficult to say no call in now and tell roper well go back to chamber court with the ladies and then check in at holland park youll keep us posted katya said absolutely there are two important moves in this game one to get kurbsky out of paris the second to get him safe in your hands at holland park so you can work your magic he smiled at svetlana dont worry my love its going to be just fine trust me as it drew closer to nine oclock at holland park they all sat waiting for ferguson had called in the salters too and at nine precisely kurbsky came through roper adjusted monicas mobile and kurbsky spoke have you got the plan for me were only three days away roper said we will have two operatives arriving in paris by private plane on wednesday their names are sean dillon and billy salter weve checked the order of events at the √©lys√©e palace seven oclock a glass of champagne as a welcome things get serious from eight then comes the buffet meal we figure you return to the ritz for elevenbut it could be earlier so what happens then im handing you over to dillon how do your minders see to you dillon asked they have a rota one on guard at all times in my sitting room in the suite you go to bed as soon as you get back whatever time it is i would imagine a man of your experience would have no difficulty handling the guard in your room then what straight downstairs minutes only there are always taxis at the rank outside tell the driver to take you to the gare du nord railway station there is a train leaving for brest at midnight well be waiting at the gate well even have a passport for you youre now henri duval and where does this train take me overnight to brittany where a private plane waits to bring you to london its so simple it could work it will work roper cut in there is only one flaw i am egotistical enough to assume that dillon and salter will recognize me however i havent the slightest idea what they look like ferguson exasperated said of course theyll recognize you dammit man theyll approach you at the gate and whisper in my ear monica said shut up the lot of you its perfectly simple ill go with them will that serve alex good heavens yes thats settled then ferguson said rather lamely well i suppose it is excellent im very grateful monica kurbsky said im sure your two friends will look after you well nothing to look after itll be a breeze she felt hugely elated and glanced at dillon who was smiling wryly one more thing major ropermy future my anonymity is assured believe me old man by the time weve finished with you even you wont recognize who you are monica said alex can i have your mobile number no but i would like yours major roper at this stage in the game its essential absolutely roper gave it to him take care but i always do kurbsky clicked off and there was only silence london paris in london the embassy of the russian federation was situated in kensington palace gardens there was a safe house close by where boris luzhkov had privileged quarters and bounine now a major was also well looked after included in all this were the joys of kensington high street and the pub on the other side it was just after noon on tuesday when bounine went out through the main gate waited for a break in the traffic and darted across to keep a lunch appointment with luzhkov luzhkov had a favorite window seat and was reading the early edition of the evening standard so there you are he said how are you finding it a posting to london at last bounine said i like it very well he turned as a young waitress approached a large vodka please luzhkov swallowed the rest of his wine and gave her the glass another for me and two shepherds pies he folded the newspaper always read the standard its an institution and almost anything on the menu here is excellent this city is a spys heaven yuri at least twentyfour gru people are hereposing as something else of course to be frank nobody wants to go home from a london posting what was dublin like great city and great people the problem was that the ambassador wanted me not only to act like a commercial attach√©but be one what a bore still life has taken on a new meaning for you now this kurbsky business very special indeed a great opportunity for both of us whats our next move not ours kurbskys right about now his falcon is leaving the motherland for paris his mobile trembled in his shirt pocket and he answered alexander my friend how are you as good as ill ever be just taking off from moscow how are you and yuri settling in he cant believe his luck were enjoying lunch in my favorite pub across the street from the embassy good for you and now to business youre aware that idiot gregorovich informed me we would be staying at the ritz because the ministry did not want to shame the motherland by its frugality naturally the lads are rather worked up at the prospect of french chambermaids to say that i seriously doubt the competence of ivanov kokonin and burlaka is putting it mildly and the chambermaids they lust after will probably turn out to be polish ive given young ivanov my personal mobile number so that he may call me at any time if he has a problem so what have ferguson s people got planned i return to the hotel after the √©lys√©e palace affair is over by then it will be late so i retire to bed having an early start for moscow in the morning as usual ill have one of the lads on guard in the sitting room by the suite im to deal with him permanently that would seem extreme only if its necessary and then kurbsky told him of the train to brittany and luzhkov said nice and simple dillon and salter are very good but i suppose the woman could complicate things not really it should all be perfectly straightforward lets get one thing clear when i get to london safely and find myself in ferguson s hands im going to go with the flow step by step and evaluate what theyve worked out for me i wont be calling you every five minutes and if i turn my phone off youll just have to accept that by the way ive turned off my recording facility id rather you didnt do that too bad colonel ill be in touch when i have something to say the line went silent luzhkov said the bastard bounine looked bewildered something wrong very much so kurbsky is suddenly turning awkward he shook his head im beginning to get a bad feeling about this whole business at holland park roper was having a sandwich around ten oclock in the evening when dillon and monica dropped by good film roper asked not bad dillon helped her off with her coat we thought wed have a drink with you on the way home she told him home is it roper said as she sat beside him and dillon went to the icebox and got a bottle of champagne youre almost becoming a family man dillon get stuffed dillon said amiably and poured whats happening kurbskys on the fourth floor of the ritz his suite interconnecting with a bedroom next door two other separate rooms along the corridor ive got some interiors restaurants bars and so on up there he gestured at the screens have a look theyve been having dinner in the main dining room how do you know that monica asked weve got an asset at the ritz what do you mean an asset is a reliable source whom you pay for information in our game this one is on the concierge staff very junior but okay for general information burlaka and kokonin have gone to a strip joint in montmartre kurbsky booked the car for them my information is very recent hes in the bar with ivanov so ivanov has missed the joys of the strip show rules of the game one of them must be with kurbsky at all times what a shame she accepted the glass of champagne from dillon just to complicate things ivanov and his chums are booked in under false names its common practice for gru operatives operating under cover on foreign soil monica sighed i dont know how you keep up with it all and im sorry for ivanov or whatever you call him missing out on all the fun in fact it wasnt strictly true for ivanov had just had a most charming surprise hed gone upstairs with kurbsky whod decided to retire to his suite early kurbsky unlocked the door of his suite and entered ivanov was going to follow him when the door of his room the interconnecting one opened and a young woman blond and more than presentable in the uniform of a chambermaid appeared carrying a few crumpled sheets one of the reasons he had been chosen for the assignment was that he spoke reasonable french he said hello is there a problem she answered him in russian im ukrainian call me olga i do night shifts only here but its the ritz and the moneys good and i get to meet interesting peoplelike you for instance i know all about you and your boss in from moscow there was a cheeky insolence to her and ivanov said whats the problem the day maid a bitch from warsaw called anya has made a disgusting mess of the bed so ive got to change it fast because if the supervisor finds out ill get sacked is it okay of course it is he was excited and then she looked beyond him which made him turn and there was kurbsky leaning in his doorway arms folded smiling slightly you appear to be in control of the situation ill leave you to it he moved back and closed his door ivanov went into his bedroom which was incredibly elegant by the standards he was used to there was a fourposter bed a desk on one side of the room a reasonable seating area on the other with two comfortable easy chairs and a wardrobe area beside the connecting door to kurbskys suite he was aroused no question of that and went and sat by the window got himself a vodka miniature from the room bar and waited she returned with fresh sheets and attacked the bed and ivanov watched as she stretched and turned her skirt rising over her thighs as she leaned to smooth the sheets he ran a hand up her right leg she straightened now that is naughty he stood his hands all over her turning her kissing her passionately she responded but when he started to make free with his hands she said no not now ive got things to do later ill see you later he pulled away yes im being silly ive got to go next door for a while is he a queer or something dont be stupid im supposed to guard him from a chair in the sitting room its orders hes a very important man so you sit here all night well no its a shift system with the other two but theyve gone out on the town at the moment well youd better hope they get back in good condition so they can do their shift im on till eight in the morning who knows she plumped the pillows turned down a corner of the duvet patted his face and walked out ivanov took a deep breath got up knocked on the connecting door opened it and walked into kurbskys sitting room there was no sign of him although the television was on kurbsky appeared in pajamas wearing a hotel bathrobe i said the chambermaids at the ritz would excite you shes a ukrainian called olga kurbsky was amused for some reason i find that very funny you poor bastard duty before a good shag i admire you go get a drink from my bar and watch television im for bed ivanov did as he was told had another vodka and then another caught up in an old movie about french paratroopers in the algerian war finally he fell asleep in the armchair and came awake to find it was half past two he went in the bathroom and splashed his face then went and listened at the bedroom door everything was still so he let himself out into the quiet corridor and tapped on kokonins door there was no response and neither was there from burlaka he was bitterly angry and then a staff door marked service opened and olga appeared looking for your friends they arrived back an hour ago drunken pigs both of them they had to have a couple of porters bring them up and help them into their rooms one was sick in his bathroom the porters had to do a cleaningup job ive got a passkey if you want to take a look yes i would if you dont mind in spite of the porters good work there was a whiff of vomit in kokonins room ivanov got out quickly and she let him into the next room where burlaka sprawled on his bed half naked snoring hugely bastards ivanov said a disgrace to the uniform i hope theyve caught the pox it was very quiet there in the corridor at that time in the morning he felt awkward and helpless and it showed she said poor old boy she kissed him briefly careful were probably on cctv he told her not on this section of the corridor she took his hand let me show you something she opened the door marked service and he saw that it was a small room shelved and stacked with bedding of every kind its nice in here nice and warm and cut off from everything dont you agree when she closed the door the light faded to a red glow and she was a creature of infinite mystery as she pushed him back onto a bolt of duvets hoisted her uniform skirt and straddled him her hands opened things up expertly and it occurred to him that she had probably done this before and in the same place but he didnt care didnt care at all and he simply lay there allowing her to ride him and when it was over and she stood there adjusting her dress he got up and tried to embrace her at the door and she pushed him away oh no youve had your ration anyway youre not leaving till thursday morning thats true ive got a split shift tomorrow half in the afternoon half at night so i dont start till eleven sort your friends out over the guarding business and maybe ill sneak into your room he was thrilled and showed it ill fix it i promise you theyll have to do as theyre told especially after tonight she opened the door led the way out and he went back to the suite and let himself in all was quiet and he tiptoed through to his room leaving the door open took off his jacket and shoes and lay on the bed suddenly conscious that hed never been so happy in his life smiled and fell asleep dillon spent the night with monica at dorset street and they drove out to farley field together in his mini ten oclock was the departure time for the flight to paris and ferguson had come to see them off as harry had with billy lacey and parry wore the kind of navy blue uniforms that pilots did the world over with a little gold braid to sharpen it up it wasnt a good morning bad march weather and they stood under the golfing umbrellas that lacey had produced and chatted what can i say ferguson smiled it should be an easy one youll be back before you know it thats when the really important part of the job starts the transformation of alexander kurbsky lacey led the way to the chieftain where parry was already at the controls and ferguson and harry walked with him monica went first then billy ferguson said to dillon paul bl√©riot is waiting at charles de gaulle hell put you up provide everything you need a good man you can depend on him dillon ducked in and sat on the other side of the aisle from monica opposite billy and lacey closed the airstair door and joined parry in the cockpit who is bl√©riot monica asked very old chum of ferguson s hes his man in paris when you need a helping hand such as youll see he grinned at billy check that bar box billy and see if theyve slipped half a bottle of champagne in which they had and billy opened it and poured it into plastic cups so elegant monica said just like a picnic billy opened half a bottle of water well lets hope it stays a picnic dillon toasted them to us th e flight was uneventful the chieftain landed and taxied to the private section of the airport where they were offloaded parry stayed at the controls and lacey saw them out saintdenis tomorrow he said and heaved up the airstair door they had light luggage only but a porter insisted on earning his tip by carrying it on a trolley to security and then out to the pleasantlooking man in his sixties wearing a tweed cap and an old leather coat his eyes were very blue and he smiled a lot lady starling a sincere pleasure ive always been enchanted by beauty and brains good heavens you are a charmer he took her hand and kissed it i feel as if i know you all having had your pictures thoughtfully faxed to me by my friend charles you already seem like old friends i have a suitable vehicle waiting he nodded to the porter and led the way out to a renault station wagon in the car park the porter loaded the luggage took his tip and went off where to now dillon asked i have a club restaurant on the seine i thought you could spend the day with me ive no idea why youre here and i dont want to know lets keep it that way la belle aurore his place was called quite charming and close to the quai st bernard with a fine view of notre dame there was a basin for moorings close at hand quite a few motor cruisers with winter covers on them and a row of barges in which people lived the red one is mine bl√©riot led the way along a narrow gangway and they boarded and followed him below it looked like it had everything that was needed for a comfortable life an enormous stateroom running into an open kitchen area at one end a shower room and two bedrooms at the other yours for the day my friends freshen up and then well have a lunch in the restaurant but first a present for you from charles ferguson he unlocked a cupboard took out a travel bag and put it down on the large coffee table in the center of the stateroom and said to dillon yours i believe dillon opened it and discovered two walthers with silencers and a colt also with silencer which he handed to monica how thoughtful of ferguson no goodlooking woman should be without one thats what i always say i hope its not too heavy for your handbag if youre being a male chauvinist pig sean dillon it doesnt suit you i would remind you that ive used a colt and quite effectively as you well know dont let him get to you monica billy said as he checked a walther i dont think were into a shooting war this time nothing my friends is ever certain in this life paul bl√©riot said so lets go and have a drink at la belle aurore and you can decide how you would like to fill your day at the ritz hotel kurbsky was still having his breakfast in the suite with ivanov when he received a request for an audience from the duty manager may i ask why kurbsky said i deeply regret to inform you monsieur kurbsky it concerns irregularities in the behavior of your companions indeed kurbsky said well we cant have that come on up he turned to ivanov trouble with the management about my companions whats been going on two of them were so drunk they had to be put to bed by porters one vomited in his bathroom how delightful kurbsky said ive always said put a peasant in uniform and hes still a peasant it hardly covers the russian federation with glory the doorbell rang answer it the manager was so apologetic that it irritated kurbsky immensely of course their behavior doesnt meet the standards the ritz expects it doesnt meet the standards i expect they will be dealt with appropriately when we return to moscow as im due at the √©lys√©e palace this evening i must request your indulgence we are leaving in the morning as you know i apologize for having to bring this to your attention monsieur as i know you are to receive the legion of honor from our president this evening kurbsky felt like saying so what but contented himself with your consideration has been all that i would have expected from the ritz the manager bowed himself out and kurbsky said to ivanov in here now both of them and dont bother to dress bathrobes will do walking dead men was an apt description they both looked dreadful and were experiencing the most appalling hangovers they stood there in their robes obviously very ill indeed kurbsky said you are officers in the gru on assignment abroad in one of the worlds greatest cities you are representing your country you are supposed to be showing some pride in the motherland and what do you do disgrace yourselves disgrace russia you might as well have stood there and urinated against a wall in the champs√©lys√©es and frankly you are not fit to accompany me to the palace this evening please sir i dont know what happened burlaka croaked i think there was something in my drink the oldest excuse in the world get out of my sight get yourselves downstairs to the sports club see what the saunas and steam room can achieve they backed out ivanov said what happens for the rest of the day well ive no intention of sitting here on my backside and according to the rules youve got to accompany me which will probably bore you to death i like art great art so the louvre is a must i might just allow you a cruise on the seine or a trip up the eiffel tower but thats it four firstclass tickets on the midnight train for brest from the gare du nord they are private compartments linked by a door each compartment takes two in the sense that you can pull two bunk beds down but with the connecting door it will suffice for a party of four here are the tickets bl√©riot put them on the table and monica examined them excellent well travel in style there is a restaurant car i presume yes i know the train well it has a kind of faded splendor and the rolling stock is charming but old for example there is a toilet at each end of the corridor nothing private hardly the end of the world monica said she turned to dillon so what do we do now go for a walk see the sights does that suit you billy absolutely remember you may use my barge as much as you want theres a lot of time to fill before your train leaves and youll need a couple of the restaurant umbrellas its not exactly the best time of the year to go walking by the seine ive things to do ill see you later bl√©riot got up and went theres always the louvre the eiffel tower notre dame been there done that monica said what about you sean my dear girl i used to live in this great city years ago in the days of my wicked past i even had a barge like bl√©riots he turned to billy what about you ive never been to paris the louvre isnt my cup of tea and im not into cathedrals the eiffel tower though is something i always wondered about when i was a kid right dillon said well get a cab and go afterwards ill take you somewhere special they didnt know that they had missed kurbsky and ivanov by only forty minutes at the top of the eiffel tower in any case the visit was something of a nonevent because of the rain mixed with mist that draped itself across the city i enjoyed blackpool tower more billy said as they descended in the elevator spoken like a true englishman dillon told him approached a taxi rank and in rapid and fluent french told the driver to take them to quai de montebello opposite the √Æle de la cit√© now what billy demanded wait and see a short while later they parked at the side of a cobbled quay whats all this monica asked getting out and putting up an umbrella bateaux mouches dillon told her floating restaurants sail up the river and have a meal and a bottle of wine see the sights its a regular thing they follow a timetable in this bloody weather billy said if you notice there are ample deck awnings and you can sit inside if you prefer dont be a grouch billy it looks like fun monica told him two deckhands were about to pull up the gangway but paused to let them on board a waiter approached smiling will you be dining if its not too late for lunch dillon answered in french of course monsieur we never close not too many customers today its the time of the year and the weather choose where you would like to sit and i will start with a drink for you they went up to the upper deck but the sides were open and the rain was blowing in so they went back down and found a nice table by the stern window so they could see all the sights as they passed dillon and monica had champagne grilled dover sole and lyonnaise potatoes billy a large bowl of bouillabaisse ive got to give it to you dillon billy said this stew is the business im really enjoying the whole thing notre dame looks great up there the barges its nearly as good as the thames monica patted his hand theres no answer to that my fish was marvelous all id like now would be coffee the waiter hovering started to clear the plates at once madame dillon lit a cigarette passed it to her and lit another theyre french he said nobodys going to throw us off the boat how do you think things are going billy said with kurbsky kurbsky seemed confident in his ability to handle the guard in his room tonight said dillon considering his military experience he should be i suppose im just nervous because weve got nothing to do except wait for him at the gate for that midnight train at the gare du nord billy said the waiter brought coffee billy asked for english breakfast tea and dillon a bushmills whiskey monica said im still fascinated by the whole venture the future i cant get my head round whats supposed to happen to kurbsky maybe he cant either billy said well just have to wait and see kurbsky had been slightly surprised to discover that the dress for the ceremony was not black tie the new president had decided to open things up and business suits were the order of the day it was fivethirty when kurbsky finished dressing and examined himself in the mirror in the bedroom wardrobe very much as he had done in new york he wore black and had to confess it looked good he went and kicked on the door of the connecting room then went and found his jacket ivanov came in you wanted me how are they obviously better than they were a long hard day bring them in ivanov departed kurbsky pulled his jacket on fixed his cuffs checking himself in the sitting room mirror burlaka and kokonin were obviously revived by the days regime had tried hard with their appearance and he knew from what ivanov had told him that they had put themselves in the hands of the hotels barber have you had a good day they looked hunted and didnt seem to know what to say it was ivanov who answered for them they behaved stupidly but theyve learned their lesson it wont happen again kokonin said never i swear it in the circumstances ive decided not to take any further action in this matter kurbsky said and to ivanov you will make no report of the affair when we return to moscow their relief was immediate thank you comrade they chorused kurbsky wondered how theyd feel when they discovered hed done a runner itd be a blot on their records sufficient to ruin any prospects of advancement in their chosen careers what would they think of alexander kurbsky then he said come down to the bar ill buy you a drink they were astonished come on we havent got time to waste he opened the door and went out they stood at the magnificent bar and he ordered four vodkas and said you cant all come with me to the ceremony only one aide is allowed to accompany me inside so two of you have to wait in the limousines in the circumstances you will understand that im choosing ivanov of course comrade burlaka said gamely and glanced at kokonin and the fact that ivanov spent the whole night obeying my orders and guarding me was i believe detrimental to his love life it wont be the same tonight you two must sort it out when we get back they nodded almost eagerly and the four vodkas appeared before them kurbsky raised his in a toast and surprised them by not mentioning himself to the motherland and to vladimir putin prime minister of the russian federation he emptied his glass and turned it upside down on the bar and said to ivanov well go now there is a mercedes due from the embassy speak to the concierge he led the way out at the √©lys√©e palace they were checked at the main gate and passed through to the courtyard and parking area kurbsky and ivanov left the others and joined a sizable crowd of people pushing toward the main doors of the palace all life was there a mixture of uniforms and civilian attire and the palace guards in their gorgeous outfits there was a great hubbub as they went in chandeliers sparkling over the incredible opulence of it all a colonel in the dress uniform of the foreign legion standing at the entrance to a cordonedoff section of the crowd saw kurbsky and beckoned when kurbsky approached he said in english mr kurbsky this is an honor weve been worriedyour embassy was supposed to be in touch an hour ago to confirm you were on the way its a good thing i saw you is this your aide yes lieutenant ivanov right hell be seated in one of the three back rows youll be in the front row of course he offered kurbsky an embossed card give this to the usher up there ivanov said good luck comrade kurbsky went along the aisle and offered the card to some sort of majordomo who examined it and led him to his seat which was at the very end of the front row on the right it meant that kurbsky only had the person on his left to make small talk with the man was very old and wrinkled with a shock of white hair he smiled when the man looked sideways at him and spoke in german which unfortunately was not one of kurbskys languages he said something unintelligible so kurbsky said hello how are you in russian he seemed alarmed and kurbsky tried english the old man immediately looked wise and said who are you very slowly taking his time with each word alexander kurbsky why are you here to receive the legion of honor what for what do you do i write books im a novelist there was a nod of puzzlement i have never heard of you kurbsky laughed out loud and people turned to look what about you he asked why are you here for the legion of honor my name is hans kruger and what do you do im a nuclear physicist well thats all right i havent heard of you either and then voices hushed there was a fanfare of trumpets and the proceedings began it took a long time and there were speeches and more speeches that numbed the mind as well as the backside as the whole thing dragged on recipients were called in turn and it all began to be slightly reminiscent of a conveyor belt and kurbsky wasnt even aware of the magic moment he certainly was there when the president pinned on the insignia of the legion of honor and words were said but what they were he could never be sure and then it was all over the president moved on and kurbsky went with the flow the crowd of people searching for the food ivanov was tugging his sleeve wonderful great stuff you know something im not certain you and i have experienced the same affair whats the time he glanced at his watch good god its half past nine already where have i been he shook his head wheres the buffet ivanov had it all worked out and led the way at that point kurbsky realized he was clutching a box of moroccan leather in his right hand and had been for some time he looked at it puzzled then realized what it was and opened it unpinned the legion of honor from his lapel and put it inside you shouldnt take it off you should wear it with pride ivanov said but kurbsky put it in his pocket and they pushed through the crowds got plates at the buffet and took their turn it was hardly worth it for people as people do in crowds were tending to become difficult he managed a few sausage rolls then said to ivanov ive had enough lets have a drink they found the champagne bar and had a glass and the foreign legion colonel found them where is ityou havent lost it already no its in my pocket the colonel took a glass of champagne himself mind you i suppose its just another gong to you you must have earned plenty and you kurbsky said politely do you ever wonder what its all about every day of my life kurbsky emptied the second glass of champagne ivanov had handed him and said good night its been a sincere sensation he patted the colonel on the shoulder and turned to ivanov lets go they found the mercedes and the others and left reaching the ritz at tenthirty he dismissed the driver and went inside ivanov said a drink perhaps no ive had enough to be frank i want my bed if two of you lads want to have something feel free but im going to the suite whos coming with me ivanov helped things along impatient for the joys of olga to come its been a big night and one ill always remember but im ready for bed now too kokonin said well in the circumstances ill take the first half of the night if thats all right with you he told kurbsky fine by me well go up then they all got in the elevator and went up together in the suite kurbsky went to his bedroom and left kokonin to settle himself in the sitting room he decided against locking the double door leading into ivanovs room because if ivanov wanted to see him for some reason finding the door locked might give him pause for thought the television was on in the sitting room he was aware of that and he opened the door of the bedroom a crack to listen he was all worked up and impatient he checked his watch and saw it was ten fortyfive if he was early at the station what did it matter it was a waste of time and opportunity to wait like this he took his jacket off and put the bathrobe on and walked out into the sitting room kokonin had a movie on and glanced up in surprise he started to move and kurbsky said dont get up i just want something from the room bar kokonin eased down again kurbsky passed behind him turned and delivered a rabbit punch to the neck with extended knuckles then as kokonin moaned held him with one hand and squeezed his thumb into the carotid artery until kokonin slouched over the arm of the big easy chair kurbsky darted into the bedroom tearing off the bathrobe revealing a silenced walther in a belt clip at the small of his back he pulled on his jacket took his leather coat out of the wardrobe went to the door of the suite and opened it the corridor was quiet he moved out locked the door and in seconds was at the door opening to the stairway four flights down and hed never descended stairs so quickly in his life he emerged into the foyer and walked straight out of the hotel door it was raining hard now but there was the taxi rank at that moment olga with thoughts of her split shift starting at eleven and ivanov waiting was hurrying to the staff door seeing kurbsky she paused in the shadows felt puzzled the doorman offered him his umbrella taxi sir where to they walked to the first cab gare du nord kurbsky said and which gate sir midnight express to brest that would be gate three the porter told the driver opening the door for kurbsky and accepting the tip he gave him the taxi drove away and olga still puzzled went in through the staff entrance and clocked in for her shift in the taxi kurbsky took out his mobile and called monica she was already on the train sitting in one of the private compartments with dillon and billy alex where are you are you okay im on my way in a taxi everythings worked like a charm i know im early but i couldnt wait i dont think that matters well see you soon she clicked off smiling hugely at dillon and billy hes on his way well thats great dillon said well go and meet him together lets get moving the midnight express at the ritz olga clocked in then went to the womens staff room opened her locker undressed and changed into staff uniform she reported to the supervisor and then went up to her station on the fourth floor it was just after eleven when she went into the linen room still puzzled about kurbsky then she wondered about ivanov was he even there there was one way to find out she went and knocked on his door lightly then used her passkey he was lying on the bed jacket off propped up against pillows watching television and sat up with a smile swinging his feet to the floor ive been waiting for you he took a quick step enfolded her in his arms and kissed her passionately she pulled away when i saw your boss leave the hotel i wondered what was going on i wasnt even sure youd be here what are you talking about kurbsky i saw him getting a taxi downstairs on my way in he shook his head but thats impossible it was him all right ask the doorman he got him the taxi it was to the gare du nord i heard quite clearly the porter asked which gate and your boss said he wanted the midnight express to brest and the porter said gate three ivanov turned ran to the interconnecting door to the suite opened it and rushed in kokonin was leaning over in the chair holding his head in his hands and groaning ivanov pulled his hands away and shook him what happened i was watching television he came in said he wanted a drink from the room bar and passed behind me he must have punched me or something i just blacked out i only opened my eyes a minute or so ago where is he gone cleared off olga here saw him leaving the hotel and getting a taxi he turned to olga who stood in the doorway get my friend from his room if hes undressed tell him to get his clothes on again and come and join us what is it she demanded what in the hell has happened my boss has decided to defect thats whats happened and if he gets away with it me and my friends might as well defect too because if we go back to moscow without him well end up in some gulag in siberia go and get the other guy she went and ivanov pushed kokonin into the bathroom take your shirt off quickly come on ill give you one of my shirts you havent got time for a full shower but a few minutes with your head under the cold spray will help he opened the shower door and turned it on ice cold kokonin did as he was told leaning in and then withdrawing and toweling himself dry ivanov went and got a fresh shirt for him and as he was pulling it on olga came back your other pal was in his pajamas but hes dressing as fast as he can is this bad for you not if we can get him back do you think thats possible he glanced at his watch elevenfifteen and the train leaves at midnight how long does it take to reach the gare du nord i think maybe fifteen or twenty minutes we could make it then there was a knock at the door and burlaka appeared could someone explain what the hell is going on kokonin came out of the bathroom im okay now ivanov said to burlaka get your raincoats and meet me at the elevator they went out obediently he pulled olga over i suppose well always have the linen room to remember he kissed her then went into his bedroom and found his coat and old slouch hat she followed him and he said well leave everything in our rooms the embassy will see to them and if i were you id keep my mouth shut she followed him out into the corridor you dont have to tell me do you really think you can get him back im not sure but if we can get close enough to kill the bastard that would be just as good he turned and ran to the elevator where kokonin was holding the door and it closed on him olga stood there thinking about him a nice boy and shed liked him but so what life could be cruel sometimes but the last thing she needed was any kind of trouble with russian intelligence she turned and went into the linen cupboard and got on with her work kurbsky found them waiting outside the gate the sight of monica like an old friend she came toward him glowing hands reaching out alex this is wonderful she kissed him on both cheeks and hugged him fiercely are you all right never better introduce me to your friends which she did dillon said we have plenty of time forty minutes lets have you straight on board and well get you a drink i think youve earned it was it difficult not at all astonishingly simple they walked along the platform station noises echoing peoples voices sounding strangely distorted a whistle in the distance a train across the platform starting up and moving forward everybody seems to be going somewhere kurbsky said well you certainly are just follow me she got in the coach and he went after her billy paused as dillon made a call on his mobile which roper received in holland park our package has arrived safely just under half an hour or so and well be off did he kill anybody roper asked not that he mentioned ivanov had promised the taxi driver double fare which worked in spite of the night and rain they reached gare du nord with fifteen minutes to spare and ivanov led the way to the nearest ticket window and slapped his credit card down the train is quite full gentlemen the young woman said all first class has gone thats okay ivanov told her anything will do i can manage three club car seats so you can at least have refreshments but youll have to sit up for the night within five minutes they were passing through the gate and starting along the platform ivanov pulled his black hat down over his eyes you two keep to the other side of the platform ill scan the windows of the train ill join you farther along it was actually easier than he thought it would be the three firstclass coaches were at the front behind the engine with a fourth that was a bar and restaurant walking past his head slightly averted ivanov found kurbsky sitting opposite a goodlooking woman two men on the other side of them at a bar table it was enough he hurried back along the platform to kokonin and burlaka at the rear of the train hes there sitting with a woman and two men in the bar in first class well board find our seats and think this thing out over the champagne kurbsky went over the events of the evening with the others he even found the legion of honor in its box and offered it to monica for a look a remarkable souvenir of today she said what was it like the award ceremony crowded and noisy and bizarre a very old whitehaired nuclear physicist sitting next to me asked me what i did and when i told him he said hed never heard of me which brought me down to earth considerably so much so that i found myself asking what in the hell was i doing there what about the ritz dillon asked you said it was astonishingly simple well i didnt have to kill anyone i had young kokonin sitting on guard i knocked him cold an old unarmed combat trick grabbed my coat and quite simply ran for it i was being handed into a taxi by the doorman about four minutes later he smiled the rest you know the train was moving gliding along picking up a little speed as it left the station a melancholy whistle echoing into the gloom i love trains especially at night kurbsky said i once did the transsiberian all the way to vladivostok an amazing experience i got some interesting poetry out of it i didnt know you wrote poetry monica said bad poetry i think so i dont advertise it as if to prevent any further discussion of the matter he said id like to freshen up can we return to the compartment of course monica said it has a pulldown basin to wash your face or shave but no toilet those are at each end of the corridor im sure well get by dillon and billy went first monica next and kurbsky followed and ivanov and his friends watched through the glass door at the other end back to our seats now ivanov said and led the way to the club car at the rear of the train they had the end table four chairs grouped around it but the fourth was vacant when the steward came with a drinks cart they ordered half a bottle of vodka and ice ivanov heavily overtipped the man we prefer privacy my friends and i i take your point monsieur the steward produced a reserved notice smiled and moved on with his cart what are we going to do kokonin demanded lets assess the situation weve no idea who these three people with kurbsky are ivanov said but they dont know who we are only kurbsky does kokonin said i dont see how we could do anything much on the train anyway as long as kurbsky stays up there in first class and we stay down here well get by were armed all three of us thats in our favor we can wait until they get off ivanov held up a timetable ive found this in the seat pocket the train doesnt go nonstop to brest it drops off at several places rennes for example they could get off anywhere exactly and maybe we wait for that ivanov said but im going to speak to colonel luzhkov and discuss it with him he gave me his mobile number ill go in the toilet so no one can hear which he did going to the one at the end of the coach and locking himself in in london luzhkov was in his quarters in kensington palace gardens preparing for bed when he received the call he listened intently as ivanov explained the situation it pains me to say this ivanov said but kurbsky seems to have defected he knocked kokonin unconscious and fled the hotel it was only by chance that the chambermaid servicing our rooms saw him getting into a taxi as she came on shift and heard his destination that led us to the midnight express to brest were on the train now and kurbskys in first class drinking with a woman and two men he doesnt look like a prisoner which luzhkov could have confirmed since he knew who the woman and the two men were there was no way he could pull ivanovs coals out of the fire he and his friends should have been left high and dry at the ritz while kurbsky disappeared into the night the british of course would expect russian security to try to recover him and they would take appropriate action knowing dillon and billy salter as he did luzhkov knew the reckoning would be harsh he remembered putins words in moscow his defection must appear genuine at all times his gru minders in paris should not be informed of the real facts if they fall by the wayside so be it he took a deep breath and said to ivanov when they get off follow them that is all i can suggest see where it leads you then contact major gregorovich at the gru safe house outside moscow take care he sat there thinking about it starling salter and dillon did not know ivanov and the boys by sight only kurbsky did so only he could alert the others of their presence on the train but if ivanov and the other two sat at the end of the train for the entire journey keeping out of the way theyd be able to follow kurbsky at leisure when their quarry left the train he had to alert kurbsky had no choice kurbsky had his phone in his right pants pocket on vibrate monica was reading a book dillon was reading parissoir on the other side of the table and billy was dozing his head back against a pillow by the open door to the connecting apartment kurbsky smiled at monica excused himself got up and went to the lavatory at the end of the corridor entered and locked the door he answered the phone and luzhkov said thank god you answered what is this i told you i didnt want to speak to you every five minutes shut up and listen luzhkov explained quickly what had happened so you see my friend ivanov and his two chums are on the train with you and they now think you a defector and a traitor to the motherland holy mother of god kurbsky said what are you going to do i dont know if i tell the others theyd need an explanation as to how i knew you could say youd taken a walk along the train and seen them and they hadnt seen me come on get real boris well youd better think of something because if this screws up the whole operation youll not only be in deep shit but your sister will be condemned to live out the rest of her days in the far north of siberia kurbsky fought hard to control himself and kept his voice low damn you dont threaten me alex im not hes got me by the balls too our glorious prime minister theres no eitheror here the great man hates being disappointed he always gets his way so whats it to be i dont seem to have much choice kurbsky said ill speak to you again dont call me ill call you he left the lavatory moved along the corridor through the dining room and the coaches behind where most passengers were curled up in sleep he was careful paused at each connecting door and scanned the passengers inside looking for his quarry and finally reached the club car and there they were at the far end he withdrew and was approached by the headwaiter as he went back through the restaurant car there were only about a dozen people eating would you and your friends like a table monsieur im not sure when is the next stop belleville monsieur about an hour and a quarter ill see what my friends think he returned to the compartment and found monica asleep on one of the pulldown bunks and dillon and billy with their heads down in the second compartment so he picked up monicas book something to do with the roman army in britain that shed written herself went back to the restaurant car and took a table he had a sort of russian breakfastvodka caviar smoked salmon and herrings and strong black bread more vodka and then black bitter tea all this was provided with impeccable service monicas book was fascinating and made the meal a true experience the time had passed so quickly that when they started to slow he was quite caught out and then they were gradually stopping and the headwaiter said belleville monsieur kurbsky peered out he saw only a small station and platform and a few decaying warehouses some people had got off to walk around stretching their legs ambling between stacks of railway sleepers and then kokonin and burlaka walked past hands in pockets chatting to each other there was a kind of inevitability to it and kurbsky moved along found an open door and went down the steps they were over by a coppice of crowded trees and seemed to disappear he hurried half running went around a corner and found them standing at the edge of a deep ditch half filled with water he was upon them before they realized he was there pulled his walther from the belt clip at the small of his back kokonin said you and put a hand in his inside pocket kurbsky shot him between the eyes the silenced walther making a dull thud he was blasted backward and fell half over the edge of the ditch burlaka actually got his gun out but too late as kurbsky did exactly the same to him he rolled first one then the other into the water turned and walked away around the coppice joining the few people getting back onto the train he returned to the restaurant car and found the book where he had left it the headwaiter approached with the bill kurbsky paid him in euros and tipped well im obliged to you it was excellent when is the next stop another hour perhaps more monsieur rennes instead of returning to the compartment he worked his way back to the club car and peered in ivanov was standing talking to the car steward upset the steward was shrugging obviously unable to satisfy him so kokonin and burlaka had missed the train not his fault theyd have to get the next one that seemed the official attitude kurbsky turned and went back from the first day you put on a uniform you had to accept you could die wearing it he was fighting in a war of sorts he seemed to have done so all his life he should have had a little pity for the two dead men perhaps but hed used that all up in afghanistan and chechnya he didnt go in when he got back to the compartments simply checked to see that his three companions were still resting turned and started to make his way toward the rear of the train it was time to finish the thing whatever it took the entire train seemed to be asleep a passenger here or there with a magazine or a book after midnight when anything is possible and death is in the air it wasnt shakespeare he knew that some minor writer from times past not that it mattered he had reached the club car the car steward in his cramped booth was asleep and the passengers in their seats seemed well away too he walked along between the seats to where ivanov sat by himself eyes closed head back arms folded kurbsky slid into the opposite seat and ivanov opened his eyes and nearly jumped out of his skin kurbsky said softly dont say a word youve been caught up in a matter of the highest security to the statewe both have now keep your voice down what about kokonin and burlaka ivanov whispered back at belleville i disarmed them and told them to run for it or else but why did you do this i am under orders from putin himself he stood up we cant talk freely here come out on the viewing platform he went and opened the door that gave onto the platform with the ironwork rail it was a spot much popular with smokers in these anticigarette times although there was a canopy the rain blew in ivanov said were going to get soaked what the hell is going on kurbsky produced the silenced walther jammed the muzzle into him at close quarters and shot him in the heart he lurched back half turning and fell head down over the rail kurbsky toppled him the rest of the way over and the body was swept away in the darkness and rain he replaced the walther in his belt clip his iron composure clicking in and calmly worked his way up the aisle to the end where the car steward still dozed in his booth after midnight when anything is possible and death is in the air it wouldnt go away went around and around in his brain he had killed three men without a hint of pity but hed have to put that behind him as he had with so many others over the years he was clear now to follow the future mapped out for him however uncertain back in first class he went into the lavatory and called luzhkov who had not been able to sleep waiting for news its done boris ive killed all three will there be repercussions i shouldnt imagine theyll be found for a while their bodies arent on the train if thats what you mean by the time anybody finds them we should be flying out from saintdenis did it give you any problem alex boris people like you acting on behalf of the state have sent people out to do your killing for years when did you ever ask if it gave them a problem he rang off paused and then called roper roper answered immediately how are you dillon called just before the train left saying you were in good hands hows the trip so far it turned out to be rather lively kurbsky started the lying now the others were having a sleep and i went into the restaurant car for a bite to eat we stopped at belleville for fifteen minutes a few people got off and to my astonishment i saw kokonin and burlaka two of my gru minders having a stroll how the hell did that happen pure bad luck i found out later some chambermaid saw me get into the taxi heard where i was going and told them they got their act together and followed me to the station they must have just caught the train so what did you do at belleville i slipped off the train followed them to a suitable spot and braced them which means what exactly i shot them both left them in a ditch and got back on board what about the third man ivanov when we got going again i searched the train and found him in the club car i think he thought theyd simply missed the train i told him we were all victims of a complicated plot direct from putin himself he lied again when i asked him how hed got on my tracks so quickly he told me about the chambermaid and where did this confrontation take place on the viewing platform at the end of the train its a smokers paradise these days but not so much for him you killed him too of course and put him over the rail i had to roper you can see that those gru idiots would have cocked things up bigtime by the way speaking of the gru has boris luzhkov turned up at the london embassy yet so i hear roper said what were dillon and billy doing while all this was going on sleeping the sleep of the righteous and it didnt occur to you that they might have appreciated the chance to join in you have a point but there was monica to consider and frankly i thought itd be more efficient if i took care of it myself ill leave you to break the news to dillon he left the lavatory and paused to look in at the compartment where monica was sitting up now and swinging her legs to the ground have you had a good trip at least i slept sean and billy were stirring next door what about you she said trains and planes i can never sleep on them he said i had a great meal in the restaurant car and read your book on the roman army in britain and what was the verdict wonderful action and passion thats what i like ill go down and get a table for breakfast ill see you there billy was at the washbasin and dillon had his mobile to his ear and looked serious so kurbsky got out fast five oclock and still dark outside rain driving against the window the headwaiter provided the black bitter tea would you care for vodka with it monsieur why not dinner breakfasthis time scale was seriously out of joint he swallowed some tea knocked the vodka back and examined the passport and papers dillon had given him when hed first boarded the train dillon arrived still looking serious billy on the other hand was full of excitement three at one blow kurbsky i always thought that was for flies on a slice of bread and jam dillon said damn it billy this is serious he turned to kurbsky i understand discovering kokonin and burlaka was a shock but you should have called us in thats what were here for well i didnt kurbsky told him i needed to act fast and ivanov look i knew him so i knew how to handle him its done now hows monica upset dillon said shell get over it billy put in she shot an ira bastard dead in the drumore affair and she didnt have any trouble getting over that lets order breakfast ill go and get her said kurbsky would that be all right with you i dont own the lady dillon told him tell the headwaiter ill have the same as i did before she was standing at the washbasin in the compartment looking in the mirror and applying her lipstick well here i am he said are you angry with me not anymore let me just ask you was it necessary theyd have tried to take me back by force and it could have been very messy she nodded that makes sense this venture youve embarked on that were all involved in it was bound to bring demands and consequences we didnt perhaps anticipate youre right i know i am alex and this may not be the last of them but thats in the future right now lets join the others for breakfast she brushed past him and led the way down the corridor they passed through rennes and twenty miles later pulled up at saintdenis a small station in a pleasant market town it was sixthirty still that bad march weather daylight now a slategray sky and the eternal rain there was quite a press of people waiting to board obviously going to brest the nearest big city parry was waiting with an umbrella and approached them at once ive got a car waiting with a driver the airfield is eight miles from here and weve had an order from general ferguson only an hour ago to bring our departure forward i dont know whats up but he wants you out of here as soon as possible they piled in the car and billy said as they drove away you think ropers had words with ferguson of course he has dillon said and wants us clear of french soil they were at the airfield very quickly and the driver obviously obeying instructions drove straight to the end of the runway where the chieftain waited parry said straight on board we have friends here its taken care of so five minutes later he was heaving up the airstair door and passing along the aisle to join lacey in the cockpit they were at ten thousand feet before they knew it still bad weather the chieftain rocking in the turbulence but making steady progress out over the channel islands and pushing on toward the isle of wight to england parry came back after a while coffees back there a bottle of champagne cokes the usual things you certainly got us out of there fast billy said good thinking billy i dont know what youve been up to and i dont want to know but we had an order from ferguson to get you out with the fastest extraction since we saved your hides in iraq he moved away and dillon opened the bar box and found the bottle of champagne as he opened it he said ferguson was just being careful he wanted to get us out of the war zone quickly as it were it should be a day or so before those bodies are found then itll take a while to identify them as russian gru and sort out what the hell they have been doing operating in a friendly nation the lies will start the deceit the demands for the bodies and the story will fade because the public wont be particularly interested anyway he poured and passed the first plastic glass to monica and billy said to kurbsky theres a lesson for all of us we said it would be smooth as silk dead simple and it would have been if that bird the chambermaid hadnt happened to be clocking on shift by the taxi rank and seen you saw me and heard me because the doorman asked for my destination to tell the taxi driver thats what doormen in top hotels do dillon handed him a glass its called service billy raised his glass anyway weve been there and done that heres to what comes next he smiled at kurbsky who knows you might grow to like it kurbsky said sharply you obviously know what is intended for me what does come next thats for general charles ferguson to tell youhes the boss that was never clear to me the boss of what exactly the prime ministers personal security unit and youve obviously dealt with this kind of thing before too bleeding right billy told him our rules are there are no rules not these days not with all the terrorists and murderers emerging free from court thanks to stupid laws and clever lawyers and how did you get involved with him kurbsky asked i used to be a gangster but it got boring so did my uncle harry dillon here was a top enforcer with the provisional ira and the two guys flying this plane are decorated raf officers the point is we can be worse than the bad guys kurbsky turned to monica and you are you worse than the bad guys she hesitated now and then i can be useful dillon topped his glass up who knows what you could end up doing at farley ferguson s daimler drove straight up to the chieftain when it rolled to a halt parry dropped the airstair door and kurbsky went down and got in the rear seat beside ferguson it sped away at once and the general said charles ferguson and shook hands heard about the spot of bother on the train yes rather unfortunate kurbsky said youre here now and thats the main thing were going to the holland park safe house most of my work emanates from there and major roper is based there it has the fullest facilities extreme security and its very hightech which saves on staff i need only a couple of military police sergeants to keep things smooth one of them doyle is driving the car now and sergeant henderson is back at the house and what about me weve put together some ideas which well explain to you shortly i think youll find them rather interesting excellent kurbsky said i cant wait to see what you have in store back at farley harry drove across the tarmac to the chieftain in his bentley put the window down and leaned out grinning lets be having you ferguson wants us all down at holland park they climbed in and he drove away so it worked okay hes here bleeding marvelous he must be a right villain knocking off three like that ferguson told you billy demanded he certainly did were like a club billy the six of us were the ones who know everything he wont tell svetlana about this kurbsky being her nephew and everything she mightnt like to think of him running around and knocking off people lets face it though hes obviously got a talent for it i tell you hed have done well in the east end in the old days when the krays were running things hell be giving you a run for your money dillon monica leaned forward and said harry youre one of a kind at holland park they found ferguson and kurbsky with roper in the computer room harry needed an introduction and shook hands warmly you certainly dont take prisoners my old son only if there is a choice and there wasnt kurbsky turned to ferguson what about my aunt she must be anxious to see me of course ive put her and katya in one of our staff apartments he turned to monica perhaps you could do the honors you know where it is of course monica led the way its on the ground floor and not far a couple of minutes later she paused at a door its a big moment alex for both of you for her especially i think because of her age i must get it right for her sake for both your sakes she reached up and kissed him on the cheek and held his hand for a moment you are a remarkable woman he raised her hand and kissed it sean dillon is a very lucky man i think he opened the door and monica glimpsed svetlana on a sofa by the window katya beside her svetlana got to her feet and kurbsky stood there for a moment then svetlana held out her hands and said alexander can it be you i cant believe it after all these years like the bad penny ive turned up again babushka there was a flood of tears and he closed the door a short while later it opened again and katya emerged and closed it he introduced me but its very emotional for svetlana in there lets leave them to it and go and join the others monica said ferguson was in the corner of the bar area talking to dillon and harry billy was sitting with roper and the two women joined them how did it go roper asked floods of tears from svetlana her precious boy back after all these years he even called her babushka i thought that meant grandmother in russian roper said it seems it was his pet name for her when he was very little she is so relieved to see him just cant believe hes got here safely monica glanced at roper who nodded tell her what happened after all you were there when she was finished listening katya looked grave but not particularly shocked its a bloody nose for the gru but alex is what he is god knows he saw enough during the years of war monica said i think theres more to it than that katya moved to ropers side table with the bottles opened the vodka and poured one something else something deep in his soul perhaps blossomed during the wars and wont go away again perhaps monica was uncertain roper reached for his whiskey the pain in his left shoulder and back suddenly intense shes got a point monica take you a class act an academic at a famous and ancient university with doctorates galore and yet when push came to shove you shot that ira bastard dead last year i mean where did that come from he swallowed his whiskey i know im the pot calling the kettle black but one things certain it would be difficult for svetlana to take on board the fact that her beloved nephew has just stiffed three people i think were all agreed on that katya said ill go and see how they are getting on she went out and billy said one smart lady katya well i wouldnt disagree with you roper pushed his glass over and monica poured another scotch is it a bad day monica asked him monica its always a bad day but im alive if not exactly kicking when i should have been in bits and pieces like a lot of the poor sods coming back from afghanistan and iraq these days it occurs to me that in the great scheme of things there might have been a meaning to my survival i didnt know you were religious billy told him im not billy but i believe in reason and purpose the conversation was cut off by the appearance of kurbsky with katya and svetlana on his arm katya said svetlana wants alex to watch my show now so that he knows what we have in mind ive spoken to ferguson and he and dillon and harry have gone ahead to the viewing theater i wouldnt miss it for the world roper said kat ya had tweaked the film a certain amount but it was pretty much the same as she had first shown to svetlana dillon and monica at chamber court she talked it through and when she was finished said lets show it once more i think so that alex really gets the idea there was silence when she finally froze on the final image of what he had become standing there in hospital scrubs very impressive kurbsky said an audacious plan he turned to svetlana what do you think it would be wonderful if it gave you the chance to stay at the house at least for a while so that i could get close again get to know you lets analyze the situation if the gru thinks im in london theyll try and seek me out on the other hand the last thing theyd want to do is advertise the fact of my presence here theyd prefer to kidnap me or kill me in some unobtrusive way all that makes sense ferguson said so i dont think theyll bring in the heavy artillery theyll wait and watch if i become wretched henri duval the walking ghoul dying of lung cancer racked by the effects of chemotherapy the oddjob man living over the garage at the house itll be so different from what they expected to find that eventually theyll just move on of course if it doesnt work and they sniff me out i can always do a runner so youre up for it dillon said the sooner the better to make such a fundamental change in me so quickly will vastly increase our chances of success ferguson was excited thats it then people he turned to katya when do you want to start as soon as possible ive brought my makeup box in the car my hairdressing essentials certain drugs i want him to take i understand you keep a wardrobe of assorted clothing and footwear here as a backup for your operations we certainly do and anything extra that you need we can get excellent she kissed svetlana on the cheeks go now love back to the apartment billy will take you hell make sure you get anything you need gold room service billy said gave her his arm and took her to the door she stopped him and turned looking at kurbsky im afraid alexander that in finding you again i will lose you he blew her a kiss you will never lose me again babushka i swear it they left katya said right the stuff from my car and you monica she nodded yes you can assist me it will be good to have you there she turned to ferguson but no one else this must be understood she turned and walked out with kurbsky and monica following london the wardrobe area at holland park was rather theatrical when you considered it filled with walkin wardrobes containing a wide selection of clothes even uniforms there was a screen high up in the corner and when katya switched it on it showed the final image she had frozen on the viewing theater set the lostlooking hopeless creature in hospital scrubs she made kurbsky undress and put on cotton pajama trousers and he sat facing the mirrors the hair wild the beard tangled you look like sir francis drake getting ready to sail out against the spanish armada doesnt he monica is that so kurbsky said romantic tosh shut up and take these she opened a box and shook out two large pills he examined them what are they you dont need to know she poured a glass of tap water you will take two each day you will notice a darkening under the eyes which will look like bruising this will help in the illusion that you are on chemotherapy they work very quickly how do you know this im in theater its my business to know he shrugged and washed the pills down now what a sheet about his shoulders monica she turned to a selection of scissors so now i shall be delilah and you samson i think the beard first she was very expert and quickly reduced the beard to the point where she was able to go to work with an electric razor the clear chin and mouth really made a difference to the appearance then she started hacking the long hair off in handfuls he made no complaint even when she obviously hurt him and finally it was reduced to a stubble now she spread foam over the skull massaging it into the face also and went to work with the electric razor again finally she produced a cutthroat razor good god not that as well its necessary believe me and she was right it had changed his appearance totally the skull the cheekbones well pronounced over hollow cheeks she applied some sort of cream massaging it under the eyes and into the scalp its making things darker already in a little while it will be even darker but the drug is more permanent in that way it helps with the haunted look she turned to monica what do you think i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it myself its just not the same person and we havent even started on dress lets see what weve got th e wardrobes were as big as small rooms and the three of them explored what am i supposed to look like a street person someone on welfare a struggling student in all these personas there is a constant youre on chemotherapy and you have lung cancer roper has inserted you into the royal marsden hospital s cancer records if anyone checks youre there he did the same at london university where you took an english degree youve worked for the daily express and the mail it says so in their records born in torquay in devon to a french doctor and an english mother you lived in paris for ten years then your father was killed in a car accidentagain thats all a matter of recordand your mother and you returned to england you understandably have a tendency to a french accent whats happened to her breast cancer four years ago i feel as if i should take it personally he started working his way through clothing he finally settled on a drabolivegreen tshirt and pulled it on next he discovered some baggy olivegreen trousers with big patch pockets ah the military look monica said katya said not really the kind of people im talking about wear stuff like this all the time its extremely cheap the sort of thing you can pick up in surplus shops he found a pair of french paratrooper boots next which fitted well and a large threequarterlength combat jacket of some sort once again with capacious pockets i may not have much but even on the street ill need a bag of some sort katya rummaging on a high shelf had the answer also olive green it was a good size and had grab handles or a crossbody strap if preferred she passed it to him and he examined it the interior base had an inside zip providing in effect a secret compartment this will do me change of underwear extra tshirt socks katya said now youre spoiling me he slung the bag by the body strap across his chest and worked his way along the shelves he found a black woolen hat and pulled it over his skull will i do he asked monica i suppose so if you want a job on a building site he continued to search found a reasonable pair of leather gloves and put them in the bag his back was turned and as he rummaged further he found a couple of black knitted ski masks staring up at him with empty eyes and wide mouths he hesitated then stuffed them in the bag too along with a couple of british army field service wound packs from a stack he found on the shelf katya said is that it i think so he walked out into the bathroom and looked at the stranger in the mirror standing there in drab olive green the bag hanging at his left side you were right about the haunted look he took the woolen hat from the bag and pulled it on god in heaven i look worse walk slowly take your time speak in a low sort of measured way you dont smile because you cant smile i get the point im permanently weary youve got it exactly monica said i must say you dont look like you at all youve done a fabulous job katya lets go and show the others katya and monica found svetlana in the safehouse apartment where katya had left her whats happening my dear svetlana asked general ferguson and the others are meeting hed like us to join them and what about alexander hell be there she gave svetlana her arm and they went out monica following when they went down the corridor the doors of the viewing theater were open and kurbsky was standing there in all his glory he stared at them then pulled off his woolen hat and scratched his head svetlana barely looked at him and said where are we going where is alexander the computer room katya said they carried on and kurbsky called no he isnt you made your point im here babushka they paused and turned svetlana gazed at him puzzled im here he said again and opened his arms she screamed and cowered against katya what is he saying where is alexander she really was terribly upset and the others came running from the computer room ferguson calling what the hell is going on they stopped dead all staring and then roper arrived in his wheelchair my god id never have believed it and neither can she katya hugged her tight it is alexander my darling its just that ive changed him its me babushka he reached to kiss her on the forehead it really is me can you change back not for the moment she shuddered such a fright i need a drink ive never been so shocked in my life ferguson gave her his arm coming right up well all go to the bar and celebrate celebrate what well if you cant recognize him its doubtful anyone else will sitting there in the corner all together katya said ive got another idea could be rather clever not far from us in belsize park is an oldfashioned corner shop we buy many things there when marek worked for us he often shopped there what are you getting at kurbsky asked i think you should turn up there in the morning youre trying to find our house but youre not sure where it is youll have a letter with youwhich ill write before we leave it will be an offer of employment to you saying that marek recommended you to us itll also say that we are aware of your medical condition and will allow you to come and go according to the requirements of your treatment i get the point dillon said if anyone makes inquiries at the local shop about duval theyll get an acceptable answer ill go and type the letter nowif i may use your office general monica said so youll stay here tonight move into chamber court tomorrow thats the general idea dillon said take it easy take time to settle in i intend to look sean i was a paratrooper then special forces and a final year with gru military intelligence monica said a license to murder and just like you the rules were no rules i read moscow nights dillon put in and it occurred to me it wasnt art imitating life but probably the other way round very astute of you katya returned with an envelope thanks he said ill see you tomorrow he gave svetlana a hug let katya take you home babushka youll get too tired she kissed him and patted his cheek be a good boy they went and dillon said to monica ill run you home you havent had a chance to freshen up well see you again alex monica kissed him on the cheek stay cool she said and went out with dillon the salters followed pausing on the way and harry said listen if you want to look in at our pub the dark man just give us a bell were at wapping cable wharf billy cut in it would be like testing the water thats a thought ill see they went and he looked in at the computer room where ferguson and roper were talking ferguson said ive got to go ive got a meeting at the ministry of defence ropers in charge now hes your control officer anything you need hell supply take tomorrow as it comes and well talk again suddenly it was quiet just he and roper a quiet buzz to things roper poured a whiskey i drink a lot the bomb that didnt succeed in killing me left a great many of its fragments in my system they hurt sometimes intolerably the cigarettes help and so does whiskey in large quantities no wild wild women though thats a shame do you have any special requirements money weapons all i have is a knife i had a walther but after i dealt with ivanov i tossed it away as the train was passing a convenient river it seemed the smart thing to do a lie of course for the walther was already in the secret compartment in his bag no problem ive got a credit card for henri duval here in this drawer you can draw cash from any banks holeinthewall for as much as one thousand pounds a day thats very generous of you weapons for our people are standard a silenced walther and a colt for ankle use anticipating your request i had sergeant doyle draw them for you theres also a bulletproof vest everything is in the drawer here together with five hundred pounds to get you started help yourself kurbsky did unzipped the false bottom of his bag and placed them inside putting forty pounds into one of his pockets he said dont you get bored just sitting there and watching computer screens all the time you couldnt be more wrong i roam the world to steal peoples secrets theres always something for instance see this a report from french railway police in brittany to headquarters in paris it appears that a badly damaged body has been discovered at the side of a track on the direct line to brest his papers indicate he was a russian named turgin that would be ivanov i assume yes the gru directs that all operatives operating on foreign soil use false papers which will make any investigation by the french police difficult roper said as i say its amazing what these screens can disgorge his fingers danced over the keys alexander kurbsky for example the screen filled before their eyes a current photo the wild one that went on the back of books and early small photoshis mother his father in kgb uniform and tania her seventeenyearold face frozen in time with a line that read deceased march kurbsky felt a kind of surge in his chest and banged his fist on the counter no not that if you dont mind roper switched it off at once im damn sorry it must be hard for you remembering the circumstances that my father used her death as a weapon to get me back an old story kurbsky got up look i didnt sleep at all last night can i go and find a bed use the apartment your aunt was in ill see you this evening at the embassy colonel boris luzhkov looked up at the knock on the door and it opened as bounine looked in come and sit down luzhkov said heres something you should know french police have discovered a body in brittany bearing false papers in the name of turgin and so it was by the rail track turgin is ivanov so kurbsky killed ivanov whats moscow doing about it putting out a story of rogue elements in the military deserters it will be embellished when the other two bodies turn up as they surely will false papers of course a chambermaid who serviced their rooms a ukrainian named olga soran has already been visited by our people in paris and sent home on the first plane available so what happens now are you going to try and speak to kurbsky i think well leave him to settle in theyve undoubtedly taken him to ferguson s headquarters in holland park thats where they will debrief him and then what who knows they could keep him there in complete comfort and privacy for as long as they like but he wont want that a man like kurbsky hell get too restless i agree we must wait for kurbsky to contact us charles ferguson is an extremely clever man bounine kurbsky is a problem to which a solution must be found there wont be a quick one so we wait but this doesnt mean a holiday for you my friend this is your first posting here so use your time wisely take oleg as your driver he knows the city hes been here two years get him to show you the sights as it were youre major bounine now use your authority thank you colonel ill do that bounine turned and withdrew it was just after six when kurbsky returned to the computer room roper sat there alone music playing softly cole porter kurbsky said you like that kind of music its a comfort roper told him how do you feel the sleep did me good roper reached for the whiskey a drink not at the moment the salters invited me to call in at their pub this dark man on cable wharf the first joint harry owned hes got millions in property now so you fancy spreading your wings billy said it would be like testing the water he could be right past the tower of london wapping high street down to the river i remember wapping well those two years i spent with svetlana at the university i got to know the city backwards seventeen to nineteen is exactly the right age for that and already im remembering it all tell me about this place were in now local people think were some sort of sanitarium of course people in the business like boris luzhkov know very well who we are but were protected by all sorts of securitydouble blinds secret exits and entrances the works so i could simply walk out if you want to two hundred yards past holland park to the main road plenty of cabs cruising and the worlds your oyster and it would be all right not for alexander kurbsky but okay for henri duval if you want to test the water my friend do it he lit a cigarette what is it you want youve jumped over the wall youre free am i really kurbsky shook his head in personal terms i look on myself as the invisible man because no one sees the real me i could write about that and what its like thats certainly an interesting thought i would think it would make an extraordinary book but first i must experience it kurbsky stood picked up his bag and slipped the carrying strap over his head so that the bag was on his right thigh ill tell you later you surely will im part of the furniture the judas gate opens automatically when you approach because ive punched you into the system which it did he stepped through and found himself on a quiet street most of the properties victorian some walled others in sizable gardens it was dark now streetlamps glowing lots of parked cars everything perfectly normal the main road was extremely busy he stood at the edge of the pavement and flagged down a black cab and told the driver to take him to wapping high street he sat there looking out at the busy streets the evening traffic the buzz of what was still the greatest city in the world remembering so much from his youth he was aware of the driver glancing at him in the mirror occasionally and decided to say something trying for just a hint of a french accent you know the dark man on cable wharf at wapping i certainly do the driver was obviously a cockney just drop me off at the high street end i want to go to a shop there fine by me watch it walking down to the dark man its a great pub but some of the streets leading down there are a problem bloody kids and their knives the worlds gone mad its all the drugs i reckon i wouldnt argue with that the cabbies eyes flickered over him again are you okay mate you dont look too well kurbsky decided to go all the way chemotherapy it takes its toll cancer christ mate im sorry it must be bloody rough he obviously felt subdued and said nothing more all the way to the tower of london and farther into wapping high street he finally pulled in at the sidewalk under a streetlamp and kurbsky alighted and leaned down to pay him the driver gave him his change take care mate he drove away hurriedly and kurbsky turned and discovered a dress shop mannequins in the window there was also his reflection in a mirror looking like a ghoul my god alex where did you go he said softly walked a few yards and came to a lane with the sign that read cable wharf above it it was dark and somehow sinister the streetlamps of the old london gaslight pattern some broken he didnt feel the slightest fear though for one thing he had the bonehandled gutting knife inside his right boot he started to walk down it had obviously been an area of thriving warehouses in its day but most of them were decaying now and boarded up waiting for the developers he walked along the center of the street carefully aware of voices up ahead and some sort of fire as he got closer he saw what it was an old trash can with rubbish of some kind burning away in a courtyard behind a broken wall two youths drinking from bottles were standing beside the fire taking turns to kick an old ragged tramp who lay whimpering on the ground there was an old woman in a beret and a layer of coats a bag on the ground its contents spilled she was very drunk and crying stop it youll kill him the youths were laughing and the tallest one shoved her away piss off you old cow he turned and kicked the man in the head again kurbsky stood and watched the youth said what the fuck are you looking at shes got a point kurbsky said and unzipped the false bottom of his bag there were two walthers in there and the one that had killed the gru men on the train had some surgical tape hed found in the bathroom around the butt the youth reached in his anorak produced a flick knife and sprang the blade my friends got one too he said as his companion produced a similar weapon lets see what youve got in the bag my pleasure kurbsky took out the walther from the train and hit him across the side of the head the youth dropped his weapon with a cry of pain and fell on one knee his friend backed away and kurbsky picked up the knife closed the blade and put it in his pocket this is a walther ppk the real thing not an imitation it has a fantastic stopping power he fired at a tin can among the rubbish there was a dull thud and the can jumped in the air imagine what that could do to your knee now go away very fast the undamaged one said come on for christs sake he means it he darted away up toward the high street while the woman was piling her belongings into her bag and the old man was getting to his feet the youth kurbsky had injured had fallen to his knee again and the old couple moved past him surprisingly fast he came up slowly a brick in his hand you bastard ill smash your skull kurbskys hand swung up he fired and the lower half of the youths left ear disintegrated he screamed and plucked at his ear blood oozing between his fingers he fell back against the wall kurbsky said you never learn people like you now clear off and find a hospital he walked away swallowed by darkness the youth cried you fucking bastard then turned and stumbled away kurbsky came out of the darkness and walked along cable wharf on his left was the panorama of london on the other side lights gleaming everywhere the sound of distant traffic a pleasure boat sailing by all lit up he came to a multistoried development of what looked like exclusive apartments but the dark man standing beside it was a typical river pub that obviously dated from victorian times there was a car park and beyond several boats moored at the jetty he went to the entrance paused then went inside it wasnt particularly crowded the bar was very victorian mirrors lots of mahogany and marble the beer pumps were porcelain the salters were sitting in a corner booth two hardlooking men leaning against the wall behind listening to the conversation as he discovered later they were joe baxter and sam hall harry salters minders nobody noticed him and he hesitated and turned to the bar where an attractive blonde was serving she looked curiously at him as did two or three customers standing enjoying a drink together whats your pleasure love she asked vodka if you please madame tonic no as it comes she put the glass before him and he took off his woolen hat she winced perceptibly are you all right love absolutely he took the vodka straight down billy appeared henri my old friend wed just about given you up youve met our ruby mrs moon shes captain of the ship keeps us all in order henri duval ruby she seemed uncertain and kurbsky said you have been very kind madame billy whisked him away and she watched as harry greeted him and baxter and hall were introduced and then billy returned another large vodka for him and a scotch for harry is he all right she said or does he have what i think he has answering your first question he gets by and yes he has lung cancer hes on chemotherapy at the marsden so hes french billy proceeded to give her henri duvals background which included his lack of relatives he normally lives in torquay but he needed to be in london for the treatment his mother was a cousin of harrys i see i feel so sorry for him well youve got a good heart ruby we all know that she took the drinks across and said to kurbsky im so pleased to meet you billys been telling me all about you when you feel like something to eat let me know steakandale pie tonight sounds marvelous kurbsky told her well all have a go at that harry said ruby nodded and went away and baxter and hall drifted to the other end of the bar and joined two men drinking there harry nodded at the vodka should you be drinking that in your condition ive checked it out it varies with people he took it down russian style i suppose it reminds me that theres still a real me lurking around inside i take your point billy said hows it going so far so good i walked down from the safe house hailed a cab dropped off in wapping high street and walked down here harry asked youve got to watch that harry told him what with all those streets empty and waiting for the developers you get some funny people hanging around not that i noticed kurbsky said anyway it does seem to be working billy asked so it seems take ruby she was troubled i had a cabdriver who asked me if i was okay he said i didnt look too well yes well he was sorry for you kurbsky didnt even smile im not used to that but katya zorin would be pleased its all working out exactly as she had hoped and wheres it all going to end thats what id like to know billy said kurbsky shrugged dont ask me im just passing through ruby waved from behind the bar and harry said thats enough for now lets have you in the back parlor for a big slice of rubys steakandale pie youll love it believe me around ten kurbsky decided hed had enough and said hed order a taxi back to holland park but billy wouldnt hear of it and insisted on taking him in his scarlet alfa romeo its no hardshipi like driving by night particularly after midnight i find it calming locked in tight in your very own world and rain kurbsky said theres something special about that the windscreen wipers clicking back and forth its hypnotic billy said suddenly when i finished on the death of men i felt such a sense of loss i started again at the beginning straightaway im flattered its the truth i may be a gangster but one day years ago i was in some waiting room when i found a paperback about famous philosophers it bowled me over i loved that stuff then dillon came into our lives spouting the same ideas dillon was that important to you harry me and the boys were handling a hot package from amsterdam on one of my uncles riverboats diamonds from amsterdam there was a police sting wed have gone down the steps for ten years only dillon diverted the package what happened then he worked for ferguson and drew us in weve never looked back to be honest harrys made millions out of development so who needs to rob banks something like that they drew up at holland park are you coming in kurbsky asked just give roper my love and good luck tomorrow kurbsky got out watched the alfa romeo drive away it was quiet and he turned and walked to the judas in the main gate was about to speak into the voice box when the judas swung open he stepped inside walked forward and it closed behind him roper was seated in his usual spot gazing at the screens he turned did you have a good night tell me about it which kurbsky did sitting down and helping himself to another vodka there is one thing he said people do look at me because im unusual or because they recognize you for what you are an outpatient on chemotherapy which means cancer most people know that if only because its a staple of medical soaps on television they feel sorry for you or uncomfortable there were fifty or sixty customers in the bar just before i left and ive got the feeling a number of them were happy to see me go i know what you mean its like people not wanting some soldier whos lost a leg in afghanistan swimming in the local pool human nature kurbsky said glancing up just a moment whats that a latenight news program it said something about shadid basayev or maybe i was wrong you werent general shadid basayev a chechen general hes been granted asylum it was on about an hour ago i recorded the program because there was an end piece i needed on al qaeda hold on ill rewind here we go there was some footage from the first chechen war the general in a tank then inspecting men at some hill station a burly man with a brutal hard face and the cheekbones of some mongol warrior his uniform was understated the cap crumpled the military shirt of a common soldier a worn leather coat boots as he walked along the front rank men turned their faces toward him thats a nice touch roper said yes nazi style he introduced it to his men did you know him and alexander kurbsky who had known him very well indeed said everybody in the russian army in chechnya knew the bastard the television program said basayev had applied for and been granted political asylum after fleeing the russian federation and living for a while in monaco political pressure aimed at his extraction had forced him to move to london where similar pressure from russia had proved futile judges of the high court having accepted that to return him would most certainly put his life in danger so asylum granted kurbsky said it seems that while he was in charge of certain affairs in chechnya oil revenues or something like that he succeeded in transferring millions into the city of london roper shook his head he has it all its been crawling through a court for nine months but hes finally made it what happened to the war crimes charges kurbsky asked although he knew very well what had happened witnesses disappeared intimidation nothing came of it i like this bit they were interviewing basayev in his house in mayfair and he was speaking of going to evening mass every sunday they even showed the church it was roman catholicst mary and all the angels basayev was a christian not a muslim kurbsky remembered that remembered it well he had a memorial to his wife in the churchyard and visited it on a daily basis in the morning many chechens are christian roper said but surely theyd have been russian orthodox or something like that lets look at his details roper tapped the keys and the facts came up what do you know he was a muslim did a law degree in rome in his early twenties and changed religion to marry a rosa rossi a fellow student that explains the roman catholicism involved in politics for years in chechnya no children there was a bomb attack on his car in grozny in unfortunately hed been delayed and it was his wife who was traveling he blamed the kgb very publicly he would but then it probably was them kurbsky said the show switched back to the church of st mary and all the angels it was of latevictorian vintage because that was when roman catholics had been allowed to build again in england it wasnt very pretty and there was a clock tower a limousine drew up and basayev got out and his driver gave him flowers the camera showed the time on the clock tower as ten then it cut to the cemetery basayev appeared and paused at a memorial stone with a photo inset which he kissed before changing the flowers youd think hed paid to be able to look that good said kurbsky oh the bbc let him have his interview but their documentary on his activities in chechnya totally condemns him which wont bother him in the slightest the truly wicked do seem to survive rather well in this life but i suppose thats the way of the world im going to bed ill see you in the morning and then its off to chamber court and the ladies he lay on the bed thinking about it the hell of grozny the chechen capital of general shadid basayev and what had happened a long long time ago chechnya grozny the chechen capital resembled hell on earth and in spite of constant rain there were fires everywhere heavy tanks had thrown everything they had at the place and the aerial bombardment had been constant and yet the chechens stubbornly resisted street by street house by house urban guerrilla warfare at its most intense alexander kurbsky a lieutenant by rank was the only officer left in what had two weeks earlier been the fifth paratroop assault platoon a special forces unit consisting of fifty men now they had been reduced to eighteen men having spearheaded their way into the heart of the city using on occasion the sewage system and in those filthy and foulsmelling tunnels they had found an enemy that fought like rats they finally emerged via manholes in the central square a wilderness of halfstanding buildings and fires smoking in the heavy rain and found themselves facing what was left of the astoria hotel yuri bounine sprawled close to kurbsky bounine was an unlikelylooking paratrooper with his chubby face and steel armyissue spectacles fastened together with tape his bulky combat uniform was filthy but then so was everyone elses his rank of sergeant was temporary because kurbsky and he had become friends and kurbsky trusted him for his brains as much as for anything else are we going then a man named nebit called someone who didnt take kindly to discipline and resented kurbsky anyway because of his youth we might get a cup of coffee in there keep your head down kurbsky told him but nebit was already standing up and two men next to him followed a burst of fire blew away his combat beret fragmented the back of his skull and hurled him over a pile of bricks a machine pistol had obviously caused the damage knocking down the other two also instant death for there wasnt a sound from them so now we are fifteen kurbsky said bounine nodded so what do we do kurbsky raised his voice follow me back to the sewer well see where it comes out a little closer to the hotel slowly and with care and covering each other nebit was stupid so he paid the price he led disappearing down into the tunnel and proceeding half bent over checking the outfalls to left and right there was water running a couple of feet deep a mixture of brown sludge in it that didnt bear thinking about he came to a kind of concrete chamber a notice saying astoria hotel and paused and the others closed up ill goyou cover me yuri he went up cautiously found a steel door depressed the handle and pushed finding himself in a room containing the central heating system he went to the end door opened it cautiously and found what must have been the kitchen staffs working quarters white chefs uniforms hanging from pegs toilets and a row of open showers there was a door marked kitchen the others cried excitedly great there must be food and kurbsky turned saying no wait he was too late four crowded through and as he got to the door there was heavy firing a cry of agony two of the men blown back shot several times he scrambled over them to the shelter of a steel food bench keeping low as sustained firing continued found a grenade at his belt pulled the pin and tossed it over to the other side of the kitchen there was a cry that was more like a scream and he jumped up and fired a burst from his ak at the wide doorway opposite he moved forward cautiously over the bodies of his men and found what he was looking for a chechen soldier uniform soaked in blood trying to breathe and nothing but a death rattle there a steel helmet had come off and very slowly the head turned hair cropped eyes staring at him mutely bounine came up behind him christ a girl i hate that are you going to finish her off kurbsky took her hand and spoke to her gently she smiled then her eyes closed and her head lolled to one side what did you say to her i said go in peace in case she was a muslim he turned to the others thirteen of us now so just follow me he went straight out into a large restaurant walked through the tables into the foyer of the hotel leading to the main doors all was still and on one side was the entrance to what had once been one of the most luxurious bars in grozny someone said my god look at all that booze there was a surge and kurbsky fired a short burst into the ceiling everyone turned he said not yet you bastards stink and i stink because weve been in the shit for weeks so follow me right now he led the way through the kitchens to the staff quarters stepped in the first walkin shower exactly as he was in combat uniform and clutching an ak he switched it on full come on in the waters fine they stared at him in astonishment and bounine was next a bloody marvelous idea he stepped under the next one the rest of the men followed boisterously like schoolboys after football and the filth and the stench of the sewers washed away in dark brown rivulets later in the bar lounge they rested eating a whole range of canned foods from the kitchens discovering that the electricity worked in parts of the hotel and that there were lights in the bar not that we could use those bounine said it would attract everyone in the city kurbsky had informed command of their whereabouts and had been promised fresh orders which hadnt come he and bounine had been working their way through a bottle of champagne and he was just refilling the glass when there was a sound of vehicles outside kirov whod been left on guard duty at the door ran in theyre ours lieutenant somebody important i think which it was about a dozen men appeared flooding into the foyer excited at the riches the bar disclosed started forward and came to a halt reacting at once to shouted commands a moment later general chelek the area commander walked through the crowd there was little to distinguish him from his men he was just as unshaven his uniform just as filthy kurbsky and his men stood up he came forward and took the bottle of champagne from kurbskys hand and looked at the label very nice you lads are doing all right who are you he took the glass from kurbskys hand and it was filled fifth paratroop assault platoon the black tigers isnt that what they call you i thought there were fifty in your unit what you see is what you get general thirteen unlucky for some they say which means you need us for something rotten chelek went behind the bar and grabbed a bottle of vodka he glanced at his men who stood waiting okay pitch in which they did he sat at the end of the bar with kurbsky who are you alexander kurbsky comrade im the only officer left your name is not unknown to me yes ive got something pretty heavy for you one of our most implacable foes in the grozny area has been general shadid basayev youve heard of him of course bounine who had been standing close said he went to rome to university general studied law hes a muslim who married an italian woman and became a catholic chelek shrugged men will do strange things where a woman is concerned even a man like shadid basayev you seem wellinformed sergeant he was once a lawyer kurbsky explained at rome university bounine said the kgb put a bomb in basayevs car before the war here in grozny his wife was using the car not him and he has never forgiven us thats why he kills russians with such venom im aware of that basayev has withdrawn into the mountains for a while my intelligence sources say he is at the monastery of kuba thats about sixty miles from here its at the head of a valleytheres a plateau perhaps five miles away our informant is a father ramsan a priest he contacts us by radio says basayev only has twenty men with him so what are you suggesting comrade kurbsky asked that we put together a hunting party and go after him we wouldnt last an hour out there every peasant every shepherd on a crag are his eyes and ears youre absolutely right but im not suggesting you go out by road by chance at the grozny military supply airstrip there is a dakota transport plane very old but very reliable or so im informed it could have you over the kuba plateau in no more than an hour one way or the other there was a heavy silence bounine said you mean the dakota would land on the plateau of course not i mean you would jump you idiot you are paratroopers are you not you have jumped into action yes i have comrade bounine told him and five of my comrades but i havent kurbsky said and neither have six of my men the demands for the war in the last year in afghanistan meant that a lot of paratroopers didnt get jump training well thats just too bad chelek said calmly my experts on staff say a pass over that plateau at four hundred feet will have you on the ground in a matter of seconds the chutes are available they rig an anchor line in the plane you clip your static line on it and you jump out its all automatic you are the black tigers are you not and an elite unit of course comrade kurbsky said when would we go tomorrow sometime ill arrange for a truck to pick you up from here during the next couple of hours or so ill see you at the airfield tomorrow he called to his men and walked out and they followed the tigers were muttering among themselves and young kirov came forward is it true this business comrade something about parachuting out of a plane we couldnt hear it all ive never had parachute training and neither have others here and neither have i kurbsky told him but in case you hadnt noticed this is the russian army so if general chelek tells you to jump out of a plane you do it even if you dont have a parachute sergeant bounines the expert you take over yuri he sat in the corner thinking about it fiddled in his right paratroopers boot and found his favorite knife in a secret pocket it was very old carved like a madonna in some kind of bone and at the press of a button a blade jumped out razor sharp a gutting knife used by some caspian fishermen way back in the past he checked that it was working to perfection aware of the talk among the men the anger then closed the knife and sheathed it again in its secret place bounine came went behind the bar got a bottle of vodka and came back with two glasses you might as well get drunk while were waiting for the truck he announced itll help when you have to think that tomorrow at some time or other youre going to be jumping from that dakota he gave kurbsky a glass vodka lieutenant what would i do without you kurbsky said the airstrip was on a section of highway just outside the city normal road traffic diverted elsewhere a tented town had sprung up mixed in with prefabricated buildings on what had originally been farmland planes were coming in and out all the time mainly transport everything was makeshift even what passed as air traffic control the pilot was an old hand named bashir a contract man brought in for the war hed flown in afghanistan old dakotas bought from various asian sources workhorses that could fly anywhere hed dropped paratroopers during his time in afghanistan before helicopters became such an important part of that illfated campaign however he knew his stuff and had an anchor line rigged before kurbsky and his men arrived he was squat and aging and badly in need of a shave theres nothing to it you strap on the parachute clip your static line to the anchor cable and jump one after the other youre on the ground before you know it have you ever jumped kirov demanded that isnt the point bounine intervened this is a waste of time you wear a helmet and your usual uniform and help each other to strap on the parachutes youll pack a canvas bag containing weapons and explosives with a hanging strap clipped to your belt it lands below you and thumps the ground letting you know youre about to land very useful in the dark only you wont be going in the darkthere will be some light just a little kirov said and when does this happen kurbsky asked well according to my orders about fourthirty in the morning youll certainly be there by fivethirty tomorrow morning bounine asked those are my orders now i suggest we rig one of the men in all his gear equipment bag the lot and have a demonstration he turned to kurbsky is that okay lieutenant everybody had heard bounine turned to kurbsky and said to those of you who have never jumped before i would say this in the last war all fliers in the air force carried a parachute in case their plane was shot down but they didnt practice beforehand they were just thankful it was there why doesnt that comfort me in the slightest kurbsky asked but they went through everything several times to make sure everyone got the idea each grab bag contained a stechkin pistol an ak with folding stock fragmentation grenades plastic explosive and pencil timers and a field service medical kit including morphine ampules they rested nervously in one of the tents and it rained and the tent leaked but outside the war went on planes of various types landing and taking off and way in the distance there was the thump of artillery and fires in the city its biblical bounine had brought a bottle of vodka from the hotel in his knapsack and sat drinking from the bottle occasionally gazing out through the darkness to the flames of the city death on a pale horse destruction everywhere what in the hell are you talking about kurbsky demanded oh humankind bounine said glumly thousands of years of civilization and we only succeed in butchering each other yes well thats the way it is nothing changes so im going to go and get my orders from chelek and youd better come with me so put the bottle back in your knapsack they found him in one of the prefabricated buildings that housed the command post which seemed full of radio equipment and staff a request to see him produced a suggestion that they take a seat they were still there an hour later kurbsky approached the desk again the young aide looked up inquiringly but at that moment general chelek emerged from his office and dropped a file on the desk so there you are he said to kurbsky ive been waiting i want to get this show on the road ive brought my sergeant comrade general ive no objection they went in and he sat behind his desk youve sorted the parachuting out yes comrade excellent this is a very simple operation and thats the way i like things the monastery at kuba has been taken over by basayev the monks all kicked out hes there now with twenty men i want you to wipe them out youre absolutely sure they are there kurbsky asked father ramsan has always proved reliable in the past he was allowed to move into a farm about a mile from the monastery when basayev took over he tells me of an old tunnel long disused which gives access to the monastery he will act as your guide he put a knapsack on his desk theres a radio in there and all the instructions you need to contact ramsan kurbsky glanced at bounine sergeant bounine took the radio chelek said ive had a look at your record kurbskyits remarkable for one so young decorated twice in afghanistan he smiled i envy you your inevitable success well try not to disappoint you comrade they went pausing only at the entrance as the rain increased heavily ive often thought about this war and asked myself why any sane person would want this place bounine said its a game my friend kurbsky told him people like chelek move the pieces to suit themselvesits their particular vanity and the pieces are the people like us who do their bidding bounine said i told youits biblical idiot kurbsky said but lets get on with it maybe there could be a medal in it for you but ive got a medal bounine said plaintively and followed him as kurbsky ran out through the rain and back toward the tent and the others so in the darkness at fourthirty they sat in a line on a bench seat in the dakota the anchor cable above them each man fully kitted out bounine as the most experienced seated close to the door kurbsky at the other end of the line had his radio at the ready and the engines were already throbbing bashir said right lieutenant here we go the dakota started to move the roaring of the engines filled the plane and then they were lifting and speeding away at low level to get away from grozny as quickly as possible the rain continued hammering the aircraft the wind howled but bashir held her steady flying at four thousand feet the mountains shrouded in cloud below when he finally started his descent they went into a kind of mist and then burst out of it and there was visibility a gray predawn light infused with a kind of luminosity that covered the mountains he was very low now drifting through a wide canyon at a thousand feet and spoke to bounine over the radio door open sergeant a red light blinked on and off bounine called clip on and stand they all did as they were told the dakota was at five hundred and there was much more light now in the flat expanse of the kuba plateau bashir made his pass at three hundred fifty feet the red light turning to green and bounine tapped kirov the first in line on the shoulder and yelled go which the boy did followed by the others tumbling out one after the other kurbsky last bounine yelled on his radio all gone clipped onto the anchor cable and dived out bashir started to climb up to four thousand leveled out and switched to automatic pilot got up went back and closed the door he returned took control again to ten thousand leveled out and turned back to grozny well ill never see any of that lot again he murmured madness bloody crazy kurbsky looking down could see the rough moorland of the plateau below outcrops of rock here and there and it was all over in what seemed a flash his supply bag thumping into the ground followed by himself he seemed to bounce and fell sideways and a stiff wind billowed his canopy he started to drag grabbed at his quickrelease buckle and it opened and the wind in the parachute pulled it off him and blew it across the moor he unclipped his jump bag got it open and armed himself quicklythe stechkin stuffed in his shirt the bag slung from his back with the ak still folded he started searching for the others which was easy enough for he could see them dotted around struggling with their canopies in the wind he dumped his helmet and put on his beret bounine was free and helping those who were having difficulties working his way from chute to chute he reached one on the far left and leaned down he turned and beckoned kurbsky hurried toward him others following and found him standing over petrovsky dead already broken neck bounine shook his head ridiculous he jumped in afghanistan a number of times with the storm guards now he has to get it in a shitty place like this he looked around the bleak moorland the rain hammering down kurbsky said put him behind those rocks over there collect those parachutes and hide them as best you can behind the outcrop fifteen minutes and get your ponchos out he looked up at the turbulent sky as thunder rumbled its really going to storm my friends he got the radio from his pack crouched down and tried to contact father ramsan black tiger calling black tiger calling are you receiving me it was rather dramatic but thats what chelek had given as a code word to the enterprise and it received an instant response receiving you loud and clear ramsan this is lieutenant kurbsky weve arrived in the jump zone safely one man dead harsh weather up here but we should see you in a couple of hours i look forward to it over and out he turned to the men lets get on with it and rain it did and he really pushed them leading at the halftrot the twelve of them in their ponchos with the hoods up over their berets five miles and two hours later they came to moorland farm territory extensive rough granite walls wildlooking sheep beyond that scattered before them they reached a stone shepherds hut and crouched behind the wall beside it bounine produced a bottle of vodka from his pack unscrewed it and took a swallow offered it to kurbsky who did the same then passed it along so that everybody could have a pull perhaps a mile or more across the valley was the monastery half concealed by the gloom and rain at that distance it was not possible to see any signs of activity in any case what concerned him was the farm below it was singlestory but reasonably extensive with what looked like a large barn at one end and the only sign of life was chickens looking miserable in the rain pecking their way in and out of the halfopen barn door there was a low wall around the property a wisp of smoke coming out of the chimney a track stretched down the valley and no sign of life there either we split two groups of six you go in from the left he said to bounine ill take the right they moved fast kurbsky leading his men crouching behind a granite wall and curving around to an orchard cramped in a small space at the side of the house there was what looked like a back door it opened on the turn of the handle and he led the way into an extensive if primitive kitchen with stone floor very basic wooden furniture an old iron stove with a wood fire burning inside a great pot on the stove kirov took the lid off smells good some sort of stew and enough to feed an army maybe its meant for us that could well be kurbsky turned to the others whod been searching elsewhere anything a couple of bedrooms a pantry with a lot of canned food and wine one of them said he went and opened the front door and saw the other group through the halfopen door of the barn bounine appeared come and have a look there was an old battered truck with a canvas hood and a stack of military jerry cans a hell of a lot of petrol here bounine said what about the house the tigers clustered around passing cigarettes food cooking fire in the stove no sign of father ramsan ill try the radio again and at that moment there was the sound of an approaching engine they waited weapons cocked and a bearded priest in his black robes drove in from the track on a motorcycle crossed the yard and entered the barn he showed no surprise at all and wore black trousers his cassock hitched up as he sat astride the bike he switched off the engine dismounted and pulled it up on its stand so you are the black tigers yes father im lieutenant kurbsky in command kirov was examining the bike with admiration where did you get this my uncle has one back home on his sheep ranch near kursk a montessa dirt bike whats so special about them bounine asked it was father ramsan who answered they were specially developed for shepherds in the pyrenees in the spanish high country you can ride them at five miles or more if you want negotiating very rough country or much faster they are perfect for the plateau country here general basayev obtained it for me that would seem very generous of him kurbsky said of course but then im on his payroll and he trusts me and so does general chelek bounine pointed out we live in a complicated world my friend ramsan turned to kurbsky bring your men in the house i have food waiting they at e well of the stew and he provided jugs of rough red wine so no one lives here with you kurbsky asked a peasant family farmed the land but theyve been driven off basayev doesnt like people around when hes in residence at the monastery he chased the monks away but only tolerates the peasants when hes off to the war since hes back they have to clear out to a village about five miles on the other side of kuba so no staff in the monastery hes a soldiers soldier and expects his men to be able to look after themselves sometimes they go and procure women for obvious purposes are there any women at the moment definitely not when he comes on these occasions his time seems to be spent on planning strategy he has a sophisticated radio room and keeps in touch daily with his forces in the fields i have heard them on occasion when ive been there so why does he keep you around bounine asked as some sort of link with the locals i am after all their priest i am also a visible presence at the monastery when hes not here to remind people who the boss is where have you just been kurbsky asked the monastery he likes the chapel keeping up to scratch hes a religious man who likes everything to be just so candles incense the holy water flowers well he sounds like a raving lunatic to me bounine put in so what do we do about him you may be right father ramsan said but as to a plan of action he looked at his watch its ninethirty theyre military they follow a fixed routine two of the men are appointed cooks i keep them supplied with plenty of fresh food driving to the village in the truck every two or three days their midday break is in the old monastery dining room next to the kitchens starting at noon they drink quite heavily the monastery was known for its wine basayev joins them only sometimes i couldnt guarantee he would be in the dining room often he prefers to eat in his own quarters youre sure of all this information kurbsky asked based on what i have seen when im there and his men bounine put in what do they do all day what are their duties to guard the monastery and protect him its that simple so what are you suggesting to surprise them during their midday meal as ive said they drink heavily and you would have total surprise on your side kurbsky nodded whats this secret way inside that chelek mentioned outside the walls is a decaying vineyard decaying because with the monks not there nobody has the expertise to look after it its overgrown badly and in the thickets there is the entrance to what was an escape tunnel during the bad times three centuries ago there was a groan from the men and bounine said not the damned sewers again weve had enough of those in grozny no there are steps down and headroom to six feet i have been through it many times over the years you emerge through a false wall on a pivot into a series of cellars leading to an underground hall used for storage years ago during sieges but quite empty when i last looked in and that was a year ago from there wide stone steps lead where you want to go fascinating kurbsky said you could always show us the way that wasnt in the bargain i think ramsan said calmly i appreciate your survival instincts kurbsky told him so whats the plan simple enough ill drive you down in the supply truck and deliver you to the vineyard the rest would be up to you i would suggest leaving here at eleventhirty they should be all full swing in the dining room by the time you get there kurbsky turned to his men go over your weapons pistol ak check your grenades then do it again after that rest its been quite a day already and a lot more to it before its over it was just after noon when the truck turned in the gate of the old vineyard moved along the track under a spread of tree branches and came to a halt they all dismounted and followed ramsan as he led the way through decaying vines a battery lantern in his left hand and came to an old stone outhouse he opened the door and stood on the step it was very black wood he leaned down and felt on the inside of the step theres an iron ring thats it he pulled and raised a section of the floor that folded back to disclose stone steps about six feet wide dropping into darkness he turned and offered the lantern to kurbsky who took it but shook his head you take it after all you know the way id feel safer that wasnt the deal well it is now kurbsky passed him the lantern and ramsan looked as if he was about to speak then he took a deep breath switched on the lantern and went down it was perfectly dry very airy and as ramsan had said a good six feet in diameter he played the light out well in front of them so they could see the false wall up ahead he paused on getting to it reached into a corner and pulled some sort of lever and the wall pivoted there was a cellar on the other side with an archway ramsan turned and said the door can only be locked from the other side leave it ajar he carried on leading the way through one archway after another walked through the last one and suddenly switched off the lantern and ran panic ensued where the hell is he kirov cried just as floodlights were turned on to reveal the underground hall ramsan had mentioned on a stone shelf about four feet high two light machine guns on tripods were mounted with two men behind each one other men were ranged at the sides aks at the ready ramsan still on the run was making for the broad steps he had mentioned soldiers waiting there and shadid basayev walked through one of the tigers called you lying bastard raised his ak to fire at ramsan and was cut down by a burst from one of the machine guns is this what the rest of you want the general asked i am shadid basayev if i say slaughter the lot of you now my men will be happy to oblige its all one to me who is kurbsky that would be me kurbsky stepped forward and these are the black tigers basayev nodded a sadlooking bunch if you dont mind me saying so and only eleven we used to be fifty thats good we must be winning the war he stood there hands on hips come on lieutenant whats it to be he stepped very close of course you could shoot me now in a mad moment but my men wouldnt like that kurbsky stared into his eyes trying to work him out and basayev smiled one soldier to another articles of war strictly observed at all times it wasnt that kurbsky believed him it was just that if there was even the smallest of chances that he was telling the truth it was better than all of them being reduced to bloody pulp on the spot here all right lads stand down he started to remove his packs and placed his weapons on the ground and reluctantly his men followed his example chechens moved in and started stripping the tigers of anything worth having father ramsan stood on the steps watching impassively so our man of god is still with us kurbsky said bounine did a strange thing bastards he bit the end of his thumb infamit√† may you rot in hell hey what is this is your sergeant an italian or something basayev demanded no hes russian but he studied law at the university in rome basayev was confounded so did i i was some years after you bounine said did they remember me they spoke of the italian girl who became your wife as a most wonderful person and much loved she was she was we must talk he turned to kurbsky now what am i to do with you like me i suspect you are a true soldier ive been reading this german philosopher lately he says that for authentic living what is necessary is the resolute confrontation of death would you agree heidegger kurbsky said his writing was heinrich himmlers bible youve read heidegger we must talk some more he turned to one of his officers take these two to the cell on floor one no need to tie them lock them up with a bottle of wine ill send for them later kurbsky said what about my men theyll be dealt with you gave me your word one soldier to another so i did do you doubt my word that would make me very angry take them awaynow his voice lifted the officer nodded to four men and they herded kurbsky and bounine up the steps in an echoing hall then up a second flight there was an ironbanded door at the top with a key in the lock and they were pushed into a room with two narrow beds and a barred window the officer said one of my men will be back with the wine but may i offer some advice do not annoy the general in any way the results could be disastrous he went out kurbsky said i get the feeling i may have handled this whole affair terribly badly dont be stupid bounine told him we were sold out by the man of god before we even got here so much for general cheleks reliable source the door opened they turned and a soldier tossed a bottle of wine at them which bounine just caught the door closed the key turned some sort of brandy with a screw top must be good bounine got it off tried it and shrugged not bad really a kind of plum brandy he handed the bottle to kurbsky who tried it and at that moment elsewhere in the monastery someone screamed mother of god not that bounine said in a kind of prayer he put out his hand for the bottle and held it against him after a while the screaming stopped thank god im afraid not kurbsky stood at the barred window looking down into the courtyard bounine joined him a long pole was stretched between two tripods about seven feet above the ground three men manhandled a body with a noose around its neck and a hook on the end which they slipped over the pole and the corpse simply hung there could you tell who it was bounine asked in a low voice too much blood on his face kurbsky held out his hand give me the bottle he took a long drink and someone else screamed the bastards bounine said theyre going to finish all nine all eleven when he remembers hes got us waiting kurbsky handed the bottle over an hour and a half later there were seven out there hanging shoulder to shoulder like washing on a line to that bastard bounine said there was thunder again a rumble and the skies opened in a deluge again they watched body eight hung up not long now bounine put the bottle to his lips christ its finally empty he looked as if he was going to toss it away but kurbsky took it from him and smashed it against the wall he handed it back ignoring new screams and the broken and splintered end looked incredibly dangerous hold it carefully its a hell of a weapon what for bounine asked in despair to fight with ive got a weapon too his hand went down to his right boot he found the gutting knife pulled it out and held it up and sprung the blade my little secret he closed the blade whoever it was had stopped screaming he went to the window and watched as they hooked him up shadid basayev and father ramsan walked down steps from the main door laughter drifted up and basayev said something to ramsan who turned and went back inside what are we going to do bounine asked kill whoever enters this room if possible and then run like hell back down to those cellars remember ramsan left the secret door ajar if we can get out to that truck we could be driving away before they realize whats happening but where to theyll be after us with every vehicle theyve got i could have an answer to that back at the farm there were steps in the corridor voices the key turned in the lock ramsan himself had come or more probably had been sent he entered hesitantly and a burly chechen with a muslimstyle beard moved in behind him holding an uzi machine pistol at the ready the general has sent me to bring you im sorry the chechen moved to one side and gestured with the uzi bounine said to ramsan sorry are you you bastard kurbsky half turned to the chechen pressed the button of the gutting knife and thrust the razorsharp blade under the chin penetrating the roof of the mouth and sticking into the brain at the same moment bounines hand swung from behind his back where he had been concealing the bottle he stabbed ramsan in the side of the neck severing the carotid artery he pushed his falling body onto the bed kurbsky pulled the knife out of the body picked up the uzi dropped by the chechen opened one of his belt pouches and found three clips of ammunition which he stuffed into the pockets of his combat jacket he was through the door and a moment later bounine was on his heels and rushing down the stairs strangely the only thing on his mind as he ran through the cellars was if ramsan had left the key in the truck he had and kurbsky scrabbled up behind the wheel bounine joining him reversed out of the vineyard turned and drove as fast as possible back to the farm bounine said what was it you had in mind theyll be after us soon ill show you kurbsky said as they turned into the barn he jumped down and went to the montessa this will go where they cant it was specially built for riding in rough high country ill drive theres a pillion for you and the rearside panniers could take a jerry can of petrol on each side ill strap them on while you go in the house and fill a bag with food and find a couple of overcoats theres bound to be something in there crosscountry to grozny over the mountains will be rough but we could do it in a couple of days bounine was back in minutes this is the best i could do there were a couple of old army greatcoats and they pulled them on and he managed to stuff the food somewhere along with the jerry cans ive been thinkingchelek isnt going to be pleased kurbsky astride started the engine screw chelek but the armys the army and there are rules you always report to your commanding officer bounine sat astride the pillion so lets go which they did climbing up rough tracks bounine looked back and saw a couple of trucks in the far distance but then the rain started again and they simply vanished they reached grozny in four days not two and reported to cheleks headquarters to discover that the previous day hed insisted on making an inspection of his sector of grozny standing in the turret of a tank and a chechen sniper had shot him in the head the desk colonel controlling things while waiting for a new general to arrive told kurbsky and bounine to put their report in writing which they did he actually read it shaking his head nine guys just like that these chechens are animals as for shadid basayev well put him on the most wanted list as a war criminal and us kurbsky asked theres a shortage of good people in intelligence these days and it seems youve got a law degree bounine which interests the gru youre going to leave all this shit behind its moscow for you and theres a commission waiting but i dont want a commission comrade what you want isnt the point bounine its what your country wants and me comrade kurbsky asked you stay lieutenantor should i say captain youre promoted you stay here in the killing ground of grozny id say it suits your particular talents to perfection and to that of course there was no answer holland park mayfair bad memories led to an extremely disturbed night for kurbsky who didnt fall asleep until the early hours he came awake suddenly surprised to discover it was eight oclock he tried to rouse himself with a good shower but it didnt have much effect and when he examined himself in the mirror the circles around the eyes really did look much darker he dressed and went in search of life and discovered roper in the computer room as usual who looked him over you look satisfactorily ill he said thats the only way to describe it bad night you could say that its not surprising youve been through it in a big way in the last day or two id get yourself to the dining room there youll find a lady named mrs maggie hall the pride of jamaica whose specialty is the great english breakfast if that doesnt revive you nothing will sound advice and ill take it he came back dressed for the street his bag slung from his shoulder his gutting knife stuffed down his right boot the knife hed taken from the youth at wapping the previous night he took from his pocket and placed on ropers desk present for you roper pressed the button and the blade jumped nasty he said where did you get that unlookedfor gift i thought you might find it useful as a letter opener ill be on my way give the ladies my regards and take your time alex im here for you day or night in this damn chair its the one constant in an uncertain world my anchor kurbsky said if you like ill try and remember that he turned and went out he walked down past holland park thinking about it svetlana and katya would be expecting him at chamber court and he needed to visit the local shop to establish his credentials but that could wait he glanced at his watch it was just before nine and he knew where he wanted to be had to be if you like and he emerged onto the main road flagged a black cab and told the driver to take him to marble arch hed already taken the first step on a journey for which there was no going back in the apartment at holland park hed found a paperback of london az with maps streets everything you needed to know hed already checked on church listings and discovered st mary and all the saints in hive street mayfair hed chosen to alight at marble arch so as to be inconspicuous and a brisk fifteenminute walk brought him to st marys rain started to fall and it occurred to him that it might possibly put basayev off but if so there would be other days he pulled up the hood of his combat jacket the church looked familiar to him from the television report he didnt go in by the main doors which had a pseudomedieval look about them oak banded by iron but followed the side path which brought him around to the cemetery at the rear there were cypress trees rhododendron bushes pine trees not much in the way of flowers but that was the season of the year on the other hand this was mayfair and the paths and grass verges were scrupulously kept kurbsky had always rather liked cemeteries and their melancholic atmosphere and st marys was a superb example victorian gothic tombs winged angels poignant effigies of the children of the rich and symbols of death on every hand the television footage helped him find basayevs wifes grave quickly too it was neat enough a curve of speckled marble rising in the center to a portrait of a handsome darkhaired woman in a circle of glass in memoriam rosa rossi basayev never forgotten was the inscription in gold lettering followed by a date kurbsky stepped back to the other side of the path where there was a marble doorway a bench across it a standing cross behind he sat down opened his bag and found the silenced walther he cocked it and held it by his side remembering kuba the monastery and what basayev had done so long ago he felt calm quite detached and it was quiet just the rain rushing down maybe basayev wouldnt come after all but that was all right he could come back the mercedes pulled in at the front of the church the chauffeur had served under basayev in chechnya had been his driver for years he had an umbrella on the floor beside him which he took with him as he went to assist his master he opened it and handed it to basayev as he got out a few yards from the church on the corner of a side street a young woman sat under a canopy with flowers for sale the usual josef bring them to me basayev told him he turned into the side path to the cemetery and josef got another umbrella from the back of the car and approached the girl basayev was quite close to his wifes memorial before he noticed kurbsky and he slowed what are you doing here he spoke in english what do you want you kurbsky told him in russian its been a long time since kuba remember the monastery the courtyard the nine black tigers who werent dancing on air because youd butchered them before you hung them up it was raining then too what in the hell are you talking about who are you alexander kurbsky and dont tell me that name hasnt meant something to you over the years remember the cellar in the monastery where you persuaded me to surrender you gave me your word one soldier to another that the articles of war would be strictly observed at all times then you butchered nine of my men at that moment josef came around the corner with the bunch of flowers in one hand the umbrella in the other here i am boss he said in russian basayev turned and shouted help me josef hes going to kill me josef dropped both the flowers and the umbrella and drew a pistol kurbsky with no option shot him in the heart and turned to find basayev already scrambling away through the gravestones he shot him in the back of the head fragments of bone and brain spraying out as he fell on his face he walked back up the path to josef still dying and finished him off with a head shot he stood listening for a moment but everything was still no evidence of any disturbance thanks to the silenced walther it was now that his examination of the street maps paid off he walked quickly to the other end of the cemetery and found what he was looking for another gate leading out to a quiet backstreet and he started to walk through mayfair one street after another he felt no elation no satisfaction it was not needed shadid basayev had been responsible for carnage and butchery and the ethnic cleansing of several thousand people thanks to the stupidity of society he had been rewarded with many millions and the right to live in luxury in the best part of london now his account was closed an hour later he stopped in a small square with a garden and benches there was no need to tell roper and company about what hed done on the other hand moscow would be delighted to hear of basayevs assassination and he had tania to think about after all it would be to his credit he used his encrypted mobile to reach not luzhkov but bounine and got him straightaway yuri its me alex where are you can you talk in my office bounine was surprised yes of course i can talk did you see shadid basayev on bbc television last night i sure did the scum tell me does he have a chauffeur named josef yes josef limov he served under him in chechnya hes been his personal hit man for years ah thats good i dont need to feel bad about killing him bounine said killing him are you crazy i hope not ive just shot him dead in the cemetery at st mary and all the saints along with basayev of course he was my primary target you know he said he liked to look in on his wifes memorial every morning i thought id say hello alex there hasnt been a word of this on radio or television because they havent found the bodies yet but how could this happen is this something to do with ferguson s people they dont know a thing about it and thats how it stays he lied now im very happy living in the safe house at holland park i have an arrangement where im allowed out for a break on my own they trust me completely so youre going back in there why wouldnt i tell luzhkov ill be in touch again when i feel like it i dont want him trying to call me this should make him look good in moscow dont you think what about your aunt what do you mean the whole idea was to guarantee my anonymity so that no one except fergusons people know im here svetlana is the last person id want to involve i dont want her bothered yuri you understand me he clicked off and at the other end bounine shook his head and smiled slightly christ almightybasayev i hope he rots in hell he got up and went off to find luzhkov kurbsky walked farther until he finally came to oxford street he was thinking of svetlana and katya now it was time he made his way to belsize park and then he came to a large bookstore the windows full of displays and deals and there was on the death of men it was a new edition from his london publisher on impulse he went in the store took off his woolen hat and put it in his pocket then wandered around a little before approaching the counter the assistant he chose was a longhaired young man of studious appearance and intense can i help you kurbsky put on his french accent there is this novel on the death of men by alexander kurbsky ive read it in french but i see you have a new edition in english i would enjoy comparing the two the young man turned away and was back in a moment with a copy an excellent idea i suppose it could be argued that to really get the essence of it one should read it in russian i see your point kurbsky said have you read it good heavens yes who hasnt a remarkable man he had the book in his hand and kurbsky said the french edition i read had no photo this one has a most excellent one he showed it to him kurbsky nodded he looks like quite a character the young man smiled with real enthusiasm i only wish we could get him in here for a book signing theyd be queuing round the block will you take it sir certainly kurbsky paid cash and playing his role to the hilt said im going in for more therapy reading it will help pass the time the young mans face clouded i hope things go well for you so do i he went out dropped the book in his bag and pulled his woolen hat back on it was the ultimate test and he had passed it time to report in at chamber court he decided to go on the underground and made for the nearest station it was around that time that father patrick meehan after an hour of hearing confession in st marys went into the vestry found an umbrella and went out through the side door to have a smoke he had managed to get his consumption down to five a day a desperate struggle but he was trying hard he lit up turned into the cemetery and almost fell over josef as someone who had served as a parish priest in belfast during the troubles death was something he was extremely familiar with josef with blood all over his face was clearly gone so he rushed to basayev and saw immediately he was a lost cause too he took out his mobile and called for an ambulance then informed the police he returned to josef and felt for a pulse just to be sure there was none but in the circumstances his duty as a priest was clear he began to recite the prayers for the dying go christian soul from this world in the name of god the father almighty who created thee soon sirens sounded and not one but two ambulances braked hard outside the church and the paramedics came on the run the general store that katya had mentioned to kurbsky carried a sign patel son it was what the english were fond of calling the corner shop a place that was always open and sold everything it was quiet no customers elevator music playing softly and the young man sitting behind the counter was indian wearing jeans and a black bomber jacket and he was reading a book which he put down when kurbsky appeared can i help you i hope so kurbsky said a friend of mine a polish guy named marek had a job at a house near here with two ladies he worked in the garden did odd jobs and they let him live over the garage thats right i knew marek well im hitesh patel he offered his hand kurbsky shook it ive had a letter from them offering me the job now that hes gone back to poland marek recommended me he produced it hitesh read it and nodded i see whats the problem im not sure if ive got the right house im new to london and i seem to have gotten all turned around hitesh came around the counter took him to the door and pointed its right there with the high walls theyre big on security front gate or side gate theres a voice box so you speak to let them know youre there theyre really nice ladies youll do well there thats good to hear hitesh was concerned so you need regular chemotherapy thats right lung cancer im sorry youve really got to take it easy can i offer you a cup of coffee weve got the machine there id rather have tea ill join you they sat on either side of the counter and kurbsky said youre not very busy not during the lunch hourits all local trade theres just you then hitesh laughed my father and mother have gone home to bombay for three months and im sitting in for them a couple of local ladies come in parttime what do you usually do im a medical student just starting my fourth year where did you go to university here in london he laughed a great disappointment to my father because im not a businessman im too english for them i was born here i know the feeling i have a french father and i was born in devon i read english at london university then i worked as a journalist before he gave an excellent performance well you know what i mean look thanks a lot ill see you again take care hitesh told him and kurbsky left he approached the house from the mews katya answered opened the gate and he walked through the garden and found her waiting on the terrace she took his hands and kissed him on both cheeks we were getting worried we expected you earlier ive just been having a cup of tea with hitesh patel and showed him your letter hes a nice guy svetlanas waiting they went into the conservatory and found her in her usual wicker chair she reached up to kiss him we were worried for you no need babushka last night i went down to the salters pub at wapping and had supper i got a taxi and then walked the streets this morning i did the same actually i had a funny experience on oxford street what was that katya asked he told them about the episode in the bookstore isnt it wonderful he said even with my photo on the book he was holding he still didnt recognize me katya said there was a call for you there couldnt have been he said sorry i mean the call was through me major roper gave me one of those encrypted codex mobiles he said hed been trying to get you but couldnt get a response ive had mine on vibrate ill speak to him ive got chili con carne for lunch ill show you the room over the garage afterwards but first theres champagne svetlana told him a celebration of your return after all these years just give me a moment he said i must call major roper you were trying to get me he said when roper answered yes there was no response so i got worried i put my codex on vibrate and its easy to miss that faint tremble especially when youre walking in the crowds of oxford street what did you want theres a breaking story on all the news shows shadid basayev and his driver a man named josef limov were stiffed at that church in mayfair where he has a memorial to his wife and when was this the priest a father meehan came across the bodies in the church cemetery not much more than an hour ago so information will be thin on the ground at the moment what do you think a russian connection svr perhaps he said naming the foreign intelligence service which was in many ways a successor to the kgb im not so sure in the old days they often hired the ira to do their dirty work these days muslims are popular mind you he was a bad one basayev kurbsky said he wont be missed ill give it some thought well speak again i might drop in to see you you know where i am luzhkov heard what bounine had to say was shocked and delighted there was no point in holding back on the story and as it started to break he contacted the prime ministers suite at the kremlin and spoke to putin i am obviously pleased that basayev has finally met his end but the manner of it gives me pause for thought i can see that comrade prime minister he treads a dangerous path you dont want to make fools of ferguson and his people on the other hand its a brilliant stroke if he gets away with it putin laughed i like it let it ride colonel and well see where it leads bounine sitting opposite him said how was he delighted i think the idea of kurbsky making fools of fergusons company actually pleases him i wont try to speak to kurbsky ill leave it to you yuri youre the man he trusts the living quarters over the garage were not quite as he remembered them the bathroom had been improved but the big room where kelly had taught kurbsky judo had been developed into another apartment a kitchen area in one corner a living room in another and a wide window looking out over the garden it was nicely furnished and in good order i had cleaners in after marek left and a plumber to improve the bathroom and kitchen its linked to the central heating system in the main house katya said svetlana wants this to work alex and so do i sit down for a minute she faced him across the table and he took her hand youve been great to me your input in this affair has been fabulous and i know youre a true friend to my aunt it seems to be working my new identity as ive told you ive been out and about and i feel that alexander kurbsky is the invisible man i can come and go at holland park as henri duval lets take it a day at a time good she said regarding your new identity i hesitate to bring this up but but you think id better actually do some gardening now and then to fit my cover story right right she said with relief ill just show you the garage and the equipment and well go back to svetlana downstairs she pressed a button and the garage door lifted there was a riding mower garden tools of every description and a small ford van in dark green it doesnt look like much but i use it as a general runaround its been in here for years just use it as you see fit the right documents are in the glove compartment and they include henri duvals name the keys in there also and a hand control to let you in or out at the front gate excellent he smiled lets go back to the conservatory and help svetlana finish that bottle of champagne shortly after the news came out of the bloodbath at st mary and all the saints ferguson had spoken to roper its like belfast on a bad saturday night in the old days the prime minister and the cabinet office are not pleased people like basayev shouldnt be allowed in our country just because theyve got a few hundred million or a billion or so and it suits the city of london and the treasury thats as may be but it doesnt look good in the papers oh dear im heartbroken i really am so whos responsible have you spoken to lord arthur tilsey as a matter of fact i have and the security services are just as mystified as the rest of us its the russians its got to be they tried to collar basayev in moscow thats why he fled here in the first place have you had words with special branch at scotland yard yes and the word under the counter is the killings are definitely the work of a professional hit man who knew what he was doing basayev really asked for it advertising to the world that he liked to visit his wifes memorial at that church every morning its got to be the russians putin will be over the moon thats what kurbsky said whats he got to do with it we watched basayev in that television appearance last night after all kurbsky was the other side in chechnya when i spoke to him today at belsize he suggested the svr as a possibility do you think that ferguson asked too direct as we know better than anyone they used to give their dirty work on contract to the ira or some muslim faction or other like al qaeda they like to be able to blame someone else true enough and due to britains kindness in operating an opendoor policy these days there are an awful lot of real asylumseekers here real victims any one of whom might have relished the thought of shooting that animal and perhaps did roper said well to other matters it wont have escaped your attention that the american vice president grant hardy is in paris at the nato meeting yes ive seen it on the news and seen blake johnson with him he said in an interview that blake would be coming to london to discuss nato matters with the ministry of defence does that involve you charles amongst others but it raises the question again of when we can tell blake and president cazalet about kurbsky you gave your word charles to preserve his anonymity therefore the choice is his not yours is he coming in i wouldnt be surprised do me a favor and raise the matter with him thats all i ask consider it done wheres dillon hes gone to stay with monica for a few days in cambridge how the mighty are fallen roper poured a scotch and tapped into the news of the basayev investigation the fact that he and his chauffeur had both been armed had leaked and was being made much of the russian ambassador had denied any involvement in the matter and so had moscow so with no more story television had to fall back on fillin stuff clips from the war coverage in chechnya basayev in the thick of it dirty and unkempt and thoroughly ruthless what was bad wasnt just the carnage of war but the bodies tumbling into open graves filmed for real as machine guns did their deadly work actual footage of basayev standing there gloating like some nazi it was to be expected that he was a hate figure to the russian army and yet kurbsky had seemed curiously indifferent on impulse roper tapped into kurbskys details again particularly his war record with the black tigers there were his decorations and god knows there were enough of them six in all and a short citation with each one on the th of february this officer with no previous parachute training jumped with his men over the kuba plateau in an attempt to apprehend general shadid basayev the mission failed but lieutenant kurbsky and sergeant yuri bounine succeeded in rejoining the army the only survivors of the unit roper sat there looking at it and sergeant doyle came in with a mug of tea and a bacon sandwich there you go sir tony what if i told you i had a man who dropped into action by parachute without any parachute training what kind of man would do that a bleeding loony sir or a bloody hero i remember one example i read about the biggest paratroop drop in history arnhem in one of the outfits lost their doctor with a broken ankle just before boarding and another young doctor who had no training took his place they strapped on his chute in the plane and he did the business he paused at the door some people will do anything for a laugh he went out and roper sat there then tapped in sergeant yuri bounine decorated twice once for the same operation as kurbsky transferred to gru present rank major commercial attach√© at the dublin embassy he phoned kurbsky where are you sorting a few things out in my new quarters over the garage i spoke to that guy at the local shop up the road hes indianhitesh patel an interesting guy actuallya fourthyear medical student minding the store while his parents are in bombay what are you up to this evening i thought i might come and see you is that okay im certainly not planning on going anywhere else the televisions been full of the basayev shooting some of the old footage from the chechen war shows him in a lessthanflattering light was that your opinion too roper knew something it was obvious from his tone the finest way of handling that was to tell the truth kurbsky said he was a vile sadistic monster evil in every way even the devil would reject him from hell and am i happy that somebody shot the bastard i couldnt be more delighted well thats plain enough by the way katyas given me a ford van of the kind gardeners use to help with my cover its green and ill give you the number roper took it ill see you later then they rang off kurbsky sat there then called bounine and found him in his quarters its alex yuri how did luzhkov take it he was terribly put out at first but phoned putin on his special number the prime minister was delighted and apparently approves of you making fools of fergusons people luzhkov says hes going to leave contact with you to me because im the only person you trust thats good but i have roper to contend witha difficult man to fool tell me yuri if you bring up your career details on computer does it show the london posting no thats classified information because of the peculiarities of the job its word of mouth only as far as my records are concerned im still commercial attach√© at dublin excellent ill speak to you whenever just a minute somethings come up and it affects someone whos a friend of ferguson and his people go on his name is blake johnson and hes head of personal security for president cazalet so hes big stuff and according to luzhkov very close to fergusons group when he was in london the other year luzhkov hired somebody to assassinate him but it was foiled by this man dillon and somebody else luzhkovs still got a bee in his bonnet about him dont know why anyway johnson is apparently coming to london tomorrow on nato businessand luzhkovs thinking of kidnapping him are you sure about this im not involved but i sat in hes using petrovich and oleg to do ityou remember them from the safe house outside moscow i do indeed theyd shoot a dog those two but anything that touches on ferguson and his friends touches me too so im concerned about this this seems like madness yuri i agree but luzhkovs intent on it you should have seen his face must be some old bad blood well keep me informed dont let luzhkov know i know keep this to yourself of course alex you come first he went through the garden to the house and entered the conservatory where svetlana sat playing patience with a background of rachmaninovs fourth piano concerto katya stood at her easel doing a pastel drawing of monica thats excellent he said not at all ive got the face but wheres the soul ive no answer to that im going out for a while down to holland park i was going to drive but ive been drinking so ill find a cab are you sure no problem he gave svetlana a kiss on the forehead and smiled at katya dont wait up for me ive no intention she went to the sideboard opened a drawer and returned with a control device for the gate now you can go and come as you please what a woman he kissed her lightly on the mouth and went out it was pleasant walking down through belsize along abbey road which made him think of the beatles and then he came to swiss cottage where there were dozens of cabs swirling by he hailed one and sat in the back thinking about what bounine had just said it was luzhkov feeling the sap rising because putin had approved of what kurbsky had done so luzhkov had failed in some previous attempt to deal with johnson and now the idea of kidnapping him had appealed to him which seemed utterly ludicrous to kurbsky if luzhkov succeeded what on earth was he going to do with johnson he shook his head he told the driver to stop at the end of the street paid him and walked to the entrance of the safe house he announced his arrival the judas gate opened he stepped through and it closed behind him doyle nodded to him at the door as he went through to the computer room where he found roper watching the news from moscow he turned and smiled there you are old stick i must say that cream shes used under your eyes is really doing the trick youre beginning to look like someone out of an old hammer horror movie you didnt drive down then svetlana got the champagne out a kind of celebration that im back in the house it must be strange for you after all these years and amazing to be with her again so much of that time has already returned to me with extraordinary clarity london when i was a teenager sharp and fresh and full of zip the age when anythings possible or you believe it is kurbsky nodded to the news program from moscow showing old war footage of basayev see theyve even got him for home consumption black and white and grainy just like the bastard was in real life the kremlin is rejecting the scurrilous charges that they have had anything to do with itwhile making it clear that the large numbers of people who suffered at the hands of this brutal war criminal as they describe him no doubt feel that they have finally seen justice done ill drink to that kurbsky went to the sideboard and poured a large vodka heres to nine good friends of mine who suffered appallingly at his hands i wasnt quite honest with you when you asked me if id known him and i said everyone in the russian army did the truth is i was involved with a unit in chechnya called the black tigers a specialops paratroop outfit a reliable source discovered basayev was at the monastery in the mountains we were dropped in to try to assassinate him only the reliable source turned out to be not so reliable oh dear it was ever thus roper said there were only eleven of us left he had nine tortured and strung up and my sergeant and i managed to escape and got back to grozny pass me the whiskey kurbsky did and roper said the sergeant would be bounine he must have been a useful chap good god you know all this kurbsky managed to look amazed but how your army career on the internet theres a brief citation next to each decoration explaining the reason for the award in this case it also said you jumped without training several of us did he became very open now bounine had jumped a time or two in afghanistan the most unlikelylooking paratrooper you ever saw he had a law degree he kept secret from the army too what happened to him somebody found out about the law degree and he was transferred to the gru there was some talk of a commission but i was promoted to captain and back in deep shit i never heard from him again he looked at roper but something tells me you know more than i do roper grinned well cyberspace can reveal all hes done well for himself a major and still in the gru posing as a senior commercial attach√© at the dublin embassy he always had a brain that was the lawyer in him that would make him stand out in any crowd he sat back so tell me whats not being reported you must know the right people at scotland yard oh i do and its almost funny josef limov the chauffeur had been basayevs hit man for years and he had a walther drawn but not discharged basayev also had a walther only his was still in his pocket the postmortems have not been completed but rounds already recovered from the bodies indicate the weapon used to kill them was also a walther it isnt almost funny it is funny kurbsky went to his bag opened the secret compartment and produced the walther hed been issued so this one makes four a very popular weapon thanks to james bond easy to use and a hell of a stopping power the preferred weapon of many hit men in moscow so you think it was a professional hit hard to say here you have a thoroughly nasty bit of work full of himself on london television rich beyond most peoples wildest dreams and amongst the two or three million londoners watching the program there are bound to have been refugees and asylumseekers who suffered at basayevs hands in other words who would have loved the chance to bump him off you could say his appearance at the church was an open invitation theres only one thing wrong with that from what you say both men were armed and josef got as far as drawing his weapon and yet the killer got both of them thats the mark of a professional so that means the kremlin either directly or through a contract killer since the fall of communism and the advent of capitalism the battle for that money has led to an incredible rise in contract killings in moscow journalists politicians businessmen in this case id say the only questions are who paid and whether the killer was imported or local roper poured another scotch and if its local there are plenty of possibilities the criminal scene has changed a lot since the old days of the east end gangsters the moscow mafia has made its mark and powerful albanian and romanian groups have moved into london not to mention the irish troubles said kurbsky wars in bosnia serbia and kosovo the first gulf war iraq and afghanistan that adds up to thousands of men not only trained but used to war im sure many of them would be perfectly capable of doing something like the basayev killing especially for money there used to be a man in moscow known as superkiller who charged fifty thousand dollars for a hit and was seldom unemployed roper nodded what youre really saying here is that we might never get anyone for these killings because there are just too many possible suspects the general public sees a perfectly vile man sitting on his money and laughing at the world and when he unexpectedly gets whats coming to him the truth is theyre rather pleased i guess thats why i cant get particularly worked up about the bastard myself anyway theres something else i want to discussferguson asked me to raise it with you and whats that weve always had a close working relationship with president cazalet who has an outfit very similar to ours operating in washington its called the basement and its run by a very good friend of ours named blake johnson hes coming to london tomorrow for a nato conference with the ministry of defence and kurbsky asked and we do a great many things in tandem with them ferguson wonders if youd agree to him passing on your story to blake and through him to the president itd be under the strictest of secrecy no way i made it plain that i would embark on this venture only if i was guaranteed anonymity general charles ferguson gave me his word on the matter he has a moral obligation to keep it he totally accepts that then let that be the end of the matter ill see that it is kurbsky left at ten oclock refused a lift by sergeant doyle and walked slowly down through holland park toward the main road he paused at the end of one lonely street and phoned bounine have you heard anything else regarding this blake johnson business a certain amount he invited me to have a drink and was very excited apparently weve just reached a deal with a private airfield at berkley down that specializes in jets for millionaires the place is about twenty miles out of london in kent luzhkov talked about being able to book a falcon wherever he wanted and the point of this is im getting there he got quite worked up about all this told me more about the previous attempt on johnsons life the other year the mistake he said was to trust a lowlife gangster and pay him well for the contract luzhkov got quite drunk when he was telling me this apparently the gangster farmed the work out on the cheap to two secondrate specimens who were foiled by this man dillon an exira enforcer who now works for ferguson and someone called salter who also works for ferguson did this business involve anyone being killed i understand there was some damage done to those concerned he said dillon had a bad habit of shooting ears i wonder if oleg and petrovich are aware of the opposition they are up against i suppose if the affair proceeded in the right way they wouldnt expect any opposition we live in a world where anything is possible you dont need to hunt for a public telephone you have a mobile phone in your pocket that can handle a call to the other side of the world and you can bang a man on the head in a london street and bundle him off in a car twenty miles into the kent countryside where a falcon jet will have him in moscow in five hours instead of eating breakfast in the american embassy guesthouse in peel mews i get it now and this is your idea of fun yuri for this poor bastard the american version is called extraordinary rendition you fly some unlucky bastard from one country too civilized to harm him to another where you can get someone to torture him for you no honor in that no honor either in refueling the falcon in moscow for an onward flight to siberia and station gorky the last place god made kurbsky said okay youve made your point if i ever need a defense lawyer it will be you yuri yuri said are you okay alex you sound tense what would i have to be tense about ill speak to you tomorrow look for me round about noon he thought about it as he walked to the main road and flagged a black cab and instead of asking for holland park he told the driver to take him to grosvenor square because he knew thats where the american embassy was in the back of the black cab he put the light on and examined his london az guide found peel mews off of south audley street running down from grosvenor square he put the guide away turned off the light and sat there thinking boris luzhkov feeling his oats was considering this mad idea of kidnapping the personal security adviser for president jack cazalet it was a crazy escapade yet as bounine had said in this modern world of today when hours meant so little it was eminently possible but it was a nasty business in the shadowy world of spies and assassins that sort of thing was to be expected and the interrogations that went with it a man like johnson so close to the president would be subject to the most horrendous torture to extract the incredible amount of information he must have but what would be the consequences he told the cabdriver to drop him on the other side of the square by the statue of general eisenhower as the cab drove away he turned aware of the great ugly slabs of concrete designed to protect the building against a terrorist attack and walked back across the square and entered south audley street peel mews was to the left some little way along he paused for a quick moment it started to rain lightly and he looked around him taking everything in fine buildings georgian victorian some superb shops mayfair night in the rain cars swishing by not too many people walking it was dreamlike in a way or was that just him he continued steadily to the end where he turned toward park lane and discovered the dorchester hotel which was reasonably busy night porters on duty umbrellas at the ready cars in and out and on the other side the darkness of hyde park the traffic cutting between in long streams what a great city this was still the wonderland to which he had come when he was seventeen all the way from communist moscow it was still probably the best city in the world and he knew quite suddenly standing there that he didnt like what boris luzhkov wanted to happen to blake johnson and he knew why it was bounine mentioning an onward flight to station gorky that stuck in his craw yes there was the cursed business with his sister and all the years she had rotted there sure he would have to continue to follow the path he was on in the hope of earning her freedom but to consign someone else to the degradation and despair of such a place was something he was not prepared to do in a way it was his own private declaration of war and that was all that mattered and he turned and walked to the cab rank in the side street just before he went to bed at eleven ferguson called in to roper how did you get on with kurbsky about the blake johnson matter he was absolutely firm he said youd promised him anonymity given him your word and that was the end of the matter all right i give in something interesting happened though when i asked kurbsky earlier if hed known basayev he said everyone in the russian army did but when he came round tonight he told me there was a bit more to it than that did he indeed mind you i already suspected there was because of my research online go on tell me so roper did when he was finished ferguson said a hell of a story god if that swine basayev had done that to any unit i commanded id have hounded him in every way possible shot him like the dog he was roper said when you think of it kurbsky had an incredible motive to kill basayev himself himself with his history for gods sake giles this anonymity kurbsky so prizes would be right out the window if he got involved with something like that all right i take your point try and get a good nights sleep for a change he was gone and roper aching with pain poured a large whiskey and drank it sleep he said who needs that at chamber court kurbsky spoke into the voice box and let himself in with the control walking through the garden the lights were on in the conservatory katya standing at the open door and svetlana on her wicker throne inside so there you are katya said come and join us for a dish of tea which he did taking off his coat and shaking rain from it he kissed svetlanas forehead and took katyas hand for a moment how are you my dear svetlana asked you look so ill he laughed and said to katya cant you persuade her that im supposed to look ill he was handed a glass of tea and katya said what have you been up to then did you visit the safe house how was roper oh the world of spooks is very worked up about the shooting of the chechen general shadid basayev and his driver its become a staple diet on all the news programs today a dreadful man svetlana commented some of his deeds were unspeakable did you know him katya asked he was one of the bestknown chechen generals and universally reviled yes i knew him kurbsky said a vile man who escaped retribution for many years and as far as im concerned hes finally met a just end he got up im tired i think ill go to bed god bless you both after he had gone svetlana said i worry about him something weighs heavily on his spiriti know these things he has a lot on his mind a lot to contend with katya told her and kissed her on both cheeks go to bed now and sleep well the things in his past the years of war such terrible things must hang heavily on him some of the old film they showed today of the war in chechnya that dreadful man basayev alexander was part of that she picked up her stick and got up ill see you in the morning she went out and katya sat there thinking about it then went and found her laptop sat with it on her knees and tapped in alexander kurbsky there was nothing secret there just the career of a great writer including an account of his military career and his medals and decorations there were so many and she felt a certain pride aware that she was slightly in love with him she started to read the citations and the details leapt out at her of the officer who had jumped with his men over the kuba plateau in february a failed mission with only two survivors the target had been shadid basayev she switched off her heart beating went to the sideboard and poured a vodka and almost choked on it her every instinct confirming what she did not wish to hear her night was restless but she finally fell asleep and awoke suddenly at seventhirty to the sound of a motor outside she got up went to the window opened it and looked out and saw kurbsky seated on the mower cutting the grass in long swaths hello she called and he stopped and looked up did i wake you if so im sorry im fine so youre getting in the swing of things thats what im here for have you had any breakfast an apple and a glass of milk he laughed its fine i want to get this side lawn finished ill have a sandwich later svetlana often spent the morning in bed soothing her arthritis and reading katya took her a tray of muesli assorted fruit toast and black russian tea hes started on the garden she said mowing the grass she went to the window and looked out bad march weather is not good for gardens they lie still nothing happens very chekhovian my dear so its a season of sadness but perhaps the gardener will find the exercise beneficial katya handed her the times and svetlana made a face more on that wretched basayev it will be for a while then something else will come along and replace it on the front page another killing a suicide bomb svetlana shook her head what a world i suspect it always was and katya went downstairs at holland park roper sat at his desk varying his screen images turning from the autopsy report on basayev to the one on josef to the scotland yard forensic reports taking it all in tapping his desk with the flick knife kurbsky had given him doyle brought his tea and sandwich in thats a nasty bit of work major where did you get that then just a present to open my mail itll open a bloody sight more than that if you ask me he left and kurbsky came in did you have a good night im not sure if i know what that means anymore what are you up to gardening im establishing my position at chamber court so the neighbors get used to me i sat in the saddle of the tractor and let the mower do all the work the lawns are looking good any more word on the basayev business not a thing the autopsies forensics and all the usual nasty details are available but but it doesnt get us an inch further to the media its russian perfidy as usual which means theres never a solution roper told him thats the trouble with you russians always getting away with things there was an edge there that he hadnt been able to resist kurbsky was aware of it at once but kept his response light we are social democrats now these days communism is dead my friend tell that to vladimir putin i doubt he would wish to speak to me now you never know said roper blake johnson was a handsome man in his late fifties hair graying a little a shade under six feet tall he was always received courteously at the american embassy in grosvenor square not only because of his position but also because the ambassador frank mars was a friend of many years and theyd served together in vietnam a marine captain escorted him upstairs and then went in search of the ambassador johnson would have welcomed a scotch after the flight but with the nato meeting coming up at the ministry of defence he needed his wits about him there was coffee on the sideboard and he was savoring a cup when mars walked in great to see you blake i thought youd be accompanying the vice president back to washington its a a pleasure to see you its good to see you again old friend blake shook his hand this meeting could be extremely important i presume this has to do with the future deployment of our troops in support of nato forces something like that frank at this stage you could say im just testing the water for the president mars said listen about your accommodation tonight we were going to put you up in the embassy house but i recall you had a slight problem there the other year nothing worth mentioning blake said but there is a hotel off south audley street called the albany regency its oldfashioned but i stayed there some years ago and liked it i asked the paris embassy to book it for me and they tell me i have a suite on the top floor a view over the rooftops to hyde park and everything sounds lovely good ill be on my way i just wanted to drop in and say hello any idea when youre flying back is there time to get together later ah well possibly i think you might have to put up with me a bit longer but i cant discuss it now frank ill call you blake left a chagrined frank mars with the distinct impression that he wasnt getting the whole picture there was nothing new about the basayev affair so roper bored began trolling around on the computer thinking of basayev naturally led him to thinking of kurbsky and that led him back to kurbskys history and the nightmare of his sisters death moscow in upheaval over fifty thousand body bags home from afghanistan riots in the streets hundreds of dead and dying and among them tania kurbsky her brother had been told that she was only wounded and so he had rushed home and found her already dead and buried a plot on his fathers part to get him back to moscow a thoroughgoing bastard ivan kurbsky but then he must have been to make colonel in the kgb also a man with real influence to be able to get his daughter buried in minsky park military cemetery almost idly he consulted the list of those buried at minsky and there were over six thousand he leaned forward frowning and tried again but he had been right the first time there was no tania kurbsky buried at minsky park this was nonsense roper had seen a family photo of colonel kurbsky by grave the headstone engraved with tania kurbskys name and dates very quickly roper explored the list of graves on his computer and there was number meticulously recorded by some clerk as empty it took a lot to get giles roper excited these days but he was now a surge of energy spreading through him january tania kurbsky apparently dead but not in her grave so where are you he poured himself another whiskey and started to find out kurbsky let it go until well into the afternoon before phoning bounine how are things at your end he demanded crazier than ever we have an asset in paris who works for the office that books embassy travel arrangements there before he left johnson made arrangements for a hotel called the albany regency in london our people have checked it out and hes definitely booked its a topfloor suite so how are they going to proceed apparently theyve got hold of a truck from the firm that does laundry pickups and deliveries to hotels in the area the idea is they grab him in his room and wheel him out under a pile of sheets or towels they drive him to berkley down where the falcon awaits and the rest you know this is going too far kurbsky said when is it supposed to happen i dont know apparently oleg and petrovich are going to park outside and wait for the right moment why they think the result will be different from the last time luzhkov tried to have johnson assassinated i dont know fergusons people keep a close eye on johnson at all times thank god you arent involved yuri he hung up thinking about it it was reasonable to suppose that the most likely time to find johnson at the hotel would be late afternoon or early evening the stupidity of the whole idea was obvious but on the other hand it was also so absurdly simple that it might just succeed and he couldnt have that he walked around the garden checking his handiwork hed done well and it had needed it katya appeared and called to him and he joined her your aunt is so pleased she loves her garden come and have a drink youve earned it so he went and she poured three vodkas and they toasted him you look better alexander svetlana said happier in yourself i think full of energy and life under all that camouflage he couldnt very well tell her why to work with ones hands plants trees the whole gardening thingits good for the soul i think will you eat with us tonight katya asked my thanks but there are things i need to do at the safe house but i wont be too late he went out to the terrace and away svetlana said you like him my dear dont you and i fear for him katya said kurbsky consulted his maps and discovered where the albany regency was in the garage he had found an old pair of black overalls and he changed clothes now putting them on there was a tweed cap which he appropriated and a khaki scarf which he looped around his neck he had the gutting knife safe in his boot and now took the walther from the secret compartment in his bag and slipped it into a patch pocket up the right leg of the overalls with an extra clip in the left patch pocket he stuffed one of the black ski masks some cash gloves and he was ready down in the garage he checked out the ford van among the tools in the back was a man at work sign and three yellow cones which could he helpful there was nothing else to do except get on with it and he drove out a couple of moments later katya who had been watching from the trees went back into the conservatory hes gone she said but to where all will be well svetlana said if this is necessary he will be good in spite of himself i am certain of it roper got his first breakthrough on his search for tania by trawling the hospitals in central moscow during the period covering the worst violence there she was a bullet in the left lung another in the side narrowly missing a kidney it was surprising theyd bothered to treat her considering the attitude of the authorities in those troubled times but somewhere there had been doctors and nurses who took their work seriously in spite of party officials and tania kurbsky had lived the next mention of her name was on a warrant for crimes against the state roper got the feeling that it was then that things had changed he suspected that her father probably hadnt been aware of what had happened to her at first she had probably appeared to have disappeared in all the turmoil but then shed been arraigned for treason against the state the penalty for which was death yet tania kurbsky was not executed more work produced a special court hearing the testimony of colonel ivan kurbsky and a new sentence exile to station gorky in perpetuity the numbered grave at minsky park was left in place in consideration of colonel kurbskys services to the state roper switched the computer off feeling so desperately sorry at what he had found this was not what alexander kurbsky believed to be true for so many years how could he possibly be told and even more told that his sister might still be a prisoner in one of the worst places in the world he switched back on and tapped in station gorky it was one of the most unpleasant things roper had ever done there was something reminiscent of the nazis about the details of those incarcerated at station gorky of heinrich himmlers insistence on records of deaths executions gassing so meticulously kept that eventually those who had committed the deeds were condemned in open court by their own records it was the same now with station gorky the archives long buried were now available on the computer lists written by hand or on cheap oldfashioned typewriters thousands of names for a long time he seemed to be getting nowhere and it was hard going but in the end sitting back easing his pain with more whiskey the breakthrough came from a single phrase entered in the court documents referring to her sentence in perpetuity it was so simple in the end like a code word and when he tapped in station gorky and followed it with the dread phrase one list after another was revealed there were hundreds of them with dates of incarceration and in most cases dates of death over the years he tapped in one or two as a start and found sparse entries usually no more than two or three lines and a photo of the convict shavenheaded for both men and women eyes lifeless all hope gone and tania kurbsky admitted january looked exactly the same just like all the others a creature beyond despair to die of typhoid on march must have been a blessing roper sat back totally depressed for years alexander kurbsky had accepted that his sister was dead buried in minsky park military cemetery to be told now that she had lived for eleven appalling years in the worst gulag in siberia would be a terrible thing to have to come to terms with but then did kurbsky need to know what purpose could there be in telling him none that he could see but that would mean keeping the whole rotten business from everyone and that included ferguson he buried his face in his hands and doyle came in you all right major have you been overdoing it again we cant have that roper smiled here we go again the old jamaican charm offensive the old jamaican cockney charm offensive how about i take you to the wet room and you have a bloody good shower roper poured a whiskey and tossed it back you know what tony thats a good idea kurbsky reached the albany regency hotel and discovered that the normal parking area had been temporarily extended a substantial building had been demolished next door and there was room for more cars until construction began many vehicles had taken advantage of the situation kurbsky took a spot in a corner and noticed a manhole he backed up against it opened the rear door found a crowbar among the tools and levered up the manhole then positioned the yellow cones around it and propped the man at work sign against the fords windshield now he was set for a while there was no sign of a laundry van it was just after five a certain gloom in the air as evening approached he continued to search among the parked cars and then he saw a notice on the wall trade vehicles at rear entrance an arrow pointed to a narrow footway through an archway and he hurried along back from his meeting blake johnson had been dropped at the front entrance of the hotel only fifteen minutes before kurbsky arrived and igor oleg saw it he was wearing a green uniform the name of a laundry company printed on the back his companion petrovich was waiting in the courtyard at the rear of the building oleg had gone around to the back using the very footway that kurbsky was on now and hurried down the steps to his companion who already had a large fourwheeled cloth container waiting filled with towels hes here oleg told him lets get it done then they went in through the basement door entered the service elevator and went up to the top floor blake had taken off his jacket loosened his tie and poured himself a whiskeyand a large one not because of his exertions at the nato meetingthe highly classified twenty minutes he had spent with his good friend charles ferguson afterward had been much more demanding the interesting thing about politics was that sometimes though not often you could help to make history just a little bit the door buzzed he walked toward the door drink in hand opened it and oleg punched him very hard just under the breastbone as blakes legs buckled oleg caught him and dragged him backward so that petrovich could wheel in the laundry cart his wrists were handcuffed together with plastic ties his mouth was taped a large plastic tie bound his ankles towels were removed and they hoisted him between them and dropped him in the cart then covered him with the towels again oleg opened the door checked that the corridor was clear and they walked to the end and discovered the service elevator was on its way oleg glanced nervously at petrovich as they waited for the elevator door to open a filipino cleaning woman in hotel uniform and carrying a mop and pail emerged nodded without a word and walked off down the corridor they got in the elevator and descended smiling at each other emerging on the ground floor and pushing the cart out into the courtyard toward the truck kurbsky emerging from the walkway saw everything he remembered oleg and petrovich from the gru safe house outside moscow and the fact that they were pushing the cart said it all the top half of the back of the truck was stretched canvas the bottom half metal opened it provided a ramp to facilitate loading they shoved the cart inside closed the ramp and walked around to board kurbsky was already rushing down the steps as the engine roared and the truck started to move the bottom of the ramp protruded slightly and he got a foot on it and hung on by his left hand clutching the twine that held the canvas tight he reached in his boot found the gutting knife stabbed into the canvas and cut it from top to bottom then he sliced to one side raised the flap he had created and pulled himself through once inside he replaced the knife in his boot found the ski mask in his left leg pocket and pulled it on stuffing his tweed cap into the pocket in its place it was gloomy outside now and even gloomier in the truck there was no sound from the cart and there were several more all full of laundry and he had to force his way through and listen from the back of the cab he could hear voices but not what they were saying he took out the gutting knife and sliced a hole in the canvas on the left side so that a flap hung down and he could see out to where they were going traffic houses but a busy road obviously pushing out of the city he turned to the cart and pulled out the towels revealing blake johnson he had obviously recovered his senses and his eyes were wide open and staring kurbsky spoke to him in street russian heavily accented working class i hear you speak russian if im right nod your head blake did so and kurbsky carried on youve been kidnapped by some pretty bad people theyre taking you to an airfield called berkley down in kent where theres a falcon waiting to take you to moscow or siberia ill take the tape off now so you can talk but keep your voice low he yanked the tape off in one quick pull and blake winced christ that hurt he said in english better we stick to russian blake did who the hell are you you ask too many questions my friend kurbsky sliced the plastic ties at his wrists and ankles there you go his harsh uncultivated tones could have been the voice of some lowlife member of a moscow mafia gang and blake pulling himself out of the laundry cart had to grab hold of the nearest strut to stop himself from falling over whats going on you americans have a thing called extraordinary rendition right i know that can happen and im not proud of it well this is the russian version and im saving you from it but why should you care now you disappoint me mr johnson kurbsky pushed blake so he fell on a pile of towels sit down and shut up he peered out through the hole he had made in the left side of the canopy they were moving out into country now fields woods only the occasional house he turned went to the tailgate and sliced the canvas till it was open from top to bottom then undid the clamps on each side that held the ramp in place and kicked it open so that it trailed down scraping on the road the truck swerved and he grabbed a stanchion and took out the walther blake rolling among the towels as the truck swerved again cried what the hell are you doing making them stop kurbsky said they swerved again into a layby that stood empty for the moment backed by trees and fields there were voices raised and both of the cab doors banged open get ready kurbsky said petrovich and oleg appeared from each side and stood there amazement and shock on their faces good evening comrades kurbsky said cheerfully what is this oleg demanded who are you your worst nightmare mr johnson doesnt fancy the holiday in siberia its the wrong time of year petrovich suddenly pulled a beretta out of his pocket and kurbsky shot him in the hand really stupid that now youve got to manage without knuckles he was out of the truck followed by blake and said get their weapons which blake did now what he asked calmer and in control well you wont want the police in on this and neither will the pride of the gru here so well leave them and drive away these days theyre only a mobile call away from likeminded comrades wholl come running have you got one blake said luckily i always carry it in my pants pocket well there you are ill drop you off at a service station he turned to oleg raise the ramp and put the clip in place on the righthand side ill do the left oleg was bitterly angry his face said it all but he did as he was told until seizing a moment that kurbsky turned pulled out a springblade knife and slashed kurbsky only just managed to ward it off it sliced through the sleeve of the overall and into his left arm kurbsky hit him across the face that was very stupid but you always were a moron he rammed the muzzle against olegs right ear and shot half of it off oleg howled and kurbsky shoved him into petrovich who was trying to stop the bleeding from his knuckles with a handkerchief and failing miserably are you okay blake asked youre bleeding ive bled before kurbsky put the walther in his pocket took off his khaki scarf and bound it around his left arm as tightly as he could he said to the two russians you bastards better call in for room service youre lucky i didnt kill you come on lets get out of here he said to blake went around and climbed up behind the wheel of the truck have you any idea what you look like blake said yes tovarich kurbsky laughed a bank robber or international terrorist take your pick see that big roundabout up ahead that sends us back the other way towards london i drop you at the first service station and you call in your people and im away like ive never been here but you have my friend blake said and thank god for it no problem tovarich said kurbsky and he laughed harshly ten minutes later kurbsky pulled in on the edge of the approach road to a service station there you go he said and blake dismounted as blake turned to say goodbye the truck simply drove away slowing only to enter the traffic stream and kurbsky pulled off the ski mask and pulled on the tweed cap his arm was hurting and he didnt know how bad it was but that was all right a good man had been saved from a bad end that was the thing and he settled down to drive back to london darkness was beginning to fall as he reached marble arch he left the truck on a building site and simply walked away from it once more threading his way through mayfair until he reached the albany regency and went into the parking area and found everything as he had left it he cleared up the cones and his sign his arm hurting got behind the wheel of the ford and drove away hed have a look at the arm when he got back to the house one of those british army wound packs that he had in his bag would take care of it his phone trembled as he was going up abbey road and he pulled in to answer bounine said alex youve been the greatest friend of my life in fact in the old days you saved my life more than once but somethings happened here and ive got to ask you if you know anything about it well i cant answer until i know what it is we got a mobile call from oleg out in the country requesting a pickup for him and petrovich they tell an incredible story im listening bounine covered the facts pretty exactly and when he was finished said forgive me for asking you this but considering what has happened our conversations your interest in the operationcould it in any way have had anything to do with you are you asking for yourself or for luzhkov luzhkov is convinced this masked man must have been sean dillon because he shot off half of olegs right ear he said its dillons trademark well there you are then all the same its a good man saved from a lousy fate so it was nothing to do with you my dear yuri im the man whos had a sister rotting in station gorky for years and who mightrepeat mighthave a chance to bring her back to life if hes a good boy and does as hes told bounines voice changed he said hoarsely of course old friend forgive me to do such a thing would be like a sentence of death for her how could i have been so stupid yuri dont worry about it but i do its luzhkov and his wild talk always me he confides in how he has strong contacts with islamists how he could bring terror to the streets of london if he wanted to fantasyland yuri dreams of power its gone to his head since he found himself facetoface with putin put it out of your mind get a decent nights sleep well talk again he drove into the garage switched off and got out of the van he went out and saw katya watching him through the trees arms folded against the cold he walked toward her have you had a good afternoon i went to the safe house it was a lie and she knew it because roper had phoned asking after him a little earlier she said calmly have you eaten we havent yet i need a shower im not fit for human consumption he joked whats wrong with your arm she said isnt that blood soaking through the scarf what happened nothing its nothing he said ill go and get changed have a shower ill let you know how i feel he went away quickly and she watched him go waited until the lights turned on above the garage she went in troubled and said to svetlana he lied to me he said hed been to the safe house but roper phoned me looking for him and hes hurt himself in some way im worried then go and see him tell him youre worried in the kitchen kurbsky stood at the sink the top half of his overalls hanging down the wound could have been worse the tip of the knife doing the damage but not too deep but it was five or six inches long he had one of the british army wound packs unopened at the side of the sink when the door opened and katya entered she came close and was shocked my god you need the hospital absolutely not ive got everything i need here im an old soldier remember ive had far worse than this she examined it and shook her head i think you should go its a knife wound isnt it what happened a couple of young punks tried to mug me one of them had a knife and there was a struggle i gave them a good hiding end of story except that in hospitals the world over if you tell how it went the police get involved so ill see to it myself you really are very stupid just sit there and wait while i go and get hitesh patel no i dont want him involved well i do she got a bottle of vodka from a cupboard and a glass and filled it drink that shut up and wait she was back in just under fifteen minutes with hitesh who was wearing a blue polo shirt and blazer and carried a black bag what have you got there the tools of the trade kurbsky asked i have my own instrumentsits part of the game he picked up the army wound pack my goodness henri you are well prepared he removed his jacket and hung it on a chair and opened the bags and found some surgical gloves now lets have a look he nodded nasty may i inquire if you have killed anybody i was attacked by two teenage muggers one of them cut me i knocked them about and they cleared off im a judo expert i just dont want to get involved with the police on the other hand youre a young guy just into his career and i wouldnt want to get you in trouble well you wont hitesh said to katya find me a big bath towel to cover the table with some hand towels i note that the central heating is on so that means plenty of hot water is available when you go for those bring pajamas and a robe and ill get him out of his filthy overalls th e wound pack had everything including morphine ampules and he snapped the glass tip off one and jabbed it in is that all right sure its kicking in you know what a cicatrix is of coursea scar from an old wound you have several hitesh smiled whatever else you are you are an interesting man henri duval anyway the kit supplies needles and thread and surgicaltape butterflies i shall try four spaced stitches and fill them in with the butterflies then do it kurbsky turned to katya who had been listening without a word i think another large vodka is definitely indicated here she gave it to him and he tossed it down okay lets get on with it not much more than half an hour later hitesh finished his careful and neat bandaging tightly held together with surgical tape i would suggest a sleeping pill which i shall give you and a good nights sleep he said katya had left them to go and speak to svetlana and she now returned she is quite concerned would you care to eat something with us she asked if you dont mind i think ill take the advice of my excellent doctor and go to bed i think youre wise hitesh said heres your sleeping pill swallow it now ill also leave you some pills strong painkillers that will help you for the next three or four days just read the instructions ill leave you to it youre a star hitesh katya kissed him he walked to the door opened it and smiled of course i havent been here no one saw me right but ill check on him tomorrow hes a lovely young man she said im indebted to him he put his hands on her shoulders and you he kissed her gently on the mouth i am a great worry to you i know this and im sorry it has to be this way however im going to bed and to hell with everything for a while she waited for him to climb the stairs safely and called night bless alex but he was already gone the only sound his bedroom door closing softly so she was not aware of him going to his bathroom and spitting out the sleeping pill she went across to the conservatory and joined svetlana hes gone to bed hitesh gave him something to make him sleep she handed svetlana a vodka and joined her youre still worried about him he lied to me about having been at the safe house im sure hes not telling the truth about how he came to be cut with a knife then do as i say go and see roper and tell him youre worried you know i think i will only send for a cab youve been drinking yes youre right of course she phoned for a cab got her coat on and called roper getting him at once hello he said did our wandering boy turn up id like to see you what now dont say no roper i need to talk im worried about him why is that because when he got back tonight and i asked where hed been he told me the safe house and he had a knife wound in his arm oh dear i sent for a cab i think its here now ill be waiting she looked in on svetlana my cabs here take your time ill wait up for you the cab dropped her at holland park twenty minutes later the judas gate admitted her and doyle met her at the entrance nobody else here but me and the major miss how about a cup of tea it might persuade him to have one that would be nice sergeant she went and kissed roper on the forehead and said good of you to see me so late we never close hows kurbsky i worry about himtoo much i think no thats me why would you he almost came straight out with it his discoveries about tania kurbsky had preyed on his mind and would not go away was there any point in revealing this most painful of truths to kurbsky after so many years but that would mean keeping the facts to himself and in a way that was a burden and not to be shared with anyone doyle brought the tea in a mug each military style miss he withdrew tell me roper said i think ive rather fallen for him silly me i mean im hardly into the first bloom of youth a woman to die for most men would think anyway because i think of him slightly like that i feel ive an instinct about him and it tells me things are not right somethings going on in that head and svetlana agrees he lies to me about where hes been and when i know hes lied that makes me doubt everything you said he lied to you this evening hed been out for some hours drove away in the old ford van wearing navy blue overalls and a tweed cap when he got back i asked him where hed been and he said the safe house which i knew wasnt true andhed been stabbed i found him in the kitchen above the garage trying to treat himself roper was suddenly very serious go on he said young patel is obviously a man of parts he said when she was finished yes a good chap roper said katya were sitting here with the midnight hour approaching the shank of the night when all things seem possible and only because they look highly improbable and im going to take a chance on you by chance i found out something totally devastating about alexander kurbsky today its these damn computers you see and i have a gift for them and if you have that there are no secrets left in this life and how does this refer to alex so he told her about tania and what he had discovered a terrible business she said when he was finished and to learn all that would truly open old wounds for him i saw it as a burden the moment i discovered the details now ive shared that burden with you and without your permission you neednt worry she told him its the knowing what to do about it thats the problem whether to tell him or notbut is that so important she suddenly shivered i dont like us having to discuss him like this will you tell anyone else ferguson he shrugged i havent mentioned the matter to him youre the only one but something else has come up which he does know about and does it concern alex it concerns a friend of ours an american called blake johnson he reached for the whiskey bottle and poured listen and learn you might find it interesting it took some time for she needed to have the whole background of past events laid out for her and of a number of individuals on both sides of the coin when he was finished she sat there considering what he had told her so blake johnson has been targeted twice in plots devised by this colonel boris luzhkov the first time he was saved by sean dillon and billy salter thats right a couple of years ago and this time he was kidnapped by gru operatives on luzhkovs orders and saved by a russian in a black hood a man in a black hood who spoke russian which dillon does and rather well only dillon wasnt responsible for this gig ive spoken to him and so has ferguson hes still in cambridge with lady monica starling katya said calmly are you suggesting what i think you are blake did say the man in the hood was cut with a springblade knife and bound it up with his scarf does that sound familiar but why would he do such a thing it was a good deed in a naughty world from blakes point of view and firstclass professional job from ours no police involved no dramatic story for the media and luzhkov and his people get away with it it never happened katya its a game we play we know that they know and they know that we know does ferguson know about alexs involvement ill have to tell him in the morning yes i can see that the thing is there are big events happening in the next few days things even the media dont know about i was only told a bit about it earlier by ferguson blakes involved but i cant tell you how i see she got up and reached for her coat i must be getting back ive got a lot to think about can i call for a cab sergeant doyle will run you home i insist on it he buzzed for doyle and followed her to the door a strange business so many questions unanswered including the biggest of all whats that she asked how on earth did he know about the attempt to kidnap blake and when it was taking place it was so silly yet so obvious that it hadnt occurred to her i see what you mean doyle appeared in the van and she ruffled ropers hair youve been good to me ill speak to you in the morning at that moment boris luzhkov sat in the living room of his quarters at the embassy with much vodka taken and angrier than he had ever been yuri bounine sitting in an easy chair opposite him had been emptying his glass into a convenient wastepaper basket for some time you know yuri thank god i kept the whole damned affair from the prime minister i meant it to be a surprise my gift to him those idiots oleg and petrovich ill have them transferred to a penal battalion i swear it he poured another vodka and slopped it down ferguson and his damned prime ministers private army and that bastard dillon theyve done it again so you believe the man in the hood was dillon bounine said who else shooting off half of olegs ear is typical of dillon hes famous for it and everybody knows that hes a linguist anyway who else would it be the history of our dealings with these people speaks for itself there was a knock on the door and a young woman entered she had tightly bound blond hair and a trim black suit and was clutching a piece of paper hah its you greta on the night shift again whats happening something unexpected colonel so i thought youd like to hear it straightaway its from our paris embassy well get on with ittell me he poured another vodka as you know vice president hardy is due to depart tomorrow for washington at the last moment however his plane will divert to london he and the british prime minister are meeting with the israeli prime minister and the president of palestine to broker a deal over gaza luzhkov almost choked on his vodka and sat up can this be true it comes from a highly confidential source in french intelligence whos on the gru payroll in paris bounine held out his hand and the girl gave him the sheet major he read it quickly and nodded yes exactly as greta says there hasnt even been a hint of thisin the media in government circles anywhere what the hell are they playing at luzhkov asked politics its as simple as that catch your opponents on the wrong foot everything revolves around the americans luzhkovs immediate response was antagonism who says so the world says so bounine suddenly felt tired the lawyer in him sticking its head out again where did the regime find such people everything seemed to be run by a layer of colonels with halfbrains it was something to do with communism devouring the country for all those yearshad to be america is still the worlds greatest superpower sure it makes mistakes but it can still knock heads together and bring about solutions public negotiations can be endlessly timeconsuming much better to pull a rabbit out of the hat everyones watching the president because the media are like leeches onto every move he makes so send the vice president on normal business to paris then divert him to london and presto everyone gathers on a boat in the thames and scores the public relations coup of the year luzhkov seemed to have sobered up his eyes gleaming his face full of purpose what is this about a boat on the thames bounine examined the message again actually it says our information is that the meeting will probably take place on a riverboat on the thames i presume theyre thinking of the security aspect there make it harder for terrorists what a target though luzhkov clenched a fist what a sensation the death of the four of them would make it would rock the world i should imagine it would bounine said acidly and then he stopped major youre not thinking of luzhkov now seemed like another man listen bounine i am sixtyfive years of age i was born in during the greatest war in russian history when we were brought out of hell to victory by the iron will of josef stalin my father a foot soldier died in the war and my mother took me to live with her parents they were village peasants but the school was good and it led to the army which saw i had a brain and educated me further eventually i was commissioned rising steadily over the years thanks to one thing the communist system it became my religion during the cold war and it is my religion still he leaned forward then the wall came down and communism was kicked to the side in its place all the evils of capitalism flourished the greed spilled over touching every country in the world those who taught me the virtues of communism at my village school were right then and right now chaos is what we must create chaos disorder fear poverty and unrest in the western world because that will more than anything cause a breakdown in society working people will revolt and communist order will be restored there was a long silence because bounine couldnt think of a thing to say that luzhkov believed every word hed said was obvious that the man was a dangerous lunatic was also obvious at least to bounine but he dared not disagree better to wait and listen what would you like me to do colonel this is now a priority the moment it is confirmed that a riverboat is to be used for the meeting i am to be notified the moment we know which boat i am to be notified every scrap of information must be evaluated bounine turned to greta who had stood almost to attention during luzhkovs outburst completely riveted youve heard the colonel greta do you understand whats expected absolutely major get on with it then she went out and he turned to luzhkov what next colonel we need a man bounine to deal with our problem satisfactorily a bad man who is also a madman he chuckled at his rhyme a man who speaks of god but thinks more of money a man who doesnt care and who looks upon each day as the day he may die and you know of such a man yes i know of such a man go and get your coat make sure you have a pistol in your pocket and i will introduce you to him the cab dropped katya at the mews and she let herself in and walked through the garden she paused on the terrace and looked at the garage and there was no light in fact kurbsky was up and watching her through a crack in the curtains his arm felt numb but not unpleasantly so he wore a bathrobe and smoked a cigarette wondering about katya and where she had been he could see through the trees into the conservatory saw her standing and talking to svetlana it was enough he went downstairs found a scarf in the hall to put around his neck and went out and walked cautiously through the trees the door stood open to the terrace he could hear the voices but not distinctly and moved carefully keeping low in the rhododendron bushes until he was close he had missed part of the exchange but svetlanas words made it plain what it had been about so you say the man in the hood who saved this american johnson was alexander can this be true johnson said the man in the hood was cut on the left arm and that he tied his khaki scarf about it that was how alex was when he came home hitesh will confirm it why would he be involved in such a thing i dont know svetlana maybe just a good deed in a bad world he saved the american from an awful fate katyas voice faltered but theres more much more and maybe i shouldnt tell because it will hurt you terribly but i feel that i must it will hurt him terribly too but what can i do she was crying so much so very much and the old lady took her hands what is it my dear you thought tania died in january and was buried in minsky park military cemetery in fact she was sentenced to life at station gorky in siberia she was admitted on january roper discovered it dear god that such a thing could be that my wretched brother should permit such a thing tears were running down svetlanas cheeks shes still there after all these years is that what youre telling me no shes dead now god rest her soul the tears made her choke died of typhoid in that terrible place on march there was a groan from outside and kurbsky appeared in the doorway for gods sake no it cant be true she went to him then putting her arms about him and holding him oh alex my dearest it is true roper broke into all the files and its all there everything that happened to her svetlana put her hands out come to me my dear one come to me he went to her falling on his knees in anguish you dont understand they lied to me she was supposed to be still alive katya crouched on the other side of svetlanas chair who lied to you alex who putin himself boris luzhkov and as svetlana held him close he told them everything bounine was driving as they turned out into kensington high street just follow my directions luzhkov told him its by the river the great and mighty thames i adore history you know its a passion roman ships with slaves at the oars crept up this river two thousand years ago and made the city out of a tribal encampment in between his lecturing he managed to give bounine instructions on their route there was a time when it was the biggest port in the world crammed with ships queuing to get a berth hundreds of cranes docks all over the place now so many are in a state of decay warehouses boarded up its a real tragedy youve been here for a long time bounine said thirteen years the best posting ive ever had i love the place i spend a lot of my time sightseeing particularly the rundown areas its amazing what you find every race under the sun every color youll find them here like nowhere else in the world down by the river tight racial groups a few streets each shops houses they were close to the river and it started to rain as they drove down narrow cobbled streets many of the properties around them boarded up and then they emerged onto an anchorage that had a sign india wharf edged by tall victorian warehouses most boarded in the basin were several moored boats including an old thames barge a curved entrance ran from the basin into one of the warehouses and moored inside was a large orange motorboat with a huge outboard motor they parked the mercedes and got out that thing looks fast said bounine it is fast he gave me a run in it once who did come and meet him he led the way along the wharf there were lights at the windows of the barge a gangplank stretching to a companionway leading below it was closed by two mahogany doors which luzhkov opened ali selim are you there who the fuck is that the voice was very cockney boris luzhkov have you brought any money with you if not you can piss off my dear ali when have i ever let you down luzhkov went down and bounine followed finding himself in a surprisingly wellordered interior the cabin was comfortably furnished with padded benches down each side pictures on the walls where there was room small curtains at the portholes there was a kitchen area behind a bar an archway behind obviously leading to sleeping quarters the man sitting at one end of the table was of mixed blood and looked to be in his fifties an aggressively handsome man with a hooked nose and the look of a predatory hawk about him he had taken an old luger pistol to pieces spread them on a cloth before him and was carefully cleaning them close to his hand was a beretta pistol that he could have picked up in a second his hair was very black and tied in a ponytail that hung to the small of his back and the only muslim thing about him was an egyptian white cotton shirt with wide sleeves he paused at what he was doing and looked bounine over whos this major yuri bounine my second in command another one boris you old bastard they come and go but you go on forever i dont know how you manage to survive your lot being the fucking maggots they are you will forgive alis rather colorful language his father an afghan a deckhand on a cargo ship landed in the pool of london around fiftyfive years ago and formed a relationship with a cockney lady from stepney get it right boris she might have been pregnant but they did marry in church so my old mum was a lady it would displease me to think of you putting it about otherwise heaven forbid that i should think such a thing is this business or pleasure very much business my friend this could be a very big payday for you well just let me fix this and then well have a drink and you can tell me all about it suddenly with incredible speed and as if it were a game he put the pieces of the luger together bounine was amazed that was truly remarkable what would you know you gru guys sit on your arses in some embassy office major bounine was a paratrooper in afghanistan and also served in chechnya luzhkov informed him really ali selim turned to bounine and extended his hand now that i respect a man who went to afghanistan and came back in one piece i truly respect sit down and well have a drink ill be back in a moment he went out and bounine said quite a character a killer of the first water served al qaeda in iraq and beirut he makes big money in the drug business running heroin along the thames he still has family links back in afghanistan which helps with the poppy trade his mobile sounded and he answered he held it out to bounine its greta you take it on deck ill handle ali bounine went up and stood under a canopy in the rain tell me he ordered it is a riverboat a new one built a couple of years ago called the garden of eden it is very luxurious three decks a bit tropical in its ambience sounds like a floating conservatory where will it be cadogan pier chelsea theyll have their discussion then their joyride past the house of commons and disembark at westminster pier preparations have already started good ill be in touch bounine went back to the cabin and found that ali selim had still not returned he quickly told luzhkov what greta had said when were driving back to the embassy we could take a look luzhkov said its near cheyne walk he nodded thinking about it it wouldnt surprise me if they got their heads together before boarding the boat who knows bounine said and ali selim came in is everything all right my friend luzhkov asked a little stomach trouble nothing a large cognac wont cure he drank one at the bar then poured another anyone else there were no takers so lets get on with it whats the game the halfamillionpound kind of game luzhkov said ali selim didnt even blink he swallowed the second cognac put down the glass and leaned on the bar okay tell me everything so luzhkov nodded to bounine afterward bounine said i realize what a hopeless proposition this must sound between the british security services and the vice presidents secret service menlet alone israeli and palestinian securitygetting on the boat would be a nightmare one couldnt even plant a bomb on board luzhkov said theyll go over the garden of eden with a finetooth comb and find nothing bounine said because the bombs elsewhere ali selim nodded come with me he led the way up the companionway and stood under the canopy rain pouring down have a look over there he pointed to the large orange motorboat with the huge outboard i call that running dog and her speed would amaze you some lifeboat stations use them as rescue boats and the river police have a few on the thames so what are you suggesting luzhkov asked selim turned and pointed down at the other boats moored with the canvas covers one of these loaded with semtex would do it sink the garden of eden like a stone come off it bounine said youd need a suicide bomber to do that this isnt baghdad id arrive while its tacking out into the river ill cast off the motorboat so it cant help but collide since it will be carrying seventy pounds of semtex with shorttime pencil fuses it will blow the garden of eden to kingdom come luzhkov looked at him in awe and what about you what about me i sink the running dog in some rundown dockland area await events and vanish if necessary with your halfmillion pounds to comfort me ill be fine i always make out bounine said and the vice president and the others this doesnt bother you not even the president of palestine fuck him major who cares its a lousy world people live and die because these politicians push the pieces around on some gigantic chessboard he led the way down to the cabin again went to the bar made a face almost as if he were in pain and poured another cognac thats better he said was there anything else yes bounine said you mentioned seventy pounds of semtex thats an astonishing amount can you get it at such short notice ali turned dropped to one knee and pulled a khakicolored canvas holdall from a cupboard behind the bar his strength obvious he lifted it and dropped it on the bar he unzipped and opened it and there was the semtex neatly stacked in blocks each covered by greasy paper on top was a large tin he opened it pencil timers see for yourself excellent luzhkov said everything appears to be in perfect order call me when you have the exact departure time now ive got things to do so go bounine said you havent made arrangements for the delivery of the half million arent you worried why would i be ali selim glanced at luzhkov this old bastard knows ill cut his balls off if he crosses me a truly frightening man luzhkov said as they drove away you can say that again bounine said back to the embassy cadogan pier chelsea first and lets see if theres any action at that early hour the streets were quiet and there were many private residences around the pier area but they paused close enough to see the garden of eden tied up at the pier many lights on there were men working particularly at the main boarding point thats a portable electronic arch theyre putting up bounine said everyone will have to pass through it for security itll be the same for the stern area where the crew join the ship or supplies are taken aboard luzhkov nodded it will be as tight as a sardine can i expected no less back to the embassy kurbsky had gone back to his room over the garage for the moment and was sitting on the bed it had been a couple of hours since his confession in the conservatory it had been terribly distressing the whole business particularly for svetlana and now he had retired to think about it in the cold light of dawn his anger was profound every instinct in him wishing to strike back at those who had placed him where he was the dvd showing tania must have been rigged from old footage when she was still alive it was inconceivable that putin hadnt been fully aware of that he could not believe that his friend yuri bounine would have known surely not that but luzhkov must have one thing was certain sitting here and staring at the wall wasnt going to do any good he got up removed his bathrobe and pajama jacket and examined his arm hitesh had done an excellent job what a fine doctor he would make it didnt hurt it just felt numb so he took two of the special painkillers hitesh had provided found the bulletproof vest and managed to pull it on he cut the left sleeve off one of the khaki shirts with breast pockets on either side useful for his mobiles and hurried the rest of the dressing pulling on the french paratroopers boots last fitting the gutting knife in the right he pulled on his knitted hat and looked in the mirror at the strange man he had become he found no answer there got his bag went down to the garage and threw it in the ford then called bounine back at the embassy bounine had tried to pull himself together after his nocturnal activities by taking a hot shower and finding a change of clothes for the active day he suspected lay ahead he answered his phone at once and kurbsky said youre probably the best friend i have in the world so prove that friendship by telling me the truth but i believe i always have alex what is this what if i told you roper has succeeded in breaking into the secret files of station gorky and has discovered that my sister tania was sentenced to life in perpetuity in yes but you knew that it was in the file with the dvd the putin file you defended him to me i remember said it had all happened before his time look alex where is this leading to my sisters death from typhoid on march there was a moment of stillness he lied yuri our beloved prime minister lied and whoever put the file together lied was it just handed over to luzhkov is it conceivable the bastard didnt know i didnt old friend on my mothers soul i didnt know what are you going to do the big question is what ferguson and his people are going to do ive done plenty already killed vronsky the three lads on the midnight express that bastard basayev and his minder and i sorted out oleg and petrovich so it was you i couldnt tell you before when i was still supposed to be earning tanias freedom what are you going to do couldnt you do some sort of deal with ferguson you realize im the invisible man i dont exist theoretically they could lock me up and throw away the key damn it alex youre still alexander kurbsky whoever that is who does luzhkov think shot oleg hes convinced it was sean dillon hes incensed alex packing johnson off to siberia was going to be an unexpected gift to putin i can see how it would upset him hes gone slightly crazy hes been ranting like an oldfashioned communist talking about causing chaos and disorder in the west overthrowing capitalism careful comrade kurbsky told him dont tell me too much im an enemy of the state remember and bounine who had been on the verge of telling him of the nights adventures with luzhkov hesitated and drew back so what are you going to do alex i havent the slightest idea yuri but id better get moving i imagine charles ferguson will be sending somebody to arrest me at any moment im surprised they havent already ill go to ground somewhere what do i say to luzhkov tell the bastard it wasnt dillon it was me and tell him how things have worked out to hell with putin and to hell with boris luzhkov for what hes done to me he pocketed his phone and turned to find katya leaning on the door arms folded how long have you been there he asked long enough whos yuri my best friend and comrade from afghanistan and chechnya hes one of the good guys when i got involved in this whole mess i asked for him to be transferred from dublin because i wanted a friend i could trust hes a major and luzhkovs righthand man reallyand your friend he thinks luzhkov is rubbish so where are you going now ill hide myself somewhere and give myself some time i think you should simply walk to holland park sit down and talk it through thats not on my agenda im afraid for all you know i might decide to wait in the street one rainy night and shoot boris luzhkov in the head what a wonderful thought he opened the garage door and she moved and caught his sleeve please alex dont go he shook his head and gently removed her hand dont waste your time on me katya im a dead man walking it was a terrible thing to say and she took an involuntary step back he got behind the wheel of the van and drove away bounine sought luzhkov out and found him in his office ah there you are yuri luzhkov said ive just had confirmation of the timing one hundred guests will be arriving between noon and half past cocktails and a buffet the four gentlemen involved arrive at one which indicates as we thought that they will already have had most of their discussions the garden of eden will slip its mooring at onethirty sail past the house of commons and passengers will disembark at westminster pier have you informed ali selim of all this ive just come off the phone he seems very happy but then hes that kind of man a hunter scenting his prey perhaps but ive something to tell you of great importance perhaps it can wait this other matter bounine cut in no colonel this is far more important i have a question to put to you tania kurbsky was admitted to station gorky on january are you aware that she died there of typhoid on march luzhkov looked stunned what nonsense is this not nonsense the putin file the dvd is all fake a plot to persuade alexander kurbsky to follow the path you and the prime minister laid out for him luzhkov shook his head she is there in the camp she has been for years ive seen her on the dvd and you know these kinds of things can be easily faked have you seen her in person no colonel because she did die on march and i can assure you confirmation of that fact is in station gorkys files so kurbsky has done everything for nothing luzhkov said hoarsely im afraid so its a good thing hes not standing here in my place hed probably shoot you but i didnt know i swear it with a certain pity in his voice bounine said i actually believe you theres one more thing you should know however the man in the black hood who saved blake johnson it wasnt dillon after all it was kurbsky he couldnt stand the idea of someone else being shipped off to that same terrible place as his sister ill leave you to think about what that all means and what his mood is right now oh and i think youll find that by now ferguson and roper have discovered that kurbskys defection is false their mood probably isnt much better he turned and walked out dillon and monica drove down from cambridge and made straight for holland park where they were soon joined by the salters and then roper this is a right carryon weve been hearing harry said youre saying that kurbsky saved blake johnson from being kidnapped by luzhkovs lot and shot two of them up yes theres no doubt about it it was definitely kurbsky because he got a knife wound in the left arm and katya found him bleeding above the garage in chamber court well all i can say is hes certainly done blake a favor and no bleeding mistake harry said and thats not all said roper i think he was the one who knocked off shadid basayev and his minder in that cemetery in mayfair monica said but why would he do that basayev was a chechen general a monster of epic proportions he butchered people left right and center amongst them were men under kurbskys command tortured unspeakably i think kurbskys been under a lot of stress and i think ive discovered why he always believed his sister was wounded and then died in the rioting in moscow in and was buried in a place called minsky park tapping away at my computer i discovered she was secretly sentenced to life imprisonment in the station gorky gulag in siberia and she died there in they had been unaware of katya standing in the doorway behind them listening she said now im afraid theres much more to it than that at the same moment charles ferguson appeared behind her just arrived and unbuttoning his coat whats all this then can anyone join in roper brought him up to scratch and ferguson said its an incredible business katya as i was coming in i got the sense you had something important to add he turned to her go on my dear were listening he believed the lie fed to him by his father that his sister was in that grave in minsky park and you told me how sorry you were to have to tell him shed been sentenced to life imprisonment in station gorky he already knew that hed been told only a couple of months ago that she was still alive and that he could earn her release by making a false defection that would introduce him into the center of british securityyou people it was by presidential decree and he was shown a doctored dvd to prove she was alive oh my god monica said everything from meeting you in new york monica to all that happened later was like following a script those three gru men on the train to brest were not informed that their masters wanted him to defect the men were ordered to kill him if he tried to he was blackmailed pure and simple he killed basayev because the chechen was a monster who butchered his friends he saved blake johnson because although he was supposed to be under luzhkovs orders he couldnt bear to see another human being buried alive in station gorky there was a moments silence and harry said why is it i think of cheering for the guy ferguson said where is he now katya he received a nasty stab wound as a result of the johnson affair and hes gone off somewhere to bury himself in london tell him to come in i have good ferguson got up and turned to roper the computer room and id be obliged if youd get me luzhkov the rest of you are welcome to listen luzhkov had just called bounine back into his office when he received fergusons call my dear charles what a pleasure dont dear charles me you bastard two things number one i now know everything about alexander kurbsky i held you and your master in a poor light before but i now totally despise you we intend to help kurbsky in any way we can hes already done us and the president of the united states a wonderful favor by saving blake johnson from a truly terrible fate let me make myself perfectly clear if you in any way again involve yourself in matters detrimental to the interests of the united states or the united kingdom i shall personally see to it that you and at least twenty of your gru staff at the embassy in london are packed off to moscow with twentyfour hours notice damn you general you cant do that try me ferguson said he nodded to roper who switched off so now to the days really important business the meeting on the garden of eden which gives me great pride harry said since its my riverboat company that owns the garden of eden i am aware of that ferguson said and were all very grateful now as you would expect the substance of the accord the measures proposed for improvement in the gaza situation will be announced and signed by the big four aboard the boat a certain amount of jubilation will ensue the people on the garden of eden will then have a jolly for a while take in the houses of parliament and disembark at westminster pier for which there will be no charge to the national exchequer harry pointed out im proud to serve youll get a knighthood yet harry ferguson told him as to security lord arthur tilseys seeing to our people there will also be the vice presidents secret service men and of course the israelis and palestinians have added security as well and what about us dillon asked ill be there obviously you and billyand i think monica youll blend in well with the great and the good monica as an extra pair of eyes and ears he turned to katya i think youd be better employed handling the kurbsky situation so everybodys going to have fun but me roper pointed out this is a very particular day ferguson said no one could be more important than you roper viewing the entire proceedings on your screens via the cctv cameras of all people you will be in control now youre stroking me but true enough his fingers danced over the keys and there on screen was the garden of eden at cadogan pier a hive of activity theres a much better view from here anyway so get out of here all of you just go away and have an absolutely wonderful time they all moved on except katya i know i wasnt supposed to tell anyone what you discovered about him it just all poured out a good thing it did it was svetlana i had to tell her and he was on the terrace of the conservatory and overheard its all right he reached for her hand its worked out for the best or lets hope it has but whats going to happen to him he could always seek asylum sit around here till his hair grows back write a truly great book and reappear on the international scene there was hope on her face would that be possible well if we wouldnt have him the yanks certainly would after what he did for blake johnson president cazalet would see to that what a world she shook her head isnt it anyway you go home and reassure svetlana and if kurbsky calls you let me know at once she went leaving him there in his only true home endgame kurbsky had driven around the streets for some considerable time with absolutely no idea of a destination his codex trembled on occasion and when he checked it indicated katya he didnt reply because he couldnt think of anything to say he finally lost himself in a maze of side streets in the general area of the dark man and cable wharf he found a small caf√© on a corner and had a burger and a cup of tea while he thought there was a television behind the bar and a bulletin came on the news of the days events having leaked old footage of each of the big four came on as the reporter talked and then some stuff showing the garden of eden and all the preparations under way it was raining again just to make things difficult for the workers and it occurred to him that the men in suits should have considered the possibility of bad march weather on the thames he returned to the ford got behind the wheel and his codex trembled katya again this time he decided to speak to her where are you she asked does it matter backstreets the river hows svetlana very upset obviously ive been to holland park and met with ferguson and the others they understand alex they really do now that they know everything ferguson wants you to just come in really absolutely he told me that was what i had to tell you if we spoke but theres something more and what would that be he had us all in the computer room while he spoke to luzhkov on the speakerphone told him he was aware of his part in the whole business from the blackmailing of you with the fake dvd and file to the attempt to kidnap blake johnson what did he say in reply there wasnt much he could say she told him about fergusons threat of mass deportation kurbsky actually found that quite amusing it would certainly denude the embassy of staff there are dozens of gru people posing as commercial attach√©s economic attach√©s even arts attach√©s it would hit the bastards hard to be banished back to moscow anyway you must think hard alex theyre all busy today with this conference on the thames yes i saw something about that on a caf√© television please alex im begging you if not for me then svetlana he was very touched give me a little time ill see how i feel perhaps i could come back to chamber court again tonight your armis it okay of course it is hitesh did a wonderful job ill be fine which wasnt strictly true because it had been aching badly for some time he found the bottle of painkillers hitesh had given him it said two so he took four then drove away charles fergusons onslaught left luzhkov in a rage he got the vodka out swilled it down and stamped around his office in a fury that bastard ferguson to treat me like this i should point out that were on his patch colonel he has the legal right to do what he has threatened and we would have the right to respond to kick people out from the british embassy in moscow bounine was all lawyer now but perhaps prime minister putin wouldnt like that or president medvedev i dont care about all that luzhkov raged it would be a pity if one or both of them came to the conclusion that you had acted unadvisedly in this matter itd be a great pity to lose the delights of london after thirteen years it was enough and for luzhkov obviously a sobering thought yes it makes sense he sighed maybe we should cancel the operation i wonder how ali selim will take that bounine said half a million up the spout hell be sensible weve worked together before and well work together again bounine nodded do you want me to stay while you phone him luzhkov was not happy and it showed a phone call he would take badly he is a man of uncertain temper as you will have noticed he turned to the wall safe behind his desk opened it and disclosed stacks of cash he took a canvas bag from a lower shelf and tossed packets of money in it he pushed it across the desk give him this fifty thousand pounds with my compliments for his time fifty thousand pounds for nothing believe me its the safest course with that one take it to him now he frowned are you refusing to obey my order major of course not then the sooner you go the sooner you get back if i get back bounine thought he took the bag and withdrew he left at once and was at india wharf in little more than half an hour yuri bounine was a brave man for he could not have survived afghanistan and chechnya if he had not been but in this case he was dealing with a very unbalanced human being he had a stechkin pistol in his raincoat pocket which he suspected would not do him much good if it came down to a handtohand struggle so he would just have to trust his luck he opened the doors at the head of the companionway and called ali selim its bounine colonel luzhkov has sent me to see you he has a message for you then come below and give it to me he was sitting at the end of the table the beretta pistol at his right hand beside an early edition of the standard which carried a picture of the garden of eden on the front page he looked up im just bringing myself up to speed on whats happening i was watching it on television a little while ago he frowned then said calmly theres something up isnt there bounine tried a joke you know what they say dont shoot the messenger he wants to cancel ali selim poured a cognac has he got a reason he thinks moscow wont like it itll cause too much trouble on the international scene why didnt he come himself because hes afraid of you and you are not when i was in the russian army i fought afghans for long enough to learn something about them you invited me in im a guest in your dwelling he put the bag on the table he said this is his gift to you for your trouble how much fifty thousand pounds ali selim laughed out loud at any other time i might have said yes but today not only does his fifty thousand quid mean nothing even his half million means fuck all could you explain that bounine sat down on one of the benches you want to know why ive been pouring cognac down me like its gone out of style pains in my gut started four weeks ago and i discovered that a slug of cognac kills the pain for a while a short while bounine said exactly so i saw the doctor had the tests and he phoned me up an hour ago wanted me to go and see him but im a big boy now so i told him to come straight out with it and cancer in my liver and lights already spreading like wildfire no chance with surgery and too late for chemo how long three months tops he laughed and poured more cognac and i dont fancy that bounine it sounds too much like a kind of torture so what do you fancy ali laughed wickedly like going out in a blaze of gloryor should i say semtex now how do you think luzhkov would feel about that it would be like one of those old blackandwhite war movies with a title like torpedo run the smile was quite mad but he obviously meant it i dont think luzhkov would approve at all bounine said what a shame hed be getting it for free and id give him all the credit he got up went behind the bar and opened a cupboard this is where i keep my flags he rummaged around and turned with a red flag hammer and sickle and god bless mother russia so what do you think that luzhkov would be so hostile to the idea that he might warn the british security services or scotland yard about what you intended no i dont think so ive handled a number of operations for him over the years and ill just mention one it was before your time here four years ago the liverpool shoppingmall bomb that was put down to al qaeda twelve dead twentyone injured that was me part of luzhkovs breakupofmoderncapitalism campaign ten years ago i arranged five different bombings in belfast during the troubles also part of his obsession with causing chaos in the western world i could prove all this the russian journalist dolishny who supposedly committed suicide from the terrace of his tenthfloor apartment in clapham two years ago him too he didnt fall he was pushed by you who else and in that case ive got a tape of our discussions setting the thing up so everything else would be just your word what would he have to do to persuade you to give him that tape this he comes here and faces me he doesnt inform on me to the british authorities he gets the tapeand i leave at once to intercept the garden of eden too late for anyone to stop me the smile was that of a raving lunatic and he laughed harshly and looked at his watch youve got plenty of time go and speak to him bounine nodded ill do as you say as he got to the companionway ali said bounine just remember this i dont give a fuck im going to die and if it isnt today its going to be soon so theres nothing he can do to me got it bounine drove back to the embassy as quickly as he could the whole thing was out of control and yet some sense of military discipline and loyalty to his country still argued that his duty was to support and defend luzhkov in any way possible it then struck him that that must have been the argument some young ss officer had faced when his boss was heinrich himmler he found luzhkov in his office yuri his boss said is the matter concluded anything but bounine told him exactly what had taken place luzhkov was thrown but this is terrible what can i do well you obviously cant warn ferguson or anyone else in intelligence because if they get their hands on ali selim youve had it that tape alone would ruin you never mind his confession on other matters hes mad luzhkov said no hes dying and he doesnt care now what are you going to do about the garden of eden would you consider a phone call to the authorities luzhkov said i dont give a damn about the bloody boat my problem is ali selim you should have shot him frankly in his unbalanced state i consider myself lucky to have got off his barge in one piece then you must go back and say please can i have the tape and then shoot him this is nonsense colonel if you want the tape you must face him luzhkov was looking increasingly desperate all right but you must come with me you must find an opportunity to shoot him he poured a vodka with a shaking hand and swallowed it down he took a deep breath i order you bounine it was a defining moment for yuri bounine an epiphany he was tired so tired and sick of the whole business of the gru and men like boris luzhkov and putin and the bleak prospect of a return to moscow to serve a system that had treated alexander kurbsky the way it had this man was part of it a man to whom others were completely unimportant who considered only his own selfinterest he glanced at his watch and said right colonel ill do as you say but ive things to do well leave in twenty minutes he went straight to his quarters locked the door went into the bathroom and called kurbsky on his mobile phone please please answer alex if theres a god in heaven make him answer and in wapping sitting in the ford beside a decaying warehouse looking out over the thames kurbsky was aware of the tremble and answered is that you yuri whats happening so bounine told him when the story was finished kurbsky said its a hell of a pickle yuri india wharf ill find where it is and you and that bastard luzhkov make your way there and well meet up do we speak to ferguson or somebody like that theyre busy with the boat meanwhile this ali selim is sitting waiting for you at india wharf well simply make sure he doesnt get to leave at cadogan pier there was a kind of confusion a buildup of traffic and people as guests started to arrive and that bad march weather swept in across the thames reducing visibility considerably ferguson was elsewhere aiding the prime minister with the consultations being held by the big four at downing street but dillon and monica were already on board the garden of eden with harry salter cracking the whip over the management and crew dillon left monica in the lower lounge area and he and billy traveled the boat from stem to stern and deck by deck with a clutch of security and secret service people in tow headed by a colonel john henry who was directly responsible for the vice president the three of them finally ended on the bridge where they found the captain arthur henderson wearing an obviously brandnew uniform for the occasion it was billy he addressed is everything to your satisfaction mr salter it bleeding well is billy told him a tight ship captain henderson my uncle will be well pleased and you gentlemen henderson turned to dillon and henry there isnt a door that hasnt been opened three or four times said henry my only regret is the weather march you see colonel and when it rains on the thames it rains believe me im afraid it will get worse before it gets better it was already pouring with enough wind to drive it across the river in a gray curtain making the view of the other side vague and ill defined billy looked down to the decks well youve rolled out all the canopies you can they can stand out under those enjoying their drinks when it gets too crowded inside down below on the approach to the pier limousines were delivering guests and umbrellas were everywhere as people pressed toward the pier hurrying to get out of the rain i must see how my boys are getting on colonel henry said and left big day captain billy said my uncle takes it very seriously so do we all mr salter billy led the way dillon followed and they arrived at the deck lounge and bar there was music playing a jazz quartet set up on a dais in one corner plenty of roving waiters on hand in white monkey jackets already offering champagne to early arrivals monica came toward them is everything okay tight as a drum dillon took two glasses of champagne from a passing waiters tray and handed her one heres to smooth sailing heres to the big four producing an accord thats really going to make things better in gaza monica said well it would be nice to think so dillon managed a diplomatic smile heres to us anyway harry arrived and he was agitated look at it the bleeding weather and where are we going to put them all dont worry thats why we have deck canopies billy told him they can stand outside harry reached for a champagne himself i suppose so if worse comes to worst he looked thoughtful i was wondering he said do you think i ought to put up one of those plaques commemorating today dillon laughed out loud and monica reached over and kissed harry on the forehead ive said it before harryyou are a oneoff at chamber court katya and svetlana sat in the conservatory discussing the kurbsky situation do you really think he will return to us tonight svetlana asked i desperately hope so a new beginning for him perhaps svetlana nodded or should i say another new beginning when you consider his life his childhood his time with kelly and me here in belsize must have been a special experience for him a release from the communist regime that had damned his life katya sighed all snatched away by his fathers wickedness no my dear thats too simple yes my brother was corrupted by his political beliefs and his position in the kgb was more important to him than his children but everything in this sorry business stemmed from tanias behavior she was a wild child who was indulged by her father and became even wilder as a student the consequences we know if she hadnt involved herself in the student uprising of eightynine had stayed home alexander would have carried on here would never have found the military and undergone the appalling experiences of afghanistan and chechnya yes i can see that but enough i think lets turn on the television and see whats happening with the big four kurbsky found india wharf with no trouble in a decaying area of dockland just twenty minutes downriver from wapping he braked on the edge of the basin taking in the situation quicklythe barge the motorboats and the running dog berthed inside the archway he already had a walther in the righthand pocket of his coat he quickly opened the secret compartment in his bag and found the colt he couldnt put on an ankle holster the french paratroop boots were too high and he had the gutting knife hidden in the right one he slipped the colt into the belt at the small of his back and got out there was the roar of an engine and the running dog reversed out of the archway a man standing at the wheel he smiled hello there what can i do for you this had to be ali selim kurbsky knew that because bounine had mentioned the orange boat and its strange name i seem to be lostits like a maze back there the running dog taxied in beside the barge and ali selim cut the engine and looped a line on a stanchion he stepped across to the rear deck of the barge and from there to the wharf where were you looking for kurbsky couldnt think of a thing to say except wapping high street ali had taken a pack of cigarettes out and was lighting one hah you couldnt be more out of the way man he walked forward two steps very fast and pushed kurbsky off the wharf into the water he went down maybe ten feet struggling his left arm clumsy and rose pulling with his right and surfaced to find ali selim squatting on his haunches holding the beretta and pointing it straight at him do exactly as i say or ill blow your fucking head off do you follow me half choking kurbsky nodded yes just come up those few steps and join me the ladder was ancient and rusting and stretched from the water three or four feet to the wharf i cant kurbsky said my left arm is injured hmm all right you look like a serious man ill believe you ali tossed the end of a line down loop it round and ill pull which he did demonstrating his enormous strength and kurbsky ended up on his knees spewing up water ali stood him up and did a quick search and discovered the walther youve got taste my friend but a man like you would always have an ace in the hole ankle holder maybe he bent down and patted no lets have a look at your waistband at the rear he found the colt i approve especially with hollowpoint cartridges i take care my friend i take care i can see that kurbsky told him thinking of the two mobile phones ali had missed in his shirt breast pocket ali said so your arms fucked take off your coat and prove it kurbsky did awkwardly disclosing his heavily bandaged left arm minus a shirtsleeve ali nodded i see what you mean what was the problem i didnt duck fast enough it was a knife i knew i was right about you you can tell a fellow pro instantlyat least i can a man like you would only be here on business he shrugged so i suppose id better put you back in the water permanently he raised the beretta and paused because kurbskys woolen cap had come off in the water theres something funny about your skull you look like one of those buddhist monks are you into zen or something kurbsky saved his life at least for the moment no im into the death business chemotherapy youve got cancer of the lung he started to shake from the bitter cold standing there in the pouring rain the visibility so bad on the thames that you couldnt see the other side confronting this dangerous madman and he knew that his life dangled from a thread lung cancer ali selim said thats a bad deal ive got cancer too he paused looking at kurbsky oh hell lets get you below and find you something warm to wear if im going to shoot you at least youll be comfortable right right and he started to laugh i was right kurbsky thought hes crazy as a loon he took his time going below clutching the banister with his right hand there was still the gutting knife in his paratroopers boot and the two mobiles in his shirt pockets any attempt to use one of those would lead to instant death he had never been more certain of anything in his life ali selim followed close behind shooed him down to the end of the table went behind the bar and found a towel which he tossed to him go on dry yourself a little which kurbsky did when im hurting i find cognac helps what about you vodka ah so youre another russkie i might have known with that bastard luzhkov involved he put a bottle of vodka on the table and three glasses help yourself three glasses kurbsky said were expecting company arent we come on you wouldnt kid a kidder kurbsky had a large one and poured another were you an army man thats right afghanistan and chechnya heh im half afghanistan and half cockneyisnt that a hell of a mixture yes i suppose it is ali selim opened a long cupboard in the corner by the bar and rummaged his eyes not leaving kurbsky for a moment he produced a navy blue linen sailing smock with wide sleeves help yourself kurbsky said thank you i will he pulled it on then poured another large vodka and swallowed it down and it started to burn and it suddenly occurred to him that there was absolutely nothing he could do about his situation ali selim said that major bounine who was with luzhkovis he a friend of yours you could say that i thought so but i dont think he likes luzhkov he poured a touch more cognac in his glass they are coming arent they it would have been pointless for kurbsky to deny it yes that was the general idea luzhkov is coming well he would be because he wants something from me something very important so i believe ali nodded you interest me im not sure how you fit in just helping a friend out bounine i cant see a man like you finding much to interest him in a worm like luzhkov there was the sound of a car engine outside so here they are he poured vodka into kurbskys glass and cognac in his own heres to you my friend he emptied his glass in the end all roads lead to hell you could be right kurbsky swallowed the vodka well find out soon enough up on deck and well greet them properly you first and ali selim pushed him to the door of the companionway at belsize katya and svetlana sat watching the television and the weather was even more disastrous than ever the thames was totally shrouded the congestion to the cadogan pier had been reinforced by the rain and the motor cavalcade bearing the big four had arrived a little while ago the cameras were covering the boat but also roamed over the river and as the commentators kept saying it was impossible to see a thing its a washout if you ask me katya said it would appear so im glad were not there roper was glad too high and dry as he viewed everything on his screen he spoke to billy who was wearing an earpiece all the world and his wife there and all putting the booze away like its no tomorrow the vice president just made an announcement that everythings been worthwhile and we look to the future with hope where have i heard that before roper said and he remembered to thank the prime minister for the use of the hall and his warm support did he remember to thank harry for the use of the garden of eden piss off roper well be leaving downriver in half an hour see you later th e mercedes was parked at the end of the wharf bounine got out and stood looking at them kurbsky said i cant help yuri hes already had me in the water ali selim said dont stand there looking at me as if this is the gunfight at the ok corral or i just might shoot you he means it yuri id do as he says kurbsky called get your boss out ali selim said and keep in front of the mercedes so i can see you and watch your hands yuri opened the passenger door and luzhkov got out he stood there looking terrified and ali walked to the other side of the wharf paused for a moment as if daring someone to shoot him in the back then turned so you dont want me to blow up the garden of eden have you spoken about it to anyone before god i have not i swear it luzhkov said i can vouch for that bounine said he couldnt care less about the boat and the people on it he told me so its his future hes worried about both here and in moscow that tape could destroy him what tape ali selim turned to face luzhkov and barked that harsh laugh there is no tape you maggot if there were it would have me on it condemning myself do i look stupid his arm swung up and he shot luzhkov between the eyes hurling him back over the edge of the wharf into the water it was so instant so brutal that it took the breath away bounine didnt make a move ali selim said if youd pulled a pistol old son youd have been swimming with him now but ill keep you a bit longer because you could be useful ease your piece out and throw it in the water and use your left hand bounine did exactly as he was told now what back down to the cabin walk in front of your friend bounine led the way and they paused at the end of the table selim said sit down for a minute they did and kurbsky said what happens now ali selim opened another wardrobe and pulled out three yellow and black fluorescent jackets each of you put one on and help him with his arm he told bounine he retreated and put one on himself quickly then he found a life jacket pulled it over his head and tied the tapes at his waist they had done as they were told and now he took some plastic ties from a drawer wrists both of you behind the back do your friend he told bounine again bounine struggled but kurbskys left arm wouldnt bend it wont work then tie them in front of him and ill do you it was finished and they stood looking at him and he produced the holdall from behind the bar put it on the table and opened it he leaned over and sniffed i love that smell semtex ive blown up parts of belfast in my day with this stuff and the ira got the blame mind you its no use without these he took out the tin box and opened it pencil timers if youll excuse me gentlemen he went to work quickly and deftly to do what needed to be done and finally zipped up the bag im going to blow them all to hell so lets get on with it bounine led the way followed by kurbsky who said as they went up to the stern deck tell me one thing why the lifejacketyou wont need that in hell but its what some nosy river police patrol boat would expect me to wear a legal requirement you think of everything what are you going to do with my friend i could shoot him but i wouldnt like him down there in the same water as luzhkov you and i want to go all the way and together he turned to bounine hes got cancer like me its better this way he hasnt got cancer bounine said youre crazy dont say that and he does have cancer he told me you only have to look at him anyway kurbsky said of course ive got cancer selim but he hasnt let him go thats perfectly correct so ill tell you what ill do just before we turn to run into the garden of eden ill roll him over the side with his bloody hands tied who knows if he kicks and struggles enough he might float its all in the hands of god though im not sure which one now down the steps and sit side by side in the stern go on do it bounine went first and kurbsky followed gingerly and they got themselves settled ali selim followed put the bag containing the semtex close to the prow and cast off they drifted out a little the body of luzhkov in the water a few feet away ali selim crouched down this is it the big moment the running dog does forty knots tops so when i turn it up we fly its all going to happen very quickly do you understand ill be at cadogan pier in fifteen minutes youd better believe it i think by now youve made your point kurbsky said no russian flag fuck the hammer and sickle attempt anything out of order and ill just give you each a bullet in the head he stood up the rain pouring and said cheerfully what a terrible day to die on he went and sat behind the wheel switched on the engine and moved out into the thames and turned upriver and fly running dog did at an incredible speed particularly considering the weather the rain like a lace curtain obscuring everything the garden of eden had cast off and was moving out into the channel to proceed downriver toward the house of commons when captain henderson on the bridge beside the helmsman saw the moving dot on the radar screen ferguson harry salter dillon and monica were below but billy who didnt drink and found most social gatherings boring had joined the captain henderson said what the hell is that the helmsman said by god its shifting ive never known such a speed on the river billy reached for a pair of glasses and focused them its one of those orange jobs like the police and customs use i think it could be the police theyre wearing the right jackets theres one guy at the wheel and two in the stern its difficult to work out whats happening its bouncing about and with all that spray and the rain you cant see much i dont like it henderson said its already veering off center ill try the hooter the warning blast echoed in the rain and ali selim laughed there they are already working out ready to proceed downriver too late he wont have time to maneuver on the boat itself there was no alarm no panic as the music played and people enjoyed themselves and the vice president of the united states gladhanded his way through the crowd followed by blake johnson but on ropers screens it was different what in hell is that he said to sergeant doyle who was standing beside him he tried for a closeup but the curtain of rain and spray defeated him ali selim standing up at the wheel howled with delight there she is ready and waiting kurbsky and bounine had been drenched with waves engulfing them and it had taken time for kurbsky to wrestle the gutting knife free with his bound hands he showed it to bounine who half turned holding up his wrists at the rear and kurbsky sliced through he held out his hands and bounine freed him and gave the knife back to him kurbsky stabbed into the thwart of the running dog the razorsharp blade doing terrible damage and it swerved and immediately started to slow ali selim turned hanging on to the wheel trying to keep his balance bounine and kurbsky tried to stand up everything seemed to happen at once ali selim held on to the wheel with one hand and drew his beretta loosing off a shot wildly as the boat swerved bounine was hit in the right shoulder and knocked back in the stern seat you bastard ali selim cried and shot kurbsky twice once in the nylonandtitanium jacket the second round passing straight through the left hip he turned back to concentrate on the steering the boat slowing down and kurbsky flung himself against his back sliding his right hand around and cutting his throat ali selim fell to his knees bowing his head across the steering wheel as his life ebbed away over to the left the garden of eden was virtually invisible in the rain and mist the engine suddenly died and the running dog drifted half full of water pushed by the current bounine was trying to sit up kurbsky sliced the waist tapes of ali selims life jacket removed it and went and looped it over his friends head hang on old lad were going for a swim the bag alex bounine croaked the semtex of course things seemed to be happening in slow motion for kurbsky i think well leave it to go down with the ship he was kneedeep in water as he helped his friend over the side and followed him the tidal current pulled them away kurbsky holding on to a strap on bounines life jacket the running dog had disappeared completely now it was quiet distant city sounds the rain muffling everything and then the surface of the river heaved and an enormous fountain jetted up the sound echoing with a curious flatness in the computer room roper said and what in the hell was that to doyle and hurriedly called ferguson on his mobile connecting with him instantly whats going on ferguson said dont know it wasnt us there was some craft proceeding very fast midriver and then it stopped and there was a muffled bang the river police are investigating in extreme conditions a fiveknot current can be found on the thames but three knots is relatively common and it was enough to push kurbsky and bounine at some speed downriver there was a certain amount of traffic but visibility was so poor they simply werent seen theyd been in the water at least forty minutes hypothermia kicking in when their luck changed and a strong eddy in the water swept them in toward the shore they drifted in toward an entrance between two wharfs a notice board paint peeling said puddle dock bounine said what the hell does that mean english humor yuri who cares were alive only just bounine gasped as they were swept in between stone piers and ended up at broad stone steps leading down into the water it was only when attempting to scramble out of the water onto the steps that kurbsky realized how serious his wound was he sprawled on a step in considerable pain the bastard got you twice bounine said i think id have been dead if i hadnt been wearing a bulletproof vest but the other ones in the right hip its bad yuri what about you now were out of the water i can see youre bleeding like crazy left shoulder bounine looked about him at the decaying building the rotting barges the total desolation well i dont know what were doing here at the backside of the world but were alive alex at least for the moment what do we do kurbsky took out a mobile from his right breast shirt pocket waterproof i think well hand ourselves in roper answered at once good god alex where are you in a bad way roper with my good friend yuri bounine luzhkovs dead at the hands of a very bad article named ali selim who was going to blow up the garden of eden using a fast orange rescue boat with seventy pounds of semtex primed with shorttime pencil fuses in a suitcase bounine and i were his prisoners we managed to break free i cut his throat and the boat went down and blew up in the process bounine and i got shot to pieces we must have left a quart of blood each drifting downriver with the currentand lets get one thing straight in case i die on you bounines one of the good guys in this treat him right where are you roper demanded dont laugh but according to the sign its called puddle dock i cant go oni think im going to pass out which he did dropping the codex on the step and bounine picked it up roper was saying hang on alex hang on well send a helicopter bounine here whatever you send it better be quickhes out of it and im not feeling too good myself he leaned against kurbsky tried to put his good arm around him and fainted katya and svetlana had moved back to the conservatory after turning off the television the buzzer sounded and katya discovered billy salter on the screen let me in katya its important she did and was waiting at the front door when he appeared in his alfa romeo he got out and she knew from his face it was bad news what is it billy id rather keep it for both of you that bad im afraid so he followed her in and along to the conservatory where they found svetlana sitting on her wicker throne why mr salter its you and my news isnt too good then let us hear it so the helicopter found them half dead at this place puddle dock and rushed them straight to rosedene its in the same area of holland park local people assume its a nursing home but its a very private hospital maintained for security personnel run by professor charles bellamy the finest general surgeon in london i should knowhes put me back together again twice and hes operating now katya asked he and his assistants are taking care of both alex and this bounine guy as we speak the very best of treatment and by god theyve earned it the prime minister the israeli prime minister the president of palestine and the vice president of the united states if this guy ali selim had managed to bring it off it would have shaken the world to put it mildly katya said so can we go now to this rosedene svetlana asked thats what im here for ladies your carriage awaits it was late evening at rosedene and dark outside and they sat in the lounge with dillon and monica the women talking in low voices the matron maggie duncan looked in weve two teams working away professor bellamy alternating both patients have lost phenomenal quantities of blood but thats down to the time they were floating along in the river bounine took a shoulder shot that passed straight through so he isnt too bad and alex katya asked much more serious his bulletproof vest stopped the first round but the second caught him in the hip and fractured the pelvis hes going to need a plate and thats being attended to now katya said thats not too good is it surprisingly it was svetlana who said hes alive which considering his activities in past years is a miracle the hip will mendthere is excellent therapy available these days she shrugged the love of a good woman who knows maggie duncan said he isnt going to die we specialize in desperate cases here so im an expert i expect youll want to hang on for the long haul we have accommodations available if youd like katya glanced at svetlana who nodded thank you wed like that dillon and monica got up wed better be off me too billy said they went and maggie duncan said ill have one of the girls bring you some fresh tea she turned to go and professor bellamy came in wearing theater scrubs maggie made the introductions i wont pretend it isnt serious he said it is and it will take time but he will respond to the right treatment his friend is a different story hell be up and about quite soon but let me say this about your nephew mrs kelly he has been wounded many times he cant continue like this svetlana smiled well try to see that he doesnt give it an hour then you can look in but dont stay too long and he left them there they had more tea and a sandwich and about an hour later the outer door opened and roper appeared in his wheelchair followed by ferguson the general was in excellent spirits ive just had bellamy on my phone telling me how things stand with our two heroes weve played the whole episode down so there wont be any media followup i think we can get away with it weve put out a cover story on the boat exploding an overheated gas tank pure accident no one could see or hear anything anyway so i think well be all right there too and where does that leave alex katya asked roper answered remember what i said that he could always sit around somewhere let his hair grow write a truly great book and reappear on the international scene when it suited him the americans have agreed to give him asylum so he can start that process whenever he wants towherever he wants to and this friend of his bounine asylumfrom ustoo he can work for me maggie looked in hes stirring if you want to take a quick look do katya turned to svetlana who shook her head i can see him anytime now thanks be to god you go my dear katya opened the door and stepped in the light was dim and he was propped up a cage over him from the waist down he looked very frail lying there his head bald the eyes closed she moved closer filled with an incredible tenderness his eyes flickered open katya is that you yes alex good his eyes closed again she went out full of energy dazzled by hope ferguson and svetlana were talking and stopped and svetlana said how is he hes well i think and hell be better she turned to ferguson what you were talking aboutalexanders future is that a definite offer slate wiped clean absolutely my word on it and you can do that general charles ferguson smiled and for a moment there was a touch of the wolf there my dear lady i can do anything he said jack higgins
