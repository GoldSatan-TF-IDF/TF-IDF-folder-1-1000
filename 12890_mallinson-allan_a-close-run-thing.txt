allan mallinson a close run thing to the light dragoons formerly the thth and the thth hussars in whose history character and personalities i have found much inspiration for this story authors note this is not just the story of an officer in the duke of wellingtons army it is the story of a regiment that peculiarly british institution which john keegan the most percipient historian and observer of all things military has described as an accidental act of genius every regiment was still is different and revelled in that difference the difference was not just in the people but in the regiments history and traditions the received notions of how things should be done the esprit the spirit the th light dragoons are a fictitious regiment but the events in which they take part are historical fact the major characters outside the regiment are real figures of history occasional liberties have been taken general slade did not go to ireland in for instance but not in any way that changes the historical plausibility of the story the army of was singular it had endured five years of campaigning in the peninsula and it had gone from success to success until the duke was able to remark famously that it could go anywhere and do anything sir charles oman one of the two greatest historians of the campaign the other being sir william napier made also this interesting observation a very appreciable number of men were of a religious turn a thing i imagine to have been most unusual in the army of the eighteenth century wellingtons army the army was not of course without its faults neither was the duke one of the most controversial matters was the purchase of commissions the system by which officers of the cavalry and the infantry bought their promotion a system that the duke strenuously upheld long after the war this is a complex issue however and not one to be taken at face value i know of no better or more entertaining explanation of it than that in volume one of the marquess of angleseys history of the british cavalry which incidentally is also the most readable authority on horsesoldiering in the early nineteenth century readers who wish to know more about the organization and equipment of the army at this time should consult the detailed reference works by mr philip haythornthwaite they have no equal i am indebted too to major retd john oldfield sometime curator of the small arms museum at the school of infantry warminster the museum is an unrivalled collection of both weapons and knowledge and though the fact is little known is open to visitors by appointment my wife whom i met in a stable has been an unfailing aid in finding the right words to describe the horses and their world she has kept me from the worst metaphorical falls any englishman writing even a little about ireland needs an irish interlocutor of exceptional patience i have been immensely fortunate in the friendship and support of brigadiergeneral retd pat hogan late of the irish defence forces and president of the irish military history society but he can in no way be held responsible for anything that smacks of perfide albion i owe a very great deal indeed to mr patrick obrian directly and indirectly his aubreymaturin stories enthralled me for so many years that i began to fret for anything remotely comparable for the cavalry of that period until eventually i found the resolve to attempt myself to do something about it he has been most generous in giving me advice and encouragement i must acknowledge perhaps my greatest debt however to paula levey mrs piers fletcher soldiers daughter soldiers sister and wife of a former soldier who as editor of the early manuscript knew exactly what was what and never flinched from telling me a close run thing oh pity the condition of man gracious god and save us from such a system of malevolence in which all our old and venerated prejudices are to be done away and by which we are taught to consider war as the natural state of man and peace but as a dangerous and difficult extremity sir this temper must be corrected it is a diabolical spirit and would lead to interminable war at what time did we ever profit by obstinately persevering in war charles james fox to the house of commons february britain had persevered in war with revolutionary france with but one short break since the royal navy at aboukir in and trafalgar in had confined bonaparte to europe british money had financed the allies when they were ready to come forward and a british army in the iberian peninsula had from maintained a front which had drained french resources and given hope to other europeans by the beginning of bonaparte could defend only france russian prussian and austrian armies were closing in from the east while the british already in the pyrenees stood ready to invade from the southwest part one pride and prejudice but if you cannot make peace with buonaparte in the winter we must run at him in the spring the marquess later the duke of wellington to the cabinet january chapter one in the heat of battle the convent of st mary of magdala toulouse april it is a very singular thing indeed mr hervey for a cornet to be placed in arrest upon the field of battle joseph edmonds was deploying all his considerable facility with words in order to convey the gravity of the matter at hand tell me if you please precisely and dispassionately the circumstances by which this was brought about cornet hervey stood rigidly to attention before the majors desk his left hand clasping the sword scabbard to his side his right hand clenched with the thumb pointing downwards along the double yellow stripe of his overalls his eyes were set front and filling the limited arc of their fixed gaze were two symbols which while if not to his mind entirely contradictory in their juxtaposition seemed somehow incongruous for on the wall behind the desk was a large wooden cross with a painted figure of the crucified christ next to it perhaps even leaning against it was the regimental guidon a piece of red silk on a beechwood stave its richly embroidered battle honours still resplendent despite the staining and fading the irony that he had been raised in a household whose world was shaped by the first symbol and had then elected to throw himself wholeheartedly behind the second was not lost on him even at this exigent moment he had little imagined such a convergence however nor its place a nunnery hastily and rudely requisitioned for the purposes of the military he drew in a deep breath his stomach feeling tighter than ever it had done when he had been awaiting combat and began the recollection of the events which had brought him now before his commanding officer sir yesterday forenoon i was in command of the flank picket as you had placed me one quarter of a league to the west of our lines of attack upon this city the fateful encounter with authority had begun spectacularly edmonds had not expected any affair on the left flank not that that was why he had entrusted the picket to hervey he had long been of the conviction that the worst that could happen in battle usually did and as a consequence he had never been wrongfooted at least that is in the field and hervey and his standing patrol were a trusty yet economical insurance hervey had disposed his command a halftroop by the sixths depleted muster scarcely two dozen men in the dead ground to the rear of a shallow ridge running obliquely to the armys front they were dismounted and standing easy posted as vidette a furlong to their front with a view into the valley beyond the ridge was his picket serjeant and it was the sudden animation in that sentinel that alerted hervey now mount he called and his troopers began tightening girths before springing back into their saddles without an order the contact man the picket corporal galloped off to serjeant armstrong who had by now worked his way in cover along the ridge and further to the flank five minutes passed before the corporal returned with intelligence that thrilled through the ranks sir there is a horse battery six guns approaching and supports pressed hervey none observed sir none no supports that is not possible serjeant armstrong says there are none within the mile as he can see sir hervey could scarce believe it but supports or no it would still be david and goliath if the guns came into action before they could close with them he hesitated not another second and took the patrol in a brisk handgallop towards armstrong as they broached the ridge he held them up and edged forward with just his coveringcorporal to where serjeant armstrong was crouching in the saddle to observe over the bracken theyve halted sir just this minute said the serjeant in his melodious tyneside why ever do you suppose they have stopped there asked hervey peering through his telescope cant make it out at all armstrong replied they both watched the battery halted in the valley two full furlongs away eager to know in which direction it would next move armstrong thought it must turn about hervey was sure it would wheel left and run parallel to the ridge suddenly both their predictions were confounded the french began dismounting to unlimber the guns herveys reaction was instinctive draw swords charge he cried ramming the telescope into its saddle holster and digging his spurs into his mares flanks his troopers took off after him as eager as greyhounds springing a hare but hervey would not check his pace for the sake of dressing he was a dozen lengths clear of the front rank by the time they were halfway to the battery only his coveringcorporal within challenging distance the french who had seen them the instant they crested the ridge were now frantically ramming charges down the barrels of the eightpounders the limbers racing back whence they had come at a hundred yards hervey stretched his swordarm fully to the engage and fixed on the narrow gap between the centre guns not one had managed to load with canister by the time the troopers fell on them in panic two guns were fired with charges only adding smoke to the confusion but nothing more injurious than the deafening reports had the gunners taken up sidearms instead they might have inflicted some damage but it was too late now hervey slashed at the battery commander as the frenchman belatedly reached for his pistol and the officer fell from his horse screaming his arm all but severed at the shoulder hervey galloped on to the limbers which were making heavy weather of crossing a halfsunken track the guns were no immediate threat now and could wait the limbers and teams would not they showed no sign of yielding as hervey made for the lead team and he glanced behind to see who was with him more than a dozen and he could see serjeant armstrong still at the guns it would do if only the drivers had yielded then they could have been made prisoner or even set free but no they tried to run in panic or in duty to the teams there was no time to care even had there been time to think hervey pointed rather than cut at the lead driver using his forward momentum to take the blade halfway to the hilt in the frenchmans side he followed through as if at sword drill in camp effortlessly recovering the sabre to set about the wheelerdrivers in the same fashion behind him it was the same his dragoons doing swift execution and then they cut the traces to set loose the teams and began driving them back towards the british lines still the fight was not gone from the battery and smallarms fire albeit ragged began at the guns hervey galloped at once to the relief of serjeant armstrong and his halfdozen prizetakers but the firing was ended by the time he came up start spiking then serjeant armstrong he called and fire the limbers ay sir armstrong replied grimly jesus but some of these bastards were a time dying hervey sheathed his sabre and leaned forward in the saddle to adjust the breastplate which had somehow twisted in that instant a bombardier sprang from beneath one of the guns and thrust a spontoon in his thigh herveys coveringcorporal leaped from his horse and launched so ferociousness an assault that the frenchman had no time to parry the downward swordstroke it cleaved his skull in two and blood bubbled like a spring for a full minute where the body lay twitching armstrong rushed to support hervey in the saddle leave go he said sharply angry with himself for the lapse of alertness that was costing so much pain to body and pride corporal collins spluttered an apology dont be a fool man snapped hervey gripping the gash hard im not a greenhead for heavens sake serjeant armstrong lets get these guns spiked and then back to our post before worse arrives a second later hervey and his arresting officer would have galloped into each other hervey had crested the rise however just in time to evade the collision reining hard right he cursed as his mare crumpled then struggled to regain her footing the air bursting from her lungs as they fought to keep their balance her nostrils flaring wide and blowing blood into his eyes and although searing pain from the gash made it difficult for him to keep his right leg pressed on the girth with blood spreading its sticky warmth the length of it neither this nor the damned fool galloping about his corner of the battlefield was going to dull the exhilaration of success he had led the charge to the french guns judging the moment to perfection so that his dragoons had caught the battery at its most vulnerable unlimbered but not yet in action had he charged too soon the french would have been off a fraction too late and his little command might have been swept away in a hail of grapeshot the surprise and terror in the faces of the gunners the frenzied cutting thrusting and slashing the hammering of nails into touchholes then the dash back to their picket post expecting french lanciers to appear at any second to spear them like dogs it had been the stuff of a cornets dream in truth it had been an affair and a prize beyond his dreams a prize which by rights ought never to have been in the offing for a whole troop of horse artillery to come into action on a flank without cavalry supports was abominable to any professional half a dozen eightpounders disabled three score and more horses captured or driven towards the british lines and as many gunners now lying with their lifeblood draining into their native soil barely a dozen frenchmen had escaped to seek the protection of their errant lancers somewhere hervey knew there was a lancier officer who ought to be cashiered or shot for that dereliction of duty but he at least knew that he had done his and he had been scarcely able to bear the wait before he would make his report to edmonds afterwards to bask in the praise with which the major was as a rule so sparing to have collided with the mounted interloper would have denied him that satisfaction for sure at such a speed a broken neck and death was the likely outcome or perhaps and what many would have counted worse it might have meant invaliding to the chelsea hospital and a lifetime of milk pobs spooned haphazardly by some old soldier either fate would have been a terrible irony after escaping the french and he could only wonder at how often he had had cause to be grateful for his little mares catlike agility more than nine times certainly she had saved him from disaster shortening the rein and completing his circle he looked about angrily for the man who had nearly ridden him down anger then turned to astonishment as he recognized him to be one of slades aidesdecamp and he wondered what in heavens name he was doing on this flank then two staff dragoons galloped on to the ridge as herveys own men caught him up but his own anger was nothing to that which he was about to face what the devil do you mean sir by abandoning your post bellowed the adc as he bore down from the opposite direction having himself circled right though nothing like as tightly as hervey and his mare had managed cornet hervey was aghast blood from the gash in his thigh where the french bombardier had thrust the spontoon was soaking the entire leg of his canvas overalls from this alone even to the most purblind it must have been clear that something had been happening but slades staff could be as obtuse as their general what in gods name are you talking about regan we did no such thing he protested sliding painfully from the saddle to loosen the girth then tell me how lancers have been able to loot the generals own baggage by now herveys coveringserjeant had joined him still in a frenzy from the slaughter they had just dealt the hapless battery he seized the adcs reins look mister what dye think but the staff dragoons reached for their sabres as you were armstrong go and settle the patrol snapped hervey the adc was now beyond mere anger and his voice rose in shrill rage mr hervey you have disobeyed orders and that insubordinate serjeant is proof of your unfitness for this command herveys groom had brought up a second charger and he now remounted though not with the easy vault he would ordinarily have taken instead he was helped up awkwardly grimacing as more pain shot the length of his leg it hardly made for a conciliatory response regan you are a confounded ass weve just spiked six guns for pitys sake we have seen no lancers lieutenant regans voice lowered menacingly then how pray did they get to general slades baggage how in hells name do i know i am responsible for this flank not for the whole battlefield the contempt was unequivocal and hervey might have anticipated its consequences had he not been so entirely exasperated by the lieutenants seemingly wilful ignorance of the affair with the enemy battery you are a damned impudent officer as well as a disobedient one you will hand me your sword this instant herveys jaw fell in the middle of a battle have you taken leave of your senses the contrast between the red jackets of the adc and staff dragoons and the blue of herveys regiment seemed to be intensifying the confrontation serjeant armstrong spat and let out a string of oaths but so thick was his tyneside accent that lieutenant regan was not sure what he had heard the staff dragoons recognized the tone well enough though and drew their sabres hervey shot an angry look at armstrong but it was another voice that was to quell what had by now become little short of a brawl a voice infinitely more measured than hervey was capable of at that moment go to your post serjeant armstrong it commanded in mellow tones of suffolk and then with admirably contrived understatement mr hervey sir is there some difficulty herveys composure began returning the voice had often steadied him steadied many of them and more so now for its being unexpected serjeant strange i am in arrest general slade appears to think we abandoned our post have you come with orders no sir replied the troop serjeant in a manner so matteroffact they could have been at a review only with a report of guns moving in the direction of your picket well they do not move any longer said hervey with a sharp edge look serjeant strange you had better take command i will tell you briefly of the circumstances and then you must send someone to report to major edmonds serjeant strange listened impassively as hervey gave a hasty account of the disabling of the battery i trust mr regan here will have that wound attended to properly and with all dispatch sir was all that strange said in reply turning to the adc of course he would said the lieutenant testily i do not need to be reminded of my business thank you serjeant serjeant strange saluted reined about and trotted over to the patrol leaving hervey feeling not a little awkward at his own intemperance compared with this noncommissioned officers bearing matthew hervey was not invariably quicktempered twentythree years old six years with the cavalry most of it on active service he still retained a surprising belief in humanity but the proverbial wrath of the patient man could from time to time overwhelm his cautious instincts a risky proclivity for an officer who valued his prospects anyone who thought that survival in this war depended merely on fighting the enemy was naïve in the extreme jealousy snobbery intrigue and patronage were the preoccupations of men of ambition in the marquess of wellingtons army and hervey and others like him decent officers with little but their ability to recommend them were increasingly resentful of wellingtons indifference to it all indeed many believed he actively connived at it but they remained wholly powerless to effect any change whatever and besides they each had a stake in the system however small so long as their commissions were obtained by purchase and held their value lieutenant regans dislike of hervey inasmuch as it could be rationally analysed stemmed from just these preoccupations intensely jealous of the distinction which his campaign service might bring though few would suppose that he envied the service itself he regarded herveys lack of means with open distaste six years service and still a cornet he regan had purchased his lieutenancy even before his regiment had seen him at a field day and if he had known hervey to be distantly related to the earls of bristol he would doubtless have dismissed the connection with a sneer at the whig propensities of that family whatever ecclesiastical influence the herveys may have had and in truth they had none for bishop hervey of deny had been dead these past ten years they were wholly without influence in the military it had not been long before someone in regans family had managed to get him appointed to a generals staff and what a general john slade black jack as he was known throughout the peninsular army as incompetent an officer as was ever placed in command of a brigade of cavalry and a coward too by common consent but if hervey had only qualified contempt for the system which could put an officer like regan where he was his contempt for the man himself was absolute as he unbuckled his swordbelt and handed him his sabre he saw the utter triumph on the adcs face and he knew that there was not the slightest thing he could do about it serjeant strange chose to send the news to edmonds with herveys coveringcorporal for he could not trust serjeant armstrong to deliver a coherent report in the circumstances let alone a detached one and he knew that the combination of edmondss temper and armstrongs was the very last thing that was needed now corporal collinss big gelding had once been the proud possession of the commanding officer of a regiment of french hussars but the corporal had cut him down in a brilliant little affair at campo mayor three years before even a french aristocrats charger could rarely outpace a good british troop horse but this gelding was an exception and the corporal covered the threequarters of a mile or so to where the rest of the th light dragoons were drawn up in a fast straight line it would not have taken a practised eye to discern that the sixth had been on campaign for several seasons for though they stood in perfect order of three squadrons in line numbered from the left they were in double rank only the regiments strength having fallen to two troops in each squadron the troops were still able to front the regulation sixty men however less the halftroop of herveys patrol from number squadron and twenty or so dragoons stood with the farriers as supernumeraries to the rear the horses were a mixed bag irish mainly and beginning to regain the semblance of sleekness as their winter coats grew out some were of real quality those which the regiments colonel had purchased when they had been in england and for which he had reached deep into his own pockets since arriving in the peninsula however remounts had been found under collective arrangements and from divers sources and some were barely up to weight it was the lament of every cavalry mess that england must indeed be in peril to have run short of troop horses the same in its way could have been remarked of the dragoons themselves without doubt many of the troopers would never have got the better of a recruiting serjeants pride in peacetime as for their clothing an untutored observer might have concluded that a hatmaker had reached some advantageous arrangement with the quartermasters for every shako seemed as new compared with the rest of the uniform which was faded and patched to a marked degree in truth the shakos were new of a pattern only recently authorized and although they were nothing in appearance to compare with the older tarleton helmets they stayed put in action and the oilskin covers kept them dry at a distance of fifty yards the regiment was a fine sight only closer inspection would reveal the signs of wear as it would too that a troops jackets were in distinctly better condition their captain having used his own wealth to engage the services of spanish tailors during winter quarters the sixth were sitting easy on the same piece of ground they had occupied since first light that morning many of the troopers were leaning forward on the rolled cloaks over the saddle arches and a good number were smoking clay pipes corporal collins found edmonds not in his appointed position to the front of the regiment but as a serrefile to the left of the first squadron doubtless attempting but vainly to conceal his frustration with the regiments enforced inactivity edmondss bad humour was exacerbated too by the worst toothache he had ever known he had already taken two sizeable draughts of laudanum that morning more than three times the quantity prescribed as efficacious by the regimental surgeon and it would be many hours before he could expect to have the offending molar drawn by a toothoperator he certainly had no intention of risking the surgeons pelican after that hamfisted fool had dislocated one poor troopers jaw earlier in the week scarcely had corporal collins begun his report but edmonds began to rage damn it all he had to do was sit on a hill and watch for a few frenchmen fool enough to cross the canal what in gods name the majors facility with words extended also to those of the barrack room indeed they frequently seemed his natural and preferred idiom no sir wait thats not all edmondss notorious temper and his present irritability would have unnerved many an nco but strange had picked his man well the victor of the single combat with the french colonel would not be frighted by the majors anger besides the cannier ncos and collins was one of the canniest knew what lay beneath it the corporal did what he had done many times before since the days when he had been a young dragoon in the then captain edmondss troop he affected blithe unawareness and pressed his report with determination the major listened to the account of the attack on the battery and what followed with mute but growing disbelief until another pang of excruciating pain made him explode again why for mercys sake was he placed in arrest then what the devil is going on up there corporal collins judged it beyond the responsibilities of his rank to comment though he could for certain have given a perceptive enough appreciation instead he sat silent opinions about the staff would have to wait for the canteen the major taking a strong but not altogether effective grip of his anger and biting hard into a lint wad soaked in oil of cloves summoned a troops leader who as one of the senior captains was also the officer commanding number squadron captain lankester i may presume that you heard our corporalgalloper and it will be no shave ill warrant a very pretty mess indeed i wish you to send an officer at once to the flank picket to relieve serjeant strange another spasm jerked him as if a musket ball had struck his jaw corporal collins you stay here go and rejoin your troop he barked joseph edmonds reined about to face front again and cursed audibly and even more foully than before it was not the pain so much he had endured worse under the surgeons knife during his service but the way that all before him seemed to be unravelling like a loose horsebandage he had not the slightest control over matters and seemingly no influence he began wishing lord george irvine were back that damned tirailleurs bullet which had smashed the colonels shoulder at croix dorade three days earlier had been about the worsttimed shot of the campaign he was relishing this acting command right enough albeit without even a brevet promotion to lieutenantcolonel as he might have expected but he knew general slade despised him a conclusion it was not difficult to come by although slade seemed to despise everybody especially if they showed the remotest chance of doing something that might reflect his own inadequacy laming will relieve serjeant strange sir lankester informed him after dispatching his lieutenant to the picket he might as easily have resumed his place in front of his squadron and with every propriety for edmonds had all but formally dismissed him but lankester had seen the storm cones hoisting and experience suggested that a weather eye would be prudent captain lankester do you suppose that damned stupid fellow has the remotest idea what he is about you refer to general slade sir indeed i do sir though i cannot claim any novelty in that description as you very well know it was lord uxbridges and never has his opinion of slade been more fully justified than during these several past months what deuced illfortune has placed us in his brigade and now it seems that his own staff are every bit as stupid as he i think he has never recovered from the affair at maguilla i do not think that wellington himself has recovered from maguilla the whole maguilla business was absurd a few of the royals squadrons become overexcited press on too far for their own good and get a fraction cut up and wellington says that all his cavalry are fit for is drilling on wimbledon common what a confounded insult what a yet another spasm contorted his face and a string of expletives followed and now slade tries to curb all vigour in his subordinates and hangs the arse at any price rather than risk another of wellingtons scoldings the mans fit only for a depot squadron it has certainly made him cautious lankester agreed with a greater disposition towards discretion uxbridge at least would have been able to advocate a little more equanimity continued edmonds and then casting aside all reserve he opined that if the earl of uxbridge had remained the cavalry commander for this second expedition to the peninsula instead of sir stapleton cotton wellington might by now have been prevailed upon to have slade dismissed he could but wonder he declared with a sigh at the complicated web of patronage that made wellington drive his army so hard and yet at the same time ignore such monstrous inaptitude but he knew at least that it was a web a web as unfathomable as that which was the fates the strands might be barely discernible but they could hold a man like him fast and for all the twentyfive years which separated them he and now hervey were caught like worthless carrion while others who knew its secrets were able to traverse the delicate threads and go wherever they pleased he had accepted it with remarkable forbearance during most of his service but he had of late become of the mind that when skilfulness amounted to a disadvantage because of a superiors resentment then the web was no longer merely recondite it was corrupt why it had taken him so long to reach this conclusion when he pondered on it puzzled him for a full five years earlier he had had a taste of slades ineptness there at sahagun he had deftly manoeuvred his own squadron while black jack in action for the first time had fiddlefaddled at the head of his brigade and almost let the french slip and all this in front of uxbridge too who had never troubled to conceal his poor opinion of his subordinate edmondss mere proximity ever afterwards could excite slades resentment and that his subsequent advance to major had been by field promotion rather than by purchase a manner of advancement that slade had more than once in his hearing derided as fit only for officers from the ranks had done nothing to assuage the generals envy and detestation jealousy and snobbery patronage and intrigue the web by heaven edmonds sighed the french are nothing to fear compared with that blackguard it has always occurred to me as singular that adultery should be grounds for dismissal during times of war lankesters proposition did not immediately reveal its sense to edmonds who was all but lost in contemplation of his brigade commander what slade adultery no uxbridge edmonds shook his head with disbelief at his own slowness well perhaps it was hardly the breaking of the seventh commandment but the manner another commandment you mean smiled lankester thou shalt not elope with the marquess of wellingtons sisterinlaw edmonds could not but reflect the smile the first he had been tempted to that day well certainly not in a postchaise from under the very nose of his younger brother lankester thought he perceived the storm cones to be lowering it occurs to me that if nelson had been deprived of his command because of lady hamilton the french fleet might still be at sea instead of under it at cape trafalgar and we might yet be patrolling the sussex coast edmonds nodded and frowned lankester had judged the storms passing overhastily the majors bile rose again at this reference to the royal navy whose utilitarian principles he had long held in admiration i do not see why we must be foisted with knaves and imbeciles when the admiralty are perfectly able to order their affairs in so eminently businesslike a fashion he snorted or does the navy have its patronage too countered lankester less manifestly connected with birth perhaps but patronage none the less all i know is that if nelson had been an officer under slades command he would not have risen beyond a troop rasped edmonds deciding that it was time he took up his position in front of the regiment and pressing his charger forward with sudden urgency major joseph edmonds his left eye almost closed by the pain in his jaw peered into the distance as the infantry pressed their assault across the languedoc canal towards the outer defences of toulouse the first city they had reached since coming down from their winter quarters in the pyrenees he might rant against the likes of slade but the object of his profoundest disapproval the conduct of the campaign itself he kept privy with a concealed passion he utterly disputed the need to fight soult here especially since rumours had been circulating for days that bonaparte was finished dead even the french had been deserting in droves many had given themselves up to the sixths own patrols and so far as he was able to make out bonapartes more general situation was no more felicitous in the east the continental allies austria prussia russia and sweden were making ever better progress towards paris a month ago wellington had occupied bordeaux but to what end surely now there was no more need than to invest with the merest token force any garrison which stood in their path paris was the cornerstone of bonapartes edifice there was little purpose therefore in trifling with outworks edmonds began to wonder whether anyone had any notion of strategy other than fighting the enemy wherever and whenever he stood as if every last french musketeer must be slaughtered or put into a prison hulk before victory might be claimed was there no campaigning art were they to continue breaking windows with guineas edmonds knew his history and despaired that the commanderinchief seemed not to share his perception of the wars of antiquity of caesar and hannibal why was wellington so fabian a general quintus fabius maximus cunctator the delayer reviled in life for his caution and then lauded for it in his later years rome would never have been defeated at cannae with such a general the senate had mourned but why so many officers wellington included took fabius maximus as their paradigm rather than hannibal was quite beyond him no wound in the dozen or more during his service had cut him so deeply as the rebuff he had received two winters before when he had submitted a stratagem worthy he felt sure of the grace of baal himself to manoeuvre the french out of spain it had been returned with a peremptory note that the commanderinchief did not wish to distract his field officers from their first duty of attending to their commands afterwards he had brooded and contemplated selling out but in the end he had turned once more to his trusty volume of seneca and taking deep draughts from the treatise on the steadfastness of wise men he had redoubled his stoic efforts in the place that fortune had appointed him if the final victory were by rumour and his own reckoning so close however then he knew these low spirits made little sense was it that he considered himself to blame for herveys arrest he had given him command of a flank picket and it was by rights a lieutenants command but then hervey had seen more service than many of the lieutenants why in any case repine over the fate of an insignificant cornet when a sous worth of powder and shot might carry off his young head at an instant the adjutant had cautioned him more than once that if he were to take responsibility so personally for every last man in the sixth dyspepsy would soon overcome him but the warning had had no effect he wondered what lord george irvine would do if he were here he had not the inkling of an idea however for lord george understood the complexities and possibilities of the web in a way he never could but be whatever that may he knew well enough that behind him the sixth were restive for they had been posted thus for four hours without a move pain shot through his jaw again catching him off guard christ he exploded dismount his trumpeter with no cautionary word of command to alert him blew the call hastily cracking the first es badly and earning a blistering rebuke there could in any event have been no more calculated an invitation to bring down slades wrath upon the sixth than this order the brigade commanders belief that cavalry should remain mounted ready for immediate action kept his regiments in the saddle for hours on end and to no purpose edmonds considered slades notion of immediate action to be positively risible in view of his chronic indecisiveness sore backs were the bane of the cavalry and whether slade liked it or not he was damned if he was going to sit there a moment longer for no good reason yet he was not without his doubts too he had to admit that the french were fighting with a tenacity he had not seen since badajoz yesterday easter of all days soult had left three thousand dead and dying on the field before retiring behind the canal and the garonne and now after another days fighting it looked as if that fox of a marshal was going to contest every street in this lovely city edmonds was beginning to concede the likelihood of a fabian march on paris after all these were selfindulgent thoughts however one consideration above all pressed to the fore besides that is the ever receding prospect of seeing a toothoperator how was he to secure herveys release come what may there were bound to be charges slade would be eager to take the opportunity to humiliate the sixth the only chance lay in having a general court martial convened instead of one of the cosy field courts where the only concern was to uphold the dignity and authority of the commander usually and in this instance the very officer to have initiated the charges with slade it was more a matter of shoring up that dignity and authority he admitted with distaste but a proper court not one packed with toadies would take the affair with the battery as mitigation damn it all he almost exclaimed aloud they ought to regard it as justification but pressing though matthew herveys arrest might be there was at that moment even more immediate business at hand all edmondss instincts told him that this was turning into a scrimmage of a battle a pall of smoke was rising over the city and he began to wonder whether slade would stay all afternoon watching making them mere onlookers to another of wellingtons infantry battles with the commanderinchiefs admonitions afterwards to add insult to injury any cavalryman with a sure coup dœil would now on his own initiative order a steady encircling movement to the northwest to occupy the prominent high ground in anticipation of the artillery lord george irvine had such an eye so did lankester and the other squadron leaders so did a good many of the troop officers hervey included edmonds was equally sure that slade did not and never would in a hundred years the trouble with wellington fumed edmonds though he would readily admit of his many soldierly virtues was that he wanted insisted on order in his battles yet was not the battlefield the very apotheosis of chaos and was it not the side that could impose the greater chaos that carried the day in battle and was it not that arm the cavalry the arm for which wellington had least regard that could create such chaos edmonds sighed by his estimation they could afford only five more minutes standing like this before the opportunity to take the ground unchallenged might be gone if no orders came within that time he knew he would not be able to contain his frustration and that he would go to slade to suggest the manoeuvre knowing full well how unwelcome that would be and indeed after five more minutes of fidgeting and stamping by the troop horses and increasingly tart commentary by the troopers edmonds had had enough sighing deeply and cursing some more under his breath he remounted and called again for his senior captain lankester trotted up on his big bay thoroughbred and saluted you are to assume command you are to prepare to occupy yonder hill with the white church began the major pointing to a small chapel a mile away that bridge midway will have no more than a few videttes likely as not i shall now alert the brigadier to my intentions however on no account save for the immediate security of your command are you or any part of the regiment to quit this ground until i return edmonds did not have to elaborate on the manoeuvre or its purpose indeed he would have been dismayed to think that lankester had not anticipated it the captain simply saluted to acknowledge the orders and a halfsmile indicated that he recognized the tone well enough edmonds had reverted to the formal and precise manner which prudence suggested was necessary when in the field with general slade it added too a distinct charm to the sixths campaign journal written up assiduously at the end of each day by the adjutant who scribbled every word faithfully in his pocketbook to that purpose but principally and at edmondss insistence the scribbling was less a matter of historical detail than a record to be used in evidence not against an officer but by one if events did not prove propitious he wanted no subordinate to be in a position of disadvantage it was needless in this instance for the notion that lankester would plead superior orders in mitigation if events went ill would have been entirely repugnant to that officer the gallop to the knoll on which slade and his staff had posted themselves half a mile distant steeled edmonds to the exchange to come but as he neared the top he saw general cotton galloping towards them from the opposite direction waving his hat and hallooing wildly hervey was lying on the ground nearby with slades physician hunched over him but it was the cavalry commanders dramatic approach that gripped edmondss attention cotton began shouting from fifty yards distant slade the french are giving way soults pulling back into the city theres no fight left in em sir stapleton cotton lieutenantgeneral sixth baronet of combermere and uxbridges successor there was little doubt that his birth had recommended him to wellington but there was such a close physical similarity between the two men that edmonds could not but ponder on the tendency of commanders to select subordinates in their own image there were the same dark curls the long face the hooked nose and hardly a year between them too what was wellington now fortyfour fortyfive four years younger than edmonds himself it was enough to test the resolve of a saint admittedly he liked cotton well enough the man had done his share of fighting in the peninsula and before that too and he had been sound enough on the retreat to corunna but he was no uxbridge edmonds knew that in the business of war he was cottons equal what then had ordered their respective military estates just twenty thousand pounds for a baronetcy a couple of centuries earlier when king james had wanted money for his irish army he supposed and one or two judicious marriages thereafter no doubt well so be it his father had been a professional soldier who had died in the american war while edmonds was still a child leaving nothing but the value of his commission with which his widow could buy an annuity and he himself had chosen to marry a soldiers daughter without a penny either a stoical smile almost overcame him but another stab in his jaw made him grimace instead what he was to hear next however as general cotton pulled up sharply almost cannoning into the brigade commander would certainly tempt the smile back albeit a wry one the commanderinchief desires his cavalry to stand fast for the time being but wishes you to send if you please a troop to occupy the high ground northwest of the city it is his intention to send guns there directly cotton was pointing to the same high ground that edmonds knew captain lankester to be contemplating at that very moment a look of contentment settled on the major for at a stroke these orders relieved him of the necessity of risking the altercation with his brigadier edmonds cotton exclaimed when at length he noticed him and in a manner uncommonly genial a very good day to you that was a smart little action on the flank one of lord wellingtons observingofficers was concealed nearby and witnessed the whole affair it seems the french were intent on harassing our flank but were discouraged into thinking we held there stronger than we did who was commanding the picket every nerve and sinew in him tensed at this promising development cornet hervey general well cornet hervey did us deuced fine service that battery would have wrought a pretty destruction had it come into action i shall meet him in due course i trust the fortunes of war could still take edmonds by surprise in spite of his long years in the kings service an observingofficer gone to ground on his way back from behind the enemys lines no doubt by heavens this was opportune a most capital turn of events but he knew there was a distance still to run and he avoided meeting slades eye hoping to give him time to choose a line of withdrawal slade had indeed been studiously ignoring him failing to acknowledge his presence even but years of intriguing had told black jack when to withdraw and he now seized the opportunity which edmondss rare composure offered cornet hervey was hurt slightly in the action sir stapleton my own physician is attending to him over there now indicating the tree under which the edinburgh medical man in his incongruous black melton coat was fussing with bandages and salving oil did slade know of the battery action after all wondered edmonds or was he just quick to sense a tight corner likely as not he would never know cotton trotted over to hervey who struggled to his feet despite the physicians remonstrations mr hervey i am glad we meet you did well today how is that leg thank you sir it is very well enough the surgeon here says it will not keep me out of the saddle i said that it may not corrected the edinburgh man with barely concealed indignation at being called a surgeon then indeed it will not insisted hervey good man good man said cotton approvingly but i doubt you will need to be in the saddle for much longer the french are done for and i mean not for today only our agents are reporting that the end cannot be far off after a few more words of solicitude and encouragement and some further intercourse with slade out of earshot of the others the commander of wellingtons cavalry spurred his horse back in the direction whence he had come leaving slade to give the orders which edmonds had anticipated a full halfhour before shall i take cornet hervey back with me then general he ventured yes yes he is obviously fit for duty replied slade dismissively without reference to the arrest private johnson herveys groom whose own lowly coup dœil was every bit a match nevertheless for this delicate moment had already brought up the black gelding an uncomfortable if localized silence followed as hervey limped across to where lieutenant regan stood like a small dark cloud in mute brooding without a word he stooped to pick up his sword which lay as in some allegory of dishonour at regans feet the adc said not a word either none was necessary for his look said everything none of it pleasant as they left the knoll edmonds was careful to do so at a trot though all his instincts and not least the horses were to gallop like fury i am sorry sir that tried hervey when they had put some ground between themselves and the brigade commander god preserve us boy snapped edmonds leaving hervey to wonder from what precisely little purpose would have been served by his asking however for edmonds had scant idea either only a sense of the need for divine providence it had been the narrowest of escapes and he did not doubt that the last of it was yet to be heard hervey was by no means entirely comfortable back in the saddle for expertly though his leg had been bandaged it was not the place to be resting it but this was nothing to how he was to feel when they reached the regiment corporal collinss dispatch had evidently been relayed through the ranks for there was loud cheering as they approached and though he might well bask in that approval for he had certainly had none from edmonds so loud and triumphant was the clamour that it must surely have carried across to slades knoll he sensed as well as edmonds that it would only fuel the generals resentment and make worse the eventual retribution but the cornets horizon was the next hill and the next minute and the discomfort would soon pass edmonds could not afford to set his sights so close however too much in his service told of the hundred and one ways slades vindictiveness might be visited on them their best hope lay in this wars coming to the rapid end which sir stapleton cotton had predicted though there was little enough sign of that nor was there any sign of the activity which he presumed might be consequent on that assessment if the french were on the point of collapse then it was the function of the cavalry to hurry them along now was surely the time to throw caution to the wind and launch them all at soults lines of communication was it not what in heavens name was there to lose he wondered mr barrow he roared the adjutant closed up from where he had posted himself three horselengths behind next to the guidon and edmondss trumpeter the sixth still carried the colonels guidon in the field many regiments had abandoned the practice though the squadron guidons had been left in england when any movement was to be executed the adjutant took up his position with the other serrefile officers to the rear but he otherwise liked to keep close to edmonds so that he could heed his orders at first hand i wish you to have the following prepared for my signature at the first opportunity do you have your pocketbook sir very well to lieutenantcolonel lord fitzroy somerset military secretary headquarters etc etc sir i have the honour no wait begin again it is my humble duty to submit with regret my resignation to be effective at your lordships pleasure edmonds paused barrow looked up with no more expression of surprise than if he had been taking orders for bivouac edmonds cleared his throat and continued in so doing i place upon record my no begin again i thereby protest at the want of ardour in the employment of the cavalry and he paused once more the tergiversation in the conduct of the campaign barrow raised an eyebrow not certain that he would be able to find anyone capable of spelling this latter complaint nor even of explaining its meaning is that all sir that is all thank you barrow the adjutant raised both eyebrows and then resumed his place with the guidon knowing it to be unlikely that the draft would ever be called for it was the third that edmonds had dictated that year alone for another three hours the sixth stood fast edmonds with every expression of serenity conceivable and more certainly than anyone could have imagined but as evening drew on he became less composed and by dusk he was as thoroughly agitated as he had been that morning the temporary remitting of the toothache in the afternoon past he was sorely vexed now by the general inertia fabius cunctator he spat barrow and the trumpeter looked at each other startled neither of them had quite heard every syllable but it sounded the vilest of curses and it just might have been provoked by the sudden appearance of the brigade major though in truth edmonds had not seen him who the adjutant now noticed was trotting across the regiments front he sighed as he took out his pocketbook and closed up to edmonds again sensing more trouble ah heroys with orders for the night perhaps began the major with more than a trace of irony tell me are they to be as strenuous as those of the day but he gave the bm no time for reply thoroughly warming to his opportunity let me guess a brigade steeplechase perhaps or a foxhunt maybe even a levee or a masque yes i have it a masque now which might it be comus perhaps that would seem apt what chance good lady hath bereft you thus dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth very droll edmonds you are perfectly well aware that thrift in deploying ones assets is a sound precept in war thats a pissfire answer edmonds some days you try my patience and then again others you quite exhaust it replied the brigade major with a resigned smile he had long years of acquaintance with edmondss vituperation i have instructions for a comfortable billet no less the particulars took edmonds by surprise a convent he exclaimed and where will the nuns be you need worry not replied heroys they are all in the hospitals with the blessés and probably a good many of our own wounded too never have i seen so many but you will need to make haste it will be pitchdark before the hours out come i will guide you down myself lead us not into bloody temptation sighed edmonds as they began the descent into the city hervey had lost more blood than he had supposed after all but fainting in the saddle on the way down serjeant armstrong and private johnson halfcarried him to one of the nuns cells in spite of his protests that first he must see to the horses heaven help us sighed armstrong aloud these gentlemenofficers and their duty but neither he nor johnson had the time to argue and hervey for sure had not the energy leaving him with a lantern they slammed the door closed and he lay down on the narrow bed without even unfastening his swordbelt with the comparative comfort of a strawfilled palliasse beneath him the first in three months he fell asleep at once the chapel and cellars had been locked before the sisters had left for the hospitals nevertheless serjeant armstrong reappeared half an hour later with arms full of bottles one crashed to the stone floor as he pushed the cell door open and hervey woke with a start bordoo sir the best not like that rotgut in spain shall we drink to the troop they had drunk together before not frequently but often enough for armstrongs invitation to be unremarkable the circumstances had never been quite so intimate however and while hervey might in the ordinary course of events have welcomed the opportunity of informality with his coveringserjeant he was uneasy about allowing any intimacy at this time for there was the business with the adc to address without doubt many an officer perhaps even the majority would have chosen to disregard armstrongs momentary loss of control since it had been directed at so reviled a man as regan especially might they have been so inclined if the offender were so warmly and genuinely solicitous of their comfort as was armstrong now but hervey could not he held the simple if at times uncomfortable conviction that no case of indiscipline should go at least unremarked for not to have held so encouraged in his judgement a lack of constancy which made for confusion during alarms not that this was to advocate a regime of punishment for each and every transgression indeed herveys zeal was tempered by the enlightened attitude which characterized the sixth where not a man had been flogged in a decade but there were other concerns now than simply that of good order and military discipline he raised himself unsteadily on an elbow serjeant armstrong what in the name of heaven did you think you were doing today those dragoons from the staff corps were within an ace of arresting you id ave tipped em both a settler if theyd tried well that would have decided matters and how do you suppose you would manage on a troopers pay id at least have my pride hervey sighed serjeant armstrong i dont seem to be making my meaning clear do i has serjeant strange said anything oh ay strange has had at me right enough but he didnt have to say a thing ive known arry strange for nigh on ten years geordie armstrong just listen to me for a minute that you are a fighter is beyond doubt one of the best the whole regiment knows it and most of the army too i shouldnt wonder but that temper the pot calls the kettle blackarse hervey sighed again serjeant armstrong if i encouraged you by my ownbut he was not allowed to finish with respect mr hervey sir which was no warranty that any would be manifest you just look out for general slade and ill look to me own devices im too small a fish for them staff to concern themselves over and he grinned hervey could but hope that it might be thus so much for his withering rebuke but there was at least no good reason any longer why he should not take wine with his serjeant and albeit without much sense of celebration that is what he did a copious quantity in measures which armstrong referred to as medicinal and the bordeaux was to have its medicinal effect for hervey slept until late the following morning the silence first told him it was no ordinary reveille and then the height of the sun whose rays streamed into his cell through the window high above his head he had not lain in bed with the sun so high nor for that matter with the sun up for as long as he could remember reveille preceded dawn that was the invariable rule of field discipline even in quarters there they might only feed and water the horses but in the field they stood to saddled ready for any alarm which first light might bring wellington may have cursed his cavalry and compared them unfavourably with the hussars of the kings german legion but the sixth would allow him no cause for complaint over that routine at least hervey lay motionless still drowsy though conscious of a dull ache in his leg but he had no great inclination to discover for himself why he was not on parade lowly cornet though he might be he was confident that the regiment would not have moved on without him and he was sure that no sleep could be so deep as to shut out the sound of a battle for once he might let events take their course in any case all was silence now and a curious scent of rosewater mixed with that of the wine spilled the night before began to have an uncommonly quiescent effect soon he was succumbing to a faintly illicit relishing of the missed exertions of the predawn labours of which few outside the ranks of a horsed regiment could have any conception an infantryman merely had to turn out of his bivouac and stand to his arms but both before and after a troopers stand to there was a deal of toiling with mount and equipment dawn and dusk day in day out but the dull throb in his supine leg was increasing and he forced himself up in order to restore the circulation there were choice curses at the stiffness as he hobbled round the cell his swordscabbard clanking on the flagstones and the noise was evidently enough to alert his groom who appeared after ten minutes of this clattering and cursing good mornin mr ervey sir i eard thee moving and thought tha could be doing with some breakfast hervey shook his head in mock despair he was private johnsons third officer in a year though they had now been together for ten months the others had complained of excessive cheeriness and an impenetrable sheffield dialect but hervey found his ingenuity as a groom more than made up for these alleged shortcomings comprehension he had told them was ultimately a matter of determination could they not recognize a black diamond johnson brought in a canteen of tea some boiled fowl and a loaf of grey bread an theres some brandy ere an all sir holding up a silver cup which looked to have been intended originally for a less secular purpose private johnson it is as ever a pleasure to see you of a morning but unusual in its being so late he replied with a bemused smile tha means why didnt i wake thee afore just so johnson well johnny crapauds quit ttown and capn lankester said tha were on tsick list and when tha was awake tsurgeon said that tha were tave thee bandages changed though hervey had counted on his not being abandoned he knew it was the greatest good fortune to have received his wound not a day earlier if the notion of fortune and a wound were in any way appropriate had the regiment moved on after the battle he would have been left in some makeshift hospital on a pile of filthy straw struck off strength and already becoming but a memory the needs of the fit and the necessities of the campaign did not often admit of retrospection but to remain on strength localsick to be tended by the regimental surgeon who would be answerable to edmonds was a different prospect for however much edmonds might curse the surgeon as a castoff from a parish poorhouse he would perforce be more diligent than many to be found in a socalled army hospital not that this nunnery was anything like as comfortable as some they had seen in spain where they resembled more the houses of grandees than of religious orders the convent of st mary of magdala had a peculiar austerity a chill which did not come from the weather for it was seasonally warm and dry outside herveys sickquarters were no cell in the purely figurative sense for they had every appearance of the clinks lodgings the walls were white and in poor repair a crucifix above his bed was their one adornment the bed was the only piece of furniture except for a priedieu with three books as johnson arranged the breakfast in a niche of the thick wall hervey picked up each book in turn the latin bible strangely perhaps for a son of the cloth was the first he had ever opened and he felt a mild revulsion at seeing the scriptures rendered thus the englishmans revulsion at the martyrdom of tyndale and others for the vernacular the second volume was in spanish el via de perfectión and he puzzled for a time whether this was the way to or the way of perfection for his spanish was still rough but he understood enough to learn that it was the testimony of st teresa the mystic from avila about whom he knew little and that only because his father had once made a study of the works of st john of the cross if he had felt uneasy at the vulgate however the third volume might have thoroughly revolted him for in the common consciousness of hervey and his kind the very word jesuit proclaimed every perfidy imaginable and this volume was the work of st ignatius of loyola no less but the title intrigued rather than repelled him exercitia spiritualia sancti the coupling seemed somehow discrepant he had studied books on exercises for light cavalry manuals on sword exercises and pistol exercises signalling exercises even but spiritual exercises an altogether arresting notion he sat down and began to leaf through its pages while at the same time struggling to wrest the stringy meat of the fowls leg from its bone meanwhile private johnson had slipped from the cell without his noticing by the time he reappeared only bones remained of the fowl and hervey was wholly engrossed in the spiritual exercises johnson was grinning broadly but unseen for hervey did not immediately lift his head mr evans says this sister will change thee bandages now sir announced his groom at length in his struggle with the complex latin constructions of st ignatius epilogue hervey did not catch this communication from the surgeon nor did johnson wait for any acknowledgement he was out of the door with the speed of one of the ferrets which travelled in his valise and supplemented the rations with rabbits he had no intention of being the butt of herveys protests when he tumbled to hervey looked up absently and was all but transfixed by the image of otherworldliness a whitehabited nun head bowed holding strips of cloth and a bowl of steaming water stood framed in the arched doorway like a phantom albeit of a distinctly celestial kind as she stepped into the cell and light from the window fell on her he saw that her overmantle was more bloodstained than white though the habit beneath was brown like those of the nuns in spain her face what little of it was revealed by the wimple was also smeared with blood and looked excessively drawn though it was not old in other circumstances it might have been described as prettyish but a haunted look made any such worldly adjective inappropriate it was certainly unlike those of the spanish sisters some of whose more sensual features had been decidedly tempting suddenly he recollected himself and sprang up though pain stabbed his thigh as he did so adding to his discomposure i am sorry sister but i was not expecting he began in french i really think it better if the surgeon attends to this sir the surgeon has been working throughout the night she replied in the measured voice of the languedoc by contrast with herveys more guttural alsace and with evident distaste there are many soldiers private soldiers french and english yet to be attended her tone stung him in his confusion he had conveyed something wholly other than what he had meant i am sorry i did not mean to he stuttered and then sensing that any explanation would be pointless he tried to dismiss her the dressing is perfectly well sister in the circumstances i think you should return to the wounded i think we must both do as we are bidden sir she replied firmly putting the bowl on the floor and beginning to tear a piece of cloth into bandages with considerable violence hervey could not have been more dismayed though the idea of being ministered to by a nun was by no means alien since he had seen them and women of rank in hospitals in the peninsula this nun made him uneasy to begin with there was her spectral appearance and though the marquess of wellington may have issued instructions that the army was to enter france not as conquerors but as liberators it seemed prudent first to be certain that this was how the french themselves regarded them how he was to dispense with her ministration however was entirely beyond him and at length after it became apparent that no amount of protest would weaken her resolve and with more chagrin than he could lately remember he gave up sat down and removed his bloodstained overalls he need not have been concerned for pain soon proved a great distractor he suspected that this sister might be more devout than most but she could scarcely have been less tender cutting the dressing off briskly and none too gently wiping away the caked blood it is clean but some of the sutures are broken i do not think the wound will putrefy but i think they must be replaced hervey bit his lip and nodded and she rebandaged his leg without speaking her eyes were reddened and he surmised that she had had no sleep for three maybe four days for that had been the duration of the lighting and though the armies may have had sleep those tending the wounded could not have found their work slackening during that time he would have asked her of the blessés but her manner seemed not to invite it and he suspected too that she was a woman of few words perhaps ordinarily under a vow of silence instead he thanked her as she left but she made no reply glancing only at the spiritual exercises lying next to him and then bowing slightly hervey noticed for the first time that her feet were bare and thought of the broken glass which in stepping over she must have taken to be evidence of his carousing the rest of his day promised little and for a while he limped around the convents grounds to try to keep the leg from stiffening though he might have wished for a less congested place to do so the courtyard had become a forum for what seemed like every staff officer in the army as it emerged that the marquess of wellington had also made it his advanced headquarters for the formal surrender of the city the place had indeed more the air of bedlam than of a convent or even than of a cavalry billet had he suspected that in the midst of this seeming babble there might be the commanderinchief he would have taken pains to make himself scarce but nothing suggested such a distinction and he almost literally stumbled on him around the east corner of the cloisters sir stapleton cotton one of several generals in the assemblage spied him before he could turn away cornet hervey how are you my boy come hither he tried hard not to limp as he crossed the yard wanting no sympathy lord wellington this is cornet hervey of the sixth it was he who saw off the sortie on our left yesterday the commanderinchief nodded without smiling smart work boy smart work he said simply it was very probably the first time he had said anything complimentary to anyone in the cavalry for months certainly to anyone in the sixth for all the regimental ambivalence towards wellington however hervey could not but feel a warm glow in those sparse words of praise there were some in the cavalry and hervey would count himself among them who would own that his strictures were all too frequently justified if a regiment could not be relied on to rally after a charge the marquesss principal and recurring lament then to what purpose was it in the field hervey knew full well that there was many an officer though mercifully few in the sixth now who derided outpost work and the like and considered mere celerity of movement to be the criterion of efficiency and it seemed that all were to be judged in wellingtons eyes by their meagre accomplishments but for a cornet to air such deprecating views risked regimental oblivion as he had once discovered when venturing the opinion that the cavalrys horsemastership was deficient only that edmonds had somewhat unexpectedly agreed with him wellingtons chiding for maguilla and vitoria had been a different matter however the affair at maguilla had been misconstrued because slade had not had the courage to tell him that his intelligence was faulty as for vitoria with its rapaciousness and letting slip marshal jourdan and much of his army noone could but denounce it but to single out the cavalry when all they had done was steal a march on the infantry in the pillaging seemed not a little peevish the day had been hot and long in its coming and there had been wine in riverfuls hervey had detested the orgy of relief as heartily as any but such was the mood of the army nor had wellington himself fared ill from it for the eighteenth had taken the marshals baton and wellington had sent it to the prince regent you have sent me the baton of a marshal of france wrote the prince in reply and i send you that of an english one in return but for the present hervey was content simply to bask in that economical praise smart work then as suddenly as he had found himself in that grand assemblage a trumpeter of the escort sounded markers the courtyard ceased to be a forum and became instead a parade square as volleys of shouted commands echoed from the high walls and signalled the time for fieldmarshal the marquess of wellington to ride in triumph into the city captain lankester was in his cell when hervey found him writing letters to the next of kin of the dozen dragoons from a troop who had died in the previous fortnight how the orderly room would discover who and where the troopers kin were and how many of them would be able to read the letters for themselves was another matter but that would not deter him hervey stood at the open door watching him captain sir edward lankester baronet the senior troop and squadron leader with a goodsized estate in hertfordshire and a handsome income he could have delegated this task to anyone and spent his time arranging comfortable quarters for himself in the city and few outside the sixth would have thought a deal of it but he had not and scarcely would he have contemplated it for it was as much his own as it was the sixths way lankester could give him no news however save that edmonds wished to see him the instant the surgeon warranted him sound why does the major wish to see me is it on account of general slade there was more than a note of foreboding in the question but lankester did not seem minded to allay it even if he had had the power to do so i have not the shadow of an idea since he has evidently elected not to confide in me and you may be sure with every good reason hervey made no reply lankester dipped his pen in the silver inkbottle of his exquisitely fitted writingcase and signed another letter with painstaking care an illegible hand was to him as abhorrent as rust on a sabre my advice is that you present yourself before him at once he added at length and without looking up for there were three more letters to write the month had taken an unusually high toll and his cornets troubles were trifling by comparison hervey supposed well enough what the reason for edmondss summons must be but god willing he would endure no more than a rebuke even that however would be disagreeable in the extreme some of the ncos might take refuge in the knowledge of edmondss soft heart but his tongue could scourge an officer as surely as the lash scourged a defaulter herveys release from arrest had also been irregular of that he was only too aware and edmondss imprecation god preserve us boy rang in his ears still a mere rebuke seemed improbable herveys grip on the swordscabbard had become clammy even inside his glove and his right hand was clenched so tight that his fingernails dug into the palm the crucifix and the guidon had blurred as one his eyes stinging with the effort of not blinking edmonds had addressed him with pronounced formality it is a very singular thing indeed mr hervey for a cornet to be placed in arrest upon the field of battle he had asked for an explanation of the circumstances precisely and dispassionately and hervey had in some measure done his bidding he had at least given as wholly indifferent an account as anyone might it was perhaps a more exact report than edmonds had required but hervey had been at pains to elaborate on serjeant armstrongs conduct in the affair with the battery which he had deemed to be of the highest order as he finished he glanced down for the first time as if to reinforce his closing cadence he saw at once and he had not done so before perhaps not surprisingly in view of his trepidation that edmondss face was no longer swollen so trivial was the observation in the circumstances that it discomfited him still further the fact was not without its significance however for the toothoperator had cleanly drawn the abscessed molar that morning and the pain had at last given way to a soreness which the laudanum in prodigious quantities since was able to ease the opiate was undeniably an element in the unexpected warmth with which the major now addressed him my dear boy he began rising from his chair and indicating another to him major joseph edmonds always took inordinate trouble to guard against any sign of favour towards hervey though heaven only knew how difficult he found that sometimes he concealed his regard so well that he appeared abrupt and unsympathetic and it would have been the profoundest wonder to hervey to discover in what affection admiration even the major held him lankester may have been the regimental paragon and edmonds would have been loudest in his praise but something in the captains corinthian accomplishment put edmonds not wholly at ease in his company in hervey he saw something of himself as a young cornet but and this was the distinction he saw in him too a quality not easily defined which might with care and good fortune secure his advancement beyond mere field rank my dear boy he repeated everything you have told me accords perfectly with all that i have heard from several different quarters the matter is entirely closed herveys relief was palpable that relief in itself was sufficient balm in his troubled circumstances but edmondss next pronouncement was in the nature of a miraclecure i have no less a letter of appreciation from the commanderinchief the major continued his words now betraying just the faintest trace of the opiums solvent the field marshal seems to be making a particular effort to praise his cavalry for a change doubtless because there has been no riot since vitoria but then again everyone will ascribe this new and godly discipline to an increase in flogging he declared sardonically for he himself loathed the practice intensely and he considered the sixths discipline to be the stronger for its absence clearing his throat he began to read the formal commendation his excellency the commanderinchief is pleased to express his appreciation of the valuable service performed yesterday by the th light dragoons under the immediate command of major edmonds no doubt they had to delve hard to discover my name he added caustically the soldierlike conduct the constancy of duty the celerity and gallantry of execution the commanderinchief will commend these observations to the horse guards in the highest possible terms of approbation edmonds placed the letter on the table but the honour is all yours my boy and you may be assured that i shall convey that fact in my reply though i must confide that my recommendation will hardly count for much but sir stapleton cotton too wants you to have some preferment there will be a lieutenants vacancy soon when rawlings goes to the tenth and while you are not the next in seniority there would be no objection in the circumstances to the lieutenancys being yours if you can find the money praise had been one thing but hervey was taken wholly aback by the offer of seniority he had been superseded so many times by others with greater means that he had reconciled himself to a long wait by his rapid reckoning he could own to six hundred pounds just but he would need twelve hundred for the lieutenancy and his cornetcy would bring say eight hundred and fifty it would be tight especially with new regimentals to buy but if he could purchase lieutenants rank it would mean that in twelve months he would be eligible for a captaincy and a troop though how he would be able then to find the additional two thousand pounds when his father was a mere country parson with no other patron but the diocese to the living and a modest enough living at that was quite beyond him for the present well then mr hervey how say you is it yes or are we to put up the lieutenancy for auction in craigs court hervey accepted with alacrity and left the orderly room in higher spirits than he had known in many a month but as he did so a voice hailed him from across the courtyard a voice which only another from the black country could find appealing and which for a cornet invariably portended something bothersome lieutenant and adjutant ezra barrows eighteen years in the ranks of the st dragoons had made him long on soldierly wisdom but short on ceremony the inelegant extract as he was known by the dandier officers mr hervey you look sound to me you can be picket officer stables now if you please in gods name hervey recoiled how those birmingham vowels grated he wondered how anyone could deride johnsons when barrows sounded so witless oh and congratulations on the lieutenancy i reckon your troopll pass the plate round if yer father cant pass his theyre all sitting high in the stirrups theres a deal of vitoria gold in them aversacks hervey smiled thinly that barrow of all people should taunt him for his lack of means irritated beyond measure it was bad enough with the likes of rawlings sneering goodnatured though it might have been he had a perfectly adequate allowance adequate that is for campaign service he did not suppose it would amount to much in brighton or dublin perhaps barrow did not think much of the clergy or their younger sons queer fellow efficient certainly but no boon companion he supposed lord george irvine must have known what he was doing when he brought barrow in from the royals though hervey could hardly believe that there were not others as congenial as they were capable thank you barrow decent of you to say so he replied with as much courtesy as he could summon he would have preferred the company of his mess and its table to this sudden imposition of picket duty as he entered the cloisters where standing stalls for the three hundred or so troop horses had been improvised just within the letter of wellingtons ordinance that churches should not be taken for stabling there was an audible groan every dragoon knew that hervey on picket meant twice as long an inspection but if the respect were grudging it was real none the less this hay is poor sarntmajor he began though he might have said the same at any stables parade since the summer before as bad as ive seen sir were damping it down but i hope the quartermasters come back with better soon or theyll all be coughing on it it was c troops man on duty a longlimbed salopian whose father had been the wynnstays huntsman for twenty years and with the best hands in the serjeants mess and what is the ration of hard feed today a halfstone of corn sir and good crushed barley it is too they had two pounds with chop first thing then the same again at midday better than it has been but still not enough about half what they need we would not be hunting on this at home now herveys eye was next drawn to a sorrowfullooking chestnut tied up in a dark corner away from the others with its head down almost to the floor what is wrong with him he asked the farrier close by moon blindness sir im to shoot im as soon as ive taken is shoes off moon blindness he replied sir its a disease of well i know what its a disease of corporal but there has not been a single case since i have been in the regiment tell the truth sir i avent seen a case either and nor have i added the troop serjeantmajor whose fourteen years as a dragoon settled the question of its incidence this is the veterinary officers judgement asked hervey though it was unlikely that it could have been any others ay sir replied the farrier he saw im after first parade and then again after watering this afternoon hervey stepped closer and reached out slowly to the geldings head but the horse made no move he crouched down and saw that the left eye was closed with swelling around it and a heavy discharge careful sir called the farrier hes terrible shy about the head how does his eye look hervey asked tell the truth again sir i avent seen it its been closed all day ill fetch his trooper private clamp was a young man eighteen or so recently joined from the depot squadron he wore his stableclothes with the mark of the recruit and he looked unhappy clamp have any of your troop officers seen this horse no sir not today theyre all on outpicket how long have you had him since i came sir just after christmas he answered sounding even more unhappy clamp there is no need to look quite so troubled i am not about to have you arrested clamps eyes began to go misty god help us sighed the serjeantmajor its not that sir continued the trooper his soft devon voice in a quaver i ave two orses to do an theyre both chestnuts anthe other one were bad like this when i got ere and if he goes like this one too well thats enough clamp and stand properly to attention there snapped the serjeantmajor though with just enough sympathy in his voice to stay the boys rambling without precipitating tears herveys brow furrowed at the thought that there might be a second case t dont understand it at all sarntmajor moon blindness specific ophthalmia its so rare that none of us has seen it before and now there sounds as if there might be two horses in the same troop clamp the other chestnut he has been well enough since christmas sir and did anything cause that sickness that you know of hed had a bang on the ead from something but i cant remember what had he indeed and this one number hervey stooped to find the regimental number on the offfore hoof the sixth had lately adopted this practice instead of the approved method of cutting the number into the coat j did he have any knocks about the head he ad a thorn in is eye a week ago sir hervey made a thoughtful umm sound fetch a candle clamp what are you thinking mr hervey asked the serjeantmajor im thinking that i should like to see the eye for myself would you hold up his head for me his eye will be way back in its socket by the time you prise it open thats why im not going to force it hold the candle up close clamp he placed his hand carefully on the geldings brow and gently extended his thumb so that it rested on the margin of the upper lid what exactly are you doing then theres a muscle just above the eyelid the retractor muscle he replied if you press gently but firmly on it it ceases to act with any strength and the lid can be lifted quite easily hervey pressed for almost a minute and then drew up the lid slowly using his other hand to pull down the lower lid the gelding stood quite calm and still well ill be damned muttered the serjeantmajor an old trooper taught me that daniel coates he was with the sixteenth in america he taught me to ride use a sword and a pistol and everything about handling a troop and all before i was twelve i should think there is very little that daniel coates does not know said hervey absently do you see anything the serjeantmajor pressed even more intrigued take a look at the pupil for yourself sarntmajor what do you see the middles very blue what else nothing that i can tell sir its very watery of course the pupil is it diminished no i would not say it was just so sarntmajor and with that hervey let the eye close we must summon the veterinary officer im afraid hes been bedded down sir fever again the poor devils riddled with it he ought to give up well sarntmajor this horse is not to be shot he needs some damp muslin over his eyes and then turning out in a day or so he has common ophthalmia not specific the symptoms are all but identical except that with moon blindness the pupil is invariably diminished clamp what is the other chestnuts number j sir him and was bought as a pair in england umm went hervey again order feedingoff then sarntmajor and now at last he could go and see his own chargers stabled in a tithe barn on clean straw the first they had seen in months inevitably they were chewing it its all right sir chirped johnson its wheat straw herveys little mare whickered in recognition while continuing to chew her bed but she looked badly run up is there no hay anywhere he asked pulling her ears not yet sir nothing decent quartermasters are still out progging jessye was by common consent the handiest charger in the sixth although when hervey had first joined for duty she had been derided as a coverthack fit only to take a blade to a meet but not to follow hounds barely an inch over fifteen hands yet she had the sturdiness and intelligence of her dam a welsh cob which for twenty years had carried his father round his parish and the speed and endurance of her sire a thoroughbred whose bloodlines went directly back to the godolphin arab she had struggled out of the womb on herveys fourteenth birthday the day he left the vicarage for shrewsbury school a birthday present of such apt timing that his understanding of natural history was unusual for some years to come he alone had schooled her though she had taught him almost as much as he had imparted to her and he always counted it an act of providence that an outbreak of farcy prior to sailing had kept her behind in england during the first campaign the thought that he would have had to shoot her on the beach at corunna with all the others filled him still with a peculiar dread an horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength eh challenged his groom not my words johnson the psalmists well he must have been fuzzed i mean that it is written in the psalms hervey explained with a smile of mild dismay thirtythree i think as if johnson might somehow wish to look up the reference for himself they dont say owt about orses that makes much sense hervey gave up her coat stares johnson we must find her some blankets and make a mash shell have colic before midnight ill be bound wheat straw or not tie her up for the time being a shrewd observer would next have noted a subtle change in herveys manner with jessye he was easy and familiar with his second charger he was perceptibly distant respectful rather than affectionate nero looks fine enough he said oh ay sir es all right that cuts nothin nero had been bred to look fine a full hand and a half higher than jessye he had come to hervey from the kings stallion depot outside hanover via an ensign in the footguards lieutenant darcey jessope had been officer of the guard one day when his majesty in one of his periodic derangements and conceiving himself to be in the herrenhausen rather than at windsor had become convinced that jessope in his scarlet was one of his hanoverians the king had taken him at once to the royal stables and presented him with the first animal that his majesty considered appropriate for an officer of his leibgarde jessope had thereby become the owner of a mount which though magnificent he subsequently found unmanageable he would always ascribe this to late gelding not wholly convincingly whenever the subject arose and he had been relieved to pass him on to hervey for a song after the battle at salamanca a generous token of gratitude for his rescue halfdead from the melee as jessope himself had remarked laconically from his hospital bed with an arm almost severed by a sabre slash he had little hope of being able to manage a rig jessope hervey smiled at the thought of him and wondered what recovery he was making since his return to england and when indeed he might see him again doubtless he was being feted at this very instant by the ladies of st jamess he smiled again as he recalled jessopes description of nero unmanageable yet in one sense it was exact enough for in the hands of any but those which had been trained in the classical method he was wholly unresponsive positively wilful in hochschule hands his manners were impeccable he could cover ground better even than corporal collinss gelding and had jumped four foot six though he lacked jessyes endurance there had been times as a boy in the ridinghall at wilton house when hervey would gladly have quit his lessons with the austrian reitlehrer and gone back to his simple hunting seat but he had frequently thanked god that the option of doing so had never been his no riding master had been able since to disabuse him of his conviction that to be master of both a classical and an english seat was a peerless asset jessye was his concern that evening however and they managed eventually to rug her up with blankets from the chaplains quarters the priest had not been seen since their arrival and make a mash of what seemed to be bran which johnson had discovered unattended somewhere the quartermasters came in with two waggonloads of good hay soon afterwards and though it meant turning out the troopers again to replace the dusty stuff in the lines the work was done quickly and hervey was able to have the orderly trumpeter sound the mess call by six oclock a jaunty little tune it put a skip into his spirits if not into his step as he left an officers wife has puddings and pies a serjeants wife has skilleee but a soldiers wife has nothing at all to fill her empty belleee e e e thank heaven there were no soldiers wives with them this time nor any others for that matter he knew their worth on campaign for sure but he knew their trouble too and the balance lay heavily in his judgement with the latter in any event all that might soon be behind them noone at the stables parade had said as much but there had been a distinct air of anticipation a sensing that the end of their long ordeal this seemingly unending war with bonaparte was near but even these comparatively light duties were telling on him and he was glad of the opportunity to get to his own mess however his hopes of any immediate rest were dashed as soon as he entered the noisy and smokefilled refectory cries of the child samuel greeted him though he was at a loss to know why first book of samuel called harding the senior lieutenant in mock despair and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with the lord and also with men hervey smiled as he tumbled to the reference the intelligence of lord wellingtons pleasure had it seemed reached the mess before him though he hardly expected that he was in favour with the stable details after calling them out a second time a press of officers formed to shake his hand and the steward trying manfully to find some ingress was jostled this way and that before being able to proffer a silver tray on which there was a letter for him it has been some time in reaching us sir he said apologetically though the delay was none of his making hervey was pleased with the excuse to seek out a quiet corner but as he did so the sight of the envelope at once discomfited him though he had never been given to too much introspection nor indeed had there been any great opportunity for it during this campaign there was something in the three short lines of the address which brought him up short made him abruptly aware of just how much his life belonged to the army that would not ordinarily have discomposed him for this was his life and he held no other to be more honourable but the sudden notion that his soul might have been taken by the drum too disturbed him more perhaps it was the terseness of the address cornet m p hervey th lt dgns spain three lines name regiment country the very essence of his being in so short a space and then another chill a portent of the contents he stared for some time before he could bring himself to open it for the hand was unmistakable though months had passed since any word from wiltshire and it was a hand conspicuously more restrained than he had seen before horningsham january dearest matthew i am afraid that this letter bears the saddest news our john has died in oxford on this th instant according to mr heywood his vicar this hard winter we are enduring was taking its toll most cruelly on his parish and he was much about the poorest parts trying to bring relief he became ill a fortnight ago and then succumbed to pneumonia there were three more pages in his sisters round script but he could not read on though his expression must have reflected the news and little to his mind could have been worse he was able nevertheless to slip the letter into his tunic and escape without giving away his anguish in the quiet of his cell he sat with his head in his hands for what seemed an age the irony that surrounded by death as he had been these past six years it was death at a distance which was finally to pierce him only added to his grief there was a knock at the door not now johnson he called but it opened slowly and there appeared diffidently the regiments veterinary officer pardon my intruding so hervey but i wished to have words concerning the chestnut in c troop the voice was equally hesitant hervey would have wished for this at another time but he sensed he had little choice but to yield well yes indeed selden come in sit down he said indicating a sedile which johnson had acquired during the day hervey the farriermajor has reported to me what transpired at evening stables he began coughing badly his face in a feverish sweat hervey gave him a cup of water you ought not to be out of your bed selden for heavens sake that i know its a damned potent attack this time but i had to speak with you about my diagnosis you examined the eye im told yes i could barely see it i confess what did the pupil look like undiminished a little dilated if anything i should say the veterinary officer sighed i should have got someone to look but the eye was so far back in its socket hervey nodded and i looked at my notebook and saw that the horse had had a previous attack of ophthalmia if there is recurrence then it signals progressive blindness and there is no recourse but to the bullet as you very well know thus i made the presumption of the specific condition i have only seen two cases before both in the indies but i do not understand how there could be a recurrence of the simple i think you will find said hervey quietly that it was the other chestnut j that was the previous case you have made the two as one the veterinary officers jaw fell then i must go at once and offer my papers to the major he replied there is no need for that insisted hervey you were in no condition to be attending to them in the first instance here take this brandy and he poured a large measure from the bottle which johnson had left by his bed none of us i dare say is in the best of sorts but your judgement seems not to have been impaired by your own infirmity said selden gesturing towards herveys leg that is as may be but i dare say i would not be so attentive now he replied how so asked selden at once puzzled but faintly encouraged by the reply oh it does not matter said hervey dismissively realizing he had let on more than he intended selden had another fit of coughing which required more brandy to subdue and he mopped his brow with a large ochreous silk square which matched almost exactly his feverish complexion horse doctor that i may be i am still able to recognize obvious symptoms of dispirits in humans hervey sighed but in truth he was glad to share his ill news which selden received attentively and your brother was i would hazard a fine sort of man an active clergyman no mere timeserver said the veterinary officer when hervey had finished of all the worthless creatures i have seen survive no prosper these past six years i cannot understand why a man so full of goodness as he should die a cruel and troubling paradox agreed selden the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us indeed and john would quote deuteronomy just so but it all seems remote and conjectural now i find it ever to be so frankly i confess that i cannot put any faith in the claims of the church what will you do are there any family obligations which now befall you i have just accepted a lieutenancy and i do not know if i am in any position to do so i simply do not know what are my duties at home i shall write of course and apply for furlough as soon as the war ceases they seem to think it is imminent until then what other family do you have asked the veterinary officer coughing again but warming to the intimacy he was rarely afforded in the mess as a whole a sister one year my senior but i should of course first say my father and mother they are all well selden interrupted yes i believe them to be my parents are no longer young but they are both active and have always enjoyed good health they are the very best of people i have always felt their absence more keenly than might be supposed and my sister elizabeth she has spirits to equal anyone i own to having been in her thrall since childhood and hervey is there any other in your affections so direct a question and from a quarter he would least have expected took him aback and his disinclination to make any reply was plain selden was a kindly and cultured man unusually gentlemanly for a veterinary surgeon yet he generally remained aloof his periodic bouts of fever racked him dreadfully but although he had completed eighteen years service and was entitled to retire on halfpay he struggled on he had been with the sixth only since the start of the second campaign and there was a whiff of sulphur in his history said some yet hervey had always found him the most decent of company forgive me hervey but i have watched you with advantage these past three years you have an uncommon facility for soldiering and yet no preferment has come your way and never will as long as money determines things he began coughing again so violently this time that hervey thought he must choke another cup of brandy brought relief however you must go east take up with john company they would value your aptitude you would have a regiment in no time hervey might have had a thousand objections but he chose simply to point out the circumstances of which he had just spoken i cannot even begin to think such a thing when matters at home are so indeterminate of course you cannot but after you have settled these concerns or is there perhaps someone else you must take account of not at all forgive me once more but i had thought that young lamings sister hervey blushed and stammered slightly i that is how could you possibly have thought that it is a year more since she came to portugal and then for a month only oh i thought i saw something perhaps then it was more on her side and the young portuguese lady what was her name delgado was it not hervey was even more astonished for seldens observation these past three years had indeed been active frances laming had enchanted him with her pretty smiles but isabella delgado had positively tortured him with her dark beauty no selden there is noone i had once a passion for the girl with whom i shared a schoolroom though since that was a full ten years ago and i dared not own it to her i hardly think it need be taken account of now but a smile overcame him at the thought a trumpetcall signalled that watchsetting was imminent and veterinarysurgeon selden took his leave with much violent coughing to allow hervey to ready himself for that parade it had been an extraordinary if agreeable meeting but now that he was alone all his earlier disquiet returned and with interest for selden had stirred up so much the second call however began to reclaim him for the regulated world that was his daily existence and as he fastened on his swordbelt he found once more that he could bury his uncertainties in the minutiae of his soldiers routine he almost spoke it aloud hitch up the scabbard free the sabretache set the shako square draw on the gloves in the short term at least it never failed so much so that by the time he reached the picket where he would take longer than any of the dragoons would have thought possible in determining their fitness for the night watch his only thought was how sharp he would find their sabres chapter two cruel punishment april am boneys beat boneys beat hervey woke with a start and sprang from his bed but he almost fainted with the first step so nauseous was the pain and he fell against the wall retching the candle flickered in the sudden disturbance of still air and he had to grope for his swordbelt in the halfdarkness outside his cell it was no brighter for the lantern in the corridor had dimmed to little more than a glow but he could just make out the figures of the orderly corporal and trumpeter pye approaching its over boneys habdicated this time he heard the words and was speechless its right enough sir continued corporal taylor as other officers began appearing likewise roused by the commotion boneys finished i eard major edmonds telling the sarntmajor only ten minutes ago but before that even a staff dragoon from headquarters was by and told me the intelligence had come from paris last evening the news which they had awaited so keenly and for so long somehow lacked the inspiration that he presumed great news must have it seemed unfitting that it should be hawked along the corridors of a cloistered billet by a corporal at this ungodliest of hours he had imagined some ceremony or other would be attached to its heralding next there appeared the adjutant fully dressed and at first hervey supposed that this portended the ceremony he had anticipated yet barrow had so much an expression of the everyday that he again began to doubt the corporals information first parade at seven details as usual gentlemen announced the adjutant officers to assemble in the mess at eight sound reveille pye barrow was as ever spare with his words and did not wait for questions marching briskly off towards the orderly room spurs ringing on the flagstones hervey was angered he was picket officer and yet the adjutant had confided nothing to him he may have been a mere cornet but confound it barrow would have been forthcoming enough if there had been an alarm when the echo of trumpeter pyes long reveille had died away the first time the extended rather than the short call had been used since winter quarters there came the gentler sound of a bell and hervey saw at the furthest end of the cloisters several nuns making for the chapel the bell struck every second and with so insistent a ring that he found his annoyance diminishing with each stroke he wandered into the courtyard it was too dark to make out the time by his watch as dark as it had been at midnight when he had trudged the streets of the defeated city to do his rounds of the outlying picket there had been no moon and the streets had been as black as pitch for the lamplighters had fled and the occupants of the houses had shuttered and boarded their windows so that it was impossible to know whether they were lit inside or had been abandoned how different it had been at vitoria there had been no question then of not knowing what lay behind the shutters for they had all been prised off and the property sacked spanish property yet here a french city where the fighting had been immeasurably more bloody than at vitoria the provostmarshals men were patrolling the streets as if it had been westminster the marquess of wellington had ordered that there was to be no looting and no looting there was on pain of death by an english musket not that hervey disapproved of such an order he loathed the larceny where it exceeded what might reasonably be counted as foraging but he hated most the bestiality to which men would sink in the process never did he imagine on entering the kings service that one day it would be his duty to shoot a man wearing the same uniform or rather the same kings uniform as he had done after badajoz the vision of that connaught private crazed with drink taking the ball from herveys pistol full in the chest yet still setting about him with murderous strength would long remain yet the terror in the dying eyes of the young spanish girl whom the man had violated and the blood from her slashed throat would more than mitigate any guilt or even regret that he might feel as the regiment woke to the call of the trumpet and began its familiar routine he walked back to his cell passing the chapel with its plain windows lit dimly from within a frail chant te deum laudamus drifted out with an occasional whicker from the cloister stalls punctuating the plainsong he found his cell a blaze of light compared with the gloom elsewhere for each corner was filled with candles and an oil lamp burned brightly on a small table these meagre but useful campstores bearing witness to the everresourceful johnsons nocturnal activities next to the lamp stood a steaming canteen of tea and a clean pair of undress overalls lay on the bed baggage came in last night sir explained his groom ill bring trest along presently thought thesed be more comfortable ill take thee field overalls to mend now i ear its all over but hervey had to admit that he had no more information than the barrack room evidently had do you have my sketchbooks yet he asked ay sir theyre with trest of thee things there was no more news at first parade either only speculation bonaparte was dead bonaparte had escaped to america bonaparte was in a cage in the tuileries by the time the officers assembled in the refectory at eight oclock there was at least unanimity that bonaparte was finished there were barely a dozen and a half officers on parade that morning fewer than half the establishment with which they had begun the campaign hervey could picture the absent faces as clearly as if they were standing there the colonel would no doubt return to duty in good time but the two captains lennox and twentyman would never again hear reveille nor would martyn and mayall the lieutenants who had fallen at salamanca nor cornets wyllie and lord arthur percival killed at badajoz cornet bruce would never again see the wild flowers of whose names both vulgar and botanical he had such astonishing recall for the explosion of the arsenal after ciudad rodrigo had scorched his eyes terribly and there were others more fortunate who had been invalided home with wounds or sickness they had filled the mess with laughter and companionship and hirsch with the uncommon beauty of his flute and he would miss them even more now that peace brought a respite from the exertions of this campaign the noise which the gallant and fortunate remnant made suggested double their number however and cornet laming had to struggle to make himself heard dye see edmonds hervey hervey looked to where laming nodded and saw the major at the far end of the refectory looking sombre barrow was speaking into his ear and appeared equally grave somethings up said laming i heard after stables that the fourteenth are for america i would not mind america why should that trouble us replied hervey momentarily forgetful of his own pressing need to return home because the regiments worn out that is why we might still have a march on paris if bonapartes flight is but rumour he countered warily that is another matter entirely look around we have been campaigning longer than any corps in the army we are at less than halfstrength look at edmonds his nerves have frayed to nothing hes had the blue devils for months and theres scarcely a horse that id warrant through another winter out but before hervey could reply barrow called them to order and edmonds began speaking gentlemen i have a dispatch from general cotton it reads as follows lord wellington has received intelligence of the abdication of the selfstyled emperor napoleon buonaparte and of his custody with the royal navy there shall be an immediate armistice for two months marshal soult is to surrender his army of the south to the commanderinchief directly the garonne is to be the line of demarcation and toulouse will remain in our possession the administration of the country is to be vested immediately in the appointed representatives of his majesty king lewis the eighteenth who are to be treated as our allies see how quickly will they make white cockades out of tricolours whispered laming too cynical hervey whispered back si foret in terris declaimed laming airily rideret democritus what has horace to do with it laming nodded with faint surprise and hervey took the opportunity to tilt gently at the senior cornets selfesteem laming contrary to what might have been supposed at eton we were not barbarians at shrewsbury oh a most apt riposte i do acknowledge said laming rather too loudly barrow glanced their way sharply and then edmonds continued but there is to be no rest gentlemen two divisions under lord hill are to proceed to america as soon as possible the fourteenth are to accompany them and a squadron of the staff corps we shall be asked for nominations of men of the highest character as usual for the corps meanwhile we shall remain in toulouse until the acknowledgement of king lewis is universal and the french army and marshals have taken oaths of allegiance the cadence seemed to indicate that this was an end to it and a general hubbub began thank god its only the chambermaids for america then said laming we can decamp to paris and then be in leicestershire for next season venery and then venery quipped hervey laming frowned but at least the sixths prizes at vitoria had not landed them with so ungraceful a sobriquet as the fourteenths a silver chamberpot belonging to bonapartes brother had at the time seemed amusing booty to the th light dragoons gentlemen please called barrow and silence quickly returned edmonds paused gentlemen this is i believe the end of what we were coming to think of as a neverending war you have done well the regiment has done well but i fear that this end may be but a beginning we are not for paris however we have been warned for england together with most of the rest of the cavalry and i need not speak aloud my worst fears for you are only too aware of the economies which this parliament will now seek i pray that our seniority will afford us some security and the earl of sussex will not let his regiment disband without protest of that you may be assured meanwhile we must continue to conduct our affairs with the same fidelity trusting that virtue is in itself ultimately a sufficient reward that is all gentlemen and turning about he left the room with not another word a very pretty speech i do declare said cornet laming what say you murray their troop seniors brow furrowed angrily so were going to be paid off are we and what price dye think our commissions will fetch now eh its all very well for the likes of you laming but i paid twice over price and all my peoples estates in the americas have been lost he snapped turning on his heel hervey and laming looked at each other blankly as lieutenant murray stalked away barrow had not left however and he now came up to them looking no less preoccupied than he had before edmonds had spoken the major wishes to see you directly hervey about what he replied there is no more trouble surely not in your case not personally armstrong bloody business bloody bloody business he replied shaking his head the regimental serjeantmajor was already talking with edmonds when barrow and hervey entered the abbesss library which was beginning to look like the orderly room in canterbury for the regiments silver had arrived with the baggage train the crucifix had been more reverently draped with a white sheet and the guidon was unfurled so that the regiments four battlehonours though still to be officially authorized were clearly arrayed tournay where they had lost every third man while covering the infantrys hardpressed retreat willems where they had almost stuck fast in the flanders mud egmontopzee where they had galloped along the beach and dunes for six miles to cut off the french he knew the battles well enough from accounts which lay in the regiments readingroom but that which he admired the greatest that which he wished most to have been party to the honour lay not in the low countries but in a place so distant that it could exist for him only at the extremity of his imagination seringapatam there were still a few old hands in the ranks who remembered that day though most had by now taken their prizemoney to begin life out of uniform those that is who had not drunk or whored it in the three years they remained in india after that affair edmonds was the only officer remaining who had been present he would never speak of it except of late to say that the sack of vitoria was but revelry compared with that of seringapatam the adjutant joined edmonds and the rsm beside the guidon but hervey saluted and stood at attention in front of the majors writingtable for a second time in as many days the rsms appearance was more than usually imposing and hervey felt his habitual unease when in his company mr lincoln had been in the same action as the rest of the regiment two days before but for all the world he looked now as if he were ready for a review on the parade ground at the horse guards his hessian boots gleaming like patent he looked as fit as any roughrider only the grey of his halfmuttonchops giving any clue to his real age abandoned as an infant in the undercroft of lincolns inn raised subsequently on the charity of the benchers and given the customary surname for such foundlings he had enlisted as a boytrumpeter at the age of twelve in the second year of the american revolt and his attestation papers had long been conveniently lost herveys gaze fell on the four silverlace chevrons surmounted by the crown on his upper right arm the effort the years of duty which they marked would awe any cornet and he wondered what lincoln must be making of his handling of the picket perhaps the rsm thought it all that could be expected from someone whose rank rested solely on the deposit of with the regimental agents mr hervey i will be brief began edmonds as the three turned towards him lincoln saluting briskly general slade is pressing charges of gross insubordination against serjeant armstrong he will allow me to deal summarily with the charges if i order him to be flogged otherwise he will have armstrong courtmartialled and dismissed with disgrace he knows the sixth does not flog i will not flog it is the vilest thing cruel punishment corrosive of true discipline and morals yet armstrong will be broken for ever if i do not was there anything more in mitigation that you have not already told me hervey glanced at rsm lincoln who remained impassive doubtless thinking that if he hervey had kept calm then armstrong might perhaps have kept his temper sir serjeant armstrong was insubordinate but he was my coveringserjeant and it surely might be taken to be mere excess of zeal lieutenant regan was guilty of undermining my authority in front of the picket and no doubt serjeant armstrong felt he should act in this respect i do not doubt that hervey but insubordination is a military offence whereas regans conduct was ungallant and that is not do not misunderstand mind regan behaved like an ass by all accounts edmonds now looked across to barrow whereupon the adjutant began speaking in an uncommonly warm tone there is but one chance hervey you might petition for redress of grievance in respect of wrongful arrest the prospect might cause the general to abandon the charges hervey did not hesitate then i will do so of course will it work sir he asked looking at edmonds i think it very probably will we do not know whether it was slade himself who ordered the arrest or whether it was regan who was overzealous even if it were regans doing he has such connections that slade would not want a squeeze but the thing is this hervey i am afraid that whichever way it goes you will be a marked man so far as slade is concerned as indeed will i though that is a different matter so be it sir and if this stratagem is a success asked edmonds turning to mr lincoln what should be done with armstrong then sarntmajor well sir began the rsm you know it is my opinion that a senior rank should not be humiliated for a momentary lapse of good sense there was to be no punishment before general slade raised these charges my mess would not be dismayed if we followed that same course now and i tender my apologies that one of my mess should fail his officer as armstrong has done i have yet to speak to him in connection with this he will not forget it when i do noone could doubt it very well then mr lincoln said edmonds a rebuke and nothing further mr barrow i suggest that you make the brigade major aware of mr herveys intention to petition without delay with any luck it may never come to a formal submission that is all gentlemen but mr hervey stay a moment when the others had left edmonds motioned him to sit in the chair by his writingtable and he himself sat on the edge his earlier formality easing look hervey this is really a deuced tricky business slade is a vindictive man and his reach is long i do not even know whether approaching sir stapleton cotton would be to any avail in truth i wish lord george were here now we must get you out of slades reach there is an appointment with the staff corps squadron for america and after the affair of the french battery i feel sure that we could place it for you for you are aware of general cottons opinion of your action the last thing i want to do is see you leave the regiment even temporarily but i really do urge you to take this opportunity hervey said nothing stunned by edmondss pessimism at length he reached into his tunic sir he began unfolding his sisters letter i would have welcomed the prospect of america but yesterday i received this from home my brother has died he was my elder and i feel that i must at least return home to discover my fathers circumstances and wishes i am not sure now that i may accept the lieutenancy even edmonds nodded yes i understand well enough he sighed there comes a time in this whole wretched business of fighting when the spirit just yearns for something peaceful and decent yes and gentle even and you are aware as i indicated in the mess that this news of our returning straight to england may well mean disbandment your investment might then be lost yes sir though i would hazard all in that respect i am glad to hear it those loobies in parliament will make unconscionable reductions in the army mr pitts income tax will be repealed and therell be beggars in scarlet aplenty on the streets that is what cotton believes too i do not wish to talk about it with the regiment just yet as long as you understand all the implications of not going to america there might even be promotion with the corps whereas you might be thrown on to halfpay with a worthless cornetcy to sell if you stay you are a courageous officer brave but thank you sir he replied a little uncomfortably not just that continued the major i mean that you have yet to acquire sufficient guile but then so have i for that matter it might be a case of crabs for us both if black jack slade has another turn i will leave the question of the lieutenancy for a while but i must have an answer on america tomorrow that is all matthew captain lankesters advice was at least unambiguous and exactly as hervey would have predicted lankester the corinthian always squared up to difficulties as he had done to illbreaking balls on upper club at eton though always with a sobering realism he hardly looked up from his journal which he kept with the same diligence that he would his gamebook in hertfordshire as hervey recounted the america option petition and stay put he drawled slade has been the death of enough good men do you want to be shot like a blackcock by some halfbreed in a racoon hat hervey laughed for the first time since the letter from home he was pleased with the advice for though he was perfectly happy to take his chance with an american militiaman the option seemed too much like running edmondss was without doubt the more prudent of the advice he knew that full well and it was all very fine for sir edward lankester with wealth and rank in his favour to urge the devilmaycare course but prudence in a cornet was a questionable attribute like coyness in whores edmonds had once said what would it profit him to evade this challenge to his selfrespect now when other challenges would surely follow he knew right enough that for him there was but one option as in some medieval scriptorium hervey sat in his cell making a fair copy of the draft petition which barrow had given him there was a knock at the door come in johnson he called absently but johnson never knocked and hervey looked up to find instead the same sister of the day before her habit was no longer bloodstained and her face not nearly so drawn he might not have recognized her but for the iceblue eyes which now less sunken were more piercing than before she had cast her overmantle and he was able to gain a more faithful impression of her figure as pleasingly slender as any he had seen her bosom too suggested an aptness for fashion unlike the spanish nuns whose amplitude would have challenged the corsetiers art having had the broken sutures replaced by the surgeon only the afternoon before he was perplexed at her being there though much charmed yes sister can i help he asked in french and she replied to his evident astonishment in english mr hervey i have heard that lord wellington has said that if king louis were to be restored we would be treated as if liberated rather than conquered not only did she convey her sense perfectly with an admirable mastery of the subjunctive but her aspirates as alien to a frenchwoman as they seemed to be to johnson were breathed consummately and there was scarce a trace of accent though she did not anglicize the kings name as cottons dispatch had done or at least the way in which edmonds had read it mr hervey forgive me she continued yesterday you paid me the compliment of speaking in french and i have not returned that compliment until now yesterday was well a most tiring day i had not slept in sister there is no need he interrupted i believe you thought me indulgent in so far as i appeared to demand the surgeon in person that was furthest from my intention i do not doubt it for a moment mr hervey you are an honourable man i think one who might be trusted she replied softly i hold myself to be so sister said hervey thankfully it was curious how he felt the need of this nuns approval sir i wish to explain something to you and then i have a kindness to ask by all means sister he replied intrigued by both the warmth of her tone and the notion that he might be of assistance to her mr hervey my name is maria de chantonnay my people are from the vendée there was much suffering there after the rising for the king you may know of general turreaus colonnes infernales yes it was some time ago but we all know of it my father lost his estates there after the fighting we have been under suspicion ever since my family will learn of the fighting here in toulouse and they may fear the worst for me her voice trailed off hervey nodded in sympathy but was at a loss to see where this might lead sir your army will i think have couriers whom it can trust i wish to commit a letter to my people to you he was not even sure where the vendée was he said that he supposed it must be possible although he could not immediately think how when she rectified his ignorance of the french seaboard he was even more sceptical i will of course do all i can sister i cannot say whether your letter might be carried by courier however and i fear that it is quite impossible for me to carry it in person since i do not suppose the regiment will march further than bordeaux for our passage to england and the vendee will scarcely be on the marching route to paris for those regiments which are to furnish the garrison there why cannot you entrust it to french hands sister mr hervey there would be a price on any letter addressed to the comte de chantonnay where may i find one of my own countrymen to trust at this time the appeal was irresistible sister maria i will do all i can he said at length though what that is i am not in the least sure sister maria de chantonnay could now at last rest for an englishman an english officer had given his word and she owned that there was no more she could ask for nor indeed need ask for mr hervey she resumed her aspect and tone becoming once again solemn when i came here yesterday you had in your hands st ignatius loyolas spiritual exercises oh but please sit down and rest your leg she seemed suddenly to notice the slight awkwardness with which he stood did you read sufficient of it what constituted sufficiency in her mind he was not sure but he reckoned it would be a demanding measure in a cursory fashion he replied truthfully but guardedly st ignatius was a remarkable man mr hervey you will know of him i feel sure nothing but that he was founder of the jesuits said hervey flatly yes indeed he was she replied with the suggestion of a frown and the jesuits were expelled from spain and portugal half a century ago for political intriguing and from your own country too sister were they not he added yes she sighed and his holiness dissolved their order it is true though some there remained in russia i believe but st ignatius himself mr hervey do you know anything of the man and his faith hervey admitted that he did not and shifted uncomfortably in the sedile his leg was beginning to ache and with apologies he began loosening the bindings of his overalls grateful for the opportunity of distraction sister maria kneeled on the bare stone floor sitting back on her heels oblivious to any sign of his discomfort other than his leg like you st ignatius of loyola was a soldier she pressed the younger son of a spanish nobleman i think you too perhaps are such a son mr hervey of a nobleman i mean no smiled hervey not a nobleman my father is a clergyman a minister of the church of england then a gentleman certainly she replied reflecting his smile st ignatius was from the basque country you must have passed close to loyola when you crossed the pyrenees mr hervey but the name meant nothing to him he was wounded during the siege of pamplona in the war with france about think he made a long convalescence and read much of the life of christ and of the saints and he determined to give his life wholly to gods service he gathered others about him and they bound themselves by vow to become missionaries among the mussulmen of the holy land but when war barred their way to the east they offered their services instead to his holiness hervey wondered where this could be leading but thought better of trying to interrupt her homily it was then that they resolved upon founding a religious order the society of jesus with an additional vow of placing themselves entirely at his holinesss disposal st ignatius brought his soldiers discipline to the order you see mr hervey but i do not see i am afraid sister i do not understand your purpose it is not unusual to find oneself as a soldier with wounds she paused and then startled him with her candour do you pray mr hervey yes of course he replied and do you meditate he recoiled at the intrusion but then so disarming was her voice and manner and so innocent her directness that instead he found himself welcoming her solicitude he knew full well that every officer maintained a pose a mask in which the worst effects of war were immured but this pose however habitual was not maintained without effort and with this nun he perceived the mask to be unnecessary indeed he felt in its slipping a glow a warmth a release even i think sister about certain things i think much but meditation would imply some system would it not yes and the spiritual exercises are just that he could not but permit a smile at the adroitness with which she had brought the colloquy full circle he was outmanoeuvred it was now obvious to him how she had managed to survive both the reign of terror and the repression since he freely confessed that the exercises had engaged him such as he had found the time to read and indeed within the limits of his latin which was of late unpractised but she was no less ready for this selfdeprecation st ignatius also found he had insufficient latin at first he took to studying with the schoolboys of barcelona no less if you wish i will conduct you through the exercises hervey hesitated i am not sure that is i and then with a note of resolution thank you sister i accept with gratitude sister maria made a small bow and said she would return later to begin the catechism but now that the stiff formality between them had eased he felt it possible at last to ask of her certain matters sister a moment if you will my regiment has so abruptly intruded on the peace of this place that well i think what i am trying to say is that we have not seen the like of your order hitherto you seem more he paused again searching for a word that would convey his meaning without disparaging others he had seen more austere mr hervey even the benedictine orders have fallen on hard times in france since the revolution the church is mistrusted and much of its earthly wealth is gone we have been left alone here i believe because toulouse was not a place of importance in the wars but also because we are carmelites we pose no threat that answered in large part the second question he would have asked but he was still unsure of the nature of her order i know of the name carmelite sister he continued but nothing of your origins or rule our roots are in palestine mr hervey among the hermits of mount carmel when the holy land was overrun by the turks they moved west and began living in community but always poor and solitary communities perhaps when you were in spain you saw or heard of the city of avila near madrid i think he knew where the city was but had not been there well if you had been there you would have seen the place where our greatest saint teresa lived a little time after st ignatius she wrote a new rule for our order and it is that which we follow here in toulouse she lived by the simplest of precepts he nodded and made as if to ask a further question but she instead raised a hand forgive me mr hervey but i must go now there are duties for me as there are with you he rose and made a bow after the fashion of the kings germans she smiled and there was warmth in her eyes mr ervey sir how johnsons attitude to aspirates stood in sharp contrast to sister marias adjutant wants to know straight away if tha wants t go tstaff corps hervey sat up and rubbed his eyes what time is it about seven oclock thas slept all night why didnt tha tell me about america he added in a distinctly resentful tone last thing i want to dos roust off there because i heard only yesterday hervey replied in any case i am not going and why must you be so damnably crabby johnson chose to ignore the question it was not difficult to see sometimes why rawlings and boyse had dispensed with his services thought hervey well thank god for that mr ervey but wouldnt it ave meant promotion private johnson may we revert to the usual practice of officer and groom in this regiment he replied with a wearied sigh suit thisen mr ervey sir ill wait till im spoken to the adjutant seemed less surprised than johnson on hearing herveys decision edmonds would be disappointed he said but he really did not think the major had expected him to take the american option anyway well just ave to sweat things out for a day or so until we hear about the petition was his verdict edmonds had calculated that it would be three days perhaps four before they would know if the ruse had worked it would take slade a day fully to comprehend the options it would take him another to come to terms with the indignity of the compromise and it would be the third day before his brigade major would press him for an answer if they did not forward it within three days they would be in default of advocategeneral larpents standing orders for redresses and to be in default of larpents instructions was to invite the wrath of wellington himself sure enough just before evening stables three days later heroys the brigade major himself arrived at the convent to offer the reciprocal arrangement that edmonds had predicted and heroys knew full well whose stratagem it was oh and by the by he added casually with a smile that might just have been described as conspiratorial i was surprised not to see young herveys name put forward for the corps you have heard incidentally that general slade is being recalled to england no he had not the most capital news it was too and edmonds had no qualms about saying so but heroyss next news was not the brigade is to commence the march for embarkation in five days time he began that in itself was not bad news but they were not as everyone had expected to sail from bordeaux where shallowdraught claretboats which made excellent horsetransports would be able to get right up from the mouth of the gironde boulogne exclaimed edmonds when heroys revealed the port at which they would embark for heavens sake man that must be all of eight hundred miles nearly nine replied heroys matteroffact what in gods name is slade thinking of not his doing cotton i should not think he was even asked but has he protested damn it ill go and see wellington myself i think that would be foolhardy even by your standards edmonds you have not exactly endeared yourself to slade i know i said that he has been recalled but stick your neck out any further and well let us just say that in the present scheme of things i counsel extreme caution even sir hussey vivian is having a hard time of things with wellington edmonds accepted heroyss advice with reluctance and had set about readying the sixth for the long march north lankester forbade hervey to take part in any active duty in the hope that his leg might thereby stand the journey instead he arranged for him to receive each morning a pile of french documents of which there seemed no end in the préfecture to scrutinize for anything of intelligence value but they proved to be of a mundane nature with nothing of military interest his work was made less tedious however by the assistance of sister maria de chantonnay whose ignatian catechism had to be conducted in snatches while they sifted through endless titles and land deeds confiscated over the previous two decades come the third day she had by degrees revealed the circumstances of her life before entering the convent her fine english she had learned from her nurse the daughter of lancastrian recusants who had lived with them in the vendee herveys own french he told her had been acquired in the same fashion for his governess had been of an old jansenist family from alsace and she had taught him german too although it was not quite so fluent perhaps as his french at this sister maria laughed and mocked his alsatian accent but you would almost certainly pass for a frenchman if ever it suited you mr hervey an unlikely requirement now i think sister and she agreed i think so i surely pray that there will be no more fighting between our countries and what of you then mr hervey what are your intentions only three days before he had rounded on johnson for wanting to know his business yet now he was content to tell all to this nun about his family about his joining the sixth and his hopes for promotion and how these were suddenly in doubt with the news of his brothers death it seems very strange to me mr hervey that a man must pay for his position in the army any man with aptitude in france may become an officer it does not turn on a question of money no sister it is strange and i for one would not long defend it but it is supposed that it has its merits besides that is making the army a good deal cheaper for parliament what might be these merits mr hervey she asked sceptically well i think if you knew of the dread in which any return to the late commonwealth is still held in our country you would own that by having officers with so tangible a stake in the system there was less chance of their throwing in with some dictator you are suggesting that such a system in france might have stayed a republic france is not england sister but such a notion is not infeasible is this notion not at heart dishonourable though is it money only which commands loyalty in england would not an oath suffice sometimes the best of men are subverted by evil ones who are able to confuse them as to where their duty lies that is well said mr hervey and she laughed he liked her laugh he admired her mind and her soul but her laugh made both accessible sister do you suppose there might be anything in these documents of the slightest import to matters of state he asked reflecting the smile not especially she replied in fact not at all i should say her look turning to one of conspiracy then i believe we might permit ourselves some respite would you like to take a turn about the horse lines indeed i should she replied still smiling never perhaps had sister maria de chantonnay expected the cloisters of the convent of st mary of magdala to throng with so great a number of men let alone horses as she and hervey made their way through the lines they had to step this way and that around piles of hay and soiled straw and buckets of water for the watering call had sounded ten minutes before and the troopers were working in relays from the well in the courtyard stopping here and there when hervey thought there was some point of interest with a particular animal they were paid no more attention than if they had been at a fair c troop were evidently to furnish some escort for a dozen troopers were in the throes of saddling up under the supervision of the troop corporal this seems a most elaborate routine mr hervey said sister maria watching a trooper folding saddle blankets yes the saddles are different from any you will have seen most likely the necessity is to keep all the riders weight and that of his equipment well clear of the spine as indeed it ought to be with any saddle but we cannot afford the luxury of measuring a saddle to individual horses so each is built up to suit look he picked up a crude wooden saddleframe the saddle itself is composed simply of two arches joined by pieces of wood called sideboards this is then placed over as many blankets on the horses back as is required by its particular conformation sister maria nodded how many does this one take he asked the nearest trooper this uns broadbacked sir needs six replied the man if the saddle isnt set up right then the horse will have a sore back within the hour added hervey and that is the gravest source of our trouble that and poor feed but said sister maria looking puzzled you cannot possibly sit in such a saddle it seems so crude hervey smiled no sister a sheepskin goes over the top of it secured by a surcingle we officers have a shabracque too for reviews you will know of shabracques oh yes as had the warhorses of the knights but not very practical i should suppose no which is why we no longer take them on campaign but see also the holstered pistols have to be strapped to the front arch of the saddle along with the rolled cloak and the carbine boot strapped to the offside and the sword to the nearside it is something of an art he added so it indeed seems mr hervey she replied but tell me you have spoken before of troops and squadrons in the same breath as if they were one how is this so no they are not one sister though i understand your confusion he began a troop may number up to a hundred or so and is commanded by a captain usually there are six such troops in each regiment when there is a royal review both the colonel and the lieutenantcolonel and the major too would each take command of a squadron the squadron would comprise two troops and each squadron would carry a guidon but on campaign it is the lieutenantcolonel who commands and the senior captains each command a squadron with command of their own troop devolving impermanently to their senior lieutenant it sounds perhaps a little complicated but it works well oh evidently so she smiled as the dragoon they were watching finished saddling you fit the headharness last she added with a note of surprise because it gives time for the animal to adjust to the girth which can then be tightened before mounting the breastplate must of course be fitted at the same time as the saddle then the crupper and last the bridle this is the new pattern he said holding up a practicallooking piece of harness much better than that we had before but it can still be the devil of a job to fit in the dark especially with cold fingers this rosette here on the crossed facepieces must be set dead between the eyes and just below the bridge or the orderly corporal will round on a man once daylight reveals otherwise it is a handsome bridle mr hervey for sure but what is this chain across the top he gave a faint smile of satisfaction that is an additional device which we ourselves in the sixth i mean have made a sabrecut through the headpiece would mean the bridle falls away and the rider would lose control of his mount the chain prevents that she turned and looked at him intently and then spoke more softly than hitherto you are proud of your regiment not just of your army are you not mr hervey he seemed surprised oh yes it is everything their parting a week later was a curious affair in the days that had followed their visit to the cloister stalls hervey had looked forward to subsequent meetings with increasing anticipation the routine each day had been the same she would first dress his wound removing the sutures when the time came then followed several hours of sifting papers and then a halfhours catechism but of no great earnestness in the afternoon they would walk together further each day as his leg regained its strength so that as the time came for boulogne there had formed between them a considerable bond a respect an affection only once had he felt any desire to stay her enquiries one afternoon as they walked in the orchard she had asked him if there were anyone waiting for him at home to which he had replied that in war a soldier must have no such ties it was a conviction not unheard of in france she countered adding however that the denial of any part of gods creation was innately sinful already he had been able to tell her that he could deliver the letter to her father in person since the sixth were to march to boulogne through the vendée and her evident pleasure brought a smile to his lips so when they met on the morning that the regiment was to leave her apparent resumption of the formality of their earlier meetings surprised him and he felt awkward with what he now intended he had had one of the armourers fit a shako plate to a piece of ebony to make a paperweight its crosspattée seeming especially appropriate to remember the regiment by sister he explained uneasily as he gave it her it is the garter cross from our countrys most honoured order with the regiments numerals in the centre honi soit qui maly pense she said thoughtfully yet with a smile just so he managed to croak i was happy that we were able to read st ignatius together mr hervey she began but there was so little time to begin the discipline of his way you will not i think have time or occasion much to ponder directly on these hours but there will come a time she paused as if to assess whether or not she might complete the prophecy there is a desire in you a spiritual desire as there is in all of us and i have composed this vademecum for you she continued gently pulling from her pocket the diminutive volume it will tell you how st ignatius himself might speak to you hervey took the primer without a word and opened it sister marias handwriting a compact almost medieval script filled its pages the effort it represented apparent in an instant he did what he could to find the right words but he knew that he failed t hope we may meet again sister he added and this perhaps said what his more formal civilities failed to and i too she replied though is it not ironic that our meeting was in war and peace makes its prolongation impossible or its repeating unlikely hervey smiled awkwardly and was about to hold out his hand when on an impulse it seemed she reached into her pocket again to retrieve a gold signet ring with a blue silk handkerchief knotted to it sir i have one more kindness to beg this ring is the de chantonnay seal it has been with me for safe keeping these past five years the title papers of my fathers estates were taken by the revolutionaries and if he is to recover his inheritance he will need the seal now that the war is ended please take it to him but please on no account place it in anyones hands but his on no account better it goes back to england with you than risk its loss time was running out for their farewell the ring begged certain questions and he would have wished to address them but it was no hardship to carry a ring as well as the letter so be it sister i shall do as you bid we must hope that i find your father home he will have a long journey to wiltshire otherwise we must risk that at least she replied with an empty expression and then at last she smiled not the wide sparkling smile of their earlier hours together but warm enough he reached out his hand fully this time and she took it goodbye sister and thank you god bless you and go with you mr hervey she rose on her bare toes and kissed his cheek and please the ring you must keep it safe and give it into noones hand but my fathers chapter three the dividend of peace st georges day since the raising of the regiment on april to consolidate the triumph of the gallant and late general wolfe over the french on the heights of abraham every man of the th light dragoons had worn a red rose in his headdress on st georges day even during the worst of the recent campaigns the sixth had maintained the tradition and that morning budroses were distributed at muster as was the custom by the commanding officer but at ten oclock after watering parade the major broke with tradition and thereby instituted a new and cherished custom for as the regiment mustered one last time at the convent of st mary of magdala edmonds dismounted at the appearance of the elderly abbess and with great gallantry presented her with his rose and by the time the sixth had reached the citys north gate a remarkable number of roses had been plucked from shakos and handed to women of the town so many in fact that edmonds began to wonder in what state of discipline his regiment had truly been during its ostensible period of interior economy those several past weeks herveys rose did not remain in his shako beyond the convents courtyard for as his troop formed threes and wheeled into column he saw sister maria at an open window near the arched entrance breaking ranks and trotting over he stood at full stretch in the stirrups and presented her with the deepred bloom whose petals were no longer primly clasped and she in turn presented him with a smile equally open and a sign of benediction i cannot say that i am sorry to be leaving this place said laming as hervey rejoined his file none of this sisterhood ever looked like praying with their knees upward hervey sighed his fellow cornet held the vow of chastity in scant regard after spain lamings own rose was gone by the time their troop had left the elegant square outside the convent and in truth he had need of three more before they were clear of the city walls and as they left this place whose welcome had been as warm as it had been surprising their minds turned once more to those who were unable to join that final march the bones of dragoons and more lay in pits or whitening on bare hillsides between corunna and toulouse for it had been four years since the regiment had left southampton and of the or so who had landed in the peninsula that day in may almost half had been killed or wounded or else evacuated home sick broken men with scant likelihood of entire recovery some of these invalids might by now have acquired a skill with which a cripple could eke out a living others might have become inpensioners at one of the veterans establishments many more would be reduced to begging in the streets desperate to avoid the workhouse some would without doubt have found themselves back in the jails whence they had been all but impressed or to avoid which they had elected to enlist paying with the drum the horses had fared even worse there were scarcely four score of the original and a dozen more of these would fail to finish this march you would have thought that someone in the treasury might have been discomposed said hervey what economy is it to deny us a new saddle at forty shillings only to have us replace the wretched animal itself a month later at thirty pounds when its back is done my dear hervey you and i know that our boast as a nation of horsemasters amounts to little more than that a few studgrooms know their business laming replied taking hervey aback by the unusual candour of his opinion if it had been left to edmonds then further loss might at least have been avoided but the decision to march to the channel ports had in his view been the final testimony that noone cared in the least measure for man or beast now that bonaparte had been brought down and his anger had been profound and brooding as a consequence had it not been for barrow so rumour in the squadrons held edmonds would have knocked down the staff captain in wellingtons headquarters which he had visited in spite of heroyss advice to the contrary when that officer loftily dismissed him with the explanation that they were marching to boulogne to spare the horses the distress of the passage through the bay of biscay but why they should now be taking so indirect a route avoiding the towns and adding more than fifty leagues to the journey was wholly beyond him and not even the most languorous staff officer could advance a plausible reason the sullenness of the country people was in marked contrast to what they had become accustomed to in spain and indeed toulouse but they hardly constituted a threat rests and bivouacs and these were few enough were solitary affairs indeed only in the vendée was there any respite the wretched condition of the towns and villages in the other départements had brought the regiment hateful glowers or that at least was the interpretation placed upon them apprehensiveness might equally have been the reason for if the grande armée had so fearful a reputation for rapaciousness in its own country then why should the british be expected to be any better once or twice the sixth had the opportunity to demonstrate their good faith when outpacing the commissary waggons they had to find their own forage and in doing so astounded the corn merchants by exchanging properly receipted promissory notes rather than merely making off with the feed but as to how the population truly regarded them the sixth were at a loss the wretched condition of the people was in part the result of the royal navys complete and utter blockade of the continent but bonapartes war taxes had made greater ravages it was not the british who had ordered the levée en masse putting every man woman and child sick or healthy to warwork intermittently for the past twenty years the people might have complained about the infamous gabelle and the sundry other extortions of the ancien régime but what had revolution profited the peasantry if the evidence now were anything to judge by in the vendée at least it appeared that this was understood there things looked even more wretched at times but royalist colours flew from the public buildings and from a good many private houses and the regiment was made welcome the brigade was permitted a fourday billet and the sixth quartered themselves in the little town of clisson near nantes and in clisson they were presented with evidence for the first time that they might indeed be liberators rather than conquerors for while there was much work for the troopers and even more for the farriers the officers found the hospitality of the noblesse most generous nor was it a hospitality born of plenitude for there had been an intermittent reign of terror since the uprising the château to which the officers had been invited on the second evening had little remaining of the fine paintings and furnishings that had once filled it its master and his châtelaine the former of whose three brothers and their two sons had died by the guillotine or the firing squad during the past two decades had dug up their plate that very morning the first time it had seen daylight during that same period but the red wine of the loire valley had filled the elegant silver decanters of the unearthed service and these in turn had kept the officers glasses full throughout the night until the adjutant at edmondss bidding had called the party away to its unsteady attendance at morning stables hervey had missed this entertainment however he had ridden some thirty miles eastward to the château de chantonnay in a fruitless attempt to deliver sister marias letter and ring into her fathers hand learning as he arrived that the family had left for paris the day before he was glad at least that he would not have occasion to describe to her what he found for the house was a veritable ruin from the one man who did not run away on seeing him a crabbed old gardener from the former estate he learned that the family had been living in what had been the stables after the house had been requisitioned and turned into a buttonmaking factory sister maria de chantonnays injunction had been uncompromising however the ring was to be given to noone but her father in person so all that hervey was able to do was hand her letter to the vieillard whom he hoped was a faithful enough remnant of the household the ring would go with him to england after all that fourday billet was indeed a labour ive fair pissed me tallow dawn to dusk since we stopped ere mr ervey complained johnson on the last morning the farriers had reshod every horse and the dandy brushes had been hard at work removing the vestiges of winter coats there had been green fodder to cut there was no commissary provision on the march and saddlery and harness had been stripped down cleaned and mended but there had been opportunities too for diversion and when the regiment left on the fifth day it was amidst more emotion even than at toulouse indeed the final muster bore so little resemblance to a military parade so numerous and pressing were the onlookers with buttons rings notes and promises being tearfully exchanged that the exasperation of the adjutant and mr lincoln was plain to behold edmonds himself was so alarmed at the suspension of good order and military discipline that once under way he trotted the regiment hard for four hours on and off to put bite back into them the country through which they passed subsequently was never as pretty and in no degree as friendly as the vendée they were jeered and spat at in le mans and stones were thrown at them in rouen although the flats of a few troopers swords exacted swift retribution the flats mind for the british trooper could possess an uncommon magnanimity prussians austrians russians all seemed to perceive it their duty to avenge their national dishonour a dishonour which thereby became a personal quest for vengeance and a vengeance which might therefore be exacted indiscriminately beyond the immediate right to quench his prodigious thirst the british trooper cared not overmuch for loot unless it could buy more drink wanton destruction and rape sometimes followed from too much of it but terror and pillage were not instruments of war or conditions of service and though it was of little consolation those of the fair sex who were taken in such moments were not ravished with method the sabine way it was true enough that britain had never been invaded by bonaparte but the ranks of the sixth and the sixth were in this respect not untypical were scarcely made up of idealists they were not inspired by royalist fervour in the way that so many french were inspired by revolutionary fervour there were upright and loyal subjects of king george in the ranks there were as many probably more who were the flotsam and jetsam of the realm the sweepings of the alehouses and the streets and occasionally of the prisons but they were under authority and under that authority these men these very dregs of the country comported themselves with no little chivalry they did not habitually put to the sword prisoners of war and civilians caught in a siege and they were more likely to share a scarce canteen of water with a wounded enemy than do him further harm authority could make of them tolerably fine fellows hervey could not conceive of a life without them at boulogne the regiment had two further days rest while the commissary officers arranged their loading in three transports all merchantmen one was a particularly filthy kent coaler in which edmonds flatly refused to embark men or horses until a working party from the town gaol had scrubbed its holds damn it man he had thundered to the startled embarkation officer we had better to take us off at corunna even and the regiment had smiled they liked to hear the majors ranting occasionally it seemed to reassure them that at bottom there was nothing to worry about for if the major raved then it must be because things might be changed thereby and if things might be changed then the situation could not be so bad few would have allowed the thought that such explosions might mask edmondss growing sense of powerlessness in what he perceived to be the regiments imminent betrayal on the second morning there was no sign of rage despite his efforts at cheeriness however there was an edge to him which revealed that his better spirits were indeed an effort and everyone knew why for the news that orders for their eventual destination had arrived with the tide had spread even quicker than would orders for pay parade canterbury my boys he told the assembled regiment as breezily as he could at muster though to what purpose i am yet unaware the fourth are for the depot too and they have no inkling why either gloom then settled on the squadrons the like of which hervey had not seen since being ordered to abandon all but their sidearms before wading out to the ships in corunna bay for the depot surely could mean no other but that they were to disband forthwith fane the new brigadier visited the lines soon afterwards but he knew no more of the purpose nor could he see any more sense in what they presumed to be the purpose than anyone in the sixth i wish the marquess were here or even sir stapleton cotton he said for sure they would have been told more i think it wicked that men men with families about whom they have heard nothing in years and officers with affairs overdue for attendance should be treated in so illconsidered a fashion they were fine enough sentiments but of little help concluded the cornets at mess that evening and the gloom remained as the sixth began embarking just before noon the following day there were few in the regiment with any expertise in embarking horses only those who had been there at southampton four years earlier had even seen it done but the march to boulogne did at least have one advantage it meant that they could embark direct from the wharf rather than by lighter a perilous enough adventure at the best of times nevertheless the operation went as smoothly as edmonds could have wished the horses were first led by the collarrein saddles and bridles off to the side of the transports and here their dragoons placed a sling made of sacking around each johnson was one of the first to protest that it must end in disaster for any of the bloods but the slings were securer than they perhaps looked reaching from the withers to the flanks and with breastplate and breeching also of sacking to prevent the horse from slipping out then under the watchful eye of the quartermasters the dragoons fastened two strong pieces of wood on the top of the sling to stretch it out in the centre of which a hole had been made to put the tackle hook through at the given signal a team of convicts from the local prison hoisted the sling aloft and the horse disappeared into the ships hold embarking was laborious work by any account but it kept minds from the ill news of the morning it went on until a little before six when at last they were able to set sail on the ebb tide and whatever fate might await them in canterbury the gloom was by degrees overtaken by the growing anticipation of returning home as the three transports led by a frigate passed the harbour mole the regiments spirits lifted visibly with the fresh offshore breeze which filled out the sails and began to throw spray into the faces of those on the weather rail and they were too the first regiment to get away hervey watched the frigate take up station a quarterleague to windward her hands deftly altering sail the line of her single gundeck in the black hull a brilliant yellow band broken by the black hatches of the gunports nelsonstyle betokening a defiant confidence a frigate was a world apart she sailed independently of the line she passed both land and fleets ghostlike on secret missions a lonely but independent command which hervey reflected was exercised by men no older than him that he must lodge that six hundred pounds soon with the regimental agents before any more talk of disbandments curtailed the vacancies was never more certain in his mind and then somehow he must find two thousand pounds more for the captaincy but two thousand pounds he almost laughed out loud at the sum and in any case did he not first have to discover his fathers wishes turning towards the larboard side to see how the other transports were faring he saw edmonds standing at the rail there was a more distant look to him than hervey had yet seen and it would have been easy prudent even to let him alone but if companionship in the sixth were to mean anything then this was not the moment to let differences of rank intrude nevertheless hervey approached him cautiously good evening sir do you know i have calculated that we have marched almost three thousand leagues since landing in portugal edmonds at first made no reply save for several slow nods of the head when at length he did speak the reply took him aback matthew those three thousand leagues have been added to your life they have been taken away from mine it was a reply so far removed from his image of edmonds an image shared in large measure by the whole regiment that he could scarcely begin to conceive of its cause illtempered and violently suspicious of authority though edmonds might be he was first foremost and for ever a soldier in their six years of campaigning in the peninsula before and after corunna no matter how appalling the conditions or how desperate the situation edmonds had shown no emotion beyond explosive but shortlived anger or indeed simple kindness did he now really abhor those years what will you do when we reach england sir hervey asked searching for a different tack on which he might lift the majors spirits though he could hardly have chosen a worse one once i have settled the regiment in canterbury and discovered what in gods name those lickspittles in the horse guards are intending and i have no doubt that a grateful parliament are at this very moment exacting their dividend from the peace which so many good men have bought with their lives well once i know what our great nation plans for us i shall write a dispatch for the colonel and lord george hand over to captain lankester as fast as i decently can and go and see margaret and my girls he replied his tone increasingly defiant and then turning and walking towards his deck cabin he added if theyre still alive hervey might at that moment have begun a long but utterly futile brooding on this unaccountable change in edmondss humour had it not been for the appearance of serjeant strange on deck the admirable strange ever formal and correct was still as much an enigma to hervey as the day they met when the regiment sailed for portugal on the first campaign strange had left southwold and its fishing fleet the year after the guillotine had been set up in paris to enlist in the sixth who were encamped nearby at ipswich he was the best swordsman and shot in the regiment even better than rsm lincoln and he had passed out of the riding school quicker than anyone in the ridingmasters memory until herveys own skill had both impressed and dismayed the rm in equal measure these accomplishments would in themselves have been sufficient to hold in awe both officers and other ranks but in addition strange held a curious authority because noone but noone had ever heard him swear not an obscenity nor even a faintly indecent remark not an oath nor the mildest profanity even he was a temperance methodist though he would preach at noone he kept his own company and permitted noone to become close noone that is but serjeant armstrong armstrong the harddrinking frequently foulmouthed exminer armstrong was no methodist he was not even baptized what they saw in each other had long been a matter for speculation in the officers mess the simple attraction of opposite natures seemed an inadequate explanation there were some who said that the reason for their enlistment might reveal a cause but neither man seemed the sort to be afraid of the deep mine or the deep sea nor the sort to run from some domestic sorrow besides strange was married was he not hervey thought meanly of himself for not knowing more about both of them though strange would not have volunteered the smallest piece of intelligence he felt sure in any case hervey would always recall his first troopleaders advice do not get too close sending them to their deaths will be all the harder a humane if cynical doctrine it had been sound enough counsel for a young cornet in his greenness perhaps that advice was as good now as it had been but hervey could no longer bring himself to believe so good evening mr hervey sir strange said quietly and with a relaxed salute the major looked thoughtful yes he was thinking of home major edmonds was my lieutenant when i joined sir he and his lady taught me to write this was possibly the first time that hervey had exchanged any talk with strange that was not strictly related to duty certainly the first time he could recall and even after six years campaigning he did not feel at his ease doing so while many a dragoon liked the attention of the officers strange seemed to have no need of their company or that is as little need of theirs as any others and soon despite his initial discomfort hervey could not but feel a warm glow at this initiation of intimacy what will you do when we get to canterbury serjeant strange i have not seen my wife for nigh on six years either he answered without a trace of emotion nor my father or mother it was the same mellow suffolk again curiously soothing reassuring hervey probed gently what will you do if the regiment disbands i have two years to a pension he replied resolutely i reckon they would pay me off fairly but i would have liked my own troop and then to be a quartermaster if colonel irvine wanted me hervey would ordinarily have shared stranges trust that parliament would treat fairly with them but edmondss cynicism these past weeks had begun to erode that confidence he wondered how many other good men would be lost to the kings service in this way indeed whether he himself would be placed on halfpay and he shuddered at the thought in the cool evening breeze the intimacy was fleeting however for serjeant strange suddenly stepped back as if the act of so doing were necessary to break that intimacy and took his leave formally saying he had to be about his duty below hervey thought of staying on deck awhile but instead he too went below to the cabin he was to share with three other cornets there was a halfhearted attempt to carouse with wine they had brought aboard but they were all more tired than they had cared to admit in less than an hour they were happy to turn in and hervey slept tolerably well as the ship gently pitched and rolled in the channels swell he was awakened at dawn by cheering from the upper deck and straight away went up to see the cause the bows and forerails were packed with troopers peering towards the land three miles distant the chalkwhite cliffs reflecting the first streaks of daylight though few of these men if any had ever seen those cliffs before they were an image of england as powerful as the standard of st george itself within the hour the transports were reefing sail in dovers outer harbour and the towingboats were approaching to take them in to berth on the morning tide the frigate had left them moments before firing one of its eighteenpounders in farewell and breaking out what seemed like every yard of remaining sail so as to take her in a fast turn back towards france so fast that she heeled over at a breathtaking angle with the wind exaggerating her speed still further who is she hervey asked one of the transports crew nisus mister replied the hand with evident respect for the name nisus was she not the frigate that ay said the man before he could finish it was er an euryalus that shadowed them french durin the night before trafalgar and signalled the rest of the fleet to follow blue light evry hour if standing to the southward or the straits three quick guns evry hour if headin westward you sound as though you might have been there was i sir he replied with passion and with the same vowels as armstrong t watched them lights all night from the nest o royal sovereign one of admiral collingwoods tars of the tyne i were if capn blackwoods an yon frigate ad lost them french it wouldve been different next day and then he chuckled and held up the stump of his right arm this wouldve been a mite longer for a start how bonaparte had thought he might defeat a navy with men like this or an army of men like those now crowding the forerail hervey could only marvel the corsican had it seemed to him failed to heed his own dictum that the fighting spirit of a man was worth three times the weapons he bore and bonaparte had paid the price for underestimating that spirit in these men for sure chapter four the commanderinchief directs dover sunday june before the transports were berthed a torrential downpour had begun making disembarkation of both horses and men more than usually hazardous and in the middle of this operation edmonds found himself confronted by an envoy from the institution he reviled only fractionally less than parliament even above the noise of the rain and the occasional peal of thunder his voice could be heard haranguing the unfortunate messenger from the horse guards cork immediately what in gods name and then another peal of thunder deafening this time making it impossible for the onlookers to catch the precise terms in which edmonds was expressing his opinion of the horse guards administration the messenger a young coldstream ensign stood rigid in blank astonishment joseph edmondss inclinations mattered not the slightest however the orders were explicit the commanderinchief directs that a regiment of light dragoons be dispatched with all urgency so the first to land were to be reembarked as soon as was expedient and were to sail for cork tomorrow possibly or the day after just as soon as transports could be found why cork he asked was there yet more trouble there to which the ensign replied that from what he read in the times and the daily courant there was trouble periodically everywhere by prodigious efforts and not a little cursing of innkeepers and proprietors of livery stables for even in this busiest of ports the sabbath seemed to be kept with remarkable fastidiousness edmonds and the quartermasters managed to get covered standing and on straw for all the horses and billets for the dragoons hervey found himself on picket once more and it was well past midnight by the time he finished his rounds so scattered about the town was the regiment the officers lodgings were in a decent enough hotel and there a little before one oclock he found edmonds sitting at a writingtable in the drawing room quite alone hervey come over here he said without looking up take some of this madeira and sit down i have an assignment for you though he was happy to be sharing edmondss company again and by this time the major seemed truly to have regained his usual robust spirits hervey would in truth have preferred his bed for there were only three hours to his next rounds these dispatches enumerate our losses and the action required for amendment to our current parlous condition as well as sundry recommendations in respect of those officers who remain you are to convey them to lord george irvine and to the colonel to their london houses that is i cannot vouch that they will be there but the dispatches can best be forwarded thence without delay i want you then to take the leave that is owing to you and deal with that outstanding family business i want no second thoughts in the future about taking the lieutenancy the comfortable chair the warm fire the madeira and edmondss confidential manner hervey might have nodded but the mention of home was too much and thoughts of family rushed in on him as water through a sluicegate matthew do you hear said edmonds when at length he saw that he did not have his attention hervey blinked and looked surprised sir i for heavens sake man try and keep with me he drawled and then with a smile you might have missed the most felicitous part i want you to wait at home for the colonel to be in touch in respect of the matters i have laid before him it might be a month or so but that is no matter im sure wiltshire must have some charms to amuse you though i cannot think of any myself and we will see you in ireland perhaps before autumn is out hervey detected no more in edmondss perhaps than a passing reference to the delay he might expect in the colonels expediting or otherwise the majors recommendations he acknowledged the instructions with a simple bow of the head and a smile oh and while you are about things in london you may go and lodge the purchase money with the regimental agents added edmonds in a tone which indicated that he wanted no reply only compliance the inrush of home thoughts would have made sleep impossible besides edmonds seemed in no haste to dismiss him and now that the majors spirits were truly restored it became once more a pleasure to tarry in his soldierly company and it emerged that the restoration of those spirits was the result of two separate items of intelligence the first though hervey would have made no wager that edmonds would have given it that priority was that all his family were well a remount corporal from the canterbury depot had arrived earlier that evening with several letters from margaret edmonds written over a period of six months marked to await return with a prescience as to the course of the campaign which many in the horse guards might have envied she had concluded that once the army had entered the pyrenees the mails would be erratic better therefore to consign them to the one establishment that years of following the drum told her she could rely on the regiments own depot edmonds admired her logic yet despaired of her want of perceptivity however for surely the most favourable course would have been to send him the letters direct and insure against her concerns by sending duplicates to canterbury in any case it mattered not now she was in good health as were his daughters who must surely during his absence have passed from childhood and charmingly he trusted the second piece of intelligence surprised him but bore him equal relief there would be no immediate disbandments in the cavalry i had forgotten about the damned irish god bless em he laughed pouring hervey and himself yet another glass of madeira and the magistrates here too are terrified of rickburners and machinebreakers there are it seems formed bands intent on disturbing the peace god bless em too parliament seems to have come to its senses though when theyll ever see real sense and establish a proper constabulary i could not begin to suppose so the returning heroes will have to keep order which means we shall not be heroes for long still its an ill wind an ill wind indeed thought hervey for he had no love for the idea of being a mounted constable even in ireland he no longer if he had truly ever expected to be treated as a hero but here was surely the quickest way to universal opprobrium yet there were felicities at that moment which displaced such concerns home thoughts again ran freely for he had not seen the parsonage in horningsham these past four years and his last visit in the wake of the evacuation from corunna had been fleeting at first the thoughts were as a swirling flood but then they began to order themselves and soon with perfect clarity he perceived in what fashion this return must be to his father he must give account of his means and intentions and hope that these might be congruent with what the changed circumstances demanded to his mother he must needs be all that a mother expects and be wholly tolerant of her incomprehension and his sister he longed simply that he and she might be what they once were to each other johnson was the first to feel the effects of herveys wakefulness when at fourthirty he received a shake from the picket and an order to report to the marine hotel here there followed a halfhour of instructions and a good deal of what might have passed for discourse before hervey felt confident he could leave his horses for the first time in his grooms care barrow would for sure have counted johnsons part in that dialogue as verging on the mutinous but then barrow would not have apprehended the reason for the grooms disquiet and nor did hervey look johnson i grant you that there is every right to be discouraged that you too are not to go home but how can i trust jessye to anyone else after all this time johnson looked bemused mr ervey theres nowt for me in sheffield tha knows ave no famly johnson always bore his workhouse origins with a perverse pride then why are you so vexed with the notion of going to cork asked hervey with a look of equal astonishment because without thee there ill get the poke an be back in tranks quick as lightning hervey assured him that this need not be the case that he would speak with the adjutant but you might try to help yourself by being less less obstinate obstinate me began his groom but hervey rapidly deflected the challenge you will at least be glad that we are not to disband bloody ell ay sir itd be tpit or tfoundries fer me otherwise and the coalpits or the steelworks hervey knew full well would mean in all probability an earlier grave than would service with the sixth now you might have found employment as a footman he tried lightheartedly there are some fine houses thereabouts are there not johnson looked genuinely affronted ill be thy doggy but ill be damned if ill be a bloody fartcatcher the angel inn where cornet hervey hoped to find a seat on a londonbound coach was crowded and noisy and he had to endure it for two days since every seat was reserved by government messengers and officials many inbound from the continent those that were not were taken by men of commerce already returning from hurried transactions in france for europe had been closed to trade for over ten years by the royal navys blockade and the merchants and financiers of the city of london were anxious to stake early claims to the dividends of this sudden peace cornet hervey did not take to these officials and commercial people who bustled about the angel he neither expected nor wanted attention as an officer returning from the war but the insouciance which many of the travellers displayed not to say the insolence with which they treated the angels servants landlord and potboys alike angered him forgotn already the likes o you made their trade possble sir said the landlord after one particularly selfsatisfied consoldealer had outbid hervey for a seat in a flycoach he could not but agree but then he told himself perhaps he had forgotten too that it was englands commerce that had financed her war and her allies too and that he could not sniff at it too much now nevertheless it was not until the third morning that he managed to get a seat inside on the dolphin stage whence he was glad to see the back of these men of affairs the dolphin was a big and painfully slow coach its team comprised four strong suffolks and their short legs with so low a point of draught gave immense pulling power but the big chestnuts were illmatched for trotting so much of the journey was at a walking pace it meant however that the gentle green countryside of kent could soon begin to ease the frustration with which he had set out indeed the country seemed to him prettier even than in his recollections and full of labouring men and women who showed no sign of the starvation or terror which blighted those of spain and france it was not long before he was minded of the equal perhaps even greater tranquillity of wiltshire and of his corner of the great plain of salisbury there he had known nothing but peace and happiness and his thoughts now meandered like the gentle chalk stream in which he had cast many a boyhood line from one pleasurable recollection to another his first pony his rides on the plain with daniel coates his sisters nimble fingers at the keyboard his mothers fussing as they made ready for shrewsbury each term his fathers long yet absorbing sermons his brothers the sudden recollection was disturbing painful even for hervey knew he would never again not in this world at least feel the strength that came of johns peace of mind and then as it were the streams sudden turbulence ended and he saw a girl of about twelve the same as he in fine silks with ribbons in her hair she teased him and teased him until he put his pony at an elm that lay uprooted in front of a large house clearing it just but losing his hat which the girl then ran with into the great house beyond his reach he was jolted out of his reveries by a particularly large pothole into which both nearside wheels fell in succession he looked about him but none of his fellow passengers stirred so he resumed his study of the tranquillity beyond the window here and there however even englands garden bore the signs of the violence of which edmonds had spoken there were the charred remains of a barn which had fallen to the torches of the rickburners at a crossroads there was a lonely gallows with the stiffened corpse of a footpad hanging from its hoist though here at least the body was without the marks of torture at one halt near faversham an inn surrounded by hop fields hervey heard how a steam engine he knew of steam engines but had never seen one had recently been installed at the manor farm to drive the new threshing machines from norfolk and how less than a month later a band swearing allegiance to general ludd had destroyed both engine and machinery the maidstone yeomanry had been called out but arrived long after the wreckers had gone it was too frequently the case said a fellow passenger a lancashire cotton man who feared for his own looms declaring it quite beyond him why the magistrates were not able to keep order with so many yeomanry militia and fencibles embodied or at call hervey had never held high in his estimation either yeomanry or magistrates it seemed to him that their interests were too often more than decently entangled and brutality too often a substitute for foresight and efficiency but he had been away for some time he reminded himself and he did not wish to provoke this choleric weaver with views that would no doubt be taken as at best feckless the dolphin stopped overnight in both canterbury and chatham and arrived at eleven on the third morning at the swan tavern in southwark the swan which was the dolphins terminus was no different from the halfdozen other inns by which they had staged from dover set as it was in the leafy kentish environs of the thames but a keen eye could detect in the quickened pace of its servants and that of the people of the street proximity to a great city and for the first time hervey was to see a great city for in his reckoning lisbon could not answer to that description he could scarcely bear the wait while his lodgings were arranged and a chaise summoned to take him across the river he had not imagined how the greatness would be manifest however he caught his breath at the sight of the thames at blackfriars its wide sweeping curve more majestic than anything he had seen in the peninsula or in france and he gazed in awe at the noble dome of st pauls as they trotted up ludgate hill but it was in the streets that his senses were all but overwhelmed for the press of people and carriages especially in the strand was immense and above the hubbub and noise of hoofs and wheels vendors cried their wares assisted by trumpet or bell in a continual cacophony buy my floun ders sixpence a pound fair cher ries crab crab any crab buy a dish of great ee ls hot baked war dens his progress was slow and twice he had his driver stop to buy cold ginger beer and once to buy a muffin so that it was almost four oclock before he reached the premises of mr gieve in piccadilly the tailor who kept the sealed patterns for the uniforms of the th light dragoons but he needed less than an hour there for his letter had arrived ten days before and his new regimentals were ready for fitting he was pleased at having been able to steal a march on the legions of officers whose own uniforms too had been worn to rags and who would doubtless soon be descending on their tailors to amend their pulleddown appearance as well as the many officers who had received brevets and field promotions who would be wanting to make the appropriate embellishments they look very fine sir said the little round cutter who attended him adjusting his equally round spectacles as he made deft marks with a chalk on tunic and overalls we will only require a day or so to adjust them sir may we now fit the levee dress hervey noted with satisfaction how the pelisse hung from the left shoulder examining its fall with particular attention between two standing lookingglasses yes they are fine let us to the levee dress then the sixths levee dress consisted of a tunic of the same pattern as the other regimentals but of finer cloth a dark blue coatee with gold epaulettes a high collar and bibfront in buff the regiments facing colour with it were worn white cotton breeches rather than the heavier buckskin for review order and tasselled patentleather knee or hessian boots you may of course wear court shoes instead of the boots sir when not a strictly military occasion prompted the genial cutter hervey added a pair to his order but made the economy of specifying pinchbeck for the buckles rather than anything grander he had gold enough from the peninsula but he did not care to see it on his feet finally sir we must fit your court overalls hervey was generous in his praise of the stitching of the gold lace on these upon my word the stripes are most beautifully executed and the court hat the cocked hat with its white ostrich feathers worn perfectly foreandaft in the sixth was to his mind an unnecessary extravagance since he could not conceive of any occasion for its use unlike the overalls which were also worn as undress in the evening nevertheless the hat was tried and it too was a sound fit you did not specify a pelisse coat in your instructions sir may i enquire if that is still your intention hervey swallowed awkwardly his pelisse coat had been lost at corunna and the compensation paid for the loss of private property not been sufficient to replace everything he had chosen to forgo a coat extravagantly frogged and braided hoping that one might be acquired on campaign at a reduced price but there had been no such opportunity the pelisse coat was an indulgence a conceit for nothing in regulations prescribed it however now that they would be returning to the ways of peace he knew that without one he would be bound to take endless ribbending from the dandies besides it was a very handsome conceit how much would a coat be twelve guineas sir and a coat was added to the order to where do you wish these severally to be consigned sir hervey had not considered this and after a moment or two reviewing the options he decided on horningsham very good sir and may i on behalf of mr gieve be so bold as to say how gratified we are to see the first of our officers home and safely very prettily put thought hervey and genuine enough he reckoned i am very much obliged to you mr rippingale and i hope to have occasion to visit you oftener in future his next appointment was with the regimental agents messrs greenwood cox hammersly of craigs court here his reception was courteous enough but stiff without any of the warmth of his tailors and he soon formed the impression that to them he was no more than an inventory item and a not especially valued one at that for although he would have as a lieutenant a bookvalue of twelve hundred pounds lieutenants even of light cavalry would soon be the proverbial tenapenny and the extra profits from officers paying over price would all but disappear he was dealt with throughout by a clerk and not overcivilly none of the partners emerging to take notice though at least one he was sure had walked through the chambers every man thinks meanly of himself for never having been to sea nor having been a soldier i beg your pardon sir said the clerk in some confusion nothing it is nothing replied hervey sighing to himself how optimistic had been dr johnsons view first the officials and bonddealers at dover and now a clerk in an army agents was england tiring already of her soldiers damned quilldrivers he muttered as he left the earl of sussex was not at home when hervey called the following morning in june he habitually left the albany for his seat in oxfordshire the earl had been colonel of the sixth since before bonaparte had crowned himself emperor and had always exercised a distant but proprietorial interest in his regiment unusually hervey had never been presented for his gazetting to the regiment had been on the recommendation of the marquess of bath which the earl could not but have found acceptable enough his absence meant that hervey would remain ignorant of the contents of edmondss dispatch he had hoped to discover something at least of the nature of the instructions which he was to await in wiltshire he now hoped therefore that lord george irvine might be able to throw some light on matters instead however lord george was not at home either his butler announcing with great solemnity that his master was convalescing at brighton the dispatches would have both gratified and appalled him had he but known their contents edmonds had been especially pleased to compose them he had been able to report the momentous end of the war and the honourable part the sixth had played in the final battle he had written of the continuing difficulties with slade he had been able to commend many of the officers for their distinguished service he had in particular made one quite explicit recommendation that cornet soon to be lieutenant matthew hervey be appointed to the staff at the horse guards in order to prepare him for the high rank for which he was sure he was fitted and two sides of manuscript urged the earl to use all his influence with the duke of york to arrange it the third call that morning was more successful in a large firstfloor apartment in queen annes gate overlooking st jamess park he found lieutenant darcey jessope in the brilliant scarlet of the nd foot guards jessope was ready for his caller indeed he had been awaiting him keenly since the arrival of his note the evening before two servants in startling canary livery brought in coffee tea and chocolate together with sundry sweet delicacies which jessope recommended effusively i know the most exquisite neapolitan confectioner whom the late sir william hamilton brought home after his consulship there he is an excellent fellow a veritable genius with sugar and spices hervey smiled as he took in addition to his coffee the glass of madeira proffered by a third footman it was all so typical a foot guards display he knew but a generous one none the less my dear dear friend tell me how you are began jessope as the footmen left the room i have so much to thank you for i could not begin to honour you properly there is not the slightest need replied hervey a little bemused and i am very well what is more the point jessope how are you i am capitally well and especially so for seeing you i was becoming affeard that i never would i swore that i would visit the moment i could said hervey now distinctly puzzled i meant that i was not certain that i would see you again in this life why jessope the worst of your injuries were over when i left you in spain has there been some complication no he said with a look of dismay i meant that i was fearful for you you seemed to have such utter disregard for the french that i felt sure it would end in disaster on the contrary i assure you replied hervey i had very careful regard of the french no the worst that happened to me was a spontoon thrust into my leg at toulouse though i confess it bled and hurt like the very devil so you are now recovered and it seems by your appearance returned to the active list yes indeed recovered and at duty jessope replied emphatically and of course i owe that to you i do wish you would desist from that line we shook hands in the field hospital at salamanca and that should be that you must not keep making that i did anything exceptional of course not jessope smiled anyone would have fought his way into that throng of frog cutthroats to rescue a man hed never met to what duty have you returned asked hervey ignoring jessopes persistence i am aidedecamp to the adjutantgeneral at the horse guards hervey nodded and this brings promotion yes said jessope i am lieutenant and captain as of april hervey smiled again the guards and their system of double rank and you know hervey i have not been idle he continued i have arranged for you to exchange into the second guards here hervey laughed a goodhumoured laugh rus in urbe he mused my dear jessope i thank you for your kindness but i have not the slightest intention of leaving the sixth not for promotion or position and on this to both jessopes surprise and very great disappointment hervey proved unshakeable all the way through the park as they walked to whites club in st jamess lieutenant and captain darcey jessope extolled the virtues of service with the guards but hervey was entirely unmoved only on the very steps of whites did jessope give up whereupon he applied himself instead to the pleasure of luncheon with his saviourfriend a celebration at which the winecoolers were employed to capacity in chilling champagne for the dozen or so habitués keen to make the acquaintance of the adcs gallant companion hervey stayed three days at queen annes gate it had not been his original intention to remain in london so long but it did at least allow him a final fitting for his new regimentals and to see something of the society which so enthralled jessope and his fellow officers he enjoyed it more than he expected jessopes circle was gay frivolous but wholly restorative of the spirits the two of them dined together at whites on the evening before hervey left for wiltshire and with the port jessope produced a velvetcovered case which he passed across the table to him inside was a gold westerman hunter with an inscription on the cover mh from daj salamanca i wanted it to say so much more but i could not find the words my dear jessope it says everything replied hervey chapter five old soldiers the city june the saracens head in skinner street snow hill incorporated the office of the universal coach and wagon company and at three oclock each morning the inn was all scurry and noise as mailbags and passengers arrived for their early departures to the west country and with them a cloud of hawkers with provisions for the journey here and there preferring the shadows to the light of the oil lamps lurked a shifty character on the lookout for pickings honest or otherwise and a doxy or two on the catch for one last customer before tripping home to sleep and into this bustle came hervey and jessope who after whites and drury lane had suppered with two italian actresses whose acquaintance jessope had evidently made some time before the balloon coach for salisbury was due to leave on the halfhour and would wait for noone however the universal licensed to carry mail prided itself on punctuality and speed and at miles per hour its coaches were some of the fastest in england if not yet quite up to the speed of the bristol mails the last of the bags brought by gig from the general letter office in st martinslegrand were thrown into the boot by the postboys at twentyeight minutes past three urged on by the driver with watch in hand for he would have to answer with his pay for any delay and hervey bidding jessope a final farewell took the remaining place inside as the carillon of st pauls struck the halfhour the swiftsure pulled out of the inn yard and up the sleeping street towards the great cathedral by four the team was trotting over southwark bridge and hervey was beginning to doze he had paid two and a half guineas for an inside seat and the carriage of two chests and he was now counting it worth while for he did not expect to be able to get a coach on to warminster until the following morning at a quarter past eight they halted at the talbot inn in ripley where bowls of hot water towels and then a breakfast of kidneys and steak rashers and poached eggs buttered toast and muffins coffee tea and small beer revived the swiftsures passengers hervey kept his own company at table awhile before leaving the fug of the talbots low dark wainscoted room to watch the team being changed old and new were quality horses which looked as though they would serve equally well under the saddle able to trot with rare velocity on the newly macadamized turnpike horses to admire ill warrant ye didnt see their like in spain often sir said the guard hervey looked up quizzically and the big openfaced man smiled from his seat next to the drivers no indeed replied hervey and i am to presume therefore that you have knowledge of that country the second guards yard of tin emitted a shrill recall to the other passengers drowning the first guards reply and hervey would have asked him to repeat it had he not observed that one of the outside fares was an elderly woman a farmers wife perhaps for she had the stamp of the country with difficulty at first she thought he wished for some payment he gave up his seat inside to her and climbed to the coach roof a gentleman indeed sir said the guard offering his flask i thank you said hervey taking a full draw on it this is uncommon smooth brandy i fear i did not catch your last against the long horn though i said sir that a part of me remained yet in spain it holds that sway with many i believe agreed hervey bless you sir smiled the guard for it is my sally only and he tapped his left shin with the butt of his fowling piece wood on wood hervey did not return the smile wide though it was then i am sorry for you was this the frenchs work ay sir albura a musket ball pointblank the guard replied still smiling then the muskets aim was most curious if you were anywhere but astride a horse that is right sagacious sir i were astride one of the third dgs indeed and with three stripes up well serjeant i am glad at least to see you in employ thank you sir and yourself you are an admirer of horseflesh a professional eye one of general cottons too perhaps and captain i would suppose cornet replied hervey as cheerily as he could thats an arsenal worthy of a heavy he added quickly nodding to the collection of firearms about the guard the fowling piece and pistols are right enough for the close country but when we get on the heath a longrange shot or two from a carbine will see off a pad he explained and the sword queried hervey he smiled ive ad it since i joined the third and that curious item by your feet it has the look of the paget and yet it is that sir havent you seen one with a folding butt before replied the guard passing it to him the sixteenth had all theirs so in america they were handier for foot work and theyre better balanced on the pouchbelt swivel cant think why the rest of the cavalry never adopted it like as not because it bore general tarletons stamp i shouldnt wonder suggested hervey that is what daniel coates would have thought with the fall of the general had gone many of the innovations of that illfated campaign you know i should very much like to own one of these an officer cannot carry a carbine in a saddle bucket it would not do but i reckon i could stow this in something little bigger than a pistol holster over the saddle arch thats easy enough sir for three pounds you may have a foldingbutt paget within the week for as well as guard on this here coach i am serjeantarmourer with the wiltshire yeomanry and carbines are simply enough purchased the butt i shall adapt myself very well then serjeant smeaton sir william smeaton very well serjeant smeaton it is agreed shall you have it sent to me in horningsham it is near warminster no sir i shall bring it myself for i have dealings with the warminster troop this very week and then business concluded hervey was content to listen to serjeant smeatons recollections of the war to his commentary on the sights greater and lesser along the road and to his general observations on the state of the country as would a returning regular find it when they set down that evening at the red lion in salisbury in the shadow of the great cathedral armourerserjeant william smeaton shook his hand as an old friend that warminster troop mind he warned scratching his head and smiling still more theyre not as you and me as reglars would know things not as things would be in the third or the sixth hervey caught his meaning well enough im obliged armourerserjeant and he smiled too no stage ran through the night to warminster and the hire of a coach of any sort would rob him so he reckoned of a preposterous sum instead he took the early post the next morning to the old wool town thirty miles along the bath road warminsters rooftops looked comfortingly familiar when first he saw them as the post crested the final rise and ran along the turnpike under the southwestern scarp of the great plain its ancient hillforts standing silent picket and the press of people at the sheep fair filling the high street was as he had always remembered it or perhaps not quite as he remembered it for the driver of the gig which then took him on to horningsham said that the fairs were double the size and twice as frequent as before the war everywhere indeed there was the look of prosperity his letter had preceded him by two days although at what time he would arrive or even which day it had not been possible to say so when the gig pulled up to the vicarage his reception was as clamorous as if he had been wholly unexpected the family all but tumbling from the door his fathers only reserve though little enough was occasioned by advancing years his mother showed none whatever and his sister was almost as unrestrained he had thought so long of this moment that in the event he found himself unaccountably composed and made apology for being so it was of no moment his father insisted it was but the manner of the soldier his mother ascribed it to the long journey but elizabeth thought otherwise fearful that she had to all intents lost a second brother though she had forborne to say so in the weeks before his keenly anticipated homecoming but elizabeth seized her brothers arm resolutely none the less come matthew there are others who wish to see you and she took him inside to the servants hall francis their ancient footman now bore a pronounced stoop but cook was as large and merry as ever he remembered master matthew do they not feed you in the army any more ive seen more meat on a tuppenny cony she exclaimed hugging and pinching him mrs pomeroy a week of your puddings will right all have no fear a kitchen maid giggled in the corner not to be so silly hannah said mrs pomeroy with some primness this is hannah master matthew abel towles youngn abel towle gardenercumgroom who could not speak one full sentence without cursing albeit of the mildest sort within the familys hearing bade his welcome when hervey and his sister went to the stable towle and ruth his elder daughter completed the vicarages modest establishment next they took a turn about the garden elizabeth pointing out keenly the additions since his last brief visit home all of five years before they embraced from time to time but it was too soon for them to speak of anything of consequence hervey stopped by some of the new cold frames and looked at her sheepishly you will think me strange elizabeth but is there still the big leaden tub i have never looked forward to a soak in it as these past weeks indeed there is the leaden bath and ruth and hannah shall fill it at once and while they do so you must go to the orchard and see the old chestnut tree of which you were so fond you will still see longleat from its branches ill warrant so long was he in his bath that a giggling hannah was sent to discover if he were awake in truth the anticipation of soaking in that big leaden tub had sustained him throughout the march north from toulouse and the happy memories were now too vivid to dismiss willingly for he knew that once downstairs he must confront the grief for his brother that was being so bravely and privately borne by his family at length he went down to his fathers study and there for the first time they met as men of equal consequence the accident of his brothers death having removed so to speak the enfolding wall which his father and mother had long ago built they talked of the pain the waste the memory and after tears some smiles and even a little laughter the vicar of horningsham poured his son a large glass of sherry and fixed him with the same piercing gaze he had known as a child matthew he said firmly johns death must be of no moment to you beyond that which is one brother to another the obligations that are placed upon you are no greater than were his and john was making his own way in the world it is perhaps too early for me truly to know my feelings father replied hervey with an appreciative smile but i should not want to leave my profession if there were no necessity i am glad of it and glad too that you speak of the army in such terms i think it indeed an honourable profession at least that is a profession in which honourable men may serve just so father but it is difficult not to feel the shadow of johns worthier calling and in that you reveal still your simplesse said the vicar of horningsham shaking his head johns was not a higher calling but a different one there was a knock at the door and herveys mother entered with elizabeth and there followed a conversation of the utmost warmth and intimacy concerning johns virtues as a son brother and human being of his qualities as a priest said his father at length they knew a little but more would be forthcoming that evening when they would receive a visitor who had known john in that calling dinner was late past two and the fast before the next days patronal feast of st john the baptist was prematurely but formally abandoned at the grace hereafter began herveys own inquisition campaigning was what his mother expected to hear of and she would allow no other conversation but his was necessarily an incomplete account and perhaps a somewhat sentimental one thereby for without the carnage and bestiality it could only be thus and any essay by him into those horrors would have been repugnant in that company it was however pleasing to a mother swelled with pride and a father wishing some consolation for another sons death but the reverend thomas herveys spirit was stronger than the flesh he stayed with the account until salamanca and then succumbed to the comfortable feeling induced by the safe return of his remaining son and the celebratory claret an hautbrion of prewar vintage the blockades having prevented in any case newer being obtained elizabeth stayed longer with the account but absented herself regretfully as dover was reached in order to be about her weekly business in warminsters workhouse hervey walked with her to the stables where towle had the ageing barouche ready matthew i have seen enough of distress these past five years in the town to know well perhaps to have a presentiment at least of the miseries of war you were all consideration itself at dinner but you must remain patient with us she said and especially so this evening with mr keble who was a dear friend of johns at oxford mr keble himself is a dear man and by all accounts an exceptional one john was always speaking of him he was a scholar at only fifteen and a fellow of johns college before he was twenty he has fine degrees in divinity and mathematics and has won prizes for poetry he is to be made deacon next year and was to have joined johns parish as second curate father already thinks of him as if he were our john so like him is he and i confess also do i hervey smiled at once i am delighted to hear it he replied and with such emphatic stress on the participle that elizabeth looked at him askance there was no time however and it was perhaps as well for her to enquire why his delight should be so pronounced and she left him instead to his fancy that one day she and edward lankester would meet and that she might thereby become wife to that noblest of soldiers no man could hope more for his sister and elizabeth he felt sure would in the event share that opinion what of religious observance in the army mr hervey john keble asked as they began supper that evening a collation which included the vicar of horningshams favourite neats tongue in aspic and mrs pomeroys revered frigize of chicken and rabbit well began hervey startled somewhat he would rather even have faced questions about the commissary system for bad as that was he considered the commissaries marginally more effective than the chaplains it is better than when i first joined he suggested hoping that this might be enough it was a vain hope indeed how is it now then keble continued in truth mr keble it is not at all good it varies greatly from regiment to regiment depending on the colonel but also on the chaplain we now have one to each brigade this is the marquess or the duke rather as he has been elevated since bonapartes defeat this is the duke of wellingtons doing prior to this campaign we had no chaplains well very few they are not on the whole of the quality you will see at oxford though and it will be no housling ministry i warrant do they celebrate the holy communion with any regularity and frequency elizabeth looked anxiously at her brother who understood her meaning at once as a rule no he replied patiently though he might easily have omitted the qualification and simply answered with the negative john keble shook his head they do preach and pray with the wounded he added in a halfhearted plea in mitigation and methodists keble continued i have heard that they make converts herveys father huffed loudly mr keble to my shame we have here in horningsham the oldest dissenting chapel in england it is nonsense to speak so father smiled elizabeth you and the minister get on like houses on fire indeed we do replied the old man chuckling though only when we avoid any mention of religion on the whole it is better that way with men of god but i would sooner spend an evening in the company of the old jesuit from wardour he does not quote scripture at me the while and we may have gentlemanly conversation about such matters of doctrine that are unknowable and which therefore we may discourse upon without acrimony and with good claret chuckled mrs hervey this latter is very sage sir john keble acknowledged and then with a smile so full that his face was wholly transformed added as is yours maam they are not my words however mr keble sighed the reverend thomas hervey but dear archbishop lauds god rest his soul said keble before turning back to hervey to press his point but as to these methodists i would think that the meeting of soldiers in their cantonments to sing psalms or to hear a sermon read by one of their comrades is in the abstract perfectly innocent indeed it is laudable but i think it might become otherwise and i think that is precisely what the duke believes too agreed hervey surprised by kebles evident grasp of the requirements of good order and military discipline but i wonder why the established church makes no greater impression keble was quick to answer though with more sadness in his tone than enthusiasm the church has i believe in many quarters turned its back on its true origins the best men do their duty faithfully but without fervour the worst well let us say they are free from the tumults of conscience but what of the claphamites mr keble elizabeth interjected they do their duty with fervour and confront their consciences squarely do they not and see what good deeds they do oh a worthy movement miss hervey but fired by protestant fervour and is that to be denounced then she challenged with some perturbation by no means miss hervey he replied seemingly stung by her rebuke but the church of england was not conceived in protestantism it is catholic and reformed is that not what we affirm in the creed elizabeth looked to the head of the table father what is your opinion in this the vicar of horningsham spoke with unusual animation mr keble is wholly accurate upon this point my dear you must read the thirtynine articles as an affirmation of the doctrine of the fathers of the church not as a protestant tract which latter is all that people seem to do today as you read they will be a revelation to you lancelot andrewes and the other caroline divines were wholly lucid on this matter poor laud went to the scaffold because of it we have drifted into protestantism it needs younger men of integrity and energy however to recall the church to its proper destiny and i believe your elder son to have been one of these mr hervey john keble replied in a tone approaching ardour you should have heard his sermons at oriel and seen his ministry in the hovels of cowley he was worthy indeed of taking up andrewess torch but herveys mother had become likewise agitated then are we to throw vipers at the methodists again mr keble john keble looked at her with polite but evident incomprehension mr keble elizabeth interjected sheepishly some years ago a methodist was preaching outdoors in warminster and a townsman threw an adder at him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come keble replied hoping that the gospel after whom her younger son had been named might deflect them just so mr keble said mrs hervey equally opaquely and now matthew turning to lighter matters will you be going to see the marquess tomorrow well mother he began hesitantly perhaps not tomorrow but yes i shall pay my respects i think if you knew whom you might also see at longleat you would not long delay she added with a smile oh mother sighed elizabeth do you have no artfulness hervey looked bemused and all the more so for elizabeths prim reprimand henrietta lindsay is come back to longleat matthew that is all his sister explained hervey felt his gut twist and he fought hard not to show it well that is agreeable mother no you are quite right it is very agreeable to hear i have not seen henrietta lindsay in years i expect she is quite grown now he looked at elizabeth who looked down at her plate and he searched for some way by which to change the subject but i thought that first i should go to see daniel coates coates exclaimed the vicar of horningsham suddenly come back to consciousness the only man with any idea at all how to deal with those rickburners and how is that father asked elizabeth kindly laying her hand on his forearm but her father had slipped peacefully back into upright yet profound sleep daniel coates rickburners what was the connection wondered hervey coates was not a violent man at least he had not been when last hervey had seen him before leaving for spain had the unrest at home taken its toll of yeoman fortitude but coates was a tenant sheepfarmer why might he be troubled by rickburners daniel is a churchwarden now and a magistrate revealed his mother at upton scudamore your father holds the benefice in commendam daniel coates a churchwarden and a magistrate hervey could only wonder at the change in the country these past few years daniel coates old soldier his childhood hero a poor tenant farmer who had once been shepherd on the longleat estate it had been he who had taught him to ride cavalryfashion to shoot straight and use a sword so well that on joining the sixth he had been dismissed riding school and skillatarms quicker than anyone could remember hervey could not present himself unannounced to henrietta lindsay but he most certainly could to daniel coates and in coates was perhaps his best chance of gaining a reliable secular opinion of what the country had become while he had been away in john keble he knew he had such a mentor in the clerical view mr keble he said with sudden resolution may we take a turn about the garden i should be obliged for your opinion on this country to which i return it would seem as something of a stranger chapter six the yeomen of wiltshire salisbury plain midsummer day his fathers cob knew the way to upton scudamore well enough and the pace at which the vicar of horningsham liked to cover the five or so miles of rutted lanes which crossed the vale skirted the prehistoric mystery that was cley hill and connected the handsome estate village with the rougher settlement by the great west scarp of salisbury plain daniel coatess farm lay on the edge of the downs virtually under the scarp when he had taken the tenancy fifteen years earlier it had been nothing but a few dilapidated buildings and three acres of poor pasture with a hundred or so more of common land on the westbury side he had rebuilt it stone by stone brick by brick hervey had carried many of them himself there was nothing poorlooking about the place now however coates received him with an easy combination of deference and familiarity but master hervey and soon thereafter simply matthew was subjected to a veritable cannonade of questions a bombardment lasting a full halfhour without respite finally coates seemed to become aware of his insensibility and was then much abashed my dear matthew how could i ave been so inhospitable your glass is empty and you have not spoken except for to speak back he said reaching for a jug of purl dan i have so keenly imagined this time for many months but i want more than anything to ride on the downs again as we have done together since i was on the leadingrein there i promise i shall answer every enquiry you have a care to make and so shall it be matthew so shall it be coates replied with the broadest of smiles and he summoned his housemaid to take word to the stables hervey had never known a groom before at drove farm when first he had gone to spain there had not been so much as a labourer and certainly no housemaid now as they went into the stableyard there was a smartlooking fellow holding a fine pair of bay hunters prosperity indeed thought hervey but their discourse did not immediately resume on leaving the yard for daniel coates took hervey at his word and waited until they had reached the downs before pressing him once more to the details of his campaigning so with scarcely an exchange they rode out along the empty expanse of warminster bottom past dirtley wood and up the steep scarp of the great plain on to knapp down both men happy to let the memories stir in silence to herveys mind the plain had no rival for both bleakness and beauty in winter with a strong cutting northeast wind and sleet hail or heavy rain driven in sheets over the lonely plateau the scene broken here and there by a few clumps of dripping trees or a misty barrow was dismal desolate even he had been as cold here more so even as on the retreat to corunna but in fine weather and that midsummer morning was as fine as they came the air was as pure as in the pyrenees and the sun high and directly ahead as warm as in gascony the turf was soft and yielding it had cushioned many a fall in his youth and the whole face of the down was carpeted with flowers whose names he was surprised to be able to recall harebells centaury dark blue campanula scabias milkworts orchids and meadowsweet and where there were no flowers there was broom and furze still they rode on without speaking until cresting the rise of summer down hervey saw and heard the source of daniel coatess wealth sheep many many more than he could ever remember so many that for the best part of a mile it was scarcely possible to see the carpet of turf and flowers yes theyre all mine said coates guessing his thoughts every bale of wool these past five years has gone to clothe his majestys troops the war has upped demand beyond anything i couldve imagined the flocks grown a hundredfold and ive five shepherds tending em ive been sole agister on these downs for three summers now im a rich man matthew hervey nodded he could find no words adequate for his admiration but i doubt demandll remain high now that regiments and ships are being paid off i shall sell em all before winter this last was perhaps the true measure of coatess acumen energy and good fortune alone might promote wealth but it seemed to hervey real judgement was needed to know when to sell out but coates did not want to speak of business t see the army hasnt given you a taste for the straight leg then matthew he smiled approvingly nodding to the hunting length of herveys stirrups no dan it has not i cannot abide it all through spain we bumped along the kings germans didnt they ride at half our length and always rise to the trot and their horses are the better for it ours seemed to have no end of sore backs it gave coates no pleasure to hear it but he could take satisfaction in herveys opinion it had been one of the hard lessons of america lessons of which he had spoken endlessly when they had ridden out together yes i always said i learned more about campaigning from the colonists than from our own officers they had little idea other than how to drill how in heavens name can you lean out with a straight leg i reckon i had the advantage of an extra halfsword riding at hunting length all the difference when cutting at an infantryman trying to use his bayonet theres an ensign in the coldstream who would be dead but for that reach ay i saw that time and again but the reach has no purpose unless the sword is sharp hervey sighed we put straw in our scabbards as best we could and it stopped the rattling too but that steel sorely blunted the blades the germans had wooden scabbards and had not half the trouble daniel coatess interest in each and every detail seemed limitless they crossed summer down with the old soldier apparently oblivious to the vastness of his flock which calmly parted for them as they trotted through and they descended the east slopes into the dry valley where legend had it king alfred hid his army before edington yet scarcely did coates seem to notice their progress only when they climbed on to chapperton down where the imber shepherds grazed their flocks though on this morning the imber sheep were the other side of the valley did he return to the present come on he called suddenly urging his bay into a canter keep with me till wadmans coppice an then its flat out to brounkers well dye remember the gallop matthew that he did though he would have preferred to be on jessye now for that fast and surefooted little mare was made for just such a run on the plain but this gelding felt handy too and soon revealed a turn of speed pulling the whole mile and more to the ancient coppice and making hervey work hard to check him letting him have his head for the last halfmile into the dry valley beyond they reached brounkers well a dozen lengths clear as he pulled up and turned south for the imber road hervey laughed and called to coates by heavens youre spending some of your wealth on horseflesh dan what else is worth it matthew not a woman in a thousand thats for sure he called back they both laughed even louder the gelding is yours matthew what dan i cant possibly hervey spluttered but his protests were unlikely to make any impression ive more to be grateful to your family for than ever i could repay not even with a troops worth of horses without your father i would have trudged on down that lane where he found me coughing up my lungs thirty years ago and more it was im that found me employ on the estate and it was im that lent me the money for the first years rent on drove farm fifteen years back the horse is yours for as long as you wants im take im at least until you go to ireland and by then you wont want to leave him anyway hes a homecoming present matthew why should i not give you a homecoming present interest to pay or not he was sure that such a gift was more than he could accept and he might have continued protesting but for the sudden appearance of a score or more horsemen on the imber road warminster troop come on and see em said coates spurring into a canter again though the troop had been raised before he had left for spain this was herveys first encounter with them their appearance was in one respect at least impressive for the blue dolmans and tarleton helmets looked almost new but the troopers themselves did not have the stamp of men under habitual discipline hardened by service in which a bed was the infrequent alternative to a straw billet or a muddy bivouac indeed in some respects they had a faintly theatrical appearance for the tarleton had been out of regular service for two years at least but although the tarleton had been disliked for field service it was almost as cumbersome as the hussars mirleton he considered it still a very handsome headdress good morning coates called their lieutenant good morning mr styles replied daniel coates raising his hat to the guidon hervey blanched at the mans lofty manner and looked with disdain at the pallid face and fleshy thighs of this leader of yeomen but he raised his hat to the guidon nevertheless styles however assumed that both salutes were his and waved his hand airily in acknowledgement and who indeed was that asked hervey when the troop had passed mr hugo styles son and heir of sir george styles of leighton park at westbury replied coates and a right johnny raw i do not know of a sir george styles said hervey puzzled no you would not he bought leighton park three years ago and a baronetcy a year or so before that he owns most of the mills in devizes not a man at home much in the saddle i should say i dare say not sighed coates he fancies himself very much the gentleman though and disports himself as a blade hereabouts then i am doubly certain that i shall not call on him a supercilious yeomanry officer was by all accounts nothing unusual and hardly something to be troubled by it did not appear to trouble coates but simmered hervey to himself that daniel coates jp and sometime trumpeter to general tarleton should not receive the commonest of courtesies from someone wearing the kings uniform was detestable dan that milksop hailed you as if you were dickinthegreen not to worrit matthew youll be looking to a troop yourself next said coates seeing his anger and wishing to divert him hah and where would find two thousand pounds dan coates whistled is that what it takes nowadays matthew in addition dan in addition three thousand is the price well ill be you should go to india you are the second to tell me that replied hervey with a smile at last but i have no desire to leave the sixth they are the very finest of fellows hervey had expected a dinner of mutton at drove farm a joint perhaps or a pudding even but not venison shot by me on summer down this last week said coates with evident pride as hervey remarked on its tenderness and when dinner is finished ill show you the means by which i dropped her that mornings ride had given them both prodigious appetites and it was not until a custard of some size had come and gone that coates revealed the means by which he had taken the venison fetching from the hall an ordinarylooking carbine its not what it seems though well not what you might think he explained rifled suggested hervey ay that too said coates delving into a leather bag and pulling out a cartridge that looked longer than usual this here is powder and bullet and its fired by an initiator in the base i mean a cap which gives off an igniting spark when this pin here strikes it he continued pointing to the firing pin the pins held in this block he continued and is struck by a cocking hammer see hervey did see and quickly enough a breechloader i had heard there were such but never saw one before the breechloader is nothing new we had em in america coates laughed they had their problems they were slow for a start but instead of trying to improve them the ordnance gave up you see you can lie down behind cover and load one of these easy enough you cant very well with a muzzleloader but i have never heard of this initiator said hervey still puzzled that is the most significant part more so merely than breechloading the piece is called a percussion lock come see they went to the paddock beyond the stables where coates handed him both carbine and cartridgebag try it first and then i shall tell you the story of how i came by it he said lifting the hinged firing mechanism at the point where stock and butt met and placing a cartridge in the breech for him you pull back the hammer it locks itself back see theres a safety catch here too and then the trigger releases the hammer just like a flintlock no exterior spark nothing and the cartridges are waterproof too made of goldbeaters skin of what well not strict as goldbeaters skin is from ox gizzards these are sheepgut i make em myself hervey tried the carbine firing at a tree a hundred yards distant and watching with satisfaction as pieces of bark flew off with some velocity coates even dropped several cartridges into a bucket of water and these fired instantly too it took only a fraction of the time to reload that it would a loose charge and the accuracy compared well with the baker service rifle dan such a weapon it is astounding tell me how you came of it from a minister of the kirk would you believe what the reverend alexander forsyth doctor of divinity no less the minister in margarets village near glasgow he made it in his own workshop and you know what matthew he took it to the board of ordnance and they said they had no use for it no use bonaparte had use for it right enough offered him twenty thousand pounds for the secret but he would not sell it so the ordnance have promised him a pension for keeping silent he now has a shop in london sportingguns and the like yes forsyths in piccadilly i saw it only days ago so this is from london no he has no permit to sell them yet this i made myself after hed shown me the principle dan at every river in spain it was the same the devils own job just to keep powder and firelocks dry then we would have to prove the carbines although we were meant to be scouting you risked either giving yourself away or a misfire when you least needed it ive seen every carbine in a troop flash in the pan so well the carbine is yours matthew i have a pair theres no reason why you should not have dry powder at least though now that bonaparte is done for his majestys ordnance will no doubt consider it timely to make it a general issue the next morning before seven hervey drove with his mother into warminster for the saturday fair where she bought turbot and lobster freshcaught from weymouth on settling for the fish as had been her routine for as many years as he could remember she took a letter for her sister in hereford to the letter office in the high street and afterwards they drove home returning to the vicarage before nine each way she spoke of little but henrietta lindsay how fine a lady she was grown what society she kept how distinguished a peer was her guardian the marquess and on what close terms henrietta and elizabeth had remained she urged him to pay her a call at longleat that day and lamented that she had not the servants to ask her to dine with them at the vicarage what thoughts hervey entertained in that direction he now sought hard to conceal for much that he might look forward keenly to meeting once again the sparkling child whose schoolroom in longleat house he had once shared he knew that both the years and the society in which she moved must place a distance between them no he insisted politely and to his mothers consternation he would wait a little while more before calling instead when they had breakfasted he took out his new bay intending to put the gelding through its paces in longleat park the yeomanry were being put through their paces in the park also hervey saw them from some distance as he rode towards the deer enclosure and first impressions of their manoeuvring were of handiness he knew well enough the difficulties with which the volunteers were beset largely the want of anyone to train them since all the regulars had been sent to the indies or spain or to ireland or the coast at the supposed invasionpoints he halted fifty yards or so from them as they drew up in double rank on the edge of a piece of open ground which evidently served as their drill field telling off by files number began the troop serjeantmajor the words of command were somewhat eccentric not strictly the dundas manual but effective none the less but then the serjeantmajor began telling off by subdivisions and after that by quarterranks the process seemed interminable and to what end hervey could scarcely imagine had they been militia there might have been some benefit in numbering aloud for many a militiaman would not have been able to count beyond a dozen but there hardly seemed the need in the solid citizens of the yeomanry beyond the troop was a vocal gathering several carriages and half a dozen blades astride quality horses the kind of group that assembled anywhere the military paraded and if these yeomen troopers had not the edge in drilling that the regulars had they were a diverting enough sight to any who would admire a fine uniform indeed hervey began to wonder at whose expense they had been clothed the furcrested tarleton would have cost double perhaps treble the new shako whoever had paid was also of an independent mind he concluded for the plume was still in what he presumed must be the yeomanrys facing colour blue rather than the national white over red to which other corps had changed a decade before he could not but admire the skirted tailless blue dolman jackets slightly longer than the newpattern coat which his own regiment wore and he noted with approval that the jackets were worn with just a swordbelt and snakefastening instead of with the barrelled girdle which used to be popular this way their belts would be kept tight even if the effect were not as eyecatching but it was clear that in white breeches and boots these men were not meant for serious field service for overalls were what anyone who spent whole days in the saddle would choose his eye moved to the drill ground where two parallel rails set on posts about four feet high and painted white ran for fifty yards down the middle of the open area and to which the troop was drawn up at a rightangle the rails were about three feet apart and at intervals of ten yards and three feet from the rails on both sides there were posts about the height of a man on each of which was fixed a sheaf of straw it was much like any cavalry skillatarms field but the rails gave it more the look of the medieval tiltyard by herveys reckoning two troopers would gallop towards each other safely separated by the rails and in a backhand cut would slice the sheaves indeed he would soon have a demonstration for the first pair were trotting out to their starting positions two corporals the chevrons on their sleeves larger even than a regulars they began their approach at a trot and he judged that they would go forward to canter at the start of the rails and then gallop a couple of lengths before the posts to his astonishment however they maintained the trot throughout and worse they simply held out their swords to cut at the sheaves with forehand swipes even at that modest pace however it should have been possible to cut them but the swords were so blunt that they knocked all but one off the posts the corporals seemed pleased with their demonstration nevertheless as did their officer the same pallid lieutenant of the imber road hervey groaned there then followed a ponderous halfhour while the thirty or so troopers went through these same evolutions why he stayed was uncertain perhaps he hoped for some redeeming feature of drill before the parade was over but there was not and he was puzzled why if it were too much to expect these volunteers to learn to cut at the gallop and he would be the first to acknowledge the skill in that manoeuvre surely it were better then to point with the sword and quicken the pace but without anyone of experience to drill them how might such a practical solution be advanced good morning my fine fellow so you are taken by the sight of regimentals eh wrapped in his thoughts hervey had not noticed the lieutenant ride up to him well you look as though you could be made to sit well and be useful with a sword want to try your hand on the gallops hervey could but stare at the lieutenants leg stretched in regulation fashion the very tip of the toe only in the stirrup and it took the greatest effort to suppress his smile at the word gallops a less appropriate one he would have found difficult to imagine and in the face of such delusion laughter was tempting in the extreme i thank you no he managed instead oh now come there is nothing to be afraid of my men will applaud your efforts be what may had this milksop assailed him with any kindness then he might have hesitated but the lofty treatment of daniel coates on the imber road the day before sealed it now was the time for lieutenant hugo styles the slightly too corpulent leader of men to learn a little humility very well then hervey conceded oh to have jessye or nero or even a troop horse but he knew this little gelding though green had a turn of speed and he guessed that with a strong leg he would not shy at another horse bearing down he wished he were wearing a shorter coat not his fathers long grey one but this too was beyond amendment and he contented himself instead by shortening his stirrups two holes one initiative he might take however was to find a sharp enough sword he declined the first one offered and rode over instead to the only yeoman whose sabre had cut cleanly styles eyed him quizzically the lieutenant of yeomanry may even have begun to have second thoughts as he himself rode to the other end of the gallop two hundred yards distant but there he drew his sword with an exaggerated flourish and his chestnut thoroughbred an entire began prancing and snorting the serjeantmajor gave the signal and styles plunged forward containing the charger in a steady canter only with difficulty hervey was not without his difficulties too as his young horse began bucking but he managed to get him back into his hands and thence to a goodish canter and then gallop and closed with the posts before styles had even reached the check rails but instead of running down the outside of his posts he went between them and the rails ignoring his own sheaves and leaning far out of the saddle and stretching over the parallel rails he sliced each of styless cleanly with economical backhand cuts at the end of the rails he turned the gelding on its quarters and with styles shouting after him incomprehensibly galloped back down the line on the outside of the posts slicing each of his own sheaves equally cleanly with neat backhand cuts to the nearside the troops acclamation was immediate but just as quickly silenced by styless rage what the deuce dye think yer playing at who the deuce dye think ye are hervey who made no reply had not noticed one of the open carriages drive up to them and nor had styles whose language was rapidly becoming that of the proverbial trooper its occupant a young woman of obvious fashion with dark tresses and large eyes the colour of the yeomanrys midblue facings knew exactly who styless recruit was hugo this is cornet matthew hervey of the sixth light dragoons just back from france she said with some solemnity but with the suggestion of a smile too have you not met hervey was taken aback though he did not at first see the full import of that recognition poor styles he thought not only distressed humiliated was perhaps too strong a word in front of his troop but in front of a lady with whom evidently he had some connection he could hardly take satisfaction in that styles struggled visibly to bring his rage under control as he turned and saluted the carriage good morning lady henrietta he spluttered and turning to hervey he bowed slightly pleased to make your acquaintance sir but it carried no conviction hervey was at once mortified by the discovery of who occupied the carriage much though he had contemplated the manner of his reacquaintance with henrietta lindsay he could never have imagined this she would he felt sure think his display showy and vulgar and would be angered by the discomposing of styles he raised his hat but could find no words not even a commonplace greeting he might not indeed have recognized her at any casual meeting but a second or sos study of her eyes left him in no doubt his stomach heaved and his head swam but how had she recognized him have you not read of mr hervey in the miscellany she asked styles with what seemed mock surprise i have not seen the miscellany yet styles replied coolly why indeed it is printed this very morning and up with the latest news here let me read you a little matthew hervey esquire the only son of the reverend thomas hervey vicar of horningsham has lately returned from the french war in which he has been nobly serving as a cornet in his majestys th light dragoons mr hervey accompanied his corps to spain soon after the commencement of lord wellingtons campaign and has seen much fighting in the four years thence it is understood that this gallant officer will remain in the district upon furlough for some two months before returning to the dragoons who are to be garrisoned in ireland styles glowered and hervey shifted uneasily in the saddle and what do you think of our yeomanrys appearance mr hervey she added very fine very fine indeed madam he replied if she had chosen the word appearance in order to restore the wretched styless selfesteem and she had a look that said she might then he did not wish to risk any discourtesy by a critical remark in any case his reply was honest enough if by appearance she meant only their fine uniforms and do you not agree with miss austen that there is nothing finer than the volunteers in their regimentals i do not know miss austen maam replied hervey puzzled you do not know of jane austen her incredulity again had the ring of mock surprise miss austen is our foremost authoress she explained holding up a small volume pride and prejudice mr hervey published only recently it tells of how the militia win the hearts of the ladies when they come into the district hervey confessed that neither had he heard of the title upon my word mr hervey you are not so conceited a regular as to disdain the affairs of the volunteers she chided no madam he stammered back not at all i then do permit me to read some she interrupted miss austen is so keen an observer of human nature here i have it she leafed through several pages until a little smile of triumph overcame her i must first tell you mr hervey that the books heroines are five sisters of singular intellect and sensibility but all are enraptured by the presence of the militia officers just as our own yeomanry steal the hearts of all they meet now here is what she writes they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune mr bingley is a coarsebred sort mr hervey much given to show she smiled but her continuing irony eluded him how was he to know bingleys true character and he presumed this to be some sort of rebuke mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign hervey felt the deep water into which he had stumbled about to close over him here again was the mocking child of the schoolroom of the fallen tree and the captured hat the message was as clear as it might be she indeed thought little of his show and the yeomanry were as close as she chose to come to the profession of soldiering forgive me madam he said shaking his head but i must be away it was a pleasure to make your acquaintance even as he spoke he thought the words absurd but he was angry that she had enabled styles this pompous ass of an ornamental officer to reinflate himself but more he had made her reacquaintance in such a manner as to appear both brash and artless as he trotted away he knew they would be laughing and great was his relief when out of sight beyond the trees he could spur into a gallop he stayed a long time in the stable rubbing the gelding down cleaning saddlery filling hayracks anything in fact which might distract his thoughts from the encounter in the park it was a full hour before he felt ready to go inside matthew began his sister the moment he did and with the air of someone about to impart good news we are to dine with lord bath this evening oh he replied groaned almost as he thought what must come next matthew i am astounded do you not wish to see the marquess after so long away yes of course i he stammered but do you not realize that henrietta lindsay will be there also and there is to be another officer too well from the yeomanry that is hervey groaned even louder elizabeth i must needs recount the events of the morning they are not propitious no not at all propitious for it occurred to him that henrietta lindsay must have known in the park of this invitation and she had played him as a catspaw elizabeth spent much time contemplating her journal the following morning she had much to write that was merely narrative though dinner at longleat was never occasion for a commonplace entry she had first to describe the evening the food the music the cards there was no dancing and such conversation as was of a routine nature this much was straightforward although she spent longer than she anticipated recalling the details of the elegant table laid before them the moroccan quails fattened in normandy ortolans from the loire truffles and champagne all to be had easily if at prodigious expense now that the royal navys blockade was lifted and she had to record too how they had dined à la russe no doubt at henriettas insistence with each course served by footmen in white gloves to the ladies first rather than the older fashion of laying all the dishes before them on the table her principal difficulty however lay in first comprehending and then finding the appropriate words to describe the sentiments and purposes of the three as she put it dramatis personae henrietta gave her most cause for perplexity for her demeanour throughout the evening suggested some understanding with styles although she had never confided anything of the sort and elizabeth began to doubt whether indeed she might claim any particular fellowship with her in light of this styles himself she observed had carried about him a sort of proprietorial air which at times verged on the possessive it was evident too that this was exacerbated perhaps deliberately encouraged even by the attention that henrietta showed to matthew though curiously it seemed to her that styles was more discomfited by adulation of hervey as a soldier than by what henriettas notice might truly portend of her brother elizabeth was in a state of mild despair she had hoped that his service might have wrought something more masterful in him yet last night he had been as ever during dinner itself he had seemed at ease enough there were occasions when he might even have been said to be expressive yet when coffee was served and with it a renewal of henriettas childhood teasing he had relapsed into silence whence nothing could tempt him for the remainder of the evening at length she sighed aloud and deep she picked up her pen and wrote with a noticeably firmer hand than the plainer narrative had demanded i have ever held to drydens avowal that none but the brave deserves the fair and i cannot doubt that matthew is brave for he was ever so yet deserts are never wholly just and i pray that his heart will not be faint chapter seven when pride cometh horningsham the feast day of st mary magdalen july o come let us sing unto the lord let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation began the vicar of horningsham let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and show ourselves glad in him with psalms came herveys strong clear response in contrast to the frailer versicle and so throughout the venite the reverend thomas hervey opened the smaller bible used for the daily offices and announced the first lesson while opposite matthew and elizabeth hervey sat alone in the choir stall here beginneth the eleventh chapter of the book of proverbs a false balance is abomination to the lord but a just weight is his delight when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom the integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them as a boy hervey had regularly attended the daily offices with his father for whom it was the command of the book of common prayer that they be said publicly and the curate that ministereth in every parishchurch or chapel being at home and not being otherwise reasonably hindered shall say the same in the parishchurch or chapel where he ministereth and shall cause a bell to be tolled thereunto a convenient time before he begin that the people may come to hear gods word and to pray with him since johns going away to oxford and matthews to the war elizabeth had filled the antiphonal void for the vicar of horningsham could afford neither curate nor clerk though thomas hervey had never been entirely at ease with a woman in his chancel there was little doubting the old mans pleasure in having once again a son at morning prayer afterwards however as they walked to the vicarage the sun warm on their backs even at that early hour he seemed to be at some pains to show his esteem for elizabeths succour during those long years i think it a pity that when the prayer book supplanted the breviary st mary magdalens became no longer a holy day he began for it was she to whom the risen lord first appeared and gave a message for the brethren elizabeth saw at once his meaning and it was she who remained at the cross the vicar of horningsham nodded could it be that her former sins stood against her still wondered hervey somehow of the mind that cranmer had been perhaps less forgiving than some oh i think not she was a true penitent yet there are those in the eastern churches as i believe who hold that it was not the magdalen who was the sinner but a third woman how so father i have not heard this asked elizabeth oh my poor scholarship is insufficient i am afraid that must be a question for mr keble he replied dear mr keble sighed elizabeth i hope he will stay with us again do not you matthew hervey agreed for there was in john kebles certain faith much that gave comfort as there had been with sister maria the thought of sister maria was especially apt that day for it was the convents patronal festival he felt uneasy still about his promise to her though he was at a loss to know what more he could do as things stood while he had been in london he had taken a letter to the french consulgeneral for the comte de chantonnay but there had been no word from france and it looked as though the ring he carried constantly would go with him to ireland when the time came when breakfast was ended elizabeth took her journal to the garden hervey went with her taking the aprilquarterly edition of the edinburgh review which darcey jessope had sent him that very week with the first article marked for his attention a lengthy piece on the state and prospects of europe do you hear this he began after some moments perusing it the first and predominant feeling which rises on contemplating the scenes that have just burst on our view is that of deepfelt gratitude and unbounded delight for the liberation of so many oppressed nations for the cessation of bloodshed and fear and misery over the fairest portions of the civilized world and for the enchanting prospect of long peace and measureless improvement which seems at last to be opening on the suffering kingdoms of europe he sighed a long peace and measureless improvement that is a happy prospect is it not a truly happy prospect she replied but though improvement is contingent upon peace certainly it does not of itself follow do you suppose that our parliament shall embrace improvement as vigorously as they did war not for one moment he smiled but they will pursue the dividends of peace and some of these might as a consequence promote improvement so you are not for reform matthew the marquess is i believe though sir george styles is not am i not so obvious a radical then he laughed i care not one jot how styles father or son stand on reform when pride cometh then cometh shame she chided you were attentive during the lesson sister i am ever thus i assure you but the marquess he has a right judgement in such things think you not i confess an admiration for the marquess he conceded and for his ward surely she teased my dear elizabeth we were speaking of matters of substance and is not admiration a matter of substance only if the admiration is substantial he was pleased with his response but she was too quick then you must now answer for the extent of your admiration rather than for its mere existence hervey sighed again but he was not entirely without the skill for a riposte i confess to more admiration for henrietta lindsay than she for me yet that need not amount to a very great deal elizabeth thought it prudent to make no reply and instead she carefully recorded her brothers assessment in her journal tell me elizabeth he began after several minutes silence you and henrietta are close yet his words trailed off oh matthew do not scruple to speak of the truth you mean that henrietta is rich or at least comparatively so and moves in the best of society and she is uncommonly pretty and has graces and refinement whereas i no i did not mean it so he interrupted what did you mean so then what i mean is that it is unjust to speak of those qualities as if the very opposite were the case with you for it is not well not those which are qualities of the person for sure you are ever sweet matthew and yet though there are differences between henrietta and me we are i think confidantes or as near as may be so called and have been so these many years since the schoolroom with its childish intimacies but for my part henriettas love of society is sufficient for the both of us for i truly do not think i have the inclination for it as well as not having the means and for henriettas part you must ask her for she will freely confess to a fascination for the parish and poorhouse but only at a remove only in my telling she is the same person whom we knew in the schoolroom but her circumstances permit her no true purpose in life i can have no envy for her position yet i know there is something deeper which may inspire her you have been here a full month you must have some sense of this yourself but i have seen so little of her and then only without any intimacy in the least part she is as distant as first she was in the park i am to school her mare again today but it will be the same there is no reason i think why it should be you have much that is of mutual interest she admires greatly your facility with horses elizabeth could not bring herself to be more direct but she is so well versed in the works of the literary men and women of the moment that at times we may as well speak a different tongue it would seem that all england has been busy with the pen these past five years matthew they are as you say of the moment well said he laughed it was time to be done with that concern so tell me elizabeth what have you seen of the saddle of late next to nothing i confess it is three seasons since i saw hounds then at least i may remedy that you must visit me in ireland as soon as i am settled there the word is that there is no finer country outside the shires shall i find a husband too she smiled only if you are able to choose between the many who will propose you are ever loyal and gallant brother she laughed t fear that it will be your undoing he did not return until almost four having spent two hours first longeing then attempting some of the simpler evolutions with henriettas new mare afterwards she had asked him to take some refreshment at the house but since hugo styles had latterly attached himself he had declined though he was now regretting his pique the family is in the garden with a caller master matthew said francis as hervey strode into the cool darkness of the hall taking tea at four was to herveys mind a conceit lately come to horningsham an import from neighbouring bath whose choice this was he had not been troubled to discover but he would have hazarded the opinion that his mother had succumbed to the influence of longleat house though he would have been wrong for longleat held to the older custom and it was elizabeth who had urged the practice on the household having read of it in one of miss austens novels the scene in the garden of that comfortable parsonage was not one of perfect fashion however for the sight of a china teacup and saucer in a hand that hervey had only ever seen holding either sabre or bottle was so incongruous as to be positively bizarre the caller sprang up deftly transferring cup and saucer from right hand to left and knuckled his forehead though bareheaded as was the custom in the sixth good afternoon mr hervey sir serjeant armstrong what in heavens name forgive me father he reddened checking his mild profanity what could possibly bring you here matthew began his mother before armstrong could manage a word the serjeant has been given leave but has chosen to come to see you and he has told us so much about you and the war i cannot think why you did not tell us yourself oh mother laughed elizabeth we women are not to hear of such things we should swoon should we not armstrong was smiling he looked as untroubled as if tea in a country parsonage were his everyday habit so many times in spain and portugal hervey had seen or heard of this roughandready serjeant fighting with the fury of a wildcat and yet he now seemed equally capable of charming the gentlest of souls that were his mother and father and likewise engaging the most discriminating of mortals that was his sister sit down serjeant armstrong he said with a wry smile as he took a chair himself what really brings you here you have orders for me ill warrant by now the family had acquired a sufficient ear for armstrongs tyneside vowels and idiom as alien as anything that had been heard in the village and were able just to discern that he had been sent from dover to the depot in canterbury to collect a draft and that just before he was to leave for ireland with them the recruits were sent instead to the nineteenth in canada the depots commander had granted him leave no doubt a less troublesome option thought hervey than having him with time on his hands in canterbury and armstrong had decided to make his way to cork via horningsham hervey could not but feel it a flattering if unusual choice of route so you are not carrying orders from the regiment no sir are you expecting any major edmonds instructed me to remain here until such arrived there followed much pleasant but inconsequential conversation during which the serjeant was able to recount other instances of his cornets capability and indeed occasions too of less distinction though hervey himself was lost in contemplation of the continuing absence of orders suddenly however armstrongs turn of story sounded alarm the affair of the alcalde of mayorgas daughter and the barrel of sardines how much leave is owing to you serjeant armstrong he asked abruptly anxious that the subject be changed armstrong was quick to the signal more than im ever likely to be permitted to take sir well i have an idea he began i have another months leave perhaps more major edmonds said that i was to stay until receiving orders from him or direct from lord sussex i think that you should stay here too we can arrange lodgings hereabouts and drill into our yeomanry troop some practical elements of the profession at this elizabeth frowned do you think that hugo styles would welcome that she asked doubtfully hervey looked faintly surprised he is not so great a fool as to decline it surely i was thinking less of the strictly military side matthew might he not consider it further rivalry but her brother did not catch her meaning that business in the park is long past he replied elizabeth raised her eyebrows and sighed to herself armstrong sensed at once what her brother had failed to though he could not know the precise details she equally sensible of his position hastened to make some explanation you must forgive me serjeant i did not intend trespassing on military questions i am merely anxious to avoid any unnecessary illfeeling in the district the yeomanry are so intimate a part of our life at present no offence miss ervey none at all these yeomen are proud men regulars have to step lightly with em to call em catshooters is horrible cruel this was uncommon diplomacy thought hervey it would have done even serjeant strange credit nevertheless he was pleased when his fathers repeating halfhunter came to his aid striking the halfhour so as to make the reverend thomas hervey spring up with singular speed muttering something about evening prayer herveys mother felt a need to speak to cook and elizabeth said she would go with her father to church and so alone in the garden hervey and armstrong sat for some time without speaking the lateafternoon birdsong supplanting their earlier talk both found themselves listening to it intently even from the tops of the elms around the house and the yews in the churchyard and from deep inside the beech hedges there came a ceaseless chorus of blackbirds and finches which would soften between midday and this hour and then resume until only a last solitary thrush remained in the gathering dusk deposed in turn by the eerier night sounds out in the vale rooks chattered and cawed continually over the cornfields the sky was full of woodpigeons with their buzzing and queer calls and even up on the downs where there were no hedges and precious few trees the larks were so numerous that there was continuous song from one end of the plain to the other how little birdsong there had seemed in spain and france by comparison by god mr hervey sir this is grand said armstrong at length grand yes replied hervey but you should see longleat house to know what is grand in the grand sense and thats a grand family youve got too hervey smiled you have never spoken of your people serjeant armstrong never seemed any point he replied with a halfshrug how so because theyre all dead sir hervey was disconcerted this was something he surely ought to have known serjeant armstrong i i am truly sorry to learn that well thats why i enlisted had to start again start again what do you mean well you remember that tar on the transport from france the one that ad been at trafalgar yes he replied intrigued by the association well how many of is mates dye think were killed in that battle four hundred or thereabouts was it not ay nearer four hundred and fifty and nearly three times that many knocked about bad now lord nelson ad twentyseven ships o the line that makes seventeen killed on each as near as makes no odds hervey wondered how this surprising grasp of naval statistics connected with the circumstances of armstrongs family but he forbore to hurry him armstrong had a way with stories and every man at trafalgar is an ero and every one of them four hundred and fifty is a dead ero but noone as ever heard of the men and bairns killed that same day in ebbum colliery thirtyfive of em two of nelsons ships worth of dead eroes and as many cripples and the dead all sent to their maker in a split seconds explosion of firedamp my father and is father and my two brothers i was the youngest and shouldve been there with em except id been urt in a rooffall a day afore hervey was all but overcome not just by the horror of the accident but by his knowing so little of things from time to time news reached horningsham of accidents in the coalmines nearby in somerset but the details were always sparse but i never knew that men could be killed in such numbers he said at length his brow furrowing in disbelief and bairns and their mothers and sisters an all sometimes added armstrong emphatically though more in resignation than in bitterness bitterness was reserved for what followed and you know what mr ervey that explosion made two dozen widows and a hundred orphans in ebburn village an all thrown on the parish with no extra from the coal owners my mother died in three months in a damp and lousy poorhouse the birdsong swelled as hervey sank once more into silence armstrong sat impassively disinclined to tempt him from his thoughts at length hervey confronted his shame serjeant armstrong i am truly humbled to admit of my ignorance of all this and i cannot conceive of how i have never read of these things in the newspapers if they are so frequent that one at ebburn was small by comparison and you know why you dont hear of em because the papers are forbidden to report em thats why they remained a full hour talking though much subdued and they spoke of matters of which only a short time before hervey would never have dreamed that they were able to do so said much perhaps about mutual respect but equally it seemed to him afterwards about the sixth and its discipline a discipline of which martinets like slade could never have any comprehension slade even at this time the ghastly remembrance could intrude serjeant armstrongs temporary assignment with the warminster troop proved not nearly so quarrelsome as many had anticipated he was in any event unlikely to have failed to win the esteem of the yeomen troopers themselves for any demands he would make on them would surely derive from experience rather than solely from the drill book in a remarkably short time he was able to improve both their horsemanship and their swordskills he had been particularly careful however in his dealings with the troop serjeantmajor a foreman on the marquess of baths estate and had shown him the deference that he would his own in the sixth probably more and with hugo styles he was so correct in his compliments and so leading in his instruction that the lieutenants standing in the eyes of the troop must have been considerably enhanced thereby they drilled on a wednesday and a saturday and occasionally on a sunday styles attended every muster for his fortune was sufficiently mature not to require his presence elsewhere and henrietta lindsay accompanied him hervey who at the outset at least felt a duty of supervision lest his serjeant be placed in any position of disadvantage was an equally punctilious spectator at first he would stand aloof in some position of observation and watch the drill intently until by invitation or some other contrivance he would find himself in the company of henrietta and styles the latter tolerated his presence always with the very least civility that their status as gentlemen and officers compelled herveys disdain of styles grew by degrees to detestation for he could find in him no redeeming feature his dress speech and manner were contrived to an absurdly exaggerated extent there were those in the sixth hervey knew who would certainly excel him in each but they would give no offence in the doing styles was a man of considerable means it was said but there were some in the sixth who were richer and yet would excite no such animosity all these wouldbe candidates for equal disdain had the very quality and in large measure that styles wholly lacked generosity of spirit and what was perhaps more they had shared the privations of a campaign hervey concluded that styles was a man profoundly unsuited for anything but the most ornamental of commands what a great good fortune it had been that the yeomanry had never been required to repel bonapartes troops one thing only puzzled hervey what it was that henrietta found so agreeable in styles henrietta herself was always entirely civil at these meetings but nothing more or so it seemed to him as the weeks passed however hervey showed less attention to the evolutions on the drill ground and greater address at joining the other two observers and so obvious was that address that the lieutenants duty of civility was placed under a greater strain than he was sometimes capable of bearing but when hervey found himself in henriettas sole company as when for instance styles took command of the troop for some manoeuvre or other she spent so much time asking whether he did not admire this or other about the lieutenant and his yeomen that he became wholly cast down then on st bartholomews eve a fast day which the vicarage at horningsham kept strictly herveys longexpected letter arrived you look puzzled brother it is not ill news surely asked elizabeth sipping her unsweetened tea with no great relish it is from my major i am to rejoin the regiment in cork within ten days he replied but you were expecting these orders were you not i was but there is something more it seems that major edmonds he is acting as officer commanding since the lieutenantcolonel was wounded in france it seems that he had asked the colonel to secure me an appointment at the horse guards but that this had not proved expedient but that is surely a most agreeable compliment is it not matthew she asked further puzzled by his want of enthusiasm perhaps so but the major said nothing of this to me and it astounds me that he should think i might welcome such a preferment it is almost as if he wished positively to see me away from the regiment he knew or at least confided that this latter could not be so curiously however he sensed that if the choice had been his now then it might indeed have been for london rather than for cork for much as the sixth meant to him at that moment the thought of quitting horningsham for so distant a station as cork without resolving his feelings for henrietta lindsay filled him with profound gloom had he now been with the regiment he would have been able to do what he had always done when troubled he would have thrown himself at once into an excess of duties not emerging until he was quite sure that his feelings were like some difficult remount in hand but he was not with the regiment and the feelings were not in truth an unwelcome intrusion elizabeth sensed all this better than he might have supposed but again she said nothing i think i shall ride out on the plain a while he said suddenly almost jumping from his chair shall you come with me she declined however judging the invitation to be but politeness but call do on daniel coates matthew he is ever wise in all matters she urged he went to the stables saddled coatess bay and within the hour he was on the downs walking along the scarp with its distant views of somerset the bristol road and beyond he supposed to cork in some way or other he had imagined the ride might clear his mind or steel him perhaps to what he must do but the purpose was unaccomplished for as he turned back at wadmans coppice all he had succeeded in doing was to identify by a process not unlike the appraisal of some military problem two equally impaired options first he might proceed to cork and put henrietta lindsay from his mind the flaw in this it was soon apparent was that he did not possess the initiative in matters of the mind alternatively he might make his stillindistinct feelings known and leave for cork with some understanding between them here however the flaw seemed even greater for he was nearcertain that his feelings must be wholly unreciprocated or else he might be deemed unsuitable by the marquess who though no longer strictly her guardian since she had come of age was unquestionably a man whose blessing must be sought but in truth the real impediment was an incapacity to press himself with henrietta especially in light of her attachment however imprecise with styles for a while he contemplated returning via drove farm where he hoped daniel coatess wisdom might extend to matters of this kind but their talk had always been of the soldiers art and of horses and there was no reason to suppose that a facility with these might apply equally to his newer concern daniel coates had indeed expressed himself only once on the subject of soldiers marrying he had opined it a cruel thing to make a campfollower of a decent maid so instead hervey made straight for horningsham by descending the nearvertical sides of arn hill it gave him cause to make much of the young gelding for his balance and thence through norridge wood the furthest place he and henrietta had ventured on their childhood rambles together he could picture with surprising recall her old nurse huffing and puffing and protesting at the distance they had brought her from longleat as he neared the edge of the estate he saw the yeomanry again leaving the park and they looked more than usually purposeful he had not known they were to have a drill day and was surprised to see styles at the head of them havent time to dawdle with you hervey theres work to be done he called loftily as they broke into a trot armstrong rode up with a resigned look afternoon mr ervey sir theyre off to sabre some poor noddleheads hereabouts what seems theres a gang intent on breaking up machinery at hindon and the justices have called out the yeomanry mr styles asked me to go with em but i said id rather not if he didnt mind an dyou know what he said damn you for a luddite yerself serjeant or dont the regulars have the stomach for it ass rasped hervey well yer cannee get sense outr haddock on a saturday night pronounced armstrong in his broadest tyneside an yer wastin yer time the rest o the week an all come on sir dont worry about it come on back to me lodgings and well toast the regiment no serjeant armstrong tempted as i am orders for cork have arrived you and i are to be there in a week or so and there is much to be done and besides today is a fast day he added with a smile armstrong looked appalled well i for one will go and drink to our return to the regiment he said striking his boot with his whip oh an by the way miss lindsay has been looking for you and proper keen to see you she appeared to be hervey was at once quickened by this report though he tried to look otherwise very well then serjeant i am for home i will see you at the bell some time tomorrow or the day after when arrangements for cork are made and he turned the bay sharply back in the direction of the village putting him into a fast trot he did not expect to encounter henrietta so soon but as he rounded a corner a halfmile on he found her walking her hack alone in the same direction his bays hoofs on the hardbaked road gave away his approach and she turned mr hervey she called i was on my way to ask elizabeth and you to come with me to the great henge tomorrow shall you she asked in a manner altogether warmer than ever he had observed at the drill ground with the greatest of pleasure maam i have not seen the henge since we shared the schoolroom i cannot speak for elizabeth of course but i am sure i am going that way she replied i will ride with you and save you the trouble of sending word tell me do you cherish those schoolroom days he sighed to himself she was the model of selfpossession more captivating than ever her riding habit was the same blue as the sixths uniform its finely cut bodice accentuating her slender waist and the full skirt reaching almost to the ground was all elegance her black silk hat was oiled to a high gloss her dark tresses were pulled back and her blue eyes shone i might wish we were there still even as they rode to the village however his doubts began returning why had she chosen now to reveal a warmth hitherto concealed it was not as if she had known he was about to leave and when she had said poor hugo will be away at hindon for several days i fear it seemed both invitation and caution but was he under some obligation to styles in the lieutenants absence in aid of the civil power so many questions of propriety did the circumstances pose that instead he fell into silent confusion when an hour or so later henrietta had left the vicarage with his sisters acceptance of the invitation to the henge he resolved to end his dilemma elizabeth i must speak with you about that is i should welcome your opinion as to but he was again unable to summon the words hervey was relieved that there was a fourth occupant of henriettas barouche and especially pleased with who the occupant was the early return of styles would have been more than he could have borne the evening before john keble had called on his way to oxford from lyme regis where he had been taking the sea air and writing poetry at first hervey had thought that the object of his calling might have been elizabeth for whom the poet seemed to have formed a strong regard at his first visit and hervey had begun increasingly to think that this would be a wholesome match but john keble had no other object but to deliver letters of introduction to several clerics beneficed in the neighbourhood of cork and dublin a gesture of kindness for which hervey made fulsome show of gratitude and when elizabeth had asked him to join them for the excursion to the henge hervey too pressed him to accept word being sent to longleat that with henriettas leave a man of letters would accompany them in the morning an hour or so before their barouche departed another coach not so grand but also bearing the bath arms left longleat for the same destination it conveyed the elaborate luncheon and the attendants who were to serve it and serjeant armstrong he had learned of the excursion from one of the longleat ladys maids whose coolness towards him hitherto had had a most beguiling effect and he had offered his services as guard ingeniously citing the trouble at hindon to gain a favourable response forfeiting thereby a soldiers farewell from one of the kitchen maids at his lodgings if armstrongs conversation in the first barouche was of an unusually respectable nature however sensible as he was of the ladys maids disposition that in the principal carriage was positively highminded for john kebles presence mannered yet warm though he was seemed not at first to admit of gaiety elizabeth was troubled by the disturbances at hindon it seemed fearing that they might spread to the malcontents on warminster common john keble believed the situation to be a paradigm for the general condition of the realm and spoke with some passion and evident knowledge of poverty in the cities and also in ireland you will do well there mr hervey to keep clear of the disputes between the owners and their tenants for it is very bitter much worse than here more bitter than you can possibly imagine fuelled as it is by religious bigotry hervey nodded an unhappy place indeed mr keble agreed elizabeth as unhappy as ever a country could be i believe miss hervey and the scars are deep there is a saying there old sins cast long shadows whose are the greater sins there mr keble asked her brother is it possible to discern for i have read of perfidy on all sides it is without doubt a confused and confusing story i am the first to admit neither am i the best to tell it indeed i know it very imperfectly you must call on canon very in cork as soon as you are able and he will tell you fairly he is of the same mind as those in the church of which we spoke when last we dined together he is leading his congregation back to proper observance and will do great things but henrietta would have done with politics i do not like only talk of trouble especially now we learn that mr hervey is to go away so very soon mr keble you have been composing poetry at lyme have you not may we hear some john keble blushed lady henrietta you are most flattering i should in ordinary have been honoured to read some but that which i have been composing recently is of a religious nature and because of the sentiments you express not i think what you have in mind i do however have some shelley with me shelley mr keble you do surprise me she replied with a smile which conveyed nothing but approval nevertheless hervey looked mystified shelley maam but henrietta did not catch his meaning in the inflection he neither knew of shelley nor had the slightest idea why henrietta might be surprised that keble should carry his poetry or else she did not reveal it yes mr hervey i am quite astonished you mean i think ventured john keble that shelley is a notorious atheist that mr keble is the very least of his transgressions is it not she challenged and with an even greater smile elizabeth now resolved on some evading action to spare john kebles blushes i think mr keble that we are alluding to mr shelleys elopement with miss westbrook and she barely sixteen but before john keble could respond henrietta positively shrieked with horror my dear that is nothing he has eloped once more this very month and to switzerland it seems leaving poor sweet harriet and two children and his new paramour is but sixteen too really mr keble how these romantics have a strong attachment to innocence elizabeth was dumbfounded at her failure to avert the moment john keble sat in open astonishment as hervey tried manfully to suppress the laughter which threatened to convulse him mr hervey said henrietta seeing his condition and deciding he was not to be spared do you approve of mr shelley i must confess maam that i do not know of either shelley or his poetry this was in truth scarcely a confession of towering ignorance for during all the time that shelleys star had been rising hervey had been on campaign conversation touching on such things was not uncommon in the regiment by any means but six years was a long time in the course of the next halfhour though the extent of his nescience was truly to disturb him byron wordsworth and so many others were all unfamiliar names had he been in some profound sleep milton dryden pope these he had learned at shrewsbury yet not once were they spoken of not even coleridge whom he had of his own volition read copiously southey they praised with something bordering on reverence elizabeth dazzled them by her discourse on the curse of kehama yet when hervey had become a soldier robert southey was known only as a hothead whose jacobin sympathies were attracting the attention of the authorities how might he now have become a high tory and poet laureate and then john keble read some unpublished sonnets by a surgeons apprentice whose work he predicted would yet surpass even southeys the war it seemed to hervey had touched little beyond the battlefield but in the midst of this feast of letters henrietta gave hervey perhaps the surest sign of her regard matthew will you tell us something of the countryside of spain i believe it can be called magnificent can it not it was not merely that she had said matthew she had not called him by his name since his return it was her evident sensibility in so changing the course of their conversation he responded keenly describing the landscape of the peninsula as best he could though he found his words less than adequate after so much poetry and each time he appeared to be nearing a conclusion henrietta would smile encouragingly prompting him to reminisce yet more when he recounted the aftermath of the battle at toulouse john keble pressed him to details of the nunnery which he then recalled in more precise terms i conclude from your description of their dress and rule that your sister maria is a discalced carmelite said keble at length henrietta giggled that sounds faintly disreputable john keble smiled he was getting the measure of her no lady henrietta the carmelites are a very ancient order which trace their origins to the desert fathers on mount carmel discalced simply means that the order goes barefoot it is part of their austere regimen do not you remember smiled elizabeth calceus a shoe of course how could one forget those days in the schoolroom how i admired matthew for the way he could decline a noun hervey shifted in his seat unsure whether her remark portended a return to mocking but he did not have to trouble with a reply for the appearance of the great henge itself a halfmile distant brought instead little cries of awe and appreciation from henrietta and the object of that appreciation was not only the henge for here on the eastern extremity of the plain as empty as it must have been in the earliest times but for sheep grazing unattended the resplendence of longleat house had been transported to the middle of the ancient stone circle silver stood on damask tablecloths wine lay chilling in huge coolers and gilded chairs were arranged by a round table two footmen conceding nothing to the heat of the day neither wig nor livery attended close by have you seen the stones before mr keble asked henrietta as they got down from the carriage feigning not to be overly distracted by the longleat extravagance only once maam but i have read much of them they were erected by the romans were they not no i do not think so he replied that is what mr inigo jones concluded because he did not believe any people of antiquity in these islands other than the romans could have carried out such a task he was an architect of the classical school and it is therefore not surprising that that was what he conceived it to be he made a very fine drawing showing how the stone circle might have looked as a classical building but it is very circumstantial indeed almost wholly conjectural i would say what of the theory that it was a place of coronation for the danish kings suggested hervey it is remarkable that whoever has treated of this monument has bestowed on it whatever class of antiquity he was particularly fond of that is a very shrewd judgement he replied oh not my words mr hervey horace walpoles no of all theories i think the danish is the least convincing there is sufficient literary evidence to suggest it is much earlier then what do you think is the explanation of the stones sir hervey pressed well i consider that mr aubreys study is the most scholarly he suggests that the henge is a religious site of the ancient britons and their priesthood the druids ritual sacrifices said hervey i fear so but for sheep beyond the cursus and the footmen the four were quite alone sitting in the middle of the stone circle after their luncheon even with so much longleat finery it was not difficult perhaps to imagine these druids especially since john keble seemed to know so much about their religion its rites and ritual elizabeth and henrietta wished to view the circle from one of the tumuli leaving hervey and keble to the druids and a last glass of madeira when they were gone john keble interrupted his own speculation on the nature of primeval belief to ask hervey so direct a question that the latter was all but stunned mr hervey he began fixing him with a benignant expression that belied his junior years you are i perceive much troubled by your affections for lady henrietta are you uncertain of them by some chance hervey made not a sound permit me my friend but is it as i suspect that you are not able sufficiently to discern what is love and what is merely admiration do not misunderstand me mind for there is infinitely much that a man might admire in lady henrietta and love might follow as a consequence yet it seems to me after so many brutal years in spain one might be inclined to be enamoured of something merely because it stands in such contrast to the brutish hervey smiled thinly you have said merely twice sir i wish it were indeed thus john keble smiled too but warmly holy fair and wise is she the heaven such grace did lend her that she might admirèd be hervey threw his head back smiling broadly is she kind as she is fair for beauty lives with kindness love doth to her eyes repair to help him of his blindness bravo mr hervey we are two gentlemen indeed if not actually of verona but permit me to make one more observation on the matter of searching for perfection and a profound one i trust at the beginning of the gospel which bears your name the apostle sees fit to place the genealogy of our saviour and in it are the names of four women tamar rahab ruth and uriahs wife bathsheba hervey studied him intently as john kebles expression turned to one of even greater warmth tamars sins we both know of as indeed we do rahabs ruth was an alien and bathsheba was both adulteress and conniver to murder yet these women are of our lords family i commit this to your reflection mr hervey never before had hervey considered the passage in more than the driest genealogical terms but before he was able to reflect or even to make some interim acknowledgement to this man whose charity now seemed as great as his incisiveness the contemplative peace of the stone circle was broken by the return of his sister and henrietta mr keble began elizabeth my companion is tired of the sun would you hold my parasol while i sketch the stones john keble agreed readily after they were gone and after an even longer silence henrietta asked is it not perfectly horrid to imagine human sacrifice in this very place it is horrid hervey agreed somewhat abstractedly but if there were sacrifices there must surely have been weddings here too she added brightly do you not think it a perfectly wonderful idea to be wedded in such a place the stones draped with mistletoe perhaps hervey was startled i i had not thought of it was all he could manage by reply what had not thought of marriage or not of such a thing in this place surely you do not lack heart the mocking again why did she taunt him so he said what first came into his head and cursed himself as he did so are you thinking of such a place for marriage with mr styles matthew she began quietly how could you possibly have supposed that i should wish to marry hugo styles he struggled for some explanation well i that is he stammered that day in the park when you read from your novel you seemed to be suggesting suggesting what she continued softly you seemed to be suggesting that a yeomanry officer was irresistible something about regimentals and the ladies of the district or whatever i took it to mean that you referred in particular to styles he has a very handsome income at least has he not matthew she said with a smile taking no apparent offence at his actuarial recommendation have you since read pride and prejudiced no i well go and do so she laughed at least read that passage carefully when they are all at meryton the one i read aloud that day chapter six or seven i think it is more riddles why how was he to discover her meaning was it merely that a spoiled existence was to be relieved by dallying or was this sumptuousness around them another kind of riddle a sign of the gulf between them perhaps however close their childhood in that schoolroom and however close henriettas friendship with elizabeth perhaps that gulf were so wide as to be a chasm unbridgeable it was a wretched hopeless conclusion and he lapsed into unhappy silence as if then at some unheard trumpetcall serjeant armstrong who had so far dutifully stood aloof indeed unseen on the instructions of the ladys maid now appeared from between two of the sarsens and never had hervey been so pleased by his appearing for it reminded him of the promise of their return to the regiment and the promise of what relief from the necessity of confronting these other intrusions henrietta seemed equally delighted serjeant she called come here and give us your opinion in gods name thought hervey was he now to be humiliated by having his serjeant drawn into this he made to protest but serjeant we have been discussing these stones could they have had some military purpose do you think asked henrietta relief coursed through him i couldnt honestly say miss began armstrong but a circles a powerful defensive position for sure could you imagine that the circle was used for sacrificing maidens to pagan gods she asked smiling coyly and with the sure coup dœceil that had so evidently deserted hervey armstrong smiled too pausing only for an instant not if they were as bonny as you miss hervey was dumbstruck as henrietta shrieked with laughter three days later elizabeth made the shortest entry in her journal in many months august th st augustines day today matthew and his serjeant left for ireland and the house is once again silent matthew is grown to manhood yet somehow there is an innocence about him which though endearing is cause enough for concern his serjeant is a fine man however and devoted to him and i think no ill should become him while he has such a man to serve with of any expectation that we had of matthew and henrietta we must no longer speak for he showed not a moments feeling for her or rather no ability to convey any feeling if feeling there were though hers for him was plain to see chapter eight the lesson of history the cove of cork september have you ever seen the like of it thrilled hervey so taken by the prospect of corks great sheltered bay as to be oblivious to all else anything so inspiring as those headlands and the sheer size of the anchorage serjeant armstrong leaned over the weather rail and retched loudly again for gods sake mr ervey never ave i known ought like this crossing even biscay after corunna was no match for it ive been throwing up me accounts alf the night and he leaned over the side again and retched even louder strong southwesterlies had made st georges channel no place for a soldier in whom the gentlest of swells invariably induced nausea the bristol merchantman which regularly plied this route no longer in convoy now peace was returned had hove to for a night in carmarthen bay rather than risk entering the channel with st gowans head on a lee shore however by this their fourth morning the winds had backed and moderated to no more than a fresh breeze which now took them effortlessly into the great harbour at cork three menowar a firstrate and two frigates lay at anchor under the sentinel of the gun batteries on the headlands in scale no more than daisies on the lawn at horningsham and the land itself distant though it still was looked as green as legend had it do you know what day it is serjeant armstrong if you said judgement day id believe you he replied still clutching the rail for all he was worth though there was but the merest swell now it is the anniversary of the battle of worcester is that right sir armstrong sighed and what might that ave been about the civil war you must surely know of the battle of worcester after worcester the king was a fugitive and his officers too i was thinking of captain thomas hervey he came here to cork after the battle and what then he lived peaceably in dublin so i understand until the plague carried him off he had been a cavalryman with prince rupert thats right cheering mr hervey said armstrong a little colour at last returning to his face hervey continued to peer at the distant hills through the small telescope he had purchased from a french artillery officer captured at salamanca did you have any family in that war serjeant armstrong he asked seeming not to notice still armstrongs indifference to conversation i ave no more idea than adam he replied i eard tell my grandfather was a collier but further back than im i avent a notion my fathers younger brother were a tar died of fever in the indies thats all the service i know of hervey closed his telescope and looked at his serjeant standing squarely and very much the better for the sheltered waters of the cove i beg your pardon i did not mean any show by it it seemed uncommon chance that we should be sailing into cork on this day that is all no offence taken as usual sir i wonder how living in barracks shall suit us hervey continued but changing tack a novelty sure enough it might suit the guards and marines but i think i should prefer the old way armstrong replied with a shrug doubtless the horse guards would too agreed hervey but billeting in ireland is an altogether different matter it is one thing to discompose a few english farmers and innkeepers quite another to foist troops on a sullen population no there have been barracks here and fortified too since cromwell we shall have to take their measure so large was the anchorage that it took a full hour to see them berthed and it was a further hour before they reached the royal barracks armstrong was first to remark on their size larger as they were than even the guards in st jamess built not ten years before there was space for over one hundred and fifty officers and two thousand men on this day they were halfempty however only a small rearparty from the sixth occupying the cavalry quarters the rest of the regiment explained the quartermaster in charge of rear details had sailed to dublin a fortnight earlier for a review it was no use herveys trying to join them he insisted since they were expected back within the week hervey might have been glad of some breakfast but the regiments mess was closed and although he could have messed with the fusiliers the other occupants of the barracks he felt disinclined to be too sociable at such an hour instead he went to the stables to see coatess bay brought in from the harbour by one of the ostlers armstrong had already been collared for duty by the reardetails serjeantmajor ey up sir called a voice from the hayloft as he entered the otherwise deserted stables johnson clambered down the ladder to cast an eye over the new charger he looks a good un but tha wont be able to call im brandywine he said looking at the nameplate on the headstall why not because tadjutants just bought one an called im that tha should know e were at tbattle o brandywine imself hervey sighed johnson had brought him rudely back to the trying niceties of regimental life very well then you choose johnson did not hesitate arkaway you reckon he may be a derby runner laughed hervey well why not harkaway it is then what is the news otherwise johnson was always abreast of the news be it from the orderly room or from the canteen quartermaster hill has died of an ague he began oh said hervey i am right sorry a good man and an honest quartermaster ay tcanteen raised a fair sum for is widow theres a new vetinry an all how so has mr selden retired at last no e was caught in fleegranty replied johnson breezily as he got to work with the currycomb hervey looked more than a little surprised but easily the master of johnsons pronunciation what with a woman from the town no replied the groom as he continued brushing with that blackie in the band great heavens said hervey abashed i had no idea that and who do ye think the general is in these parts added johnson before hervey could elaborate on the extent of his surprise i have no idea general slade oh he groaned before checking himself in front of a subordinate and then quite forgetting himself oh that is very ill news indeed they talked for an hour or more but only when hervey said that he must go to find lodgings in the city did johnson remember that there were rooms ready for him in the mess he had a key and there was an invitation to dinner waiting there too from whom somdy from tcathedral johnson replied with a shrug and canon vereys invitation to dine the instant he arrived in cork was curiously insistent hervey would have found it hard to ignore even had he other duties to attend to johnson was therefore dispatched with a note announcing his officers arrival and intention to join him for dinner at six that evening an hour that seemed a reasonable compromise between the older and newer fashions in the absence of information as to which prevailed in cork the canonry was a more modest establishment than hervey had expected it was a fine enough house in a new terrace in deans yard but small by comparison with one in an english close canon verey himself was a tall spare and somewhat austerelooking man in his fifties a hebrew scholar and a bachelor hervey knew of the scholarship from john keble but guessed his celibacy within minutes of entering the house for its walls were lined with books in an entirely haphazard manner and lacked any sign of a feminine hand either present or past there were two other guests one was about the same age as the canon though shorter bald a little round with a ready smile and a dublin accent which hervey recognized from having heard so much of it in the peninsular army this dublin man was the chapter clerk a trinity college attorney called nugent the second guest was altogether less genial perhaps a little younger smallframed and with a full head of black hair he gave hervey a searching look as they shook hands dr obegley here is my physician when he is not at his infirmary canon verey explained proceedings before dinner were uncommonly brisk they drank but one glass of sherry apiece giving thereby the lie to herveys notion that ireland would put even his own mess to the test and then dinner was announced by the same maid who had answered the door this same girl then served them dinner itself which began with a cold but palatable soup of shellfish and potato scarcely had hervey lifted his spoon however but that dr verey began the serious business of the evening mr keble writes that you are a thinking soldier mr hervey i hope i am that sir but it is nothing remarkable a thinking soldier nothing remarkable mr hervey enquired dr obegley with the faint suggestion of a challenge in his tone i saw many in the peninsula said hervey cautiously then that is where they have all been replied the physician drily you must not mind dr obegley said nugent with a smile he has nothing against soldiers as such just english ones and indeed they do not even have to be soldiers mr hervey continued canon verey feigning not to notice the exchanges my purpose in inviting you here is to explain something of the complexities of this country you are a junior officer of that i am aware but even one officer who understands something of the country will be a beginning and it may be that you will be minded to pass on some of that understanding to your fellow officers i have little enough opportunity to do so indeed i would not in the ordinary course of events have made your acquaintance other than after morning prayer on a sunday perhaps the garrison keeps itself very much to itself except for the hunting field mr kebles introduction is therefore most felicitous hervey felt disinclined to take offence he had somehow expected to be preached at this evening and dr vereys manner though grave fell well short of being sanctimonious in any case the notion of discovering something of the country other than the received prejudices of the ascendancy engaged him not a little but therein lay an assumption surely for was not dr verey the apotheosis of that ascendancy the subdean of a cathedral of its alien church might this evening not be in spite of john kebles best intentions no more than a protracted sermon to its greater glory he sighed inwardly resigned to the ordeal but to what purpose might these other strange birds be present even after so many years in this country i have an incomplete understanding dr verey explained nugent here is a formidable historian a trinity college man obegley is too or rather he is a formidable historian but not a trinity college man no indeed i am not a trinity college man mr hervey began the doctor testily though that is neither by my own choice nor through any insufficiency of learning merely by chance of religion chance of persuasion doctor we are all of one religion surely persuasion it is then canon he replied briskly indeed i would go further and say that we are all of one faith canon this is not the night for divinity if you please obegley was becoming impatient and dr verey bowed the penal laws mr hervey he continued they are ameliorated but not gone as ye surely know and they were a damned sight more severe in my youth it was america or france to study my medicine a catholic was denied such learning here and when came i home for mercys sake i might not under penalty of said laws own a horse worth more than five pounds can you credit that mr hervey catholics were not allowed to own a horse worth more than five pounds you are a cavalryman that ought to amuse you hervey tried to imagine the military necessity of such a limitation but could not conceive of any that might be represented to the doctor with any credibility we had catholic officers in the army in spain he tried any senior ones rasped obegley justification of the penal laws was the least of his concerns however for it suddenly occurred to him that canon verey might be no more a loyal instrument of the ascendancy than was his irascible guest and if the subdean of cork were some kind of latterday nonjuror then it might be less an evening of tedium and rather more of sedition he need not have worried canon verey followed dr obegleys intemperance with an uncontentious chronology of the norman and earlier english settlements most of which was in any case vaguely familiar from his shrewsbury days but then came cromwell to the story and nugent and obegley began to relate alternately what hervey had never before heard referred to as the war of the two kings the canons method as well as his purpose was now clear obegley was to be the champion of the catholic explication and nugent of the other yet he guessed from the ease at which these three men were in each others company that there would at some stage of the evening be a reconciliation of opposing views a denouement to which he might therefore look forward keenly though he would listen intently meanwhile to the unfolding of the history a large salmon which dr verey was proud to reveal he had himself netted the day before on the kenmare came and went during the recounting of the war of the two kings as did some fine hock by the time the narrative reached the battle of the boyne the only occasion on which it seemed the two kings actually confronted each other in the field the chapter clerk and the physician had thoroughly warmed to their subject hervey had begun a tally of the grievances as soon as it had become apparent that such listings were to be made obegleys list included the ulster plantation cromwells sack of drogheda and wexford the forcible transportations to connacht and the martyrdom of oliver plunket nugents was equally compelling the massacre in ulster and tyrconnels confiscations of seemingly every bit as bloody and incomprehensible but in respect of the crucial question of where loyalties lay now hervey had received no answer nor yet could he suppose there might be one in the face of this welter of contradictory evidence a mutton pudding had also come and gone and some good burgundy candles had been lit then new ones brought in and the maid had been dismissed for the night the house martins had long since gone to their nests in the eaves and only owls and bats made any intrusion on the conversation canon verey now raised the question of loyalty which remained the question is was ireland loyal during the late war with france he insisted he did not address it directly to the doctor however rather he offered it as might a don to his seminar again hervey thought it had the ring of wellrehearsed disputation for obegley did not immediately respond leaving nugent to speak to it first have you heard of wolfe tone and the society of united irishmen mr hervey imperfectly was his prudent and honest reply well permit me to remind you and hervey was indeed reminded and at length of the strange convoluted history of that nationalist rebellion but the account was ultimately more perplexing than enlightening such it seemed was the canons intention for as if this were indeed a trinity college tutorial he now embarked on a summingup which if not exactly the denouement hervey had been anticipating in its way began to explain why these three men might share more or less amicably a table you see mr hervey it is wholly illusive to regard the troubles here as unbridled religious animosity to begin with the label catholic is as misleading as is protestant which catholics ask yourself always the normans the old english the later recusants or the native celts nor would you expect me to own that my church is protestant at least that is it is not akin to those dissenters who take it upon themselves to claim that mantle no the troubles here are at heart a conflict between an often weak and corrupt landowning class and a peasantry in for the most part abject poverty indeed it is almost a tyranny the guilt of the landlords coreligionists is largely by association only i am tarred with the same brush as the worst rackrenter simply because my faith is the same as his although i am ashamed that he should pretend to the same for indeed my church was conceived in catholicism but that is another matter and obegley here is likewise suspected by the ascendancy because he shares the declaratory faith of the most murderous whiteboy though he too would be appalled to share the altar rail with such a wretch understand this mr hervey and you may begin to serve the king wisely god bless him so scholarly and humane a summary deserved to herveys mind a respectful silence by return but he felt a greater need to make some acknowledgement to express some appreciation of the erudition prompt and unqualified endorsement he thought wanting in aptness however so there was indeed a respectful silence while the three worthy historians sipped their port eyes elsewhere but on him one more thing dr verey he enquired after several sips of his own this rackrenting what is it precisely the canon looked at the doctor who began by shaking his head put very simply mr hervey it is the greed of the landlords absentees often enough in stretching the rents to the utmost value of the land the tenant has no margin therefore either to improve his smallholding or to insure for a year when crops fail the tenancies are for the most part on short leases too and when they expire the landlord jacks up the rent again knowing the wretched tenant will agree to anything to avoid eviction the problem is not always directly with the landlord added nugent aspiring less than enthusiastically to some balance those not resident rely on agents many of whom are shorttermers and downright unscrupulous some of the tenancies are in truth sublettings too the middlemen taking the marginal yield there was another moments pause and then dr verey made a minor prophecy you will come across its worst effects soon enough mr hervey families by the roadside evicted without a thought for their wellbeing either physical or spiritual and there is no speenhamland system here they will starve without the private charity of their neighbours who will be in no condition to assist them or that of their church which has nothing they will not seek or accept ours for the most part either your own namesake lord hervey bishop of derry a distant relative i understand was assiduous in arguing the catholics case and indeed used much of his own wealth to improve their condition he is fondly remembered still in those parts but even he was able to effect only the most modest relief a very distant relative confirmed hervey and finally dr obegley added his advice and with just a suggestion of warmth it seemed to hervey you must read a novel called castle rackrent you may know of it it is full of truth indeed it should be since it recounts the events on the neighbouring estates to the authors father in county longford at the turn of the century miss maria edgeworth is the author a quite remarkable work for so young a lady she has written more lately and still it is the same i now seem to have a veritable list of lady novelists replied hervey ruefully as they rose to begin their leavetaking pulling the oillamp at his bedside closer in order to begin reading castle rackrent which dr verey had pressed on him as he had left that same evening hervey felt a sense of purpose that had been wanting since toulouse a deficiency made worse by the confusion of feelings that was his attachment for henrietta lindsay he desired keenly to understand this place a country he was already beginning to think might be as alien as spain or france but another book had been pressed on him too on leaving horningsham and he had made a promise to read it sooner rather than later he put down miss edgeworths novel and picked up miss austens instead trying to remember which passage henrietta had urged on him something about meryton chapter six or seven he opened the redleather volume and began to read though with little enthusiasm it seemed full of talk of getting a rich husband and styles was certainly that and a good deal of london of st jamess where he had observed as much that was vacuous as fine and of superior society and the like but nothing that suggested any explanation of her remarks at the henge he began chapter seven now yawning and struggling hard to keep his eyes from closing he had had little enough sleep during the crossing and miss austens was not a voice that commanded them to remain open and then he saw it there at the bottom of the first page veritably leaping from the page they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign he cursed himself for not having looked up the passage before it was no riddle why had he not seen beyond the hereandnow when first he had heard those words if henrietta lindsay were not apt to regard styles as an officer and indeed how could she it was plain to him now then the passage made perfect sense true the militia were no more or less soldiers than the yeomanry but if she likened this bingley and his large fortune to styles and his large fortune then the approving reference to an ensign for she must be wholly sensible of the difference in name only from cornet must surely mean he sprang out of bed and took the lamp to the table where johnson had laid his writingcase now was the time for resolute action his earlier uncertainty his vacillating his downright incapability the very contrary to what was in his understanding the essence of the cavalry spirit all this must be a thing of the past he must make up ground he had heard as it were hounds speak or the sound of the guns as both a sporting man and a soldier he knew he must gallop at once towards that music chapter nine beyond the pale september at am a drummer began to beat reveille in the fusiliers lines echoing around the barrack squares so as to wake even hervey in the nextdoor quarters he stretched his arms wearily in the chair where he had spent half the night his greatcloak falling from his shoulders to reveal one of the cotton shirts he had brought from the peninsula around him on the floor lay crumpled sheets of writing paper testament to his hard crosscountry ride to rejoin hounds or to reach the field of battle in front of him on the desk lay one sheet threequarters filled by his careful handwriting only two clean sheets lay in reserve when he had begun his bold dash in the early hours he had written freely expressively with some passion even but when he had read that first draft he had been unhappy with its presumption and had taken a new sheet each subsequent draft had lost a little more in candour until shortly before dawn he had settled for something not unlike a dispatch from the duke of wellingtons headquarters he had omitted any exegesis of pride and prejudice and had instead contented himself with inviting henrietta to come and hunt with him and his brother officers picking up the pen as the drummer finished with a long roll and emphatic tap he signed the letter your humble servant an hour later he was in the stables telling johnson he would take out harkaway but a hunting saddle not the hungarian he insisted and no shabracque just a sheepskin right sir said johnson in a resigned but reproving tone if tadjutant were ere though thered be words look the horse has never seen an army saddle i want to stretch his legs after the crossing and i have not the time to start fitting one now the rm would understand even if the adjutant would not but the riding master would not be able to save johnsons skin why does tha ave tride in uniform though because i think the adjutant would want me to that is why replied hervey tiring already of his grooms primness in matters of saddlery johnson was quick to recognize the hopeless circularity of the argument and shuffled off to the harness room muttering and just a snaffle no curb hervey called after him but if he thought it prudent to ride out in uniform and it was not merely the adjutants expectations which had decided it he had at least resolved that it would be undress that way he showed himself to be a soldier yet without the appearance of being on official business this had been the practice in the peninsula and was for the most part a modest guarantee of being able to ride unmolested by the provostmarshals patrols but he would go armed nevertheless after johnson had saddled up the bay therefore hervey fastened his double pistol holsters on to the saddle arch it was not easy with a hunting saddle but he managed by improvising straps through the drings meant for the breastplate he then unhitched his sword and sabretache from his swordbelt and mounted with his customary vault johnson let go the bridle and then waved him off hervey sighed to himself three months in barracks had seen no conspicuous amendment in his grooms bearing an ostler might wave off a postboy but johnson was meant to be a trooper there seemed little to be gained by reminding him of that however and formality was left instead to the fusilier sentry at the gate who presented arms briskly though quite unnecessarily since a butt salute was all a lieutenant was entitled to the map he had studied earlier that morning suggested a route to the south of the river lee along the road due west which in a days hard riding would take him to the atlantic then there would be nothing beyond but america with whom the nation was still at war but this was to be a mornings ride only a preliminary reconnaissance in order to gain some feel for the country he thought he might go as far as macroom eight leagues or so distant and if harkaway were supple enough perhaps a little beyond to catch a glimpse of the mountains dividing county cork from kerry then crossing the lee he would return to cork city along its north bank it was a fine morning it had been fine for weeks johnson had told him and the stubble fields were witness to this soon after leaving the city the road was not unduly busy but even so noone gave him so much as a second look that came as no surprise there had been a large garrison in cork for centuries and it could not have been unusual to see individual officers riding out he hoped however that soon his appearance might be rather less familiar for he wanted to see the ireland of which they had spoken the night before rather than what seemed to be just an outpost of the pale it was a disappointment therefore when after several miles of what he supposed was a road which would soon bring him to real ireland he came across a troop of artillery in the road trotting towards him at ease as if on morning exercise he saluted their captain who acknowledged it as if such a meeting were an everyday occurrence puzzled as to where they were going or where they had come from for there was no artillery in the city as he believed he trotted on another mile or so until reaching ballincollig according to his map it was a small town of no significance but curiously there was an artillery picket on the road at the town limit the gunners saluted him but the bombardier in charge said nothing allowing him to pass unremarked half a mile beyond however he was to discover the reason for the picket gunpowder mills of colossal proportions and barracks next door for an entire artillery brigade little wonder the map made no reference to them he supposed for here was a part of the nations great war machine which was better kept privy since it lay within such easy reach of a hostile landing cork was home and victualling station to the irish squadron of the channel fleet he knew well enough but this he wanted no tour of the mills however nor to dine with the artillery both of them gracious enough invitations offered the instant the picket officer saw him he wanted simply to get on that i would not advise not alone that is said the picket officer a mile or so west of here and it can be as wild as cantabria i surmise that you will know my meaning well enough hervey was encouraged much to the artillerymans dismay believe me we had a courier ambushed not five miles from here last week he had no intention of abandoning his reconnaissance however i thank you for your warning sir and i will prime my flintlocks i must see something of the country though untamed as it is but he wished he had his folding carbine and as he took his leave he resolved to have the saddler enlarge one of the holsters at the first opportunity harkaway it was soon apparent was incapable of a fiftymile march that day especially in the unexpected heat of that earlyautumn morning a couple of miles further therefore hervey turned south into the gentle hills which formed a watershed between the lee and the river bandon and reconciled himself to a pleasant country hack rather than the more purposeful reconnaissance he had intended in the event however he could not have achieved his purpose more subtly or economically had he pressed on towards macroom and beyond he would have seen the english influence gradually diminishing until had his gelding possessed the stamina in the derrynasaggart mountains he would have found the meanest hovels every bit as mean as the worst he had seen in the peninsula and they would have been as popular imagination supposed them with turf roofs filled with peatsmoke in a remote and hostile landscape beyond the frontiers of the civilized pale instead he entered a less elemental landscape though he felt it distinctly alien nevertheless within a few miles of ballincollig and thus within but a dozen miles of cork what he first noticed here in countryside which otherwise looked no more remarkable than east somerset was the absence of church towers from a hill anywhere in england especially from the parts he knew so well it would be possible to see several towers or spires but not here there was indeed a curious flatness to the landscape despite the gentle hills canon vereys history lesson ought perhaps to have alerted him to it but the physical consequences of academic history were not always easy to foresee he rode through several settlements village hardly seemed an appropriate word for them and although there were some decent stone buildings the majority were rougher consisting of timberframed daub or unshaped stones some especially those lying outside the settlements were rougher still no better than he would have seen further west there were remarkably few people about too and none working in the fields that he could see unlike the busy acres of wiltshire he freely greeted those he did come across touching his cap to the women but the most he received in reply was an expressionless nod at about midday six miles or so south and west of ballincollig according to his uncommonly accurate map he came upon the ruins of a religious house a small monastery perhaps standing isolated amid ungrazed pasture the map told him the place was kilcrea but nothing more the heat was now beginning to tell on harkaway and so he dismounted and let him drink at a stream nearby there was not a soul to be seen reinforcing the impression of isolation yet it did not look to him like a cistercian house for although the setting was characteristic of that pastoral and reclusive order the ruins themselves lacked the grandeur of cistercian buildings these had the look of a much later and smaller establishment what was more and in contrast again with all he had seen in england the building was as a whole intact the walls high and unbroken in england a monastic house would have been given or sold to some favourite by henry viii at the time of the dissolution and converted into a dwellinghouse or else its stone would long since have been carried away for other building but these remains seemed almost to have been preserved cherished even he was uncertain of his history were the monasteries dissolved here as in england at the reformation somehow these ruins had the stamp of cromwells work a more malign destruction perhaps a spoiling rather than a dismantling he pulled up harkaways head from the water the stream was cold even on so warm a day and he risked the colic he led him closer to the ruins loosening the girth and then unfastening the snaffle at the cheekpiece so that the gelding could eat some of the lush grass through the arched west entrance he could see that there were many gravestones within the walls new ones not the occasional ancient tomb of some medieval knight as in an english church he took a picket peg drove it into the ground and then tied harkaways halter rope to it leaving himself free to explore inside the walls the silence was broken only by the call of rooks in a distant coppice and by the faintest whistling of the light breeze through the broken lancets above the arch it was not difficult to imagine why this must have been was still a favoured place for the dead many of the stones were worn and their inscriptions indecipherable although they were better sheltered from the elements than in most graveyards those which were decipherable were in english he had thought some at least would be in gaelic were the gaelicspeaking poor not buried with headstones or perhaps the stonemasons art was too refined for the language was this a place reserved only for catholics of substance he sat by one headstone whose inscription was too recent to have undergone any weathering here lyeth the body of tim mccarthy of balineadig who depd this life june th aged yr also anorah his wife died nov agd years also tim their son june th aged yr god rest their souls in peace amen what he wondered had connected those two deaths in the same month of the same year had tim mccarthy his wife having predeceased him died of sorrow at losing his son had some contagion been responsible or was it more sinister could they have been killed in skirmishes with the militia surely not the old man but curiosity as to how they had come to die was only part of what intrigued him about the stone more engaging was the simple diminutive tim he felt sure he would not have seen its like in an english churchyard even if tim had been the lifelong familiar in death he would have been timothy the warmth in that cherished rendering tim mccarthy and the union in death with his spouse brought to mind genesis there was abraham buried and sarah his wife here was a special place these mccarthys were not simply of the past but of a country he did not know he felt so at peace that he might have lain down in the sun and been put to sleep by the distant cawing of the rooks and the gentle whistle of the wind had he not thought better of leaving harkaway to gorge on the rich green grass instead he left repose within the walls to the departed and put an end to his bays feasting as he refastened the bit tightened the girth and then remounted he resolved to return soon and next time he would be in no hurry to leave the walls which had once enclosed so many devout men and which now provided shelter for the last remains of so many beloved fathers mothers children half a mile on down the road though track might have been a more apt description he crested a small hill to see a plume of black smoke rising over a settlement a few hundred yards ahead it would have been nothing unusual perhaps except that even at this distance he could hear shouting his first instinct was to gallop there for it was his duty to go to the aid of authority in a disturbance and that was what he surmised to be the cause of the shouting but he did not know the country or its ways and so he decided on a more circumspect approach he checked that his flintlocks were still properly primed and then put harkaway into a steady canter across the heath rather than spurring him to a gallop down the road and made a wide halfcircle left towards a clump of trees just short of the settlement from here he would be able to observe unseen and if necessary approach the settlement on foot using the cover of the gorse which dotted the heath he had just tied his gelding to a tree and taken his telescope from its holster when out of the village burst like phoebus a horse hitched to a blazing waggon at first hervey thought this to be a consequence of the tumult but then as more and more villagers rushed from the settlement shouting he realized that this alone was the cause of the disturbance straight away he untied the reins sprang into the saddle and wheeled round to give chase a bolting horse terrified by blazing hay which stays with him no matter how fast he gallops has a prodigious turn of speed and endurance even taking account of his cobby make and the load he pulls and it was all that hervey could do to press an already tired harkaway into a gallop fast enough to begin making ground it was three hundred perhaps even four hundred yards before he was able to close with the deranged animal but his difficulties had only thus begun as harkaway himself began shying at the blazing hay hervey used all the leg he could to press his gelding closer to the other horse and even drew his sword to lay behind the girth yet it was only after several attempts to lean out during one of which they almost fell as harkaway missed his footing that he was at last able to seize hold of the bridle with all his weight now braced in the stirrups he heaved on it for all he was worth but still he could not get the cob to pull up in desperation he was about to leap on to the runaways back to try to clap his hands over its eyes something he had known to bring even an artillery team to a halt when he saw the river ahead and the ford with its entry and exit cut into steep banks hervey would never know whether he steered them into the ford or whether that was the way the runaway had determined on but they plunged in and he now dropped his reins to pull on the cobs bridle with both hands trusting to his legs alone to turn harkaway sharply up against the bank downstream of the exit a bold gamble on a wellschooled horse let alone a green one as he had further gambled the bank was too steep to jump though the runaway attempted to rearing between the shafts as burning hay fell around but all forward movement had now ceased and hervey sprang from the saddle in order to separate cob from cart holding on desperately to its reins he used his sword to slice through the straps which held the yoke in place as he cut through the last one he let the reins go and the stillterrified animal lunged from the shafts leaped the bank and bolted again hervey cursed furiously and though he had burned his hands he vaulted back into the saddle his bay having stood quite still throughout not ten yards away drinking from the stream and took off again after the runaway for a common horse it would give a blood a good run over this distance he rued and it took him another halfmile to catch it and bring it to a halt they trotted back to the village in a lather each exhausted they gave the waggon a wide berth for all its timbers were now fiercely ablaze and were met at the edge of the settlement by the crowd of villagers who had alerted him to the distress and who had then watched his dramatic intervention they were barefooted and looked pulled down but more than that they were silent and unsmiling one old man though how old it was difficult to tell in thick tweed trousers and rough flannel shirt stepped forward to take what was left of the runaways reins buíochas le dia go raibh míle maith agat a nasail the words meant nothing to hervey but the sense was clear enough he had little idea how much the villagers had seen but the return of the horse was probably cause enough for gratitude whether or not its value was less than obegleys five pounds as he dismounted those nearest stepped back the reason for which he could not judge mere apprehensiveness he suspected his overalls were thoroughly soaked and his face was black but it was the backs of his hands beginning to blister that were the object of the older mans attention are ye by yerself sor for a moment he hesitated wondering whether to draw his sword i mean sor them hands theyll be needing seeing to an old woman black shawl over her head in spite of the heat of the afternoon stepped forward and took hold of one of them examining the burns tar liomsa nóimead she said beckoning him through the crowd which parted to let her lead him and harkaway towards one of the turfroofed cottages she motioned him to enter and he had but an instant to decide whether or not to risk handing over harkaway pistols and all to the boy who had followed them it was said his instincts a moment for trust the old man came in after him fior cinn fáilte he said quietly with a bow of the head indicating a chair near a window which with the door was the sole source of light for the room my father says you are welcome hervey looked round to see a much younger woman little more than a girl standing in the doorway her hair was copperred and as thick as a blackthorn bush even in the poor light he could see that her looks and complexion would have been the envy of many a fashionable in st jamess caithlin where is the balsam in the stone jar beside the yeast mother ill get it replied the girl turning to hervey she smiled you see we speak english perfectly well it is by choice that we speak gaeilge though the old woman relinquished the task to her daughter and sat down in a chair near the smoking fire to stir a pot simmering away gently hervey now felt it time to say something anything for here seemed the very opportunity he had been seeking i am lieutenant hervey of the sixth light dragoons in cork he offered and i am michael omahoney sor and right grateful for saving my horse this is my wife brigid and my daughter caithlin caithlin omahoney now crouching at herveys side and smoothing the balsam on his hands looked up and smiled again hers were the only native smiles he had seen since leaving cork but such smiles they were warm open full and free in such contrast to the sullenness of the rest of the village they did more to soothe the pain in his hands than the balsam he almost sighed with the ease but suddenly the dim light by which she worked failed and he turned to see two men filling the doorway as completely as if the door itself had been closed he braced himself ready to spring up with his sabre only when the two moved into the cottage and the light from the window fell on them did he see that they were unarmed young men in their twenties and with the same thick copperred hair as caithlin omahoney she seemed unperturbed by the scowls on their faces her own smile scarcely diminished fineen conor the old woman began roughly say welcome to this officer he has saved finbarre and burned himself in the bargain they muttered a passable greeting the scowls remaining but redirected at their sister these are my sons sor explained the old man two of them anyway good day hervey said i am sorry i cannot offer my hand as you can see neither son responded leaving the cottage instead without a word forgive the boys manners sor said the old man discomposed by their exit sure theyre mad with themselves that it had to be an outsider who came to your aid father and an englishman at that everything that happens passes them by i wonder they dont go to america as theyre always vowing to we are at war with america miss hervey had said before realizing that we might not have been the word the omahoneys would have used the old man sighed will the english fight everybody then ireland is a peaceable enough place theres no cause for fighting he said handing a cup to hervey now that caithlin omahoney had finished with the balsam sláinte he said raising his own sláinte replied hervey the word was familiar enough from many nights in the peninsula with highlanders he took a sip and knew immediately what it was the old man winked and hervey laughed the regiment had returned from dublin a week later and after one night in cork the squadrons had dispersed to their outstations one troop each at mallow bandon tallow and gort and three in limerick plus smaller detachments in places like skibbereen leaving one troop and headquarters in cork itself the best part of munster was thereby covered by light mobile reinforcements able to support the garrisons of infantry in the major towns though what threat the native irish were from his perception of their condition at kilcrea hervey could scarcely imagine his own troop remained in cork but his initial disappointment at not being sent further west all but disappeared when some weeks later captain lankester took three months home leave giving him temporary command i hear you have been riding the countryside lankester had said to him when handing over and to herveys reply his troop leader had fixed his gaze and added accusingly t hope you have not started developing romantic notions about this place it will be so much the harder when you have to draw your sword stay detached mr hervey lankester was by herveys own reckoning the most humane of officers and such an injunction might have given him cause for thought but since he would admit not the slightest fanciful attachment to the country there was to his mind no cause it was true that he had been back to the ruins at kilcrea he had learned that it was an old franciscan house father ogavan the priest whom he had met on his second visit to the village had taken him there one afternoon hervey had been to kilcrea village several times in fact and he had begun to learn something of both the language and the people he had come to know the omahoney sons not as fineen and conor but as finghin and conchobhar and not as omahoney but o mathghamhan was this not all useful intelligence if not of direct then at least of indirect value to the authorities caithlin was a good teacher and had already given him a rudimentary understanding of the language he learned too that the brothers were married with smallholdings of their own in kilcrea tenants in their own right too young to have been with tones united irishmen hervey had little doubt that they would have been if given the chance neither of them could read or write unlike their sister and though they tolerated his presence whenever he came to the village they would not welcome him caithlins father on the other hand had grown positively to relish his visits and he and hervey had drunk many cups of poteen together preceded always by the wink but lankester had nothing to concern himself about hervey had assured him lord george irvine now quite recovered from his wound had remained the while in dublin where he filled in a temporary capacity it was understood the appointment of commanderinchiefs military secretary command of the regiment had once more devolved on joseph edmonds who had elected to leave his wife and daughters in norwich the speculation in the mess was that gentlemanly lodgings in cork were beyond his means by convention as commanding officer he ought to have quitted his rooms in the mess and taken even the smallest bachelor establishment in the city at first he had shown some interest in the apartments being constructed in the old fort at huggartsland amid the market gardens on the western edge of the city but instead he had remained in the barracks to the increasing discomfort of the few other officers with whom he shared the mess hervey enjoyed his company there more than most but soon he too had reason for disappointment that edmonds had not set up a family establishment in the city though this was less to do with the majors irascibility and more because he had received a reply from henrietta and his sister to say that they were accepting his invitation to visit where therefore would he accommodate them at least without a hefty bill lady george was in dublin with her husband so there was no other regimental lady with whom his guests might stay but then by a following post came another letter from longleat to say that she and elizabeth would stay at lismore the home of the cavendish family lismore was over thirty miles away but since there was a troop at tallow nearby he thought it a good enough plan not that he knew the cavendishes in the least except by reputation november could be an inhospitable month michael omahoney had told him but it could also provide the best hunting and he concluded that it would be good that they should have such comfortable lodgings and in so advantageous a place from which to follow hounds the last of the summer was soon gone and the first cold mornings of autumn brought mists over the city and the countryside the fields were now empty of crops as well as of labourers the late wheat and barley having been cut and the potatoes on the smallholdings dug through such a mist one morning hervey rode over to kilcrea for another of father ogavans discourses on the history of monastic ireland he expected that caithlin would also be there as she had been hitherto she seemed to have more appetite for learning than the whole of the village the result no doubt of the priests faithful instruction despite there being no obvious purpose to which it might ever be put hervey had even found his greek which was better than the priests being for once sought after he had come to know the byways well and could find his way to kilcrea without passing through any settlement larger than a dozen dwellings that morning with the mist shrouding everything he reached there without seeing a soul the village itself seemed deserted except for another mounted figure in the main street a rare enough sight a second man then joined the other his horse in a lather as hervey got closer he saw and heard that they were angry good morning captain said the younger of the two though twice herveys age at least a solidlooking man riding an equally solid irongrey he wore a green coat and top hat which he lifted the other man had the look of a bareknuckle fighter and remained silent good morning gentlemen replied hervey touching the peak of his forage cap but i am a lieutenant not captain he added cautiously for there was something about these two what brings you here lieutenant the man asked cheerily enough visiting friends he replied the mans eyes narrowed then you must be well out of your way shall we point you back to the high road no thank you this is kilcrea is it not at that moment caithlin omahoney emerged from a cottage with father ogavan she smiled the same warm smile that greeted him each time he came ah lieutenant now i see your purpose here right enough you find the cork ladies less obliging leered the younger man but yell find it hard to crack her pipkin with the priest forever around laughed the older one caithlin looked away father ogavans face went red with anger and herveys sabre flashed from its scabbard the point reaching the mans throat in an instant for gods sake man take that sword away he gasped the colour draining from his florid face with the speed that herveys sabre had reached it his accomplices horse nearly threw its rider in the commotion giving him a convenient pretext not to intervene you will apologize to this lady for that slur and to the father here for saying as much in front of him the apologies came at once though the man almost choked on the words hervey shouldered his sabre and the two galloped out of the village with the vilest threats and curses i do not like violence mr hervey but heaven knows it is a fine tool in good hands said the priest caithlin looked him full in the eye i thank you sir he and his like consider they have rights over any village girl you have come on a sad day to say the very least added the priest mother olong in there indicating the cottage from which they had just emerged hasnt but a few hours for this world and those two have been serving eviction notices on the village and this a village of english tenants too the man you berated was the agent fitzgerald hervey dismounted english tenants i do not understand father oh it is an expression we have it means the tenants pay their rents on the day they are due as they do in england do they not on some estates there are arrears and duty work and lord knows what else besides but this is a regular english village and the agent has no right to serve notice in that way in which case father why does the landlord want to evict you would have to go to london to ask him that i think said caithlin with a rare note of resentment his agent the man you all but sabred she continued though with less edge has had the notion for years that this valley would be more profitable if the cottages were cleared and sheep run over it sheep replied hervey incredulously but there are farmers in england selling their sheep for all they are worth anticipating that wool prices will fall now that peace has come clearing this valley for sheep is no economy whatever im sure its no better in gods eyes either mr hervey added father ogavan but the landlord seems set on improvement and that is that when the tenancies run out there is nothing in law to stop him how long is your fathers tenancy caithlin hervey asked twelve months the same as everyone elses here it expires in the new year it will be so much the harder when you have to draw your sword stay detached all the way back to cork lankesters words troubled him he had drawn his sword sooner than he had imagined and against an agent of the ascendancy rather than a malcontent it might have been well if lankester had been at hand when he reached the barracks but he was not and edmondss was instead a counsel of equivocation the major echoed the captains warning but in terms which expressed little but contempt for the likes of the kilcrea agent and more he appeared to encourage hervey to maintain his links with the omahoneys they needed early intelligence of unrest and so it was that in the early hours of the following morning having lain awake since turning in after watchsetting there occurred to hervey a prudent alternative to strife at kilcrea he would write to the landlord in england stating baldly his doubts as to the agents integrity the dubious economy of running sheep and the benefits as they had been explained by dr obegley of bigger smallholdings on longer tenancy agreements the letter took him a full two hours to compose and he sent it the next morning without reference to edmonds nor indeed to anyone soldier he might be but that did not in his estimation preclude his expressing a view on matters other than soldiering indeed had not that been dr vereys premiss that the need for military aid to the civil power might be obviated by a better understanding of the country a month passed without his venturing south or west of the city for the tallow troop was hardpressed mounting smugglerpatrols around youghal and herveys troop had been sent to assist them it had been a relief in one respect for having sent the letter there was little that would be served by his presence in kilcrea it had been a profitable relief too for the troop had won a revenue bounty for apprehending alive six bretons and taking their luggerful of calvados though one or two casks had been unaccountably written off in the process but if there had been nothing to be directly served by his visiting kilcrea he found himself nevertheless strangely fretful for want of the company of both father ogavan and caithlin and the books which he had asked john keble to send for her a lexicon chapmans homer and a greek new testament lay unopened in his room in corks barracks with the arrival at youghal of additional excise men the troop returned to cork on the eve of the anniversary of trafalgar in the expectation of celebrating that providential victory the next day but edmonds warned them instead to be ready at six the following morning to ride to ballinhassig to assist the bench in serving writs in heavens name sir hervey protested writs on whom and why the whole troop because a troop is what the justices have requested and since the chairman of the bench of magistrates hereabouts is on close acquaintance with general slade so he informs me i see no reason to demur stand down whom you please but not fewer than fifty men to ballinhassig whom are the writs to be served on i do not know and i do not care and nor should you with luck they will be served on idle beggars whod sooner shoot as look at you in all probability though theyll be served on decent godfearing souls who are in some evil renttrap but there is nothing that you or i can do about it and it will be as well that you start out there tomorrow morning thinking thus this is not the time for walking spanish matthew later that evening hervey sat alone in his room there was no certainty that the evictions would touch on any at kilcrea indeed as he understood it kilcrea was under the jurisdiction of ballincollig but the possibility was enough to disquiet him and there was not a soul in whom he might confide his misgivings edmonds had said his piece there was not another officer of the sixth within forty miles and even canon verey was away in dublin he might with advantage have engaged the wisdom of serjeant strange but his principles would not permit him to unburden himself on the very man in whom he would have to place so much trust the next day and as for armstrong but at least he might engage himself in some purposeful activity so in the absence of any troop officers he passed his instructions direct to strange again acting as troop serjeantmajor muster in marching order at five fortyfive then were his last words at evening stables before retiring to his rooms to write to horningsham and to oxford by the time he began putting pen to paper his uncertainties had become a ghastly premonition if not kilcrea then it would be somewhere somewhere that conscience and duty would confront each other or rather duty would confront duty for which might be the truer duty to the civil power or to simple justice he knew well enough that justice was not always the same as the law how might he neatly render unto caesar to john keble he wrote his thoughts freely and without reserve to elizabeth he penned but a précis of the difficulties in the abstract which the military faced in aid of the civil power and to henrietta he wrote of the country and the people a letter which to his mind would tell nothing of his turmoil though to a reader of her percipience the intensity of his prose could tell nothing other when at length he finished the letters near to midnight he found that though his limbs were weary his mind raced and the notion of retiring to bed was impossible and so he took castle rackrent from his writingdesk where it had lain unopened since he had brought it from canon vereys and turned to its preface he began reading with no great enthusiasm hoping merely for some distraction from his concerns for the morrow but in this respect it was a lamentable choice to those who are totally unacquainted with ireland the following memoirs will perhaps be scarcely intelligible or probably they may appear perfectly incredible he read and he wondered how acquainted with ireland he had a right to claim when ireland loses her identity by an union with great britain she will look back with a smile of goodhumoured complacency on her former existence he read it a second time scarcely believing what he had read the first but that was indeed what it said now miss edgeworth he would be the first to own possessed an immeasurably greater acquaintance with the country than did he but goodhumoured complacency in the circumstances it seemed a most singular proposition he put down the book with a sigh perhaps it was to be as the author warned scarcely intelligible he turned instead to sister marias vademecum it too had lain at his bedside scarcely opened the very sight of it a daily challenge to his conscience the hand its upright strokes and perfect loops a credit to any medieval scriptorium reminded him at once of the few days peace of mind he had found in her company at the magdalen convent choose a passage of a devotional nature and read it before retiring select not more than three elements within it on which to meditate on waking recall the subject and after short preparatory prayers perhaps including an act of contrition compose thyself by three preludes for the body of the meditation he could not but admire the economy of her english prelude one recall the elements two compose in thy minds eye the place with thine own self a part of it third pray for grace he grew drowsy of the body of meditation itself he could read no more and turning out the oillamp he closed his eyes and prayed for sleep yet as if st ignatius spoke to him direct through the pages of sister marias book he could only ponder on miss edgeworths proposition and whether it might indeed be flawed fatally flawed chapter ten in aid of the civil power trafalgar day it was raining hard as fifty men of a troop in their dark blue cloaks oilskin covers over shakos and carbine locks bound with cloth formed up in the chill darkness the horses were restless they would put up with most things but they did not like rain in the dim glow of the oillamps around the parade square they could be seen backing and fidgeting bringing curses for their hapless riders from ncos trying to keep the three ranks straight private johnson had brought nero to the front of the officers mess and hervey had mounted as the barracks clock struck the threequarter hour within the minute he was exchanging salutes with serjeant strange on the square it was no morning for excessive formalities subdivisions to the left turn he ordered immediately then walkmarch and without further ceremony except for the orderly trumpeter sounding them out they marched from the royal barracks south and west to ballinhassig it took little but an hour to cover the six miles and throughout hervey said not a word instead turning over and over in his mind castle rackrents proposition ireland will look back with a smile of goodhumoured complacency he wished profoundly that he had studied sister marias vade mecum with more application for he sorely felt the need of its method in weighing this notion he knew he had to do whatever he judged right that indeed was ever the duty of an officer but where would right be this morning and how might he know with the law the magistrate would he supposed be a reliable enough guide in matters of statute with expediency again the magistrate as representative of the civil power of government might be expected to be the best judge of that would it be with justice in this however there could be no higher judge than conscience there was no counsel but his own and he could confide now only in more prayer for strength and the wisdom to do his duty trafalgar day nelson himself must have prayed at this very hour nine years before it was still raining when the troop made its rendezvous with the chairman of the bench who was sheltering in a mean little inn near the edge of town it was not many minutes before hervey learned the worst that they were to serve immediate eviction warrants on two dozen of sir dearnley lamberts tenants in kilcrea the magistrate a nervous man in his fifties whose shape suggested he had never known the want of four square meals a day would give no indication as to how he intended to proceed with the evictions all he would say was that they must first meet the agent and his crowbar brigade as they trotted north up the rutted and uneven road to kilcrea with the first streaks of daylight to help them hervey learned the reason for the ballinhassig magistrates jurisdiction sir dearnley lamberts estates extended both north and south of that town and were treated therefore as an entity this he considered was a faintly reassuring punctilio he had at first assumed that it must be because the agent found the ballinhassig justices more compliant than those from ballincollig however when eventually they made the rendezvous with the agent hervey became uneasy again for though fitzgerald must have recognized him he made no sign of it speaking instead and pointedly so only to the magistrate it was proper enough in one respect for only the magistrate had the power to summon the assistance of the military and if the agents aloofness were uncivil then so be it hervey had hoped never even to see the man again but it did not bode well twenty yards away in a huddle under the trees trying to shelter from the rain which still beat down in the grey dawn was a gang of some two dozen men with crowbars and sledgehammers just beyond them was a curiouslooking waggon with all manner of pulleys and levers yoked to two sturdy draughthorses what do you think is the purpose of that contraption serjeant strange im no engineer sir but pound to a penny its not for construction i was afraid so he sighed father ogavan appeared striding towards them in a great black cloak his broadbrimmed hat taking a lashing from the sheets of rain the crowbar brigade shuffled uncomfortably as he passed and those with hats removed them so much for catholic fellowship thought hervey the magistrate raised his hat too though perfunctorily and hervey saluted but the agent sat impassively astride his big grey good morning mr gould what will your intentions be this day asked the priest good morning father ogavan twentytwo tenants have been served notice to quit by sir dearnleys agent and they have failed to comply i have immediate eviction warrants and they will be evicted forthwith peaceably i hope but forcibly if necessary now mr gould you know very well they have nowhere to go the landlord has forbidden any of his other tenants to take them in will you have them sleep and starve in the ditches the magistrate looked about awkwardly but not the agent who was eager to begin his business your advice would have been better directed to the tenants before now father ogavan said fitzgerald defiantly theyve had ample warning to quit the estate mr hervey began the priest if these evictions are to proceed then we must at all costs avoid bloodshed i hope your men will show restraint do you know this officer father asked the magistrate with some surprise indeed i do he is a good friend of the village gould looked uneasy again as hervey began to speak father my men will show every restraint but i am obliged by law as you know to assist the magistrate if called on to do so i am afraid that all have barricaded themselves in their cottages mr gould explained father ogavan i have tried already to tell them that such resistance is futile but i have to say that with nowhere else to go they believe they have no option but to resist the evictions come on come on gould lets be about it snapped fitzgerald very well stammered the magistrate lets be about it mr hervey please dispose your men so as to protect the agent and his men as they do their duty hervey would have liked to debate the notion of duty with him but instead he began disposing the troop as the magistrate had requested the first cottage to receive the crowbar brigades attention was easy prey a violent assault on the boarded window and barred door gained them rapid entry followed by the ejection of the occupants a man and his wife no older than hervey and their five children the eldest a girl of about eight clutched a crucifix in the way that horningsham girls clutched their dolls as they stood hunched in the downpour with as desolate a look as ever hervey had seen the man mouthed some plea or other to the agent whereupon one of the foremen stepped forward and struck him on the back of the neck with his blackthorn felling him headdown in the mud herveys blood rose at once he spurred nero forward drew his sabre and sent the foreman sprawling with the flat of it before anyone could say a word how close the man had come to feeling its edge he would never know youre too damned quick to draw that sword mister its an abuse of government property the agent bellowed i should have been as happy to use my bare fists but i would have done him more harm and the sword is my own hervey rasped and turning to the magistrate he issued his own warning mr gould i am obliged to follow your instructions but i will not stand by and witness an assault i think the officer may be correct in law mr fitzgerald that was an unwise thing for your man to do replied the magistrate hesitantly hervey meanwhile had dismounted and followed by strange and armstrong began to help the evicted man to his feet the rest of the family were crying and shaking hervey took off his cloak and put it round the three younger children and stranges and armstrongs cloaks covered the remaining two and their mother in gods name will yer look at that exclaimed the agent with so much contempt that magistrate gould shifted awkwardly in the saddle again and he defiantly beckoned forward the wheeled contraption its purpose was quickly revealed and its work did not take long two hooks on the ends of ropes were thrown on to the roof a man clambered up and fixed each to a coign stone the ropes were tensioned by the pulleys and then in three strides of the draughthorses the upper walls were pulled in and the roof collapsed the crowbar brigade set to work and within a quarter of an hour the cottage was no more the troop watched in silence only armstrong giving voice to his feelings thiss no way to treat a dog not even the coalowners stooped to this hold your peace serjeant armstrong said strange mellow suffolk again hervey would need every ounce of composure before the day was out the next cottage proved an altogether more stubborn proposition hervey knew well enough that it was fineen omahoneys and that he would not walk out meekly as the others had the door and window were firmly barricaded and the crowbar men could make no impression put the hooks on the roof then if they wont come out well carry em out the agent called to his foreman dont be a fool man shouted hervey theres a family in there for pitys sake then hes the reckless one for not coming out snapped fitzgerald get them hooks on even above the noise of the rain and the crowbar mens hubbub fineen omahoneys voice could be heard shouting in a manner at once both pleading and defiant ive a sick wife and mo pháistí in here and a sister for mercys sake leave us a sister omahoney had but one herveys stomach tightened that caithlin was there put paid to his hope that the omahoneys might be brought out without a fight for he had intended bringing her from her fathers cottage to try to persuade her brother to quit and while the eviction of the first family had been hard enough to bear they were at least strangers to him caithlins presence changed everything mr gould it cannot be lawful to pull a roof down on the heads of a family he shouted fitzgerald glowered at the magistrate who dithered it was the due process of law he replied but go easy with the roof he called to the agent as if the idea were even practicable no shouted hervey you will not touch that roof tell me mr hervey what then happened as a consequence of your altercation with the agent matthew herveys sodden uniform clung to him tighter by the minute the big fire in major edmondss office had begun to dry the front of his overalls so long had he been standing at attention recounting the events at kilcrea and he struggled hard not to shiver lest it gave his commanding officer the wrong impression i told serjeant armstrong to escort the crowbar brigade clear of the village sir and serjeant strange to dispose the remainder of the troop to prevent their return and what did the magistrate then say he kept ordering me to desist but i repeated several times that i would not be a party to injuring women and children whatever his orders were sir were those lawful orders do you consider with respect sir i am not a lawyer no mr hervey indeed you are not and if you cannot be sure that they were unlawful orders you had no business disobeying them i could not be sure that they were lawful sir and in that case i should have thought it reckless to conform especially since there was no threat to life in disobeying whereas just the contrary was true that is veritably a moot point it does not pass muster with me and i doubt it would in court are you sure that your friendship with these people did not cloud your judgement i do not believe so sir it would have mattered not to me who was inside that cottage joseph edmonds sighed and then swore to himself mr hervey why are we stationed here in cork hervey continued to look directly ahead in aid of the civil power sir just so and on what duty in the general sense were you engaged this morning aid to the civil power sir so mr hervey by your own admission you have failed to do your particular duty and in that failure you have set yourself not only against military authority but against the civil as well hervey assumed the judgement to be rhetorical answer me mr hervey barked edmonds sir that is as mr gould and mr fitzgerald would see it edmonds sighed again in heavens name mr hervey i doubt you will find anyone who sees it any differently this is not merrie england we are beyond the pale the arseend of the realm who do you suppose is in the slightest degree interested in the niceties of conscience when theres rebellion lurking in every hedgerow hervey remained silent edmonds picked up several sheets of paper on his desk and held them out towards him do you know what this represents he demanded never have i seen a deposition from a magistrate written so fast it is a declaration of intent an example to be made exemplary punishment and all that hervey shivered and was angry that he did so do you have anything more to say at this juncture asked edmonds shaking his head no sir replied hervey calmly very well said the major now equally composed you will hand your sword to the adjutant forthwith and retire to your quarters on parole and there i suggest you render your entire account in writing hervey unfastened the two beltloops from the drings on his scabbard and held out his sabre the adjutant took it and acknowledged with a brisk bow and then hervey turned smartly to his right saluted and left the orderly room events have a strange habit of repeating themselves said the adjutant when the door was closed edmondss brow furrowed you and i should have done the same at least i hope we should besides all else the surest way to provoke trouble here is to become embroiled in the dirty business of absentee landlords however the law as it stands is unequivocal i shall forward a report to general slade but i do not suppose that the great man will have gained one ounce in sagacity since his translation here i very much fear that this will make the incident at toulouse seem a teafight that night hervey wrote one letter to oxford my dear keble it began and after confirmation of the concerns of his letter of the night before and of the events since t fear that i am finished but i believe i have done my duty to these people and indeed to the king for they are his loyal enough subjects if chance they be given the law which should equally be their defender seems only to be the instrument of driving them to rebellion chapter eleven a noble peer county waterford november lismore castle set high on a crag over the river blackwater had nothing of the elegance of longleat but that was not its original purpose william cavendish the same age as hervey and recently succeeded to the dukedom of devonshire had spent most of the crossing from bristol explaining just this to henrietta and elizabeth together with his plans for embellishing the castle now that peace had come to europe and circumstances in ireland were more settled an ancestor by marriage richard boyle first earl of cork had built lismore in the seventeenth century to withstand attack and while the duke explained the earl had laid out some fine gardens with yew hedges and topiary and woodland trails of rhododendrons it was not yet a place of gentlemanly leisure a steam barge a novelty to both women had brought them up the blackwater from youghal to where a brig had ferried them from the cove of cork and a carriage had taken them the remaining halfmile to the castle here they had expected to find matthew hervey but instead they found letters addressed in his hand that to the duke was formal and brief explaining that military duty had detained him and that he thought it unlikely that he would be able to accept the invitation to stay at lismore those for elizabeth and henrietta were longer and except in a few intimate details each said the same both women felt the contents needed to be brought to the dukes attention immediately william began henrietta in perfect calmness but with an edge he had not seen in her before matthew is in arrest you may read the details for yourself but it seems that he has refused to obey the instructions of a magistrate and is to face a court martial by that odious man general slade let me first read of the exact circumstances said the duke sceptically but why do you describe this general as odious do you know him not other than by reputation but matthew has told me of the animosity that there was between the two of them in france and i enquired of someone who is acquainted with the horse guards and they affirm that the general is not thought well of in london so they send him to ireland he smiled duke i believe this is very serious elizabeth interrupted in france matthew was placed in arrest by this general who believed he had abandoned his post which of course he had not matthew was later congratulated for his conduct by lord wellington and this caused bad feeling on general slades part there was also some trouble over a serjeant whom matthew stood up for against the same general i fear that whatever the rights or wrongs of the case this general will be seeking retribution for the earlier affront forgive me miss hervey but does your brother have an habitual difficulty with authority he seems to have had a remarkable share of tribulation for so junior an officer henrietta motioned elizabeth to say nothing william he is a very fine officer everyone will tell you so but he is no yes man and when he believes something to be wrong he will say so i want you to go to cork today and do all you can to have him released from custody today but we are only just arrived yes today now insisted henrietta and i shall come with you and i said elizabeth and nothing that william devonshire said could persuade either woman that accompanying him would do no good only the most explicit threat that he would refuse to leave until the morning finally induced them to relent and against all his better judgement he left lismore for cork a journey by road of some fifty miles before noon was out the arrival in ireland of a descendant of richard boyle even so distant a one was already cause for remark in cork the two centuries that had passed since his ancestor had landed in these parts almost penniless to become within an uncommonly short time one of the richest men in the realm had done little to dull the reputation of the first earl and whether the reputation were admired or reviled william devonshire now sought to use it well duke began edmonds who knew nothing of the boyle connection but enough about the cavendishes i can assure you that we are not being idle in the matter he is being advised by a local attorney in whom he we have great confidence a mr nugent who is also the chapter clerk here and an acquaintance of his i will not hesitate to bring a man from dublin though or london if necessary do you wish to meet them they are conferring at this moment here in the mess mr hervey is confined to the barracks themselves you understand the duke did indeed wish to meet them and when he had heard what the attorney had to say he was not entirely discouraged well your grace nugent had begun the law is not quite so precise in these matters as many seem to believe and i include magistrate gould and general slade in that category it is without question the absolute duty of an officer summoned by a magistrate to do all in his power to prevent a breach of the peace or to restore it the means by which he disposes his forces is however his business and his alone he can neither be ordered to do something which in his judgement is militarily unsound nor for that matter can he relinquish his duty in this respect to the magistrate whatever indemnities he is promised he is answerable for that judgement in respect of any breach of the civil law to the civil courts but in respect of his military judgement he is answerable only before an appropriate military authority do i make myself clear your grace indeed perfectly clear mr nugent but as i understand it there was no difference with the magistrate over military matters it was rather more fundamental was it not so it might seem i wanted however to lay out the relative positions of the civil and military with respect to this frequently misunderstood point you have also if i may say so mr nugent laid out a remarkable knowledge of the law relating to these matters for someone whose work is with ecclesiastical business said the duke approvingly that is because sir i have studied the history of this country from a legal aspect you would be surprised by how many grounds for appeal there are in an average parish hereabouts we will not pursue that replied the duke with a further smile so let us return to the question at hand you will recall that i said the military have a duty in the maintenance of the peace this does not extend however to enforcing the law as such except where not to do so would lead to a breach of the peace so mr herveys troop at kilcrea were not there to assist with the evictions but to prevent attack on the agent and his men proceeding about their lawful business but any magistrate knows that began the duke and hervey here refused even to allow them to go about their business not so the first tenants were evicted without incident insisted nugent except that one of the crowbar men struck the tenant for no reason and mr hervey struck the man in return countered the duke that i believe would be most unlikely to result in charges against the officer a blow for a blow is what it amounts to and indeed it could be argued that the action was anticipatory there being good reason to suppose that the assault might continue no the significance of the foremans assault is its indication of a predisposition to violence on the part of the agents men a factor of which mr hervey would take account in forming his judgement in all it seems to me that the evidence would suggest that mr hervey was at the outset perfectly prepared to carry out his duty in respect of the evictions indeed the evidence of the parish priest would corroborate this mr hervey said as much to him then how will you account for his subsequent obstruction of the eviction process asked the duke doubtfully the agent gave an unlawful instruction to his men to collapse the second cottage on the heads of the occupants the agent himself was thus about to precipitate a breach of the peace even perhaps an unlawful killing his men were already shown to be violent and the magistrate took no steps to restrain them as i said mr hervey had an absolute duty to act at that moment in the same way that he would have had a duty to ignore an unlawful order from the magistrate it is the very devil of a position for an officer to be in your grace damned if he does and damned if he does not silence followed as william devonshire contemplated the import of what the attorney had said there is therefore only one question mr nugent he suggested eventually this is clearly your interpretation of the law will it be that of others will it come to trial the attorney raised his eyebrows and sighed your grace that question is of the essence the fact is that in the case of military aid to the civil power there has been much confusion you are too young to remember the gordon riots i was in london at the time the riots could have been nipped in the bud if everyone had not laboured under the misapprehension that in law the riot act had to have been read and therefore the riot to have begun before the magistrates could call upon the military after the riots there was a great deal of legal argument but alas there were few firm rulings the best interpretation ironically though alas it has no force of law was that given by the archbishop of york in the house of lords here it is declared nugent with a flourish holding open a large bound volume it will form the centrepiece of my submission the archbishop declares that a fatal error prevailed among the military that they could not in any case act without the orders of a civil magistrate which is the case when a great mob has assembled but has not yet proceeded to acts of violence but when they have begun to commit felonies any subject and the military among the rest is justified in common law in using all methods to prevent illegal acts that seems clear enough replied the duke who will make the ruling in this case it would be argued in front of a judge advocate at a court martial the facts themselves are not in any material dispute the judgment would turn on whether or not collapsing a roof with the occupants inside amounted to an illegal act good heavens man weve hanged people in england this year for doing less than that luddites and the like they get up great steel hawsers round the chimneys and bring them crashing through the roof how in gods name is it any different here your grace it happens here every day a few months ago it was done in front of the bishop of meath himself his protests at the time and subsequently came to nothing william devonshire not yet versed in these disparities within the union was unsettled by the revelation and a steely resolve came to him in that instant cornet hervey he now knew had not only in his judgement acted honourably indeed in the only way a gentleman could he had acted within the bounds of justice and if the law here could not admit of that then he would ensure the case came before the highest court of appeal in the union meanwhile he could at least use all his good offices to have hervey released from arrest he thanked everyone for their forbearance declined with much regret the invitation to dine and stay the night and instead though it was already dark began the journey back to lismore elizabeth and henrietta had retired long before his return in the early hours so it was breakfast before he could recount what had passed in cork then elizabeth and i may go and see him at least said henrietta as he finished that much was reasonable he agreed but he counselled patience i have already sent an express to general slade asking for cornet hervey to be released into open arrest for which i have agreed to stand surety if that be necessary i do not think the general will find it expedient to deny the request as to whether charges will be pressed that is another matter entirely between them the officers of the th light dragoons subscribed to four hunts five if mr crokers scratchpack at ballingard in limerick were counted the muskerry hounds had hunted the fox in county cork for the best part of a century and the home troop enjoyed their bank and wall country on wednesdays and saturdays when that hunt met as far west as macroom however the officers would instead join those of the bandon troop to the south and ride out with the carberry sometimes hounds would run right down to bantry bay where the field would then overnight riotously in the town or the military followers might ride on to skibbereen and billet themselves on the outstation there the mallow troop subscribed to the oldest pack the duhallow whose southernmost meets were also accessible to the home troop hervey preferred their country to the carberrys since there was less plough but the hunt he loved best was the scarteen mr thaddeus ryans black and tan hounds hunted both fox and stag over the finest bankandditch country imaginable and so good was the scent that hounds ran faster here than anywhere in ireland before his altercation with the ballinhassig magistrate had brought an abrupt end to his hunting hervey had managed no less than thirty days out over half of them with the scarteen and on his release into open arrest slade having found the duke of devonshires appeal more than compelling his spirits were once again restored at least outwardly by some of the longest and fastest points he had ever known and in the company of the two women for whom his admiration and affection knew no equal beyond what was necessary however the three had no conversation on the matter of his arrest for if the outcome of the due process of military law were favourable then there would be time enough to talk of it and with the necessary dispassion but if the outcome were unfavourable then it were better that he had at least some happy memories of carefree sport and good company to sustain him in the darker times to come throughout these weeks he enjoyed the generous and civilized hospitality of lismore or of the dukes hunting box in tipperary but not the company of the duke himself for on the pretext of business in connection with his estates the duke was working assiduously towards herveys thorough acquittal indeed his acquittal was to the duke an utmost imperative by the end of november hervey and henrietta had spent the greater part of every week in each others company only the occasional field day or picket duty requiring his presence in cork yet elizabeth would confide to her journal that their association seemed no further advanced in those precious weeks than it had been on their parting at horningsham hervey had he kept a journal would have confided the same in general company henrietta was easy full of laughter and game but each time there was any opportunity for intimacy she became perceptibly distant distant enough in any event to daunt any affirmation of his true feeling it was not that his heart had faltered but the arrest had sapped at his surety as a worm in an oak and he supposed henriettas certainty to be likewise diminished with each day he felt the initiative slipping yet further away and he could conceive of no stratagem by which to recover it then one morning as the black and tans were drawing covert in some of their best country near the southern end of the golden vale henrietta took him by surprise matthew this is heaven but i hear tell that the muskerry are not to be missed may we have a day with them perhaps when next they hunt west of cork we may of course he replied but it is poor hunting compared with this in truth she returned i would see the country in which you made so gallant a stand with the magistrate believe me matthew a woman might admire such courage and hervey had been nothing but encouraged by this apparent resolution of doubt on henriettas part taking no note of the conditional in her assertion of admiration the arrangements were made easily enough and the following week he elizabeth and henrietta were to be found with the skyblue collar of mr samuel hawkes the muskerrys master drawing the south bank of the river lee from the meet at the artillery barracks in ballincollig by midday they were near kilcrea as henrietta hoped they would be and when hervey disclosed this fact she asked if they might see the village they left the field and elizabeth and rode to the little settlement which he had not seen since the day of his arrest over a month before peat smoke rose from the holes in the thatchroofs and from the chimneys of the more substantial cottages but there was not a soul to be seen scarcely had they turned into the single muddy street however than the occupants of the dismal dwellings began to emerge and as hervey passed each door he returned their greetings in the same tongue but wary though the greetings were and ignorant of the tongue that henrietta was there was no doubting their benevolence one face at least bore him a smile however and he could not but reflect it as he reached the cottage where first he had begun his precipitous friendships he sprang from the saddle to hold out his hand to caithlin omahoney but she dismissed his formality and instead put both hands firmly on his shoulders to kiss him on each cheek scarce a dozen words of irish passed between them before hervey turned to henrietta yet in the space of those seconds of vocal intimacy henriettas doubts seemed confirmed all her instincts were to turn her horse for cork only pride kept her hands still the fine cloth and colours of his uniform had thrown the village and its people into drab contrast and his black coat for once made him almost a part of that scene but the goldenyellow velvet of henriettas riding habit was in stark contrariety caithlin knew that the cashcrops of the entire village would not in one year be enough to buy such clothes and for certain all that there was inside their cottage into which henrietta now stepped at her invitation and with perfect graciousness would buy neither scent nor gloves for such a lady caithlin was at ease however for if she had no need of such a habit or scent or gloves then the want of them was no deprivation whether such a costume would make her as desirable as henrietta was a question which might later stir her but it was one to which hervey at least had never given the slightest consideration unlikely that it may have seemed to henrietta or to be precise he had never until that moment caithlins copperred hair and dark eyes were not without their effect after so many weeks the meanest of the longleat tenants was betterhoused and betterdressed than the omahoneys and henriettas selfpossession was not so great that she did not notice there was in consequence some warming towards this girl to whom to her mind hervey had lost his reason though she would be the first to own that he did not himself know it and caithlin for her part placed not a foot awry in the perilous mire that passed for conversation time and again she faithfully led their talk back from exclusively mutual matters though hervey blithely pressed question after question on her but there was not any mention of arrest or the action he faced though all the village knew of it how have the regiments patrols been behaving he asked at length with a smile oh were right thankful for them always sor michael omahoney interjected and pleasing it is always to see that serjeant armstrong yes dear serjeant armstrong added caithlin emphatically i so much enjoy his company her eagerness seemed to generate further unease michael omahoney looked away and his wife who had said next to nothing throughout began poking the contents of the firepot in a purposeful fashion caithlin looked down at her lap as silence descended well said henrietta never content with such pauses we have a long ride back to cork matthew do you not think we should take our leave of these good people taking their leave was a protracted affair however since the rest of the village was intent on shaking the hand of the man in whom quite simply they had seen both their deliverance the eviction warrants had been cancelled on grounds of public order and a promise of equitable treatment in the future by the military but if a handshake was one thing it seemed scarcely appropriate for caithlin after her welcoming embrace indeed hervey judged it to be wholly inadequate so as she the better judge of prudence held out her hand he took her by the shoulders to kiss her cheek and so innocent and natural a gesture might have passed unremarkably had not caithlins own unease suddenly manifested itself in coyness and in that instant hervey finally though with chill confusion sensed the delicacy as they left the village henrietta was mute and she continued thus as they took the road to ballincollig the chill now beginning to numb his faculties yet something from deep within told him what he must do to explain his former insensibility to lay to rest what had blighted their time together these past weeks to put an end to any concerns she might have about caithlin i should like to show you a special place near here he said after what seemed an age of silence is that not where we have just been she replied with a hurt that left him in no doubt what he faced they rode to the ruins of kilcrea friary the place had lost nothing of its peacefulness though the wind now whistled constantly through the lancets as he helped henrietta down from the saddle she would not meet his eyes she seemed almost lifeless like one of elizabeths childhood dolls whose horsehair filling had been lost there was no sign of the selfpossession which had drained him of his own confidence so many times that summer in wiltshire they walked round the ruins he recalling their history as it had been told to him by father ogavan though she showed scant attention and even less enthusiasm he pointed to the stones and their inscriptions and he told her how caithlin had taught him irish there and what did she want from you matthew she asked with a directness he had never imagined of her he could give her no answer in truth he had never supposed caithlin had wanted anything but an increase in learning and had they not always been chaperoned by father ogavan no they had not of late but nothing had ever passed between them had it hervey found himself quite unable to think clearly and even began to shake his head as if to deny the doubt but if he had anything in his heart for which to beg forgiveness there were no deeds for confession i taught her a little greek he replied and even as he said it he knew it sounded absurd greek exclaimed henrietta hervey took fright losing all remaining perspective yes he replied in panic almost she already has some latin henrietta began to laugh she covered her mouth so loud was her laughter yet it scattered the starlings beginning to roost in the lintels greek she exclaimed in another peal of giggling hervey looked at her hopelessly oh matthew you are so that girl adores you it is as plain as can be what do you really suppose has passed between you he opened his mouth but nothing emerged at last though his instincts began to speak for he saw at once quite clearly indeed with absolute clarity that the resolution of their separate months of confusion and despair lay within his grasp in this moment he took her shoulders gently in his hands marry me henrietta he said and he was surprised by his own words for he had been trying to formulate the proposal with what he considered due refinement she looked up at him and shook her head and it seemed as if a cold blade were piercing him but then a look of absolute contentment came about her i want nothing else she said clearly i do not think i have at heart wanted anything else since the schoolroom so my dear henrietta you are to marry a man of no fortune a man very likely to be cashiered disgraced and cast out from society you will be dishonoured and all this for love asked the duke with so grave an air of dismay that henrietta was almost abashed yes she replied defiantly the duke smiled what great things might i do if i had such a wife henrietta smiled too a smile of relief and with it sprang back her spirit then take unto yourself some hervey blood do not you have any feeling for elizabeth permit me henrietta but i know a womans heart well enough miss herveys would not open itself to me of that you may be assured no not even for a coronet william that but the duke bade her stop there are more felicitous matters to discuss madam he began your affianceds court martial think i may have news that will be pleasing truly i am all ears sir replied henrietta intently the duke rested an arm on the chimney piece in his voluminous library and began the news that he supposed must bring her such happiness it seems to me too risky to let this case proceed to trial what must needs be is that proceedings are abandoned henrietta looked dismayed forgive me william but is not that what everyone has been trying to do you said the news was felicitous felicitous yes but on the contrary it is not what mr herveys attorney has been about what he has quite properly been doing is addressing the issues the case for the defence in anticipation of its coming to trial and it is a clever case too turning on a most elegant point of law but so elegant i fear and so momentous in its implications that it runs the gravest danger of defeat though i for one would take it to the house of lords come what may then why seem you so sanguine she asked perplexed because dearest henrietta these several past weeks i have been canvassing my fellow landlords and have secured a remarkable concordance so far as this case is concerned what do you suppose would be the implication if your mr hervey were to be acquitted in open court remote though the chance may be i cannot think she replied more perplexed well let me suggest to you as i have to my fellow landlords that the whole question of forcible evictions might subsequently be adjudged dubious in law every landlord in the country would then be in the very devil of a position but began henrietta grasping well enough the proposition but remaining unconvinced you have said that there seemed but little chance of matthews being acquitted indeed smiled the duke wickedly but in the question of rights of eviction none of them would wish to wager even against such long odds none would ever want to see it subjected to a judicial ruling i think it is time that i wrote to sir dearnley lambert and went to see mr magistrate gould and perhaps the agent too oh william you are cleverness personified gasped henrietta as she threw her arms round him let us just say that honour and selfinterest are for once in accord a cavendish and a descendant of the great boyle if only through marriage was enough to put the ballinhassig magistrate into a state of mild panic for his part he declared on hearing the dukes proposition he would be content to leave things entirely to the military and on second thoughts he would also rescind his submission to the lord lieutenant william devonshire was especially relieved at this latter since it saved him the journey to dublin to argue his case at the castle fitzgerald the agent was altogether less pliable only the threat of using the cavendish name with his employer shifted his stubbornness at first he protested that there were no grounds on which to press for his removal the wider implications of the legality of forcible evictions were not his concern he argued whereupon the duke simply smiled and agreed adding that although it would give him no pleasure to use his title to coerce a baronet he would have no hesitation in doing so on this occasion these two were however the easier of his antagonists there remained one enterprise of especial delicacy for if this business with hervey did indeed comprise an element of vindictiveness and his instincts told him it did then he would have to make sure that general slade abandoned any proceedings when the magistrate withdrew his complaint buoyed by his success at ballinhassig the duke therefore journeyed to fermoy to pay what he announced as an introductory call on the startled general and invited him to dine at lismore the following evening he then left fermoy as soon as he decently could but would have been heartened to learn that such was the enthusiasm for dinner at lismore slades staff spent the rest of the day sending messages throughout the county to cancel the invitations which the general had issued to dine at his own headquarters that same evening henrietta took much persuading to be at dinner the following day and elizabeth even more the duke insisted however that in his scheme of things their being there was of the essence for he had surmised that a ward of the marquess of bath would tend further to overawe slade and that when he learned she was in ireland at the express invitation of matthew hervey the seeds of doubt as to the wisdom of proceedings against him would be sown elizabeths connection need not be revealed until it was propitious he added and if the general possessed the least degree of acuity there might be no mention at all of the difficulties and so at the end of that dinner into which slade had entered as an unwitting enemy enters an ambuscade henrietta and elizabeth retired with the generals lady the duke of devonshire poured out his best port as slade was quick to recognize and broached the question of the charges laid against lieutenant hervey slade professed but an imperfect knowledge of them but looked disconcerted by the volley the duke bade a footman bring cigars thereby allowing the general a little more time to appreciate the extent of the danger he was in though no soldier the duke was now warming to his work and judged it the moment to fire a volley from as it were the second rank oh by the by general you know i presume that lady henrietta lindsay and mr hervey are to be married slade reeled visibly at this intelligence now was the time for ruthlessness the duke knew and his third volley was decisive a model of artfulness of foxcunning even the words were so deft that later slade would not be able to recall them with any precision yet firmly in his mind now was the awful notion that he was laying charges against the brother of the future duchess he could barely hide his discomposure if this magistrate is to withdraw his complaint he began his voice transposed by half an octave at least then there is no reason whatever why this young officer should be kept in anguish a moment longer i shall send instructions first thing tomorrow morning that all charges against him if indeed there be any be dismissed i am right grateful to you duke for advising me of the matter now if the duke of devonshire had any reservations as to his stratagem any doubts as to herveys integrity in the matter any fears that slade might be too much maligned they were largely allayed by the generals quite evident disingenuousness and when they joined the ladies the doubts that remained were entirely dispelled by slades great show of discovery that elizabeth was the brother of one of my officers a most active and engaging young man the duke raised an eyebrow as he glanced across to henrietta and elizabeth and in that he managed to convey the intense satisfaction of a man who had comprehensively outmanoeuvred a knave of the blackest kind serjeant armstrong hitched up his sword and fell into step beside lieutenant hervey picket duty came round frequently when there was but one troop in barracks and only one officer and a handful of serjeants but there were worse things on a cold january morning than inspecting the lines will miss lindsay and miss hervey be paying another visit to ireland then sir he asked with a distinct twinkle in his eye i hope so but not before the summer i should think replied hervey noncommittal it was good that they were able to stay longer to make up time for your confinement arrest serjeant armstrong arrest im not a woman with child forgive my lack of learning sir armstrong retorted with heavy irony hervey returned the firepickets salute as they passed the hay store learning be damned you were fishing i was no such thing i merely asked if we were to see the ladies again in the feed store hervey checked the quartermasterserjeants ledger to compare it with the figures he had been given at the orderly room armstrong began counting the sacks of oats opening several at random and prodding the contents with his whip sixtyseven sir he called at length thank you all correct then quarmserjeant said hervey signing the ledger taking up the conversation again as he and armstrong left the store hervey decided there had been enough beating about the bush you will see plenty of lady henrietta because as you very well know we are to be married that is if her guardian consents now how did i know that sir was armstrongs almost convincing protest because johnson told me you had already collected your winnings from serjeant harkness really armstrong betting on your troop lieutenants marriage stakes serjeant armstrong was momentarily and uncharacteristically silenced giving hervey further opportunity to discomfit him tell me how in heavens name you learned of it he pressed i cant say sir what do you mean you cant say this isnt a game of charades would that be like brag sir armstrong well all right he began reluctantly halting in midstride miss lindsay told me erself she what she came to riding school just before leaving for england while you were away in town and told me whatever for shes your intended how should i know why she wanted me to know serjeant armstrong if she confided in you that day there must have been something earlier what had you been saying to her before then nothing dont lie i i just put in a good word for you from time to time youd do the same for me hervey laughed i just have armstrongs expression lost its remaining assurance what do you mean i mean last week while you were with my intended at riding school i rode over to kilcrea to see michael omahoney and he asked me if you were good enough to be a soninlaw armstrong was struck dumb though he recovered after some selfconscious shuffling ah well right enough ive been on duty at that place for the best part of two months off an on since the trouble i got to calling on the omahoneys and walked out with caithlin once or twice i never thought id be asking an irish lass to marry me an i never would ave thought shed have me they may be dirtpoor but shes full of learnin i think the old mans pleased enough but i couldnt speak for them two brothers shes a grand lass though shell make a soldiers wife right enough hervey agreed wholeheartedly but whether she would be happy the other side of the barrackroom curtain well it was none of his business now however if that was where she was to live then hervey was certain of one thing she could not live more happily or it would seem more cherished than with this man an so will that miss lindsay make a soldiers wife said armstrong who could never be troubled with titles an it was me as told you as much in england if you remember indeed i do serjeant armstrong indeed i do the orderly trumpeter passing on his way to the middle of the square to sound watering was bemused by the sight of both men shaking hands and smiling his call interrupted their mutual congratulations however demanding a further round of mundane inspections a halfhour in the stables checking that buckets were full and clean afterwards armstrong his customary wile and composure restored took advantage of the earlier bonhomie to probe on the question that occupied so much of a troops canteen talk the word in the mess is that c troop will be wanting a new captain in a couple o months he began since you know so much serjeant armstrong you ought to know that i will not be eligible to apply hervey answered sounding more than a little sore that i did not know sir how is it then asked armstrong with a frown because and i do not wish this to become commonplace in the mess or the canteens general slade has in his dispatches declined to endorse any recommendation for promotion what an after all that business at kilcrea because of the business there apparently it seems my judgement is questionable in gods name cant you appeal i am not even meant to know it is only because lord george irvine is acting as military secretary in dublin that i learned about it he recommends we let sleeping dogs lie for a while sleeping dogs be damned youre as good as finished in peacetime with a mark like that against you that genral slade as ad it in for the regiment since tloos thats what thiss about cant your grand friend the duke help no i think not something will up peace or no all we can do as major edmonds would say is be stoical armstrong looked puzzled well its all greek to me part two one hundred days the tiger has broken out of his den the ogre has been three days at sea the wretch has landed at fréjus the buzzard has reached antibes the invader has arrived in grenoble the general has entered lyons napoleon slept at fontainebleau last night the emperor will proceed to the tuileries today his imperial majesty will address his loyal subjects tomorrow paris broadsheet april chapter twelve evil news rides post cork march the times arrived in cork each morning two days after leaving the new steam presses in printing house yard unless strong contrary winds delayed the bristol packet from time to time its news arrived sooner by word of mouth of some traveller who had covered the miles from london to the great seaport faster than the mailcoachs twelve hours and who had been able thereby to join an earlier sailing but not often news of bonapartes escape from elba reached cork in this accelerated fashion however and for several hours on march one jeremiah sharrow manufacturing apothecarys agent found himself the unlikely guest of the officers of the th light dragoons who pressed him to every detail of the escape and the response of the government of lord liverpool without doubt lord george irvine who had been retained in dublin much against his will would have greeted the news with the pleasure that a sporting man takes in seeing a fine dogfox break cover with good hounds and a huntsman who knew what he was about the chase and prospect of a kill promised capital sport major joseph edmonds received it differently however evil news rides post while good news baits milton i think sir began hervey but i cannot quite place it samson agonistes hervey had watched the majors spirits ebb throughout that winter command seemed a trial to him now with nothing of the energy of those days before and after toulouse he no longer seemed to lose his temper even hervey had thought the news might somehow invigorate him when as picket officer he had brought it to the mess instead it received only the melancholy quotation from milton here indeed was the heavy heart of a family man who had spent practically every one of his thirty years in king georges uniform on active service he had no personal wealth to speak of and although he had accumulated a little prizemoney he had lamented that he would never be able to buy the lieutenantcolonelcy of even an infantry regiment now that peace had come to europe he was too old he knew to seek preferment with the honourable east india company in truth he had privately become reconciled to going on to halfpay and to joining his wife and three daughters in norwich hervey was puzzled none the less why this news of the flight from elba was not greeted with more enthusiasm surely it was cause for hope in one respect for the fortunes of war were ever changing the agonistes seemed apt indeed samson calm of mind all passion spent it was not a heroic state not a state fitting for this man in whom the regiment had placed its trust time and again and who had never once failed them do you believe there will be war again sir he asked he would not be put off by the insouciance why in heavens name would bonaparte have left elba otherwise i doubt it was to pay a call on a mistress edmonds replied tartly believe me if they let him get to paris the bourbons will run like hares and the old guard will rally straight to him there arent but fifty thousand of our troops and prussians in the low countries and hell have three times that number in the field within two months do you think the austrians have any more stomach for a fight the dutch are treacherous and the brunswickers are finished i doubt even the prussians resolve hervey was unabashed still but we broke what remained of their southern army at toulouse and the other allies had crippled the northern ones what can he achieve he can put the wind up that congress in vienna thats what make them give better terms a republic perhaps they should have seen it coming elba was too close to home for him in both senses you remember the agonistes samsons despair in his incarceration of living a life half dead a living death how did they think they could cage such a beast as bonaparte within scent of his old prey hervey decided on a prudent withdrawal how indeed sir shall there be any message in reply for the adjutant doubtless mr barrow is at this instant relaying the tidings to the outlying stations be so good hervey as to give him my compliments and send a recall to officers on furlough but why we must receive this evil news from the times and from some travelling man rather than from dublin i truly despair we may surmise that the government has paid off all the telegraphstation lieutenants in their search for economies one question alone exercised hervey however one for which the officers recall augured well but he would put it to the adjutant for he judged that edmondss melancholic humour would not admit of reason what do you think be our chances of joining the dukes army barrow he asked after returning to the orderly room as little chance as you have of no more picket duties this year was the perfunctory reply though delivered with a smile and for a whole month it looked as though barrow would be right until on april orders were received from dublin to prepare six troops for immediate service in belgium edmonds was at once transformed throwing himself into the preparations working with the punishing energy of a steam hammer one morning he sat down after muster and wrote without drawing breath except to dip his pen directions for carrying camp equipment specifying the means of securing every item a dragoon would carry mallets tents pins and hatchets to be carried in water buckets fixed to the near ring of the saddle behind the powder bag to be carried by the orderly corporal kettles to be fixed with strings upon the baggage till straps can be provided canteens to be slung on the right side haversacks on the left side picket posts strapped to firelocks com sacks with corn divided between the ends across the saddle hay twisted in ropes and fixed upon the necessary bags waterdecks neatly folded and placed upon the hay nosebags fixed to the offring of the saddle behind forage cords upon the baggage scythes wrapped with haybands and strapped with the handles to the firelocks sneeds stores c to be carried by the same men old clothing hats and spare things not wanted at present to be properly packed and lodged at the regimental store and so on and so on until every last detail had been arranged really hervey there is no need of an adjutant with the major so rued barrow one morning as he gave him his orders for picket he is riding to each and every outstation to inspect for himself every horse heaven alone knows when he sleeps on the th lord george irvine arrived from dublin to take command which edmonds relinquished with not a sign of the intense disappointment that he must have felt and on the th a and b troops marched from the barracks to the cove to begin embarkation nine days later including reshipping at ramsgate they landed at ostend or rather the officers and men landed by lighter the horses were pushed overboard to swim for the shore this not unusual method of disembarking always meant delay while the two groups were reunited and almost invariably occasioned injury to both parties on this morning however lieutenant hervey was able to hand over a troop to captain lankester who had rejoined them at ramsgate at exactly the irish establishment of horses less chargers and other ranks and all fit for duty ostend harbour itself was all activity officers on home leave who had made their own way to belgium were hailing comrades as their regiments disembarked or greeting old friends in others and the scene resembled as one india hand put it a calcutta durbar laming now the sixths senior cornet who had been in ostend for over a week grasped hervey with unrestrained enthusiasm dye know its like the first day of the summer half at eton i have not seen so many old friends in years what a turnup eh and we all believed that halfpay or selling out was all that beckoned have you heard that lord george is to get a brigade dutchmen mostly though hell have no brigade after the first shot is fired who is to command us then asked hervey warily edmonds of course and right glad of it i am too youll see soon enough that things here are not as they should be nows not the time to be foisted with an extract he paused and then frowned why are you looking so nothing nothing at all it is just that the major has not been himself these past few months although he has worked like a black since orders for here came whose brigade are we to be in grants for the time being with the seventh thirteenth and fifteenth so i understand they arrive only now but have you heard who is to command the cavalry you mean it is not to be general cotton uxbridge great heavens replied hervey reflecting lamings smile of satisfaction but i thought that he and the duke could not speak with each other after that business with his sisterinlaw i mean that is as maybe but i hear tell the duke of york himself was adamant and that wellington has accepted with good grace and so he deuced well should uxbridge is the only general with cavalry genius hervey smiled but then why should not laming make so precocious a judgement he himself would not hesitate to voice such an opinion especially in respect of uxbridge on that we can all be agreed and yet had not le marchant fallen at salamanca floreat etona laming came a call from the press behind him hervey would have walked away leaving laming to yet another fourthofjune encounter but something in the voice made him turn instead by heavens jessope he exclaimed and there followed much vigorous handshaking and mutual expressions of delight but why my dear hervey do you sound so surprised on seeing me thus you do not suppose lord fitzroy somerset would have sallied hence without me said the adc with the same solemn selfmocking that had so endeared him to hervey in spain no i did not suppose it for one minute you are quite charming enough to flatter any assignment out of the horse guards of that i am sure to tell the truth my dear jessope i had not given it a moments thought we have been uncommonly busy in the line you know but now that i see you here i am full of confidence at last in this campaign shall i suppose that lord fitzroy is to be military secretary again verily he is began jessope ignoring herveys earlier irony but listen my dear fellow this campaign ought to be a very fine summers sport indeed hardly anyone believes that bonaparte will survive long his marshals and generals will throw him over now that he has been declared an outlaw brussels has become quite like london so many of mayfairs hostesses have set themselves up here and we are hunting in the forests just outside i tell you it is capital sir capital i think it will come to a fight replied hervey refusing to endorse jessopes dismissiveness my dear fellow so do i so do i and so does the duke but there will still be plenty of sport then who is it that does not suppose there will be war those fools in whitehall to begin with i tell you they think this thing so trivial that slender billy was at first to be made commanderinchief who is slender billy asked hervey with a frown in heavens name where have you been these past months the crown prince of orange that is who but was he not one of the dukes own adcs in the peninsula surely he was the same the same in any event i am given to understand that some arrangement has been concluded i think the young dutchman is to be given command of a corps your esteemed lord george is to be a liaison officer at his headquarters lord george but i thought he was to command one of their brigades said hervey intrigued by this turn of news lawks no they will not even give the duke direct command of dutch troops in action let alone make one of our officers a brigade commander no he is to go and keep an eye on slender billy but look weve been here nearly a month and the duke rides out each morning with lord fitzroy you may accompany if you wish he is the most engaging of company on a good day i am very pleased to hear it said hervey with a smile amused at jessopes familiarity but it does not sound as if the duke is having too many good days by your accounts nought without his capability i assure you my dear friend but how say you to riding with us hervey smiled again i should be honoured to ride with you both capital then i shall send word as soon as is expedient now i must go and collect the dispatches which that frigate yonder should have aboard jessope said nodding to the singledecker about to drop anchor in the outer harbour no sooner had he gone but that hervey was confronted by a figure who excited every contrary emotion to those inspired by jessopes unexpected company under a helmet resembling that of an ancient greek hoplite was the face of hugo styles the flesh more than usually loose but the complexion now florid the broad gold braid down the front of his scarlet jacket shone as if new from his tailor that morning well hervey a far cry this from wiltshire and by the look of ye yve come even further than from there hervey chose to ignore the reference to his wellworn field dress and instead returned the greeting such as it had been formally but briefly good morning styles i am given to understand that i should congratulate you on winning the esteem of lady henrietta lindsay continued styles with disdain i cannot say what you should or should not do you are an extraordinarily favoured man mr hervey extraordinarily favoured he went on his tone changing to one of reproach i count myself so replied hervey holding to the clipped speech that betrayed his impatience styles sensing perhaps that he would force no change in herveys humour reverted to his former condescension i understand this business here might be tedious in the extreme the talk in london is of peace i do hope we may be allowed a little recreation they say brussels is a tolerably fine city not at all provincial how many horses have you brought two my dear fellow do you think that two will be enough i managed in the peninsula well enough yes yes but if we are to race and hunt every day you will need more than two i would not gainsay your logic only your supposition well we shall see i fancy that you in the light cavalry will all be sent on picket to the frontier in any case hervey thought this the only sense styles had spoken throughout the exchange the heir to leighton park lieutenant of yeomanry and now cornet of life guards seemed more than usually gifted with foolery very possibly styles he sighed and it would be a most welcome duty too shaking off the flotsam hereabouts now you must excuse me i have work to do and he strode off towards the corralling area the effects of this unwelcome encounter did not last long however for in the corralling area the parklike gardens in front of the harbourmasters house he found the perfect antidote joseph edmonds positively transfigured by the news of his command and with pay too no less edmonds laughed hervey could not recall how long it had been since he had heard edmonds laugh so months many months the major restored to good humour and in command by his reckoning it would make the difference perhaps of two troops in the days that followed there was little to sustain them in that humour the provision of forage was not good the commissaries protesting that all their attempts to consolidate supplies were to no avail they cited any number of reasons none of which enraged edmonds so much as the price of corn as if bookkeeping were to be admitted to the arts of war he complained as a consequence of this failure to establish any form of supply his six troops were scattered about the farms over a wide area around the town of drongen outside ghent so that local arrangements for forage might be made and as one morning he was despairing of ever getting them together for regimental drill lord uxbridge arrived unannounced the commander of the allied cavalry and the dukes presumptive secondincommand sympathized it is not only regimental drill that might be wanting brigade drill is my most pressing concern he confided my regiments are scattered the length of flanders to keep them fed unless we may work up as brigades we shall be at a most trying disadvantage in this open country i wonder that you will have any opportunity to form divisions then my lord the major enquired just so edmonds just so replied uxbridge i despair of assembling even one division for but a single field day well general we shall drill as best we can you know we shall but i have so many new men i hope that is not the case with the rest of the army ha but i fear it is edmonds i am certain it is but it is worse with the infantry the duke is not in the least sanguine and matters are not as they should be with the allies there is even difficulty with the prussians still we shall be well of that i am sure at least my brigade and regimental commanders are old peninsular hands how i wish i had been with you in the second campaign do you remember sahagun edmonds of course you do well we shall not freeze this time if this heat continues we shall drop like recruits in the indies but we may i fear see a good many sahaguns before bonaparte is back in his box yes here was a cavalryman with the surest coup dœil all would be well but even so edmonds had not liked what uxbridge had said about the difficulties with the dutch and the prussians never had he trusted anyone but an english regular yet now they must rely on allies close on both flanks was not this what he had warned of that very day in cork when the news of the escape from elba arrived and it would be no peninsula this time no fabian campaign of advance and withdrawal on wellingtons terms no game of cat and mouse this was too close to paris for the french and bonaparte himself would be in the field it would take the whole weight of an allied army an army of unity to defeat him not one of rifts and suspicions later in the morning hervey rode into ghent to see darcey jessope whose invitation to dine with his regiment he had received the day before but first my dear friend said the adc as he greeted him enthusiastically i want to show you my new charger i am excessively pleased with him i must admit he is the most beautiful creature they went to the chateau stables where jessope had lodged his new horse and an orderly led him out under a magnificent saddlecloth there exclaimed the captain of guards tell me your opinion is he not the most magnificent steed fit for an aidedecamp to the dukes military secretary hervey smiled jessope had such an attachment to looks this gelding was however as fine a looking thoroughbred as hervey had seen an inch short of sixteen hands he guessed there was a pleasing symmetry to his conformation his lean head indicating the real quality of his breeding was well set on he had a kind eye betokening a generous disposition and that hervey judged was what jessope needed above all else he had a nice length of rein let into sloping shoulders putting the saddle in the right place he stood on good legs not too spindly as some thoroughbreds had with enough bone below the knee his quarters were well let down and his hocks were well under him his summer coat a deep liver chestnut shone and which jessope no doubt found most pleasing he carried his tail well hervey had but one reservation he was a shade too shortcoupled for his liking true jessye had a short back but he always believed this to be less a concern in nonbloods but he had to admit this gelding was a picture and he congratulated jessope let us ride together a while then and i can show you his paces he trots as if on air hervey readily agreed the tacking was called for and after a little difficulty fitting the saddle he is somewhat coldbacked jessope explained they set off for the park near the great cathedral of stbavon to jessopes frustration however he could not keep his gelding on the bit is he green asked hervey trying not to make too obvious a suggestion that jessopes hands might be wanting well he was warranted eight years old i think perhaps i have not been able to give him quite sufficient exercise since coming here hervey was sceptical however and he observed the gelding intently as they trotted along the sandy ride that bisected the park the horse would not relax its back seeming instead to hold it stiffly and there looked to be too little activity in the hind legs for so well bred an animal when they returned to the château hervey asked if he might look him over more closely do you think there might be some ailment then asked jessope with more than a note of concern hervey paused before making any reply running his hand along the horses back feeling for obvious sore points but there were none the back was as clean as could be look he began i know only a very little about these things but i am always a trifle uneasy about shortcoupled thoroughbreds i like more room for the lungs though i must say that yours seems to have not too shallow a chest you say he is eight years has he done much i dont rightly know said jessope a might uncomfortably i bought him at tattersalls as the property of a gentleman hervey looked in the geldings mouth the groove in the crown of each incisor was gone and the star was present in the central ones well he is eight at least beyond that i cannot tell what do you suppose is the trouble then hervey let out his breath and raised an eyebrow look jessope he is a handsome thing but jessope had by now braced himself tell me what you suppose i fear he may have a kissing spine jessope looked puzzled i have seen it only a couple of times before and there is no sure way of knowing but each time it has been a thoroughbred with a short back a kissing spine is when the vertebrae impinge invariably in the middle back jessope looked crestfallen and what may i do about it the first thing you must do is seek the opinion of someone betterqualified than i there must be a staff veterinary officer with the dukes headquarters yes there is replied jessope and what if he confirms your diagnosis hervey paused again i am very much afraid that at his age you can do nothing but in any event you must have a horse that you may rely on in the field you do have others yes he replied of course but they are not one bit as magnificent as he jessope my dear friend believe me urged hervey i understand that it is necessary to be turned out magnificently on the staff but when it comes to fighting you know full well that its handsome is that handsome does dinner comprised both agreeable company and good fare the guards having paid handsomely for the contents of a market garden nearby and for venison from their chateaus deerpark there was champagne brought that day from rheims by traders of resource its cost inflated however by the tolls paid to french patrols near the border in respect of champagne at least even during the late wars neither the allied blockade nor bonapartes edicts had ever quite extirpated trade but jessope had been curiously reserved throughout dinner and afterwards walking in the formal gardens of the château he revealed why you must not breathe a word of this he began in almost a whisper but matters are looking very grave indeed as regards the prussians hervey committed himself to absolute discretion there might even be a thorough rupture in the alliance he continued herveys expression of surprise encouraging his conspiratorial manner it would seem that earlier this year at the congress in vienna there was some impasse as regards the future of saxony and poland the prussians appeared to want to incorporate the greater part of both into prussia itself it would seem that a secret treaty was signed in which we agreed to side with austria and france against the prussians and with the russians too i believe in the event of its coming to a fight great heavens sighed hervey and i suppose you are going to say that the secret is now out bonaparte discovered it naturally and is now most skilfully driving a wedge into the alliance what shall happen i know not lord fitzroy considers that it will not make a deal of difference in so far as the congress is concerned bonaparte must be dealt with the prussians know it well enough and the only way is by concerted action but in vienna they may have their stately dance the difficulty will be in the field for it seems there is much resentment already amongst the prussians gneisenau their chief of staff can be trying at the best of times so hearsay has it but is not prince blucher to be their commander he has a reputation as a seasoned soldier has he not yes indeed but you with all your study will know that the prussians have a most curious system the chief of staff answers direct to their king in many matters principally in the strategy of the campaign so even though blucher is the field commander he is bound by gneisenaus orders in certain circumstances it is a curious system for sure it evidently works however evidently so though it is untried in coalition oh and by way of adding to the discord said jessope almost as an aside they are shooting the saxons what gasped hervey several saxon regiments have mutinied and the prussians are shooting the ringleaders altogether then not everything on our left flank is as the duke would have it be hervey raised his eyebrows and then shrugged and what does headquarters think bonaparte will be about next the duke believes there will be no attack in the north at least to begin with he believes bonaparte will strike first at the austrians on the rhine and what of us here then oh there will be some offensive to hold us in belgium that is for sure but look my good friend i have to be back at headquarters ere long i will tell you all as i hear it but it must go no further i tell you because i cannot trust anyone else to keep silent and in truth i must talk with someone the confidences are all but intolerable now riding out with headquarters shall you be able to join us tomorrow you may be sure of it then be there by eight the duke will be very prompt chapter thirteen design for battle flanders june when hugo styles had raised an eyebrow at the supposed inadequacy of herveys equipage do you think that two will be enough he had scarcely fancied that one of those two horses would be an unprepossessing little mare and had it been styles about to ride out in the company of the commanderinchief albeit no doubt at the back of a large field that ornament of an officer would for certain have ridden the poorerlooking charger to the headquarters his groom leading a finer one and there he would have changed horses just as at home he might take a hack to a covert and thence change to a blood for the chase but hervey had chosen to do the contrary though acutely aware that the sixths officers had at one time scorned jessye as a coverthack not that he feigned to consider for the briefest instant the alternative he dismissed it however on the grounds that the duke of wellington would not engage himself in the sort of hyde park ride that styles might have envisaged and if there was to be anything tricky then he wished to be on that handy little mare indeed the handiest in everyones judgement now perhaps if harkaway had not thrown a splint he would have chosen him instead but the gelding was gorging himself on the lush green grass of east cork making whole again in anticipation of herveys return to the hunting field in that glorious county the headquarters party that morning was not as big as he had expected the duke himself wearing a plain blue coat and hat and riding a big grey was accompanied by lord fitzroy somerset this herveys first sight of the dukes military secretary greatly took him aback for the man looked no older than he that is because he is not said jessope well not by more than a year or two and a lieutenantcolonel to boot hervey studied him fascinated twentysix or twentyseven a lieutenantcolonel in the grenadiers and one of the dukes principal staff officers a son of the duke of beaufort no doubt this had been instrumental to his first being appointed adc to wellington in spain but there were many similarly connected officers who failed to win so signal a favour patronage could be but an incomplete explanation and here was he a lieutenant with hardly the means to buy a captaincy and a stop on promotion even if he did have it would have required the attributes of a saint at that moment not to feel at least some particle of resentment did you know his wife is with child their first added jessope as if hervey might have any idea or indeed interest she is in brussels at this time i was not even to know he was married he replied flatly why yes began jessope unperturbed last august to the dukes niece it was a deuced fine wedding i may tell you hervey smiled to himself the dukes niece how these threads wove tight together and he wondered who these other three in the party might therefore be perhaps they too were officers of like affinity he began to feel uncomfortably out of place maybe had he not been so conspicuous he was wearing field order so that he looked not unlike the two staffdragoon orderlies accompanying the duke he might have felt more inclined to ease for the others wore plain clothes of black blue or green which would serve them equally well in the hunting field and they seemed intent on keeping their own company though apparently on nodding terms with jessope where is the escort he whispered there is no escort the duke keeps his field small and relies on quality replied jessope likewise sotto what do you think of that entire he rides he is quality is he not truly he is though more a youngster than i would have supposed the duke has a stable of near two dozen counting drivers and most of them bloods then i shall be sure to remain a respectful distance behind with jessye he smiled what of the hanoverian you bought of me was he not a more meet companion for a ride such as this asked jessope puzzled i rode him here did you not see in truth he would i agree have set me off finer in a parade but my mare here is the fleetest little creature god made jessope frowned believe me insisted hervey in a squeeze i would be with no other a fast trot south and west took them through villages full of british dutch and belgian troops for the most part infantrymen the duke stopped once or twice to exchange words with an officer he appeared to know but there was no formality the commanderinchiefs progress was indeed as brisk as reputation had it then as they turned back in the direction of ghent crossing a hayfield which had taken its first cut a week or so before a big buckhare got up from almost under the dukes feet startling his young horse and those of his nearest attendants the duke however regathered his reins before any of them and was straight after it hallooing loudly soho called jessope to hervey we must be in at the kill the hare led them in a huge circle over country empty but for a few labourers by the hayricks they crossed three streams at a furious pace and still there was no check a full five minutes galloping a sunken road all but proved the hares escape too for the dukes horse pecked on landing short of the top of the far bank and tumbled its rider two of the other officers riding hard up close went the same way the third pulled up before takeoff as did the staff dragoons and lord fitzroy hervey put jessye at the hedge where the others had gone for the gap and she cleared the road in a soaring arc ignorant of what convention demanded of him and seeing the duke already on his feet and remounting he galloped off after the hare with noone in front now to check his speed he pressed his legs to jessyes flanks and closed steadily with the big buck at twenty yards he drew his sabre and pointing pressed the mare to a final effort the buck jinked to the left and hervey came back to the recover turning jessye sharply who did a neat flying change of her own accord to lead with the left leg the hare continued running to the left and hervey knew he would not be able to get on its inside so he leaned forward at full stretch and pointed down the nearside a second or so later and he lifted the quarry on his sabre smart work boy smart work shouted the duke as he caught up bringing the rest of the field with him the smartest swordwork i have seen in many a year they began circling in a walk to let the horses down and hervey presented the hare to the staff dragoons for your pot troopers whos your hardriding friend jessope called the duke as the adc caught them up lieutenant hervey sixth light dragoons your grace he replied the duke smiled turning to him a different hound for every chase select with judgment nor the timid hare oer matched destroy do you know that verse boy indeed i do sir it is somervilles chase the duke nodded just so and i think i should despise an englishman who did not know it hervey the name is familiar we have met before have we not toulouse yes sir i was commanding a flank picket he replied incandescent at the recognition indeed you were added the duke breaking into another smile lord fitzroy this officer accounted for a horse battery on his own what sport there is to be had in the cavalry i sometimes wish i had remained a light dragoon myself duke added lord fitzroy offering hervey his hand well i cannot say the same myself laughed the commanderinchief though i was only a dragoon on paper as it were it seems to me though that a light dragoon is something a man must be at some stage of his life but that he must move sharply on to more serious things consider the elder pitt hervey now theres a dragoon who moved on to greater matters everyone laughed politely as subordinates tend to when a senior officer attempts humour i think it best if i first seek distinction as a dragoon your grace hervey submitted but you are almost there my dear fellow countered the duke you know how to handle a picket now if you can do something to check this appalling habit our cavalry have got into of galloping at everything and then galloping back again without note of the circumstances you will achieve distinction right enough i dare say you will be unique hervey smiled awkwardly for he knew that though the remark was in jest an earnest particular underlay it a particular on which the duke had expressed his disapproval many times the commanderinchief was in good humour however certainly none the worse for his tumble and the party turned for home in high spirits come ride up alongside hervey called the duke as they set off back on long reins tell me what is your opinion of what bonaparte might do here though startled by the unexpectedness of the question he answered at once for it was a matter to which he had given much thought i suspect that many will think he will envelop us by a drive around our right flank cutting us off from ostend and the other channel ports perhaps fighting a holding battle on the border around charleroi he has made so many moves of this like before yes said the duke slowly as if surprised by the discernment of the reply and intrigued by the question posed by many will think but that is excessively risky hervey continued thoroughly warming to his subject his strategic aim must surely be to knock us the british i mean sir out of the fight back into the sea and to send the prussians back across the rhine it seems to me your grace that if he puts his effort into an envelopment then what he is doing is trying to use sheer weight to achieve his design he might not have enough weight and he might also drive us towards rather than away from the prussians and then he would simply have too big an army to defeat the duke was about to say something but hervey failed to notice and instead pressed on to his second conclusion if however bonaparte strikes direct for brussels he might drive a wedge so deep between the two armies that each falls back along its own lines of communication and he would thereby have achieved his strategic purpose by the indirect method that i am sure is much more at the heart of what he seeks to do with his socalled manoeuvre yet everyone excuse me your grace many seem only to see the movement rather than the purpose well well replied the duke whoever would have thought it i have officers in the cavalry who have studied bonaparte rather than just reynard do not take offence mr hervey the two have much in common there was more laughter so you are acquainted with bonapartes socalled strategy of the central position continued the duke yes sir i have read much on the subject it is the strategy that i believe would give the best chance of success here well then describe it briefly for the benefit of my friends here he added indicating the three staff officers who were now looking at hervey with evident regard rather than merely through him as before briefly sir divide et impera his army divided into two echelons drives between the two opposing armies he uses just sufficient force to fix one in place and then concentrates the rest to defeat the second he does not have to destroy the second completely just to destroy any hope of its assisting the other he then turns to defeat in detail the first army which he has fixed in place and what are the prerequisites of the strategy asked the duke his eyes now fastened on him hawklike prerequisites sir hervey began stressing the anticipatory so as to be wholly clear of what his answer was conditional upon surprise and security just so nodded the duke pensively and without another word he broke into a trot it was midday by the time they returned to the commanderinchiefs forward headquarters at ghent hervey had fallen back to his original place next to jessope who was much amused by the strategic tutorial as he called it as they entered the courtyard of the inn which had been pressed into military service the duke turned to them both thank you mr hervey i have much enjoyed your company he said warmly captain jessope you must bring your thinking friend out again yes gentlemen surprise and security they are everything it became even hotter in the days that followed supply as far as it affected the sixth seemed to be much better although the troops were still scattered about numerous villages in order to take forage direct from the farms rather than through the system of depots and while this suited them in many ways it still made mustering for drill difficult the brigade had only been able to hold two field days since arriving although there had been yet another change of location this time to the river dendre around grammont here though they were plagued by midges and it was not long before sweet itch appeared particularly in those horses billeted in the poorer unkempt farms where there was little cover and scant wastediscipline never had the regiment suffered from it so badly in c troop one morning sixteen horses could not be saddled so abraded were their backs and edmonds became affeard of an epidemic there was no agreement even as to its cause for many believed the connection with midges to be circumstantial neither was there unanimity as to treatment the new veterinary officer young and active had no doubts however and managed to procure large quantities of sulphur treating all the cases with his own foulsmelling potion it had unusually early results although three of the worst cases had to be dispatched by the farriers axe captain lankester had sniffed when he heard of the losses for each day he had had all his troop horses brought in before dawn and again before dusk when the midges were the most active and had lit fires to smoke them away as a consequence they had lost not one trooper nor had any been unfit for saddling for more than a day his own chargers he anointed with a most precious lotion he had bought the previous year in london on the recommendation of a teaplanter oil of citronella one of the east india companys most exotic and expensive imports the planter had sworn by it it had a most pleasing smell yet was wholly repugnant to any flying insect and lankester had been able to enjoy his shooting and fishing unplagued after daubing his face and hands with it and he had now been able to transfer exactly this protection to his beloved hunters but if the new billets did not favour the horses they certainly suited many of the officers since it took less than two hours to get to brussels the capital had almost as many theatres as london and dances and levees carried on apace at one of these and he had only been to the one hervey had met lady fitzroy somerset are you the officer who courses hares with his sabre she had asked laughingly to which hervey had replied that he could have done better with a lance my husband tells me that your conversation with my uncle set him thinking for several hours quite an achievement mr hervey i am sure the duke is thinking constantly madam had been herveys reply it had been the best he could manage for he was not as yet at ease in that company and lady fitzroy somerset put him in mind of henrietta lindsay and of his initial awkwardness in her company it had been a charming enough exchange no doubt the inconsequential talk of such gatherings but even if there had been only a fraction of truth in the idea that the duke had found his discourse stimulating then it was some comfort for a man whose prospects still were so comprehensively blighted by general slade then in the second week of the month hervey received another invitation from jessope to ride out with the duke the party a bigger affair than before assembled in the courtyard of the hotel de ville in halle on the monstobrussels high road and it soon became apparent that its purpose was more than morning exercise standing beside a large map fixed to the double doors of the empty stables was sir william de lancey he acts as the dukes chief of staff until sir george murray arrives from canada explained jessope and those other two officers are the dukes artillery and engineer commanders sir george wood and sir james smyth i think we shall see good sport this morning the duke duly appeared walked to the map and taking the pointingstick which de lancey proffered began to address the assembled party gentlemen i want today to complete my reconnaissance of defensive positions in the event of bonapartes making a direct move against brussels a move which i am still far from convinced he will make nevertheless i intend being ready for him if he does if he should strike for brussels it will not be to take possession of the lace factories there was polite but restrained laughter his purpose will be to divide the prussians and ourselves although it may seem therefore that he has the initiative in that he chooses the time of attack he does not entirely choose the place he must attack astride the junction of the two armies and that junction is where the good general blücher and i make it and where we make it is as far east as we dare without exposing my right flank and ostend so we shall of course make plans to cover the monsbrussels road but that is not his likely axis since the junction will be further east towards charleroi he explained pointing to the features on the map now he continued with a pause for further emphasis we will not hold him forward on the border there is little chance of our being able to concentrate there in time but we will delay him there make him pay the price of time and we will stop him along this line here through brainel alleud mont stjean and wavre and this morning we shall examine a defensive position astride the chaussée on this ridge at mont stjean which if these maps are at all faithful promises to have capability as that other landscaper might have described it there was more polite laughter torres vedras duke asked his engineer capability brown would have approved of our landscaping efforts there no sir james the effort is too great for so slender an eventuality but more to the point we could never keep the enterprise secret and in that lay half the strength of torres vedras colonel smyth seemed disappointed you will not allow me to raze any bridges duke and now you do not want me to throw up any earthworks the bridges will be more use to us when we move against france than they will be to bonaparte if he moves against us and i am afraid that i cannot spare troops for digging he replied with an emphatic smile soon afterwards they left the inn yard preceded by a halftroop of hussars from the kings german legion and headed south along the nivelles road and then east along a poor carttrack towards mont stjean jessope and hervey were soon covered in the grime of the road and so fell back just far enough to escape the dust cloud i for one should recommend he blow up all the bridges called hervey when they were well out of earshot should you indeed replied jessope with a smile yes the dukes predicament is that he has no absolute intelligence of where bonaparte will strike and so he must watch a considerable front before bonaparte strikes you may be sure that he will have taken all manner of measures to deceive us but the one thing which will reveal his hand is the location of his engineers and their bridges it will be very difficult to mask such activity no doubt the duke has considered it of course i was merely expressing my judgement that is all your judgement made a great impression the latter day you know i should not wonder but that the duke will write to your colonel on the matter i wish he would write to general slade replied hervey with a resigned shrug and as they trotted on towards mont stjean he recounted to jessope for the first time the events of the previous november it was a long day the duke made the keenest inspection of the ridge running east to west to the south of the village of waterloo astride the charleroibrussels chaussée although lowlying it suited his purpose well he told the party its reverse slopes would give his infantry protection from artillery fire his supplies and reserves could move undetected and he could if all else failed withdraw into the cover of the forêt de soignes behind and continue the fight there what he especially prized was the fortuitous situation of several clusters of buildings just forward of the ridge the small château of hougoumont to the west in the east the settlements at la haie and papelotte and in the centre la haye sainte farm which when garrisoned might serve in his words as anchors for the whole line throughout the duke had not spoken to hervey but at the end of the reconnaissance as they gathered on the crest of the ridge at the point where the chaussée bisected it and just above one of the anchors la haye sainte farm the duke called him over now mr hervey what would you say was the principal weakness in this position hervey was even more astounded than the first time the duke had asked his opinion for that time it had begun as mere banter now the duke seemed wholly in earnest your grace he began pausing for no more than the fraction of a moment it is a very advantageous position indeed as strong as i have seen outside the mountains of spain the approaches in the centre and his left are so open that bonaparte could scarcely attempt them without the most fearful loss he will in all likelihood therefore seek to envelop your left flank he has cover to move his troops a good way round and the country beyond papelotte is so trappy that yes yes so what is the answer the duke interrupted impatiently but hervey was not fazed the prussians must threaten that flank from the outset so that he dare not risk the manoeuvre and two full brigades of cavalry will be needed on the left of our line as additional insurance herveys confidence in his opinion which brought smiles to the artillery and engineer officers was at once vindicated hervey if you had said anything else then i should have written you off as a mere harechaser after all yours is precisely my appreciation too except that i would go further if bonaparte gets this far and if the prussians are still with us as you say he will have surmised that our left the east flank is too risky an essay our right will be then his best course but look i wager that he will be tempted by desperation to force his way straight through the centre the high road to brussels i am not intimidated by all this talk of manoeuvre he has never yet had to face a stubborn sepoy general of whom he appears to think not a great deal and i perceive that he might receive a very great shock in that respect here noone spoke not a word well come then gentlemen we must survey our delaying position next the crossroads at quatrebras i think three leagues south it should not take long hervey returned to the regiments billets so late on june after yet another solitary excursion that captain lankester and the other officers from first squadron had left for the grand ball in brussels without him he toyed with the idea of riding there alone but gave it up by the time he arrived the best part of the dance would be over supper especially it was not as if there had been a personal invitation he would be one of the party comprising the officer commanding his majestys th lt dragoons and three officers as the card specified whereas lankester and most of the others had had their own cards edmonds had politely refused the invitation poor old richmond he had said on receiving it comes out to brussels hoping to get a corps and all he gets instead is the duchess spending his money ill not embarrass them they were not expecting it to be me in command when she wrote it i shall pass it to lord george hervey had in any case kept his own company for so long during the preceding weeks that the notion of such a gathering at this time was unappealing at the beginning of the month he had ridden into brussels and returned to the astonishment of his fellows with a great sheaf of ferraris et capitaine maps which had cost him all of twenty pounds over a month of his pay and he had ridden out since each day not returning until after dark when pressed by his fellow cornets and lieutenants to answer for what he had been about he was invariably less than specific he had been riding the country between quatrebras and mont stjean lankester however always insisted he recount his days reconnaissance and on one occasion after hervey had explored as far as the border they had as a consequence ridden over to edmondss headquarters billet to apprise him of the dukes plan for that sector the only plan indeed that they had the least knowledge of edmonds had made one remark only cant think why he doesnt blow the damned bridges and hervey had smiled to himself when he returned during this evening of the th with more to inform lankester of than ever before his troop leaders absence at the ball put him in a quandary he rode to edmondss headquarters to tell him of the sound of intense cannon fire which he had heard from the direction of charleroi indeed on returning to his own billet after the reconnaissance he had been surprised to find that there were no movement orders edmonds had asked if he had heard anything in the direction of mons but he could only say that he had encountered two of general dornbergs hanoverians taking routine dispatches to brussels and they had reported that all was quiet on that front the major decided nevertheless to send a report to the brigade commander with his evening returns and a copy direct to lord uxbridge he then stood hervey down all my instinct matthew is that we are about to be tested as never before i intend turning in early and i implore you to do the same hervey woke abruptly just after three oclock to the trumpeters short reveille it was a less insistent call than alarm but long experience said that the short reveille portended something almost at the same time lankester and the others returned from brussels with the news that the french were across the border at charleroi and engaging the prussians the news having been brought to wellington himself at the duchess of richmonds ball a few minutes later edmonds arrived in a troops billet to find out what lankester knew i do not understand it the major began we have just had orders to concentrate at ninove but that is north of here it makes no sense to me either said lankester great heavens what a beginning groaned edmonds we have been here these two months and we are now caught napping lankester send if you will a galloper no you can spare no officers send an orderly to general grant to verify those instructions for ninove he cannot have failed to appreciate surely that we are south of there while everyone else is north or west meanwhile i shall assemble the squadrons in grammont corporal collins and his coverman took off down the road towards grants headquarters while the remainder of a troop mustered by the light of their campfires the moon had set at midnight and it was still pitchdark lankester addressed his troop in the most composed manner imaginable the french were on the move he began the troop would be likewise soon but they should not expect any more intelligence since the duke himself found it in scarce supply what i can promise you however with as much certainty as maybe is that if you do not fill your bellies with something warm within the next halfhour there will be scarce the chance to do so in a week by the time that edmonds got the troops together from the outlying billets it was after five and there was reasonable light but collins had brought back a change of rendezvous and command the purpose of which was not immediately apparent to the major vivians brigade why the change but no matter mr barrow he called briskly to the adjutant send an orderly to sir hussey vivians headquarters the regiment will now march on enghien column of troops if you please and turning back to lankester he asked quietly why do you suppose we are changing brigades well if herveys own understanding of the dukes design is correct i suspect vivians is going on to the left flank to keep contact with the prussians and will need an extra regiment so you think herveys excursions all over brabant these past few weeks will repay his efforts smiled edmonds he supposed better what would be the french point of attack than did anyone i should have wagered a hundred guineas bonaparte would strike towards ostend he may do so yet but i tell you this lankester there is not space between here and brussels to check them if things continue as they have begun i cannot for the life of me think why uxbridge has not formed divisions even if there were no chance to gather for drill there are just too many brigades loose and we have not a clue as to our purpose thank heavens at least that we have brigadiers who know what theyre about can you imagine slade in such a crisis lankester could only too well but at enghien which they reached soon enough they were not enlightened much indeed they became materially confused too since a large part of the army seemed to be trying to push south and east through the town guns and waggons blocking the roads as completely as ever the enemy could vivians orders which now arrived by galloper were to move on to brainelecomte twelve miles to the southeast astride the monsbrussels highway it would have been an easy enough march under normal conditions but the road was now jammed with traffic the heat was intense and they were not able to water in the town even hervey who had ridden these roads often enough knew of no easier way to braine there seemed no alternative but to push down the road if such it could be called taking to the fields when progress was altogether halted in the event they did well to reach the town at four in the afternoon but there was still no sign of vivian by now the sound of gunfire was quite distinct although from which direction it was uncertain it seemed principally to be from the southeast but at other times it seemed equally to be almost due east towards nivelles edmonds took a bold decision to alter their line of march since gunfire due east as he perceived the dukes design from herveys telling threatened the worst scarcely had the sixth got nosebags on their hot and hungry animals than edmonds ordered mount to be sounded there was a sudden commotion in a troop one of the horses a fractious gelding that more than one rider had cursed as a rig lashed out with both hind legs in the tight press and struck a mare in the rank behind she squealed and threw her rider who managed nevertheless to keep hold of the reins and then stood quite still on three legs the offfore hanging uselessly like a rag arm her dragoon quickly recovered himself took one look at the leg and saw that the cannon bone was shattered immediately he primed his pistol and put it to her head but he held it at too inclined an angle and with insufficient grip so that when he fired the ball scraped along the horses skull and off to a flank striking another dragoon in the thigh the pistol flew from the dragoons hand with the excessive recoil breaking his wrist and the flash and report sent the mare into a frenzy jesus christ spat serjeant armstrong springing from his own horse on to the startled mares neck wheres the farrier in gods name but the farrier was with the others at the back of the column and still they could not calm the mare only a blanket over her head settled things hervey made his way through the press with his carbine as half a dozen dragoons got her down on her side and others made space seeing what must be done he pushed a cartridge into the breech put the muzzle in the fossa above her left eye and aimed at the base of the opposite ear just as daniel coates had taught him he pulled the trigger the mare kicked out twitched for a few seconds and then lay still armstrong began cursing all and sundry for their clumsiness before captain lankester rode up and took in the scene very well then gentlemen first blood to the french let us see to it that they have no more here a troop resumed the march subdued sheepish almost and an even more difficult march it was since the road was no better now than a carttrack though it led straight to nivelles and then beyond to quatrebras they could see nothing of the fighting however as they approached quatrebras about eight the sun setting behind them the village and the important crossroads from which it derived its name was screened by dense woodland but the noise louder though not as intense as it had been in the afternoon was unmistakable and cannon shot flew over from time to time edmonds was relieved nevertheless herveys appreciation had been correct for as they neared the trees he saw at last majorgeneral sir hussey vivian well done edmonds i am sorely glad of seeing you called his brigadier what a beginning i am only just arrived myself come we must find what we are to be about up there he said nodding in the direction of the village as vivian and edmonds entered quatrebras they were met by one of uxbridges gallopers in as great a composure as could be imagined and his instructions astonished them further for all that uxbridge wanted was for them to bivouac in place with just a field officers patrol out on the left flank to make contact with the prussians the sixth to take the patrol then please edmonds i have still to collect the germans from nivelles somehow said sir hussey his hussars of the kings german legion having had a greater distance to march than even theirs lankester made his rounds before taking the picket out what did i say at muster he called here and there with a wry smile you shall not see your baggage this side of brussels plenty of green fodder to cut though put your backs into it boys choosing a lieutenant for the patrol caused him no great thought herveys german and his familiarity with the country were singular indeed both skills were to prove inestimable since the moon was low and though they probed all the way down the road almost as far as ligny they could make no contact whatever with the prussians working their way back to quatrebras soon after midnight the moon having set was even more perilous than the ride out lankester would later reckon it to be among the most hazardous essays of his life and more than once herveys german was the saving of them as nervous dutch patrols beat about the country at about three a prussian hussar came into the outpost which lankester had finally settled one league from the crossroads with intelligence of the prussians battle around ligny after hervey had questioned him the hussars brandenburg was the clearest german he had ever heard he was escorted to vivians headquarters in quatrebras ill news indeed said lankester when he was gone i had not expected to hear of such a reverse which way do you suppose the prussians will retire hervey peered at his map by the light of the outposts fire well we must hope they do fall back on wavre as they are meant to lord fitzroys adc says the duke has consummate trust in prince blücher he says the old marshal would die in the saddle rather than not keep his word to him and what will the duke do now well i spoke before of the defensive position at mont stjean like it or not with the prussians unable to hold the french at ligny i do not see that he has any option but to fall back there and let us hope that that is where the rest of the army is already making for he must maintain contact with the prussians though if he does not then i doubt he is strong enough to hold even at mont stjean and then therell be the very devil of a fight in the forest behind what i could not discern from that hussar was whether the prussians have any fight left in them if the french gave them such a drubbing that they cannot reform then even if they fall back in concert with us it will not be to any purpose it looks forbiddingly as if bonaparte may have achieved his first objective my dear hervey said lankester holding out a flask of brandy you have a truly remarkable grasp of campaigning there is not one officer in a hundred in this army who would have any notion of strategy beyond brigade drill though in fairness they know that drill well enough i hope with all sincerity that you will have a brevet out of all this for one will recommend it though you know edmonds will always anticipate me in that regard but frankly in this army i feel sometimes that you would do better to capture some absurd french eagle hervey had never received praise from lankester before curiously it felt better even than the rare praise he had received from edmonds the master at shrewsbury who had taught him his greek the gentlest of men whose academic interest in battles would have made him envious now of herveys position could have told him why a stoics praise was worthy but a corinthians was an inspiration a little sleep in the few hours remaining before dawn was all that hervey was able to snatch but it was satisfying enough the outpost was called in soon afterwards and they found the rest of the sixth still in bivouac and making breakfast that meal consisted of nothing more however than tea and biscuit from the troopers haversacks there being neither sign nor news of the baggage train other than the periodic crack of a baker rifle from a picket its sharp report easily distinguishable from that of a musket or a carbine there was silence from the direction of the previous days fighting rumour spread around the bivouac that the french had been decisively repulsed that there would be a general advance and that the sixth would be expected to lead it hervey was able to stop these fanciful ideas gaining too much of a hold but it was a blow to them all none the less when orders came at about nine for a general withdrawal the one mitigating detail was that their brigade was to cover the left flank hervey heard one of the younger troopers ask an older sweat if they would see any action there and the sweat began to regale him with an account of sahagun and the retreat across the esla hervey remembered it well it was more than apt but god be praised that slade had not command this time nothing new under the sun is there mr ervey corporal collins called as they took ground in front of general pictons division on the left hervey checked himself sahagun was one thing yes they had faced a superior number of french cavalry there but this was quite another affair upwards of two corps of infantry by his recall of the commanderinchiefs assessment with artillery and cavalry were about to fall on them he knew they had to buy time for the dukes infantry to struggle back to mont stjean and he reckoned that they themselves would be lucky thereby to make the ridge as a regiment it was nothing less than astonishing therefore when they found themselves sitting for three hours awaiting the supposed onslaught three hours in which the dukes infantry and guns were able to march up one of the best roads in europe to a defensive position which hervey had thought one of the best he had seen was this really bonaparte in the field he wondered could it be a feint after all captain lankester rode along the front of the first squadron edmonds having ordered squadrongrouping for the withdrawal a move that placed hervey in fieldcommand of a troop lankester exchanged the odd word with his troopers in a manner so matteroffact that hervey could not but admire the accomplishment as if the owner of some wellrun estate were hailing his contented tenants on his morning ride im sorry first squadron no breakfast no rum no frenchmen but i think well have all of them aplenty and in good time if not in that order he called to much laughter and cheering it could be worse though hows that sir came a voice from the ranks well replied lankester wishing now that he had not said it and trying to think of something it could be raining half an hour later it was an apocalyptic clap of thunder at almost the same instant that the french guns opened up precipitated a torrential downpour which continued throughout their withdrawal to mont stjean but rain or no rain the withdrawal proceeded as a model exercise conducted as if on a field day the squadrons fronted repeatedly the horseartillery troop unlimbering and engaging each time in support then it would be guns cease firing out of action and light dragoons threes right at the trot march it was repeated once twice so many times that noone would remember precisely only once did they nearly come to grief in genappe when third squadron took a wrong turning their captain unable to read his sodden map in the sheeting rain hervey realizing the error had galloped after them and brought them back on to the right road just in time for the horse artillery to deal with a squadron of landers pressing them hard even barrow had been moved to remark on the address he had shown it is my opinion sir he exclaimed to edmonds shaking his head in disbelief as third squadron galloped back on to the chaussée that the service can ill afford to lose such a man for want of promotion it was the last place from which hervey would have expected praise thunder lightning rain in torrents and mud up to the fetlocks the instant a horse left the pavée the conditions were a trial worthy of the most exacting reviewingofficer but the enemy seemed unable to press to a decisive advantage three hours delay before resuming their advance it was all hervey could think of three hours what a difference that unaccountable failure was now making it had been the dukes deliverance no less and dusk earlier than the day before with so heavily overcast a sky now began to envelop them in a blanket of safety as they reached mont stjean the lanterns of dozens of staff officers rallying the regiments to their collecting areas and thence to bivouacs near their battle positions none of those officers could have expected the rearguard in such good order soaked exhausted hungry men and horses but in formed bodies under perfect discipline three hours what a price bonaparte had paid already for that inexplicable stay had he not himself told his generals to ask of him anything but time there was now a chance just a chance chapter fourteen a hard pounding mont stjean waterloo june before dawn broke the bedraggled troopers of the th light dragoons were roused from their sodden sleep by the hands of the inlying picket the flattened corn which had at first afforded some comfort to backs aching from long hours in the saddle had also held the surface water as if in a honeycomb so that saddle aches had given way to cold cramps everywhere men scratched at beards three days old and felt the griping of empty stomachs there was a rank smell about the place worse than was usual even for such a rough bivouac so dark and hurried had been their camp that latrine discipline was all but ignored there was no breeze and few fires had survived the torrents of rain to take away the fetid air the sixth had never liked to bivouac with others whose legionary habits they deplored and as the troopers moved silently to the horse lines they were further dismayed by a trumpeter some way along the ridge blowing reveille soon to be echoed by others of neighbouring regiments in a cacophony of different pitches and they cursed them for the racket which put their own stealth to nought a drummer in an infantry battalion began beating emphatically the rain had drummed all night at least it had now abated to little more than a drizzle a hand shook herveys shoulder but only a touch was needed to wake him except for the few hours he had snatched the night before it had been over a year since he had slept on the battlefield but the instincts of the previous five remained in any case the rain had allowed no more than a fitful sleep it had been near midnight when he had at last lain down he had peered at jessopes watch by the light of a provost marshals lantern and looking now at the sky with the first intimations of daylight over where he supposed and prayed the prussians must be he estimated it to be about four oclock the hand had moved on but johnson was there in its place with a canteen of tea he wondered how he had been able to find a fire on which to brew it on such a night and reckoned that not one officer in a dozen would be woken in this way yet in spain noone had wanted this little yorkshireman the canvas of herveys valise had kept out much of the nights downpour but the thunderstorm which had accompanied the withdrawal from quatrebras had been too much and he had crawled into it already soaked to the skin now he shivered as he took the tea couldnt get no brandy or nothin johnson said a german ad some snaps but e wanted gold for it gold we cannot go another day on liquor and tea johnson groaned hervey where are the quartermasters still progging i expect sir ive been up alf tnight wt orses an theres no sign of nobody why is it so infernally difficult to bring food up to the army astride a high road he sighed despairingly so there is nothing for the horses either no surrounded by corn and no hard feed do you suppose there is anything to be had johnson oh ay sir chirped his groom artillery waggons ave been comin in all night theres plenty o shot an shell by all accounts thank heaven for that at least thought hervey though he could not fathom why it always seemed to be a question of alternatives powder or shot rations or fodder they had snatched a hurried breakfast on the sixteenth at lankesters insistence and there had been nothing since only biscuit geneva and tea and green fodder now he was grumbling and that vexed him even more could he not put up with an empty stomach for a day or two there would be plenty enough to fill it after they had swept the french from the field damn it johnson heres a guinea go and buy anything we can get our teeth into he sighed the dawns drill was routine however to be done on the emptiest of stomachs the regiment stoodto just before five and twenty minutes later when the sky had lightened enough for edmonds to be sure that there would be no attack at first light they had stood down as the order to dismiss was passed along serjeant strange who had again stepped effortlessly into the boots of the troop serjeantmajor came up to give the muster report rank and file seventyfour presentsick three absentsick three missing two horses sixtyeight and the armourers serjeant strange corporal ford is ready to begin now sir i shall get them to sharpen by halfsections and i suppose there is no sign of rations and forage some barley has come up but little else serjeant armstrong has been foraging all night but hes not found much he says the place is fair crawling with troops never seen so many we shall not be able to cut any of the corn either since its all been flattened there was nothing gloomy in stranges delivery simply matteroffact both of them had seen it often enough before in the peninsula but half the troopers were new drafts who had seen nothing more arduous than a field day outside cork or a review in phoenix park they did well yesterday though think you not serjeant strange the greenheads ay they did well enough but i cant say as we were pressed that hard sir true enough agreed hervey and then he smiled but the troop has stolen another march in getting the armourers heaven only knows how many times we hacked with blunt blades in spain we want none of it today he thought of salamanca and the repeated cutting to rescue darcey jessope how many do you suppose the duke has here sir how many what he replied conscious that his thoughts had been elsewhere how many troops do you believe the duke can dispose on this position how many can you see serjeant strange well i have not seen this many tightpacked since he looked thoughtful exactly so i would hazard you have never seen the like even with your service well i may tell you something the duke can dispose of eighty thousand or nearabouts strange whistled an uncharacteristic display but continued hervey he is so suspicious of bonapartes intentions that he planned to station onequarter of these at hal and tubize lest the french march on our flank for the channel ports and i believe he will have done so even now still a goodly number more than ever he has had before for a single battle i should surmise but less than half are our own and most of those are largely untried mr hervey began serjeant strange warily you are not saying that you doubt the outcome today not for one moment he replied without hesitating but bonaparte can dispose of so many a hundred thousand they say that it would be rash to suppose we might spend a second night here he will for sure have a superiority in guns and he has the initiative so will be able to concentrate them the dukes artillery amounts to a hundred and fifty pieces no more and he must dispose of them along a wide front but what a front sir indeed so serjeant strange and you will not have seen the half of it it is a very handsome position to defend there is a château at yonder end of this ridge which is a veritable fortress or will be once the guards have done with it and you have learned all this in riding with the duke mr hervey ay we rode every inch of the ground but i tell you serjeant strange the duke will come to rue leaving that corps at hal for with the forest behind he has little space to manoeuvre and he has a great want of reserves without the prussians he runs a very close race indeed shots now rang out raggedly the length of the ridge as the infantry proved their cartridges and firinglocks and the sentries whose muskets had been primed for their night watches discharged them rather than risk drawing the charges soon the cavalry would be doing the same with their carbines and hervey winced every time he had heard it in the peninsula he had winced how we do flagrantly tell the enemy of our position and strength serjeant strange do we not break the most fundamental principle of war and all because of a worry over damp powder it is so needless too for with percussionlocks there would be no fear for it well that is true sir i reckon your carbine must be the only one of its like in the field today had i the opportunity i should have bought one for myself whatever the price for it might be the difference between the quick and the dead on a day such as this exactly so said hervey the rifles at least might have had them if his majestys government and the ordnance had shown a little more address indeed they might there is nothing those riflemen would like more than to load on their bellies hervey smiled with him it is a mercy at least that bonaparte never laid eyes on the patent for he would have had it in the hands of every tirailleur by now campfires were burning soon after standdown primed by the same powder for which there was such a fear in the quantities the troopers of the sixth had used to light theirs the combustion was not an altogether reliable indicator of the absence of damp but the flames augured well the horses were unsaddled and given their few pounds of uncrushed barley slade would never have permitted that thought hervey but edmonds knew he could have them saddled up sharply enough in the event of an alarm and sir hussey vivian had yet to issue even a preparatory movement order theres a stream just behind the ridge mr ervey sir said johnson as he handed him another canteen of tea its a bit brackish but right enough the downpour had not been without its advantages then for a want of water near the position would have delayed them sorely well replied hervey since that halfloaf of bread you bought will not detain us long i shall shave it can be a passable substitute for a good nights sleep ill fetch thee some hot water then theres some on the boil for serjeant armstrongs potatoes potatoes said hervey with some surprise how can it be that you found the most expensive loaf in flanders and armstrong finds potatoes where in heavens name did he there was a commissary officer pissing by the side of the road and enough johnson i can guess the rest he sighed fetch my razor if you please by the time the armourers had resharpened a troops sabres it was almost seven and edmonds came walking through the lines with the rsm just as herveys men began their meagre breakfast of tea and parboiled potatoes the older ones gave him a cheer and hailed him with easy banter thought tloos was meant to finish im then major called one old sweat well if you remember harris we were never permitted a crack at him that day laughter and more cheering followed and just a shade forced hervey thought not much of a choky then elba eh sir called another sweat an old indiaman and you of all people would know about chokies finch raucous laughter and cheering erupted nerves were on edge hervey concluded could be worse sir it were snowin at sagun that it was smiler and it seems an age ago dye think we shall ever get a christmas at home in my case major edmonds its more a question of whether ill ever get a ome at christmas there were peals of laughter and hervey smiled at the black humour the soldiers secret weapon edmonds had a way with these men of that there was no doubt different from lankesters very different but equally effective more so perhaps for lankester was held in respect and admiration whereas with edmonds it was respect and affection hervey admired them both though if pressed he would have owned to aspiring more to lankesters patrician ease edmondss obvious devotion to his troopers made him somehow more vulnerable he seemed to know every man by name nickname in many cases including recruits who had only just joined in the weeks before they had received their sailing orders hervey had thought him worn out beyond repair but now his solidity seemed never more welcome for though there was laughter in the ranks its nervous edge suggested a rawness which needed nursing well mr hervey began the major with a smile it has come to pass and just as you foretold hervey had muttered but a few words of reply and with no little selfconsciousness when a commotion behind made them turn the sight rendered both speechless for the present indeed it would endure in the mind of every man in the sixth that day they were all to witness it to be recounted in drawing rooms and alehouses alike for years to come for the commanderinchief on his favourite charger copenhagen accompanied by a galaxy of senior officers and their staff a veritable troupe dorée was making his ceremonial progress through the lines the dukes gelding his sleek chestnut coat the picture of condition was as well known as his rider to the old peninsular hands though his breeding was good hervey had heard tell his dam had a line to the rutland arabian he was not the handsomest of horses certainly not one to have tempted darcey jessope but the duke had told his staff many a time that though there were many handsomer and faster he had never known copenhagens like for endurance and bottom handsome is as handsome does smiled hervey to himself but the rawest recruit could recognize the dukes own profile and it was as well for he was not in uniform he wore instead the same blue coat of that first mornings ride when they had chased the hare his buckskin breeches and tasselled boots were too of a pattern that might have been perfectly at home in piccadilly his cocked hat was the only appreciably military apparel set off by four cockades the hanoverian black of king george and three smaller emblems in the colours of portugal spain and the netherlands the four armies in which the duke held rank of field marshal but all would later recall with what presence and authority did he make his inspection he acknowledged the salutes with an expressionless nod long acquaintance with his army had scarcely inspired love on either side but the duke had confidence in their steadiness in defence and they in turn trusted his choice of ground and dispositions there was no cheering it did not seem appropriate and it would not have been welcome across the valley bonaparte would soon be making the same procession and at his approach drums would roll bands would strike up veillons au salut de lempire his soldiers would cheer him to the heavens vive lempereur and the sound would carry across to the sixth not half a mile distant no the duke did not permit cheering for if he allowed it once it might invite the opposite in other circumstances as he neared the end of a troop he paused good morning major good morning mr hervey i trust the sixth will guard the flank keenly you shall see action enough even over there we shall today show bonaparte how a sepoy general defends a position edmonds made some appropriate reply and hervey swelled with pride at the dukes attention but the nobility of the majors comportment could not hide the wound and then hervey felt meanly for his own pride while this officer of thirty years loyal service received no more recognition than was indicated by his badges of rank but the duke was never a one for flattery and edmonds might soon take comfort in that knowledge for the earl of uxbridge as conspicuously militarylooking as the duke was otherwise chose at that moment to test albeit unwittingly the fragility of their association you had better apprise me of those sepoygeneral plans duke he said with a smile lest i be required to execute them plans replied wellington sharply i have no plans sir i shall be guided by circumstances edmonds raised his eyebrows and then harris sir hussey vivians brigade major riding up with orders to proceed to the flank took the dukes second barrel before he could utter a word ah harris you may tell sir hussey that i will have his hide if the brigade so much as thinks of leaving that flank for a minute well mr hervey said edmonds at length when the duke had passed by and harris had relayed his brigadiers orders the commanderinchief seems a trifle liverish but no matter let us go and mark our ground we are indeed to be the leftflank brigade as you supposed though i confess to being surprised that we are to be the directing regiment that much at least was a compliment to edmonds thought hervey for it would have been easy enough for vivian to relegate them to the supports the dukes plan he cleared his throat as he realized his difficulty that is to say the dukes dispositions are as he anticipated them to be during his reconnaissances good god man not you too edmonds snarled dont you damn well turn into another of those arselicking fops that go by the name of staff officers in this army of ours say what you damn well mean the duke has plans of course he has plans or else hes even more of a look hervey he wont confide in uxbridge because of all the trouble with that strumpet of a sisterinlaw i am impressed no i am greatly impressed that you are so much in the mind of the commanderinchief but i am truly dismayed that uxbridge his own secondincommand should appear to know so little hervey thought to make some amending remark something that might restore the majors bruised pride but nothing came to mind that might escape another tonguelashing indeed sir was all that he judged prudent but edmonds could not leave things unresolved well he barked what do you suppose are these damned circumstances the duke refers to hervey considered it was allornothing time sir the duke is relying on a rapid junction with the prussians they must come to his support here or he knows he may be too sorely pressed yes yes go on demanded edmonds sir the duke has disposed his line along this ridge with three strong positions forward as anchors these are the château of hougoumont on our right he pointed to the distant roofs the farm called la haye sainte just below us here in the centre and the farms at papelotte and la haie over on the left below where we shall take post yes replied edmonds this time more measured sir the french will not make a frontal attack their strength is in manoeuvre they would be unwise to manoeuvre against our left however since that is the direction from which the prussians must come they must therefore be expected to mount an attack which might envelop our right hougoumont will thus be of prime importance edmonds paused for a moment admirable hervey quite admirable he said almost inaudibly thank you sir and then with a sigh he turned to him again i am put in mind of the late lord chesterfields dictum hervey was unaware of it there is a silly sanguine notion his lordship said once in the house of peers that one englishman can beat three frenchmen and this encourages and has sometimes enabled one englishman in reality to beat two hervey smiled broadly those may indeed be the odds here sir two to one all should be well then edmonds smiled too come let us repair to the flank we may have nothing to do there but at least we know what we are meant to be about hervey saluted and returned to his troop cornet seton canning his only officer and serjeant strange would be expecting orders canning looked more boyish than ever that morning but other than listening to his troop leader with intense concentration he showed no signs of anxiety the first courage was always the greatest hervey recalled yet he rued that the duke would have to depend on so much of it in this battle if only the american war had not taken the first battalions the peninsular veterans but canning had been steady enough the previous day as had the others new to battle and hervey had made up his mind that boy or not he could trust him by heavens he himself had been only a year older at corunna next he sought out armstrong a few words of appreciation for his nights foraging seemed in order he found him sitting on an upturned campkettle the reverse of his sabretache serving as a writingslope and scribbling hurriedly hervey could not recall seeing him with a pencil in his hand before and it brought to mind the teacup in the garden at horningsham a smile came at the thought serjeant armstrong is it not a little early to be writing a memoir he called armstrong acknowledged the jest but with some reserve nobody would be wanting a mere serjeants account when all you officers is so eloquent with the pen hervey frowned no sir its me last will and testament never ave ad cause for one before now and ive always thought it tempting fate for a soldier to write one heavens man youre indestructible youll be seeking absolution next said hervey with genuine surprise ay that an all mr ervey if i could find a priest i might very well do so serjeant armstrong he replied resolutely if you could find one priest who would not envy your dutiful record i should at once become a papist myself well tell that to my caithlin if i stop a musket ball with my vitals today and be so good as to witness this will meanwhile hervey smiled again as he put his signature to the document you know of course that i cannot be a beneficiary and a witness too well i cannot very well leave my wife to you can i though she is my only possession of any worth but i know you wouldnt see her fall on the parish armstrong fixed him with an unyielding look you may depend on it he replied and there was a second or so of intimate silence before edmondss trumpeter sounded stand to your horses very well then serjeant armstrong to your post right marker righthand troop brigade rightregiment thank the lord we are not with general grant on the right of the line eh sir hervey looked puzzled why because if the duke ordered the line to rightwheel i should be marking time for three whole hours they both laughed that was a real joe miller serjeant armstrong but you took me by surprise nevertheless away with you and good luck private johnson answered the trumpet with jessye she looked uncommonly good with not a scratch from the day before johnson had even made quartermarks but still hervey had second thoughts no nero i think please for once his groom did not argue take er for the minute then sir an ill bring im up the sixth mustered quickly and without ceremony edmondss brisk commands moved them to the left at the halt in column of squadrons there was a minute or sos wait to allow several ammunition waggons to clear their line and then it was walkmarch by the trumpet along the unpaved chemin dohain towards their vigil on the flank the scots greys with the rest of the union brigade trotted by in the other direction towards the crossroads at the centre of the line they were a rare sight they had scraped off most of the mud which had covered them from head to foot the day before but the rain had caused the dye of their red jackets to run over their white belts as if the sanguinary work they were about to begin was already completed guidbye lights yell be unco palled over there they called the sixths troopers were happy enough to return the banter and trade goodhumoured insults but they had more than a suspicion that the greys might be right that they would indeed see nothing of the fighting which these scotsmen craved so much but hervey was first astonished at the impertinence for here was his regiment with all but eight successive years campaigning and yesterday was the first action the greys had seen in a quarter of a century their spirit could not but be admired however the first courage again they meant to make up for those years and knew they would have every opportunity of doing so and he knew too that afterwards they would never let anyone forget it why are they so particular about ridin greys anyway sir asked johnson after a mutually incomprehensible exchange with one of their troopers well said hervey it is their name surely i mean why did they ave to ave greys in the first place i beg your pardon johnson i mistook your meaning it had nothing to do with their horses their uniform was grey cloth when first they were raised i wouldnt want one of them ats thats for sure johnson scoffed certain that the bearskin must topple over in the charge no nor i they are uncommonly attached to them though i think they captured many from the french grenadiers in the duke of marlboroughs wars what is most vexing though is that they must now dock their tails i envied the heavies the days when they had long tails i think it the most abominable thing still that we must do it i thank heaven that chargers are exempt i could not bear to see jessye plagued by flies as i have seen others well if dealers would stop docking em before they was remount age we wouldnt ave to buy em its because all them fashionables wants em that way yes youre right of course johnson i dont think many believe any longer that docking strengthens the back the chemin dohain took them past an extraordinary patchwork of uniforms the red of the british infantry the backbone of wellingtons campaigns predominated but there were lines of blue coats too of the dutchbelgian corps with the distinctive orange facings of their militia battalions and then the more familiar green of the kings german legion exiles whose hatred of bonaparte would mean no quarter to any frenchman hapless enough to fall prey to their bayonets of the dutch hervey was not so sure during his reconnaissance the duke had confided his concern at having so much of his army made up of untried allied contingents and for that matter untried british battalions but his own infantry were well drilled at least whereas the dutchbelgics had until recently been drilled in french methods there had been many sneering asides hervey himself had made some but word now was that they had given a good account of themselves yesterday at quatrebras perhaps then the concern would prove unfounded hervey prayed that it would be so for if they were to face bonaparte in the strength that the prussians had felt yesterday and then for once just for an instant as he watched a company of rifles doubling along the road he wished that he might be elsewhere than with the sixth dye see those riflemen johnson id give a deal to be with them today for they will be in the thick of things come what may cant say as i would johnson replied with a shrug theyre as big a bunch of roughnecks as youd find that is as may be but you should have seen them six years ago on the retreat to corunna i tell you had it not been for their discipline and marksmanship in that march over the galician mountains well let us just say that more than one corps owes its survival to those men what are they meant to be about today then sir they will take up positions out in front of the brigades to counter the french tirailleurs and then to harry the columns of infantry i tell you they may rely on being in the thick of the action come whatever and did you hear what those infernal greys were saying that we were riding to the flank like ladies withdrawing after dinner but then a voice called him back from his thoughts hervey hervey the sight of lieutenant hugo styles with a detail of the nd life guards was almost too much and he would have turned nero away but that styles suddenly spurred towards him like a man demented grabbing his arm after almost colliding with him hervey my dear dear fellow is this to be a real battle herveys jaw fell i think that is the general idea he replied in his astonishment he had not meant to sound scornful but styles in any event seemed in no condition to detect scorn intended or not hervey i am given command of a troop i cannot do it herveys first instinct was to express himself not in the least surprised that styles did not count himself able that he was a pompous selfimportant ass that he was about to get his comeuppance and that it was no good whining now having looked down his nose for so long but for all his desire finally to cut him down to size hervey hesitated for what of the wretched troopers of the life guards who were equally new to the battlefield and in need of steadying instead he deloped of course you can do it styles you are an experienced officer and your men will follow you he said staunchly hoping he might sound convincing but that is it you see styles returned quickly i cannot recollect myself i do not know what i am about hervey suppressed another urge to speak sharply to demand that styles stop snivelling and take a hold of himself instead he continued with his quiet reassurance styles my dear fellow that is how we all feel he lied you will do your duty well enough you will be capable i tell you is that really so hervey you too have doubts thank you thank you his eyes were now wild with alarm let us dine together at westbury when this is over i shall tell henrietta lindsay of your composure yes indeed we shall dine together hervey knew it to be unlikely and he cursed him in his heart for bringing henrietta to mind styles would forget this exchange soon enough he warranted he was glad of the excuse to rejoin his troop when the squadron trumpeter sounded the trot the repeating cs of that call never failed to thrill they spelled action they signalled an urgency to close with the enemy or to put some distance between them and the snorting of the troop horses who knew the call as well as their riders and the jingling of bits added to the exhilaration but this morning hervey found no thrill the flank was by the rubrics of the drillbook the appointed place for light cavalry and he himself had recognized the wisdom of doubling to two brigades on this occasion but he knew nevertheless that they were leaving the seat of action far behind for bonaparte would not attempt anything on their flank with the prussians so close even the dukes dispositions seemed to confirm it for as they trotted along the road atop the ridge bordered in places by thick high hedges or sunken by as much as a mans height he saw less and less of the familiar and reassuring red and more of the blue coats and orange facings of the allies wellington would not have so disposed his weakest forces had he expected them to face any determined action herveys heart sank further yet he saw that the dutchbelgics were setting about the position with a will cutting gaps in the hedges so that cavalry could pass through digging out embrasures for the guns and making loopholes for the riflemen they even cheered heartily as the sixth rode by after threequarters of a mile they reached their appointed place opposite the hamlets of papelotte and la haye a few hundred yards across the valley to their right and they executed a smart evolution from column into line coming to a halt on the forward slope with the warm sun on their faces herveys troop in the second line forming the support to b lankester at once called him forward how do you suppose this conforms with the dukes intentions he asked the senior captain and also thereby edmondss secondincommand was remarkably free from pride to enquire thus of his junior thought hervey i think it very exactly as the duke intended sir he replied see in that scattering of farms below us mark the roofs yonder he intends disposing his nassauers they may be there this minute and if you stand in the stirrups you can just see la haye sainte below the crossroads close where we bivouacked last night that he has garrisoned with some of the german legion and the rifles we cannot see the château at hougoumont for it is perhaps a mile beyond the farm at la haye sainte here see i have a sketch of the position the duke said that he intended to place four companies at least of the guards there and he will need to for it will by now be nearer the french lines than our own lankester studied the sketchmap intently and there is nothing to our east but the forest of ohain no replied hervey warily a couple of leagues or so beyond the forest will be the prussians on this side of the dyle river we must hope for i believe the duke will want for a junction with them ere too long it was still not eight oclock but everywhere steam was beginning to rise from the ground the horses the saddlery from the men themselves and from the roofs of the dwellings in the hamlets hastily abandoned by their occupants and now garrisoned by the duke of saxeweimars nassauers only a year or so ago these men had fought for bonaparte but wellington must surely be confident of their steadfastness to trust them to such a position even on this flank would that i were able to find such faith replied lankester sceptically and hervey nodded as with growing despair he surveyed the sodden ground a gun team nearby struggling fetlockdeep in mud to drag a ninepounder along a rutted farmtrack majorgeneral sir hussey vivian rode along the front of his brigade calm assured and exquisite in the hussar field dress of his old regiment accompanied by his black trumpeter that he ought by regulation to have been wearing general officers uniform mattered not to vivian who cared only and jealously for his hussar brigade even lord fitzroy somerset on the dukes behalf had chided him as he had the other cavalry brigadiers though to no avail especially since uxbridge himself insisted on wearing the dolman but if vivian was at all dismayed by the appending of the th light dragoons to the hussar brigade he had never once shown it he had even placed them on the right of his line good morning general said lankester as the brigadier reached first squadron he and hervey saluting together i think it may be another toulouse for us by all accounts ha laughed vivian you will recall that i was in a field hospital with a damned ball in my shoulder along with lord george but i doubt you will be inactive here today bonaparte is in the field and he is sure to manoeuvre against us in any event i do not think that we shall long remain in this position the prussians are marching to us and i fully expect them on this flank by noon i do not suppose lord uxbridge will keep us idle thereafter let us hope not general lankester replied but i am surprised the french have made no move yet not even their artillery has begun harassing fire sir george wood believes it is too wet their guns would have no ricochet fire and since wellington has placed most of his infantry on the reverse of the crest their shot would have limited effect he believes too that they have few howitzers we should not forget that bonaparte is first an artilleryman and will not join battle until he is sure of his guns he must be deuced confident though to be awaiting the ground to dry out what with the prussians about to fall on his flank at any moment we are sure of the prussians then general we had better be i dined with muffling some days ago and he swore that blucher had given his word that ought to be enough well i for one would be content with a prussians word exactly so sir edward but to more pressing matters uxbridge has recalled mercers troop to the centre temporarily i would hope there is a dutch footbattery making its way hither in its stead though with little enough haste ill warrant i do not suppose however that artillery will be a requisite for some while at least but good luck to you gentlemen i must now have words with sir john vandeleur vivian gave them a cheery wave in response to their salutes as he spurred into a canter towards the adjacent brigade well sighed lankester what think you of taking away mercers guns the duke will have an inferiority of them it is sure and will make up for it by wheeling them about sir george wood says our horse batteries are the envy of all the french included that is as may be hervey but what use is a footbattery to us it cannot support any manoeuvre perhaps that is why it is sent to us to anchor us to the spot then it would have been more expedient to remove our horses smiled hervey but what chance do you give our manoeuvring in this soft going even had we mercers troop still nothing faster than a trot without risk of losing formation but at least the french will find the going as heavy look hervey if we do go forward then you must keep up close and check the pace you will not be worth the name of supports otherwise we have drilled often enough i am confident of b troops handiness in the rally but holding a troop as supports at the right distance is of the essence heavens but these are difficult evolutions to accomplish at the best of times indeed sir replied hervey and i have seen so many regiments drill in the weeks since we arrived that i have my doubts that all will be capable in this regard hervey i have not the slightest doubt that some are wholly incapable i saw the union brigade at drill less than a fortnight ago a real dutch ball it was the scotch greys are as handy as a thames barge without a rudder and if any run on today they will pay dearly as indeed may the poor souls who will have to recover them a rattle of distant musketry towards the centre of the line or perhaps beyond and the first that morning stayed further reflection on the state of the cavalrys drill hervey looked at his watch a little after eleven he said curious that musketry should open a battle such as this replied lankester i think it must be skirmishing around the château suggested hervey then it seems he is to force that flank after all conceded the captain turning his charger round and making back for his place in front of the squadron but the sound of skirmishing did not distract them long for across the valley there came the first sign of activity in three hours a troop of horse artillery trotted on to the opposing ridge and fluttering lance pennants just visible two hundred yards or so to their rear indicated sizeable supports unlike that memorable day at toulouse which had given hervey opportunity and tribulation in equal measure he took out his telescope and studied the troop as it began to unlimber the gunners dressed in hussar fashion manhandling four burnishedbrass cannon into line with the sun now high over the french lines glinting on the barrels and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward ai beg your pardon sir said herveys trumpeter book of joshua he replied absently joshua waved his spear and it glinted in the sunlight the signal to spring the ambush on the canaanites the trumpeter nodded joshua was my first hero hervey continued still peering through the telescope i remember as if yesterday the first time i heard my father read that lesson it is strange is it not to think of those fearsome acts of war recounted in so tranquil a place as a church strange indeed sir a very contrary thing can the bible be agreed the trumpeter readily hervey lowered his telescope with a sudden thought it was the sabbath his father would be in his pulpit this very minute and henrietta perhaps in his congregation but before he could indulge his thoughts of horningsham too deeply his trumpeter cried out excitedly look sir a galloper lieutenant the honourable charles dawson the distinctive blue busbybag of the th hussars flying horizontal as he sped along their front called to him as he passed sport hervey im off to bring mercer yes he sighed well may he gallop after mercer with still no sign of that damned dutch battery sir hussey vivian with whose summons for mercers guns dawson now sped was contemplating the courses now open to him there was but one of any aptness however for launch what he might at the guns they would be overwhelmed by jacquinots lancers beyond their red and white pennants now unmistakable in the clear morning air and any cavalry would first suffer sorely from the batterys fire as they advanced in such heavy going no he would have to wait for mercer or the dutch wherever they were and he was certainly not prepared to retire behind the ridge so soon for it would sorely try the nassauers in the hamlets below steady as their reputation might be if they perceived the line to be withdrawing but curiously no fire came from the troop they merely stood like the rest of the french line in eerie silence hervey turned to look at his own command he saw the apprehensiveness of the new troopers and the impassiveness of the older ones who were mostly chewing tobacco at the end of the first rank the flanker armstrong sat with the faintest trace of a smile on his lined face like some seasoned foxhound waiting patiently at the covertside assured of the good sport to come not serjeant strange though not that hervey was able to see him behind the rear rank his face would reveal nothing whatever he then looked over to the other squadrons noting with pleasure the congruity of the horses within troops which long custom and attention since their return from spain had ensured there was his own troop consisting entirely of dark bays there was b with blacks c like a with bays d had lighter browns e the smallest but smartest were all chestnuts and f were mainly blacks with some dark bays all were compact active types mainly irish few were over hands at most and although the practice had been discontinued by an army order of the sixth in common with most other regiments still mounted all their trumpeters on greys no he thought the regiment did not disgrace sir husseys brigade and if they had to ride at this battery well after what seemed an age but which the adjutants journal would record as one quarterhour only the sound of mercers troop returning broke the silence the thud of hoofs pounding on soft ground the clatter of running gear and above it all the jingle of harness the six gunteams galloped straight through the gap between vivians and vandeleurs brigades on to the forward slope and deployed in two sections the faster way of coming into action than by the usual three divisions as they did so a thunderous fire erupted far over to the right i think it has begun in earnest then said hervey to his trumpeter coolly eleventhirty by my reckoning but before the man could make any reply the french battery opened up ripple fire so that the gunners could better observe their fall of shot and correct the rounds went high but one gun at least needed to make no corrections its shell slamming into the ground and exploding five yards in front of edmonds his horse a fine black mare bought the previous summer at banbridge and edmondss pride and joy was thrown screaming on to her back legs flaying frantically for several seconds before falling still the major lay motionless by her side his body riddled with splinters his neck broken the sixth let out a groan the like of which hervey had never heard one trooper close by threw up noisily another fell out of the saddle in a dead faint he himself was frozen with uncommon horror mr hervey take command of the squadron please he heard lankester saying as the captain rode forward to assume edmondss place rsm lincoln and the majors trumpeter himself bleeding from the lacerations of a dozen splinters were already dismounting to carry their commanding officer to the rear lankester had to think quicker than ever before as with dismay he perceived that his first order in command might be to retire as shameful to him as it was perilous to the unity of the line the french gunners with the range thus established would now be loading solid shot rather than shell or even doubleloading both in open order the roundshot would go through each of the four ranks like a hot knife through butter but they were at least drawn up in line of squadrons by vivians prudence or the need to show a wide front he could not know which was there enough time even to go threesabout to get behind the crest but then if the french corrected high there might just be lankester had it dismount he shouted no reviewing officer could have faulted the steadiness with which the sixth executed that command it was as if they saw edmonds himself observing the movement and they rendered it precisely as required in the manual as he would have wanted it in open order they did not need to make ready taking the time from the man in front each trooper threw a lock of his horses mane into the left hand at the same time quitting the right stirrup and placing the forefinger and thumb of the right hand on the pommel of the saddle then a pause before the second motion bearing on the left stirrup assisted by the right hand each man brought the right leg clear over the cantle many a trooper repeating to himself the orders his rough rider had barked at him so many times in training in this position the body is to be kept perfectly upright the shoulders well back the breast out the belly in without constraint the back hollow the thighs and legs together and the head turned to the front over the left shoulder the third motion brought the right leg to the ground and the left leg from the stirrup scarcely had the left foot touched the ground than the four guns fired in unison three roundshots whistled just above headheight to go bouncing harmlessly down the reverse slope the fourth slammed into one of mercers guns now unlimbered and being aligned with the handspikes it turned the big ninepounder over as if a toy crushing the layer beneath the barrel he screamed so loud that mercers own fire order could scarcely be heard shell one thousand three degrees he called through a speaking trumpet while the ammunitionnumbers ran forward to the stricken gun the other layers worked as calmly as if at drill on woolwich marshes calculating the angle of the forward slope with the plumbline in order to offset the threedegree elevation on the tangent sight but hervey heard the range one thousand yards with surprise and hurriedly pulled out his field sketch no sir he called to the astonished artillery captain as he dropped his reins and sprinted towards him i have paced it eight hundred mercer turned with a look like thunder but herveys confidence was unshakeable truly sir i have paced it it is no more than eight hundred yards that slope is deceptive mercers profession was not about being deceived by slopes sixteen years an artillery officer most of them on active service and this boy from a cavalry regiment was correcting his fire orders in front of his troop the layers stared at him frozen for an instant yet something in herveys manner was so compelling that for the first time since leaving woolwich mercer accepted a correction by heavens boy you had better be right he shouted menacingly eight hundred two degrees two guns ranging number sections lead gun fired followed by the second sections hervey watched with admiration but anxiously as the crews worked with mechanical exactness the ventsmen had their leatherstalled thumbs over the touchholes in an instant to prevent the ingress of air blowback from smouldering powder was ever the risk while the number sevens swabbed the barrels with spongestaves both shells arched faithfully across the valley to strike their target squarely the first exploded between two of the guns felling most of the gunnumbers the other set light to an ammunition limber and the secondary explosions at once threw the remainder of the battery into confusion mercer confirmed the settings as the number eights were loading the bagged charges and their fixed projectiles the number sevens turned round their staves and rammed home the charges with the solid end the ventsmen stuck prickers down the touchholes and primed them with quills of gunpowder the leadgun numbers struggling to reposition and relay their pieces after the violent recoil fire shouted mercer the gunnerlayers ignited the primers with portfires and the four remaining ninepounders belched their explosive shells at the horse battery twenty seconds it had taken by herveys reckoning faster even than a rifleman might reload they wrought a woeful havoc too the french gunners who were not yet casualties of the ranging salvo cut down almost to a man by the splintering metal cheering erupted from the ranks of the sixth but mercers work was not finished number one shell carry on remainder three rounds shot three degrees fire he called adding the extra degrees elevation for the heavier roundshot having killed the gunners he intended completing the batterys destruction it was as much vengeance as military necessity the french might have killed the sixths commanding officer but they had also killed three of mercers gunners and destroyed one of his guns in two more minutes the gleaming french cannon and limbers were a wreck of shattered wood and twisted metal the drivers having decided on prudence rather than on bringing their teams forward with shell continuing its ruinous work stop cease loading ordered mercer and his gunners began making safe again sponging barrels and returning charges to the limbers while the captain grimfaced turned and rode up to herveys squadron well done sir hervey is it not he asked raising his hat it is sir said hervey returning the salute and wondering how it might be that captain cavalie mercer should know his name if we had fired at one thousand yards the rounds would have fallen unobserved beyond the ridge the french had our range and would have fired off three salvos before we could have corrected on to them i think they would have broken us said mercer gravely before adding with a sigh that is why adyes pocket gunner condemns contrabattery fire except where the infantry are suffering more than the enemys hervey added on an impulse upon my word a cavalryman who has read the artillery manual i thought you read only french novels replied mercer without the trace of a smile and he reined about and trotted away to lead his troop out of action hervey now looked about for the rsm praying that there might be news that edmonds would somehow live though knowing there could not be had he but died gloriously sword in hand going for the enemy not this way unceremoniously with the opening shot even though hervey had seen men beheaded by shot or disembowelled by shell splinter edmondss death was still unseemly lankester called him over hervey he began with a shake of the head i have not time to begin to express to you my regard for there is immediate business to be about you are not the senior lieutenant but strickland is new to us and besides i do not wish to take him away from third squadron at this time so you will keep first squadron for as long as we are in action this day but remember this first has always been the directing squadron and to reorder that now would be imprudent it will come to action soon enough and when we go forward keep the pace steady or else the supports will take off and therell be the very devil of a mess yes sir replied hervey resolutely lankester smiled you will do your duty well enough matthew but it did not come to action as promptly as lankester had expected midday passed with the noise of battle continuing to their right but still nothing of consequence to their front hervey sat motionless before his squadron it was not the first time he had seen clear air between himself and the enemy but hitherto behind him had been no more than a picket a halftroop at most he wished profoundly however that the circumstances had been different that in front of him two horses length and to his left there might have been edmonds he raised a hand to wipe away the moistness in his eyes mr canning he bellowed cornet seton canning closed up from a troop and saluted sir mr canning if we are to advance you will keep the pace steady and remain within strict support distance do you understand there must be no bunching or running on to b and in this heavy going it will not be easy i do not wish to be bumped i shall do my best sir you may depend upon it he replied eagerly i know you will said hervey encouragingly and then as if they were at some field day he began examining his cornets understanding of the battle canning why do you suppose that battery came into action against us to test our strength sir perhaps yes but what did it achieve nothing sir in the larger scheme of things are you sure well i let me put it to you that it has told the french two things first that they cannot tempt us from this flank too easily and second that the duke will send guns here if we are threatened i see sir but to what use would the french put that intelligence how do you suppose bonaparte will fight this battle he would not risk manoeuvring against this flank with the prussians close enough to take him in his flank as he did so and he is too much of a general to attempt a frontal assault so he will manoeuvre against our right suggested canning that is what i should do having first tried to tempt the duke to reinforce elsewhere along his line at the expense of that flank so do you now think there might have been purpose in that batterys otherwise imponderable action yes sir replied canning in evident awe of his seniors grasp of strategy yet not long after cornet cannings admiring response at about one oclock there began a series of events which astonished them both astonished them all a cannonade like the crack of doom erupted from the massed batteries in the french centre so loud that it made the horses start even on this distant flank nero all but threw his rider who had dropped the reins to record some detail in his sketchbook though hervey could not see the guns because of the lie of the land and the smoke now drifting across the valley nor indeed any fall of shot he concluded somehow that the cannonade was directed on the centre of the line to what purpose however he could not immediately discern canning too thought they must be directed at the very place they had bivouacked why do they pound the centre sir do they expect the duke will reinforce it that could be so yes but it is now so late in the day that bonaparte is chancing much by doing so it will be telling with what he follows for it is the very devil of a hard pounding will not all the infantry in the centre be carried away by shot asked canning incredulously if they were to stand in its way yes replied hervey but the duke will have disposed them on the reverse of the slope they will be sorely plagued there but by no means as ill as if on the forard canning nodded feeling foolish for not having come to that conclusion for himself but the cannonading continued longer than ever hervey had supposed likely for a full halfhour or more and the sound of the guns carried to brussels where the doors and windows shook and to antwerp and even across the channel to kent where two days later before news of the battle reached england the kentish gazette would report that a heavy and incessant firing was heard from this coast on sunday evening in the direction of dunkirk hervey how will the french attack asked canning at length hervey at first confessed himself puzzled yet if they do assault the centre they must first break up the dukes line for the musketry of those battalions would be too great for advancing infantry to withstand he may suppose of course that his artillery has shaken our infantry so badly that they will not stand bonaparte has too a fairish quantity of heavy cavalry and if these move against the centre then the brigades will have to form square thereby reducing the number of muskets that can be brought to bear he must support them with horse batteries of course or our own cavalry and artillery would frustrate him but if he followed up at once with infantry in large numbers he might gain the crest and what should we do then our orders are to stay in this place replied hervey cautiously and indeed if we abandon it the french might very well take advantage and turn our flank though i still cannot see how they dare risk doing so with the prussians so close where are the prussians then sir asked canning ingenuously we may be sure they are making best speed towards us canning do not be affeard of that but sir if the french were about to gain the crest in the centre what would be the good of our remaining here surely canning your shrewdness does you credit for that is the very question on which the battle might turn and that is why we have generals i see sir replied the cornet reassured while hervey merely lapsed into thoughtful silence a quarter of an hour passed little could they make of what was happening in the centre because of the dense clouds of smoke drifting across the valley but then between the thunderous volleys there came a different sound cheering shouting drums and soon quite distinctly although almost a mile away cries of vive lempereur and as the cannonading fell away the distinctive beat of the drums could be made out rumdum rumdum rummadum dummadum dum dum what is that hervey asked canning with a look of alarm it is called the pas de charge he replied ominously peering through his telescope though still the powdersmoke was too thick to see whence the drumming came and then the smoke cleared enough for there to be no doubt see there canning that is how the french will attack nay do attack canning put his own telescope to his eye and gasped but but what said hervey briskly but they come in great columns like greek phalanxes and the cavalry can see lancers and cuirassiers they are on the flanks you said they must first make our infantry form square then if our centre is intact they will pay dearly how fast can our infantry volley i confess i do not know sir for i have never seen them canning replied sheepishly twice in a minute and they do so in two ranks only instead of three unlike every other army in the field hence the duke can dispose of such a long line how many do you count in those french columns i cannot rightly see for there are so many hervey peered even more intently through his telescope as the clouds of smoke cleared the massed battery having halted its bombardment well canning unless i am very much mistaken those are not battalion but divisional columns they will be even more susceptible to fire canning continued to study them but there seem to be hundreds so tightpacked that that ball and case would ravage them ay indeed and our infantry will enfilade them too in those french divisions there are probably eight battalions six hundred men to a battalion theyll front two hundred twentyfive ranks deep or more but why suppose yourself for a moment to be standing in the path of one of those columns might you not be intimidated yes sir i fancy that i might well that is how bonaparte has swept so many from the field these past years i tell you canning it takes nerves of steel to stand your ground before such a machine hervey and canning every man in the sixth indeed now watched with a mixture of exhilaration and dread as three divisional columns all of fourteen thousand men marched up the slope astride the brussels high road towards the strongest part of the dukes line while a fourth veered towards papelotte farm and the nassauers below hervey could not at first believe it a frontal assault no manoeuvre and this from the greatest proponent of that art in europe he felt somehow cheated that in their first direct encounter with bonaparte they faced the tactics of the battering ram but with what magnificence did that assault unfold the drums kept up the pas de charge almost as intimidating as the cannon fire which had now ceased the solid ranks of bonapartes bluecoated infantry with their whitened crossbelts forced their way through the uncut rye which covered the slopes the dukes guns began now to play on them and gaps opened to be sealed almost at once as the ranks closed up and pressed resolutely forward a furious fire erupted from papelotte farm below where the sixth stood as the nassauers poured volley after volley into the column as it engulfed the buildings further towards the centre bylandts dutchbelgian brigade broke and fled but the cameron highlanders behind rallied and met the french with a storm of musketry which kept them from making any progress beyond the crest not a man in the sixth could have relished the situation of the dukes infantry yet their enforced inactivity made them fretful once more might they not have harried the columns at least the dragoons began cursing and even the horses champed at their bits but it seemed to hervey as he peered ever more intently through his telescope that the momentum of the french attacks was broken some of the columns were at a standstill and he could even see redcoated infantry on the forward slopes by la haye sainte and then came a sight that at once both thrilled and agonized him in equal measure for at that moment there was nowhere for a cavalryman to be but with the dense host of scarletcoated horsemen the union and household brigades with uxbridge himself at the head as they poured over the crest and down into the valley to set about the reeling columns in an instant the greatest of battles would be over and without the sixth so much as drawing swords the ground shook with the thundering hoofs of heavy horses he saw the greys their mounts so conspicuous amongst the browns and blacks of the other regiments the tall bearskins of the dragoons themselves distinctive even at that distance they were having the best of it scything through the disintegrating ranks of french infantry and overrunning an artillery battery which had misjudged its withdrawal he saw their heavy sabres rising and falling again and again and again as they cut the gunners down but then beyond he saw also what the greys evidently had not lancers and cuirassiers in prodigious numbers moving to the countercharge and he cursed the unfledged heavies blind in their ardour they would hear of the dukes displeasure soon enough if they ran on without rallying but then he saw with mounting horror that few would live to hear that rebuke for their horses were so blown by the heavy going of the hollow beneath the ridge that the french must surely catch them before they might retire sir hussey vivian came galloping across the front towards where sir john vandeleur sat with his staff equally transfixed by the greys perilous situation you had better go to the heavies aid sir john he shouted take the sixth as supports if you will lankester smiled the words were keenly judged for vandeleur was vivians senior hervey smiled too that is why we have generals he had said to canning it was indeed for he had heard the dukes words plainly enough and woe betide vandeleur if he misjudged it lankester smiled again more obviously this time for they would sit in contemplation no longer sixth light dragoons draw swords he ordered the rasp of metal on metal set herveys teeth on edge as the sabres pattern with their wide curved slashing blades were drawn from steel scabbards rasping meant blunting but this time he welcomed it as the sound of grim resolve and he knew that not one of his troopers new or old would be satisfied to return his sword unbloodied form a third support line for vandeleur then sir edward called vivian as he rode back keep them up close but hold them tight to the rally for if you too fall foul of the french i cannot come to your aid ay sir hussey replied lankester we shall at least sweep the french out of the farms below and then as vandeleurs front line took off at a brisk trot lankester gave the order sixth light dragoons will advance first squadron directing walkmarch by the time the sixth had cleared the ohain road and angled right towards the grand battery vandeleurs regiments were into a steady canter the falling slope giving them additional impulsion lankester increased the pace to a brisk trot but still the regiments were opening too great a distance and he had to press into a canter although the ground was so bad that dressing was soon lost by the time they reached the bottom of the valley he had given up the struggle and they too were in a gallop before ascending the far slope every gun in range now seemed to turn on them men and horses began to fall bowled over like rabbits there were all manner of profanities after each new explosion close up close up hervey called continually then a shell burst not ten yards to his left the blast tumbling nero so quickly that hervey could not leap clear the big black gelding fell heavily snapping its neck and dropping stonedead on top of him riderless horses galloped by so close he marvelled he was not trampled when they had run clear he struggled to free himself though every bit of wind seemed knocked out of him but his leg was pinned fast by neros dead weight and there was no shifting it searing pain shot through his head and then darkness chapter fifteen voilà grouchy near la haye sainte pm allez vite fouillezles he lay in fetlockdeep mud pinned fast by nero the horses bulk obscured his sight of all in the direction of the shouting in the other lay the bluejacketed bodies of his troopers fouillez et tuezles chacun vite vite he could just make out a lance pennant over neros flank thirty yards away perhaps nearer then a pistol shot as unseen a lancier dispatched a halfdead trooper before searching him he was closer to panic than he had ever been he had nothing but his sabre to fight with for nero lay with the saddle still in place and coatess carbine trapped in the holster beneath the nearside holster was empty but even had the pistol fallen within reach he knew it would be useless after lying in the mud and now there were more hoofs and a different voice better french a voice of authority rather than of mere rank he stopped struggling and strained to listen les prussiens vont the prussians were making for the left flank of the english said the lancer officer the emperor is at this very moment strengthening his flank at plancenoit but there is little he can do to prevent the prussians joining the field we must not let our brave soldiers lose heart when they appear the emperor wishes it to be known therefore that he expects marshal grouchys men at any moment on that flank the marshal is marching even now from genappe where they have beaten the enemy whoever appears on that flank are not prussians but grouchy and our countrymen voila grouchy comprenezvous mes braves so bonaparte would deceive his own soldiers yet how might they be deceived for long he wondered because the battle would be a closerun affair even perfidy might have its reward he heard the lancers moving off but his relief was shortlived for one of them had dismounted and begun searching a troopers body not three dozen yards away he now had but one means of escaping the same fate as the wounded man the carbine no matter how much he heaved he could not pull it from the holster though he fell back in the mud almost despairing but his sabre lay still attached to his wrist by its knotleather and he could at least die swordinhand only then did he see how simple it was to release the carbine for it was the holster itself which was trapping it if he could cut it free he could then pull both from beneath the horse he set to work on the holster straps with his newly sharpened blade and in a short time managed to pull it free from the saddle the carbine had been more thoroughly immersed in the cloying mud than even he had been a flintlock would now misfire for sure could he rely on this percussion lock he eased himself up on to an elbow again to fumble for a cartridge from his smallpouch wiping it clean and praying once more that water had not permeated the gut casing still pinned fast under nero he fumbled to unfold the carbines butt the click of the retaining pin seemed as loud as a pistol shot he lifted open the breech and inserted the precious cartridge he cocked the firinghammer and brought the carbine up into the aim steadying the foresight as it bisected the horizontal between the upper arms of the v of the backsight his aim wavered for he could not lie fully prone he waited for the lancer to come closer until at twenty yards the man was now larger than the v and the bisection was level with his chest he breathed in and then held his breath to freeze the aim taking up the play in the trigger please god he prayed such long odds a percussion cap from the kirk and a cartridge from a sheepfarmer please god the crack was deafening and a curtain of powdersmoke billowed before him death or deliverance awaited its clearing yet he did not doubt his aim and the curtain parted to reveal his skill the lancer lying stone dead his chest a frothing crimson hervey now pulled himself upright the freeing of the holster allowed him the extra reach to cut through the girth straps and with the saddle loose there was enough play for him to struggle from under neros dead weight at last he sprang up halfsurprised that his leg numbed after its constraint was in one piece for he had seen many a leg shattered in lesser falls the lancers horse stood obligingly still by its erstwhile rider he seized the reins and leaped into the saddle despite the pain now displacing the numbness only then did he see serjeant armstrong galloping back down the hill towards him oh thank christ mr ervey i thought you were done for come on quick sir the regiments gone back therere lancers everywhere you dont have to tell me that said hervey with a grimace as he spurred after him the french horse was sluggish and he had to use the flat of his sword to move him apace through the mud kneedeep in places how did we fare he called to armstrong we saw em off sir he shouted back but jesus that lance is a fearsome thing we need that bloody weapon ourselves some officers went down i saw captain elmsall and captain roberts fall an i think theyre dead lankester dolefully confirmed as much when hervey and armstrong reached the depleted ranks of the sixth back on the ridge above la haye hervey i am doubly relieved at seeing you he called as they galloped up and saluted there is but nail left of the troop leaders and no more than a halfdozen other officers what of cheney sir asked hervey in dismay and laming laming is right enough but i think he will lose an arm cheney was set about by lancers while he was trying to rally second troop canning brought first out with stranges help the boots did well hervey would have heard the entire muster roll but bonapartes intrigue was the more pressing and instead he rattled off his intelligence lankester listened intently and even with an incomplete knowledge of wellingtons design for battle comprehended its significance at once very well go immediately to lord uxbridge if he is still with us that is for he was at the head of the heavies and in the thick of things when we reached the greys uxbridge had returned to the place whence he had led the heavies in the fateful charge against derlons columns behind the crest of the ridge astride the chaussée he held as it were the tollgate to the brussels road the french infantry had paid a terrible price attempting to force that gate and would do so once more but there was now a change in the pace of the battle if not quite a lull then a perceptible slackening yet despite his earlier exertions the earl of uxbridge looked just as he did at a field day his pelisse off the shoulder in true hussar fashion his dolman immaculate his shako set square hervey was discomfited by his own mudspattered appearance thankful at least that he had not lost his own shako uxbridge seemed not to care in the slightest well done mr hervey he replied on hearing his report i am only gratified that your french was sufficient and that you had some notion of the implication of such a ruse but we must waste no time trying to find the duke marshal bluchers liaison officer baron müffling you will remember him i think from our review last month has this hour set out to discover what is happening with our gallant allies ride after him take the wavre road inform him that no go with him in person to the prussians i myself shall tell the duke hervey thrilled at the commission he was no mere galloper but an emissary and from the duke himself to the dauntless prince blücher he gathered his reins as calmly as he could saluted and then sped back to the sixth gone was the mares sluggishness and instead she bucked for the best part of a hundred yards while he tried painfully to apply his leg to pick her up how in gods name did the french school their horses he wondered next time mr ervey sir im gooin with yer called johnson as hervey reached the regiment its not right gooin off in a charge an leavin me wheres nero johnson its as well that you did stay here or you might now be lying down there with nero and a lance in your back he replied curtly look take this french trollop i will have jessye from you now where is serjeant armstrong here sir came the confident reply from behind hervey turned and saw his broad smile and his swordarm in a sling i had not appreciated that you were bloodied serjeant armstrong he exclaimed is serjeant strange fit ay sir but what do you want of him asked armstrong suspiciously i have a dispatch for the prussians and need of an escort this arm will not fail you armstrong declared pulling it from the sling no i cannot risk it fetch serjeant strange if you will replied hervey sharply bringing a welter of protests from his coveringserjeant which were only silenced in the bluntest of terms johnson attempted likewise to protest and he too was silenced only with difficulty when strange came up hervey explained their assignment and then instructed armstrong to tell lankester of it receiving a surly salute in reply as he and strange took off down the ridgeroad after the baron jessye bucking as violently as had the french mare halfa mile beyond the flank picket of vivians brigade they saw at last general muffling and his escort the same distance again and about to enter the forêt dohain hervey quickened the pace still more though stranges horse was beginning to tire and it seemed that they might close the distance before the prussians were too deep into the forest but he had gambled on speed alone to keep them safe and the gamble now looked like failing for suddenly as if from nowhere there came a check to their progress perhaps even an end three or four hundred yards away and trotting towards them red tunics and tall chapkas vivid against the background of green was a lancer patrol their redandwhite lancepennants fluttered a full fifteen feet from the ground and hervey might have admired them had they not been standing between him and his mission he counted a dozen unpromising odds to say the least and he knew he had but two options he might run back to the security of the allied line it scarcely was an option though for stranges horse would soon be outpaced he tried instead to judge the angle between them and the french and the point where they might gain the cover of the forest but it was so acute that a gallop in that direction offered little chance of success either yet he must make a decision strange had already made it go on sir ill stop them he had never before heard such urgency in stranges voice stop them strange said stop not delay both knew what that meant for stopping could only be at one price go on sir hervey undipped the carbine from his crossbelt and thrust it and the cartridgepouch at strange here you know the mechanism well enough that he did for the carbine had been the talk of the sixth in ireland and he had fired it he took them without a word but reached inside his tunic and pulled out what looked like a leather tobaccopouch though hervey knew he did not smoke here sir take this for later and go on now he urged spurring his tired gelding towards the patrol and good luck mr hervey he called over his shoulder good luck to you too serjeant strange said hervey beneath his breath as he too spurred into a gallop there was no show of sentiment the formality was exaggerated even hervey knew he would have done the same himself had their circumstances been reversed and that strange was only doing his duty as countless other serjeants were doing at that moment but it made it no less gallant he reckoned strange would be able to get off four or five shots before the french closed with him but this was no guarantee that the lanciers would be dissuaded from pursuit for the patrol if it knew what it were about ought to divide one group to deal with strange the other to intercept him but he guessed they would not for he had never thought much of their patrolling kneetoknee in the charge yes but not this sort of work and pride would surely get the better of them when the first lancer was hit he gambled well even against the continuous thunder of gunfire a mile away he heard stranges first shot then after a few seconds another then another and another then nothing with fifty yards to go to the trees he looked back the french had made straight for strange and there was an evenly spaced line of four dead or dying lancers each shot which strange fired mounted had told and now the best marksman in the regiment was parrying a lance with his sabre hervey looked away for an instant to fix his opening into the forest when he turned again strange was no longer visible overwhelmed by the french stop them indeed strange had known precisely the price he would pay the forest swaddled him in leafy silence as he slowed to a jogtrot then a walk for jessye was blowing hard first edmonds now strange he wondered who might live to recount this battle his head hurt sorely the trees were a blur and he was all but overcome by the urge to lie down dropping the reins and letting jessye take him along the rutted track oblivious now to his surroundings a pistol exploded he felt the ball kiss his cheek bark splinters flew as it struck the tree behind magpies and jays scattering in noisy flight making jessye shy votre épée monsieur rendez votre épée shouted the chasseur à cheval hervey touched the graze curious that there was no pain nor then any blood on his fingers his gut tightened his mind raced the plume of the chasseurs busby changed from a blur to sharp detail and he saw that neither flight nor resistance was prudent in the face of two cavalry pistols not ten yards ahead je dis encore monsieur rendez votre épée but the voice somehow lacked assurance though the escorts five six or even more looked solid enough eh bien lieutenant replied hervey measured thoughtful quest ce que vous faites ici the lieutenant looked surprised it was for him to ask that question he stammered what was an englishman doing speaking this way hervey felt himself trembling uncontrollably yet he did not know if he were his voice almost broke as he now grasped his chance alors messieurs je ne suis pas anglais je suis lagent de lempereur the lieutenant looked anguished cest pas possible but hervey would not let him finish instead piling on his doubts he reached into a pocket the escorts gestured with their pistols and took out the de chantonnay ring see this it is the seal of the de chantonnays my seal no frenchman can fail to recognize it the lieutenant rode up closer and peered at it do you not have papers of authorization monsieur he asked sceptically what to be found by the english or the prussians do you take me for a fool rasped hervey in his most imperious french i have papers well enough but you will find them only with the emperors staff now if you please i have business to be about the lieutenant shifted uneasily what business is this monsieur i am not about to disclose the emperors business to a lieutenant gasped hervey even to a lieutenant of chasseurs then i am afraid monsieur that you must accompany us so that we may verify your identity said the lieutenant hervey was now fired by the deception imbecile he shouted what in the name of france do you think we are about this day you have seen my seal have you not you recognize it surely yes of course monsieur but then let me put to you this for your consideration which only those in the emperors confidence must know the prussians they are expected hourly upon this flank are they not mais prussiens monsieur jamais they are grouchys men no voilà grouchy nestce pas the lieutenant was at a loss and then profoundly relieved oui cest ça voilà grouchy truly monsieur that is so a thousand pardons for delaying you i was only doing my duty you understand may i provide an escort for you indeed you may not thundered hervey you will fly from here this instant and leave me to dupe the prussians away at once the thrill of so outrageous a bluff turned rapidly to cold dread as he pondered the consequences had he failed shot out of hand as a spy sister maria had said you could pass for a frenchman and he had how he wished she might know of the providence of that ring he pushed it deep into a pocket as jessye extended her trot the forest was cool soothing and silent still the thunder of cannon fire to the south no more here than a rumble he began to doze in the saddle again halt came the command unseen he pulled up at once and looked around he could see nothing wer ist das wohin gehen sie but before he could make any reply there came another voice nein verflucht es ist ein engländer he did not hesitate a second time herr general he called the prussians vast bulk unmistakable in any light half a dozen mounted figures emerged from the trees two of the generals cavalry escorts kept their pistols trained on him as he rode straight for muffling and launched into his dispatch with a fluency that took them aback teufel gefährlicher als ich gedacht hatte exclaimed the baron much more dangerous than i had imagined come we must make straight for prince blücher hervey sighed relieved that müffling had grasped the danger and was prepared to act indeed he was first relieved that he took him at his word for he had no written authority nor was he an adc and as they quickened on the generals eyes widened in astonishment when hervey recounted how he had discovered the ruse the general kept repeating his assurance however that all would now be well just as soon as they found prince blücher hervey believed him but his confidence faltered on first seeing blüchers men a halfhour later for where he had been expecting to see a military machine the legacy of frederick the great he saw only disorder some would say chaos never not even during the worst moments of the long retreat through the astorgias to corunna had he come upon anything so disheartening was rabble too extreme a word for this mass of soldiery guns and waggons toiling through mud axledeep it was as if the entire army had become stragglers muffling however knew both his countrymen and his allies and perceived well enough herveys dismay it is true he conceded we were evilly mauled yesterday at genappe but do not underestimate the hardiness of these men mr hervey alte vorwärts has given your duke of wellington his word his sacred word that he will come to his aid you do not suppose that these men will be unworthy of it this pledge of constancy and of the spirit that animated the prince was heartening but it seemed unlikely yet soon it proved true for when they found prince blücher he was encouraging his weary infantry in person kommt meine kinder noch einmal he exhorted them slapping his thigh and waving his hand his intent could be in no doubt and his energy was at once imparted to the jaded footsoldiers when he saw his old friend however he turned his horse and rode up in a welter of earthy opinion mein gott muffling es ist scheisse reine scheisse hervey fought hard not to laugh field marshal blücher the veteran hussar and fighter of the french warm emotional with a soldiers vocabulary and reeking of onions and gin what greater contrast with the duke could there have been blücher even apologized for smelling so rank having dosed himself he explained after a fearsome fall at genappe and shook herveys hand so vigorously that he thought his wrist must crack this officer bears extraordinary intelligence of a ruse by the french said müffling i consider that you should hear it before my own the marshal listened to herveys report in frowning silence and then turned to one of his adcs instructing him to hasten general von ziethens corps to the dukes flank and sir ventured hervey in textbook german animated by bluchers determination to foil this stratagem may i propose one additional order may i suggest sir that general von ziethen opens fire as soon as his men debouch from the forest for although they will be half a league or more from the french the firing will signal hostile intent and should therefore confound bonapartes ruse ja ja richtig das ist eine exzellente idee replied the field marshal excitedly vieles schiessen he shouted slapping his sides as if about to take off after hounds vieles schiessen lutzow he called after the adc hervey was as anxious to be away as the adc for his business concluded he wished to search for serjeant strange but he saw that his progress would be quicker in the company of baron müffling yet müffling showed no enthusiasm for an immediate return blücher and he withdrawing for a full quarterhour to confer alone he dismounted and fed jessye some corn which a commissary was content to give him and as he sat on a fallen tree holding her reins he began to study more closely the men who filed by and what he saw began to encourage him indeed inspire him these men as a body looked as if they had had a mauling and yet they had with them all their personal equipment what was more it was as serviceable as he had seen more serviceable even and the faces of the musketeers of the silesian regiment trudging past though tiredlooking had a fearsome aspect hervey thought he saw in them a positive lust to be at the throats of the enemy the cavalry carefully picking their way around the infantry were even more convincing they too bore the signs of battle but they carried themselves with the same grim determination these hussars knew what they were about how proudly the blackandwhite shakocockades bobbed with their horses action and what horses zey are fine are zey not said one of müfflings adcs who had come over to share his tree handing him a silver flask yes said hervey he could not say other for they were fine horses in the finest condition and this despite their exertions of the past week trakheners ja trakhener do you know ze breed no i have heard much of them but i have never before seen one you admire zem ja very much they are bigger i think on the whole than our troop horses half a hand i should say plenty of bone and beautiful heads too he smiled thinking how much jessope would approve of them you do not have a cavalry stud in england i understand continued the adc offering his flask again no we buy from dealers there never seems a want of good horses ja i admire much your zoroughbred ve are using some zoroughbreds now at trakhenen stud i am hearing to give more speed but your horse is not a zoroughbred i zink no replied hervey with a wry smile facing the hopeless task of explaining jessyes breeding her sire was a thoroughbred but her dam was a welsh cob an old breed from but the adc needed no priming ze velsh cob i am admiring very much he said in delight ze hardy native pony und ze andalusians make zis cob four or five hundred years ago i zink ze ambassador in berlin has von of zese ponies for his son und it is how do you say ze handiest little horse in ze grünewald and i fancy that mine too is the handiest in this forest laughed hervey when at last they began back for mont stjean it took them all of two hours through the mud and the press of men horses and waggons to reach the edge of the forest yet in that time he became confident at last that the prussians would assail the french as they had promised with all vigour and dispatch it only remained to see how soon this would be but searching for strange was not possible for as they emerged from the treeline they saw more french cavalry forcing them on a wide detour herr general began hervey as they reached vivians flank pickets may i ask you the favour of reporting to lord uxbridge that i have done what he commanded i believe my duty now is to rejoin my regiment of course mr hervey you have done your duty admirably and i must apologize again that my hussars mistook you for a frenchman he smiled do not concern yourself about prince blücher he is above seventy you know but still he is a tenacious soldier ein treuer husar as we say he will never give up hervey had halfexpected to find the sixth gone from above la haye instead he found vivians same pickets on the flank but although the regiment had dressed a little towards the centre as the brigades had tried to close the gaps they held the same ground as four hours before has please god serjeant strange ridden in sir he asked hoping against hope that he had somehow made his escape i fear not replied lankester holding out a flask you had better take a draw on this brandy and tell me all that has passed when herveys account was ended the captain turned to adjutant barrow who though hervey had not observed it had been active once more with his pocketbook is there anything more for the record barrow asked lankester no sir he replied except that if i might be allowed to say so this seems uncommon service i am sorry for serjeant strange but mr hervey should not in my judgement let it rest upon his consciousness for it was noble necessity hervey might have resented so cold a dismissal of strange but he recognized the adjutants purpose well enough and lankester voiced the same indeed so barrow and very aptly put he nodded well done hervey you cannot grieve for there has been no deficiency in your conduct and now if you please i desire that you resume command of your squadron for there will soon be hot work to be about hervey was grateful enough for their solicitude yet it did little to reassure him as he rode over to his squadron cornet seton canning greeted him with evident relief as he resumed his place at the head of first for canning had joined the regiment just before they had left cork and after only the first field day he had grasped for himself the extent of his inexperience command of a squadron had sat uneasily with him for the past few hours armstrongs relief stemmed from a different impulse however for he counted his lieutenant more than a mere squadron leader thank christ mr ervey he exclaimed this is worse than salamanca tell me of it serjeant armstrong for i do not wish to dwell any more on my past hours serjeant strange is dead i am certain and i had to leave him in the field armstrong paused but and heaven knew how much he wanted to know of the circumstances he held his peace and began instead to rail against their own inactivity not fewer than twelve frog charges in a row he thundered recalling with startling imagery the attacks on the centre by the masses of cuirassiers and lancires they ave tried to break them squares all afternoon every time they came on theyve been seen off by the guns or lord uxbridges men in the middle the ussars on the other flank ave been all over the place and yet we ave sat ere idle as a monks prick one paltry gallop in the whole day the dukes express orders serjeant armstrong hervey sympathized we are rooted to this flank until relieved by the prussians armstrong shook his head in despair and what good might that do look yonder he spat pointing to la haye sainte there the french ave taken it at last whats the sense of us sitting here then with the centre about to give way half a league hence the duke of wellington turned to the earl of uxbridge and said calmly night or the prussians must come chapter sixteen night or the prussians overlooking papelotte and la haye evening hervey took out his watch the smallest of shell splinters was embedded in its face neatly piercing the letters da j on the cover and arresting the hands arent you the lucky one mr ervey said armstrong that wouldve made the eyes water how was jessope he wondered as he examined the watch puzzling whether the mechanism was still intact how he envied him his situation in the thick of the fighting with lord fitzroy and the duke half after six said armstrong looking at the watch he had found at vitoria where are them prussians then hervey had no answer then brigademajor harris came galloping along the line the tails of his red staffcoat flying like an express boys hallo somethins up said armstrong hopefully hervey agreed and rode up to lankester in anticipation the flank pickets report that prussian hussars are approaching both brigades are to move to the centre as soon as relieved said harris lankester merely looked at hervey for an acknowledgement confident that there was no need of elaboration hervey nodded saluted and trotted back to his squadron his broad smile at once conveying the intention through the ranks are we to ave at em at last mr ervey someone called yes boys nows our time later he would ponder on that familiarity it was what edmonds for sure would have said and lankester too although the captain would more likely have said my boys but hervey had done so unaffectedly and the squadron accepted it as an unbroken horse at last accepts the bit ten minutes later with the first green jackets of the deathshead hussars coming on to the ridge vivians brigade began its move lord uxbridge rode up well done vivian he began you have anticipated the dukes intentions precisely a gap is opening in the centre and some of the foreigners are beginning to waver i may tell you it is damned hot work there herveys mare squealed suddenly as his trumpeters grey flykicked and threw his rider causing uxbridge to turn mr hervey he exclaimed we must speak of certain matters when there is opportunity if your trumpeter leaves you in one piece that is and hervey flushed bright red as the wretched dragoon attempted to remount in a profusion of apologies they trotted all the way to the centre guns may gallop captain lankester vivian had called as they began cavalry proceeds at a trot lest those that do not know us should conceive that we might be affeard lord uxbridge says the cumberland hussars have already left the field and they supposedly steady brunswickers there is noone better than sir hussey for a show such as this said lankester falling in alongside hervey and first squadron he will handle the brigade as if on review and i should do so myself mark you for i warrant that such a show will be all that keeps some of those dutch in place a harsh judgement thought hervey for it soon became apparent that even the kings germans were shaken as the brigade reached the crossroads above la haye sainte they formed into line the sixth extending in two ranks on the right behind general colin halketts hanoverians just to the west of the crossroads with the remainder of the brigade to the rear of colonel omptedas ravaged german legionaries the dutch battery which had been working feverishly as they arrived fell silent smoke obscuring their line of sight and then as the acrid black fog cleared hervey had his first glimpse of the inferno which the slopes had become a sight which horrified the recruits and veterans alike and not only the sight for every sense was assailed it was hotter here by ten degrees or more the powdersmoke was so thick he could taste it and the noise was truly deafening horses went rigid with terror even jessye would not respond to the leg hervey having to dig in his spurs for the first time he could ever remember had they been fretting on that flank for want of this he could scarcely credit it cannon shot flew thicker than he had heard even musketry before and there were so many bodies men and horses that he could but marvel at the steadfastness of these men to his front how had they borne it he thought of waves beating against a sea wall breaking receding but each time washing away more of the wall so that the time must come when it would be gone and what lay beyond inundated the smoke cleared again and he raised his telescope the tall bearskins were unmistakable the garde impériale were advancing lankester trotted along the sixths front as cool as if he were at morning exercise once the infantry have fallen clear of us to the rear we shall charge those columns he called to each of his squadron leaders still certain the hanoverians would break at any moment keep an eye on their cavalry supports he urged nail is hit hervey you are now the senior mind the fortunes of war sighed hervey a cornet less than a year ago a stop on promotion and now within a mere stunningshot of command of the regiment and lankester by exposing himself thus was doubling perhaps trebling the chance of such a shot must he place himself broadside to the enemy but what then was the alternative a covered approach along the rear of his squadrons trusting his orders to the trumpet that was not the way hervey saw the roundshot hit the ground five yards to lankesters offside as he rode back it threw up a fountain of earth bounced with barely diminished velocity and struck the captains bay easily the finestbred horse in the regiment squarely in the flank with an audible thud the third of the four men hervey most admired in the regiment went down like a skittle at a fair he shut his eyes and groaned just as when edmonds had fallen but this time he hesitated for barely a second before pressing jessye towards where the manual told him the commanding officer must stand centre one horses length in front of the regimental guidon and a place he never dreamed he would know except in the pages of that drillbook but how long might it be before rook commanding third squadron would in turn have to ride up to take that place would he at least remain long enough to lead the charge to stop the waves what should he now do what orders should he give the instinct to grasp at the familiar was strong one order at least might be useful if unorthodox shorten stirrups he called they could at least have the benefit of reach if they were to go at these infantrymen the order was repeated along the ranks for it had no trumpet call besides seconds before his trumpeter had slumped forward in the saddle his shoulder carried away by a bullet from the cloud of tirailleurs preceding the garde jessye scarcely moved a muscle as hervey pushed his left leg forward lifted the sheepskin and felt for the buckle two holes would do he was already riding one hole shorter than the adjutant would have approved then the same on the offside all the time without taking his eyes from the field ahead he leaned forward to check the girth hoping it would need no tightening he had pushed her hard and she might well be tucked up but no it was tight enough though he need not have worried about her standing still if he had to take in the girth a hole too for she was as steady as he had ever known indeed she seemed in some kind of trance and so did the rest of the regiments horses as he glanced behind him there was not even the usual napping that accompanied any parade in close order it was as if they were paralysed by the abyss into which they looked would they answer to the leg when the time came he waited it was all he could do now nor was he sure whether he was meant to charge when he judged it the moment or whether the order was to come from vivian but if he did not charge then what he resolved to trust his judgement and answer for it later if there were a later better a rebuke from wellington for excess of ardour than to be remembered as another sackville would the cavalry ever expiate the shame of lord george sackville at minden even the marquess of granby going baldheaded for the french days later had not expunged the stain but how might he lead a charge with this shaken infantry brigade in front and it was not only the living who barred their way for a hundred yards beyond the hanoverians the field was strewn with dead and wounded men and horses no momentum could be had through such a charnel house surely all he might do was keep his gaze fixed forward lest looking about should weaken his resolve and trust that he might have a right instinct in this the garde were magnificent they marched for so long astride the high road straight towards the weakest part of the line that it seemed nothing could stop them not grape not musketry not the boldest cavalry charge ever but then astonishingly they veered to the left so that the main weight of the attack must pass to the west of la haye sainte and to where the guards stood backed by vandeleurs brigade but was that where the guards were it was where they were meant to be yet he could not see them they had surely not withdrawn must vandeleur face the attack himself could this account for the gardes change of axis the threat of the sabre preferred to the volleys of the infantry but the gardes flank battalions were still bearing down steadily on the hanoverians and the legion now began pouring volleyfire into the densely packed columns of bluecoats each discharge felled them in whole ranks like a scythe through corn but still they came on it was impossible that the hanoverians whose own ranks stood sorely depleted should hold once they clashed bayonet to bayonet hervey steeled himself to the order sixth light dragoons draw swords he shouted his voice stronger and clearer than he expected then quietly he nodded to the trumpetmajor beside him all of whose trumpeters had been carried from the field and his own trumpetarm was bound to his chest walkmarch as soon as the germans have cleared our front please and the trumpetmajor took up his bugle knowing he would need its extra octave to sound the call above the noise but the germans stood how he would never know especially once halkett himself had fallen their last volley tore into the blue files pointblank and like a prizefighter swaying after a bodyblow the columns wavered a reserve brigade of dutchbelgians in the short blue jackets that made them look as if they were his own regiment dismounted marched resolutely forward to the left of the remains of the hanoverians and added their muskets to the curtain of fire that prevented the elite of the grande armee from gaining the ridge he felt shame that he had ever joined in the scorn heaped on the allies before the battle but glancing across to where he supposed vandeleur must soon take the main weight of the assault something seemed amiss what is that trumpetmajor he gasped peering through his telescope the smoke is so bad is it the duke i cant tell sir replied the trumpetmajor yes yes it is the duke he waves an arm but i cannot see whom he beckons hervey saw soon enough for as if from nowhere from out of the ground even appeared the guards there must be a thousand no more a red fortress not twenty yards in front of the french maitlands brigade had lain concealed until this moment oh the steadiness the nerve hervey cried aloud their fire was continuous for half a minute never had he seen drill so rapid load present fire again and again the french fell in their hundreds then the guardsmen were rushing forward bayonets glinting in the evening sun which filtered through the smoke and he saw the duke waving his hat in the air he looked towards vivian in front of the brigade the generals voice audible even above the musketry which the infantry were still pouring after the recoiling french columns come now my boys will you follow me and then loud cheering with ay to hell sir hussey along the length of the brigade they surged forward gingerly at first picking a way through the standing remains of the kings germans and the dead and dying of both sides beyond until the slope began to give them impulsion at the bottom they set about a reserve battalion of the garde trying desperately to form square their sabres made light work of the attempt and hervey rallied them quickly to push on to the batteries beyond for the guns had begun a brisk fire again now that the garde had cleared their line as they raced up the slopes he knew it was over with nothing in sight but a few chasseurs scarcely capable of defending themselves let alone mounting any countercharge half a mile beyond la haye sainte astride the high road he led his squadrons straight at a battery of big pounders les belles filles de lempereur he could see the gunners had no fight left in them they ought to have been able to get off a round of grape in the last fifty yards but instead they raced for their horses or cowered under the guns the sixth fell on them with rare savagery the drivers mere boys crying and hiding their faces as the sabres cut at them the troopers standing in the stirrups to put extra force into the downswing noone who did not raise his hands in complete surrender was spared and some who did found it too late hervey still had the regiment in hand by some marvel for blood had brought them to a frenzy and they rallied quickly to the trumpet horses were blowing hard as they pushed on up the slope through what remained of bonapartes army swarming from the field everywhere there was shouting sauve qui peut and trahison too why he could not imagine what part treachery had played in their defeat as they broached the crest whence bonaparte had surveyed the field for much of the day he could see the solid blue line of prussian infantry sweeping over the ridge to the east and down into the valley that had almost seen him dead he quickened the pace yet further for he could see prussian hussars nearing and he was determined to gain the crest first there was no sign of uxbridge nor of vivian even smoke drifted everywhere and the light was fading should he now drive on down the road towards rossomme every instinct was to do so but with noone following him up it was as well that he hesitated for sir john vandeleur would have need of him where are the prussians shouted the general as he emerged from the smoke hervey pointed to the hussars approaching from plancenoit to the northeast t think they will be from general von billows corps sir vandeleur looked surprised by his knowing lord uxbridge is wounded are you the foremost squadron he asked i fear we are the foremost regiment sir replied hervey to the new commander of the dukes cavalry great heavens i had not supposed vivians brigade to be so thinned hold here we are all blown i have not the slightest idea what has become of vivian himself i must have the prussians take on the pursuit i speak german sir if it would help said hervey hesitantly help i should say it will replied vandeleur turning to his staff none of us have a damned word of it help it did for vandeleur would no more have recognized prince wilhelm at the head of von billows cavalry than he would an officer in another brigade and now was not the time for discourtesies sir john was notoriously short on ceremony he managed to give with hervey as interpreter a passable account of the last hours fighting and the prince agreed to take up the pursuit one more matter general said wilhelm his hard berlin consonants commanding absolute attention marshal blücher and the duke of wellington must seal this arrangement i propose they rendezvous in this very place at this inn la belle alliance an apt name for the battle itself think you not vandeleur looked at hervey who did not wait to translate for him we may arrange the rendezvous your highness he began instead but the duke is very particular about naming his battles the army slept that night where it halted on the battlefield itself surrounded by the dead and dying their exhaustion utter the campfires which as a rule lit up after battle like so many stars in a clear sky were few and far between everywhere men just lay down and slept not so in the sixth they could not claim to have suffered as the infantry and hervey had two thoughts only to recover their dead and wounded and to make ready for the advance on paris which he knew must follow soon makingready he could with confidence leave to rsm lincoln and asshetonsmith the senior of the other three lieutenants still in the saddle but recovering the dead and wounded was another matter mr lincoln he began thoughtfully we have but a halfhour of twilight scour the slopes in front of the battery we overran but no further i myself shall search for serjeant strange as you wish sir replied the rsm his voice for once muted but i urge that your coverserjeant goes with you hervey was more than content to take the counsel since there was noone else with whom he might begin to relate his sense of guilt at this time in failing light and against the flow of prussians they trotted northeast the sights and sounds all about them reducing even armstrong to silence for never before had either of them recrossed a battlefield and never for sure one as bloody as this what therefore made hervey check in front of la haye sainte he could not tell the ground was everywhere covered with the dead and dying but one body lying facedown sword still clutched in an outstretched hand even among all the others drew his eye perhaps the uniform looked too pristine compared with the muddy gory remains all around he dismounted and turned the scarletjacketed body over the wild staring eyes which he had last seen on the ridge that morning rolled upwards yet there was no other life so styles had reached the slopes in front of the batteries dying with sword drawn going for the enemy whether those eyes stared in wild fear or with the exhilaration of the charge mattered not hervey would be able to tell his people that their son had died among the enemy and that was all he would need to say it was after midnight before they found strange hervey had prayed so fervently that they might not but his body they found easily alone and where he had last seen him contorted in the agony that the dozen or more lance wounds had inflicted for that was the number the lantern revealed jesus mr ervey cursed armstrong its an infernal weapon its unchristian they wrapped him gently in a blanket as if wounded and then armstrong caught one of the loose horses roaming even this remote corner of the battlefield a chestnut strange had always liked chestnuts unmarked by the battle she stood patiently while they lashed his body into the saddle they picked their way back to la belle alliance in silence once more across a moonlit landscape where ghostly figures shuffled or darted in and out of the shadows at times they were accompanied by a press of riderless horses seeking the security of the herd some barely able to walk so appalling were their wounds it was past three oclock when they reached the inn and burial that night was unthinkable hervey had resolved that strange would have the rites of the wesleyan service so they wrapped his body in a velvet curtain blue the colour which had clothed him in life and laid him in one of the rooms soon afterwards asshetonsmith and the rsm came with the regiments paradestrength hervey studied it through eyes that already ached and which now filled with tears he could scarcely believe the order of their loss for they had been so late engaged only five officers and other ranks would be ready for duty at dawn i have posted an inlying picket only sir said the lieutenant do we standto as usual before dawn hervey checked his irritation at the suggestion they might do otherwise yes he replied simply his leg ached his head pounded and he felt weak for want of food he ought to do his rounds of the squadrons that was what edmonds would have done was it not but surely he had done sufficient of his duty and was it not now his duty to rest the rsm insisted it was and hervey yielded johnson had already taken jessye who had carried him through so much that day without once even stumbling and he now brought his valise hervey put his hand on his grooms shoulder i am glad that you at least he began but then stayed his sentiments and went instead to the nextdoor room in silence he lay on the floor by stranges body and struggled to think of a prayer but sleep came quicker part three aftermath were you at waterloo i have been at waterloo tis no matter what you do if you were at waterloo popular ditty chapter seventeenthe audit of war before dawn june at his headquarters the inn on the brussels chaussée at the village of waterloo the duke of wellington slept he had returned after dark eaten some supper with those of his staff who had survived and then sat down to write his dispatch to the prince regent when he had finished he had instructed the headquarters physician dr hume to bring him the casualty list at first light so that he might attach it one of his adcs sir alexander gordon had lain mortally wounded in the dukes campbed so he had instead lain down in an adjacent room wrapped in his cloak hume crept in silently and placed the list by the sleeping commanderinchief when he returned after daybreak he found the duke up studying it intently his face was still grimy from the previous day and there were traces of tears on the other side of the battlefield hervey wrapped also in a cloak slept too and death in the shape of a comrade was likewise but a few feet away johnson roused him as late as he dared before the squadrons paraded for standto are there no orders for the pursuit he asked as he took the canteen of coffee the beans were johnsons sole find in the inns cellars there were none and rsm lincoln had disquieting news there had been no contact during the night with sir hussey vivian or his staff very well then rsm said hervey resolutely as he rose stiffly we must standto with extra vigilance lest there has been some unaccountable reverse since last light shall i detail parties to search for our wounded sir most of their losses had been on the ridge at mont stjean they would surely by now have been recovered no mr lincoln he concluded i cannot spare even a dozen we must trust to the medical services had he but known that these were already overwhelmed that the wounded were yet lying on the ridge and that some would do so another night he might have dispensed with all caution and taken the whole regiment back to scour for their fallen ask the rm to get the squadrons collecting loose horses if you please but not to venture beyond carbinerange we shall need all the prize money we can lay in for widows pensions the rsm saluted and made to leave but hervey had one more concern is corporal sandbache fit mr lincoln yes sir he replied dubiously then i wish him to read the burial service over serjeant strange he is a preacher is he not hervey made his rounds in silence except for the briefest word here and there to warn for an outlying picket and he held the squadrons a full quarterhour beyond first light for without knowledge of who else was about he would not risk an encounter with stragglers there was a mood of numb relief about the sixth all they wanted to do was get away from this place for never before had they halted where they fought so that the sights the sounds and the smell of the battlefield had remained with them as they lay recruits and older hands alike unnerved by the strangeness of it all night long there had been moaning and shouts for help those of the regiment who had not been called for duty and who had slept soundly had indeed been fortunate those who had stood sentinel would tell of the moaning the cries the screams and the ghoulish sights which the moon had shone upon they had seen men sitting clutching at a stomach ripped open by a sabre slash or a piece of shrapnel one by one succumbing to death as their lifeblood drained away others less dreadfully injured or possessed of some last strength had risen and staggered off into the darkness only to fall down again after a few steps there were horses too that suffered no less and claimed more pity by their helplessness some still lay with their entrails hanging out and yet some of these would live attempting to rise from time to time only to fall back again in the manner of their fellow human sufferers and then all strength spent their eyes would close gently there would be one last convulsive struggle and their suffering would be at an end all this as close in places as a dozen yards yet few even the usual samaritans had dared to venture out of the lines that night for there were too many roaming the field intent on evil business and shots had punctuated the small hours as the wounded who tried to resist the looters were sent to join the dead he walked through the lines of tethered troophorses casting an eye over each to gauge their condition and exchanging a word here and there with a dragoon who felt the need of something to say it amounted to little however since the exhilaration of the gunfire and stirrupcharges had passed and the reality thinned ranks and lost comrades was grimly apparent in the daylight as he neared the inlying picketpost the corporal the ubiquitous collins rousted its troopers for a salute picket commanding officer approaching preesent arms hervey glowered at him but collins returned the look with defiant pride as far as he was concerned hervey was commanding officer irrespective of rank arms would be presented not a mere buttsalute he left the bivouac and crossed the rutted road to see the ground over which they had fought with such resolve smoke still drifted in places but to his left and right he saw clearly the shattered remains of bonapartes folly where the day before there had been magnificence proud cuirassiers fine horses burnished guns fluttering lancepennants the bearskins of the garde eagles tricolours and everywhere vive lempereur there was now only desolation even the silence was melancholy no wind no rain not even the skylark was tempted to song here and there a single shot rang out as a horse too badly injured to be worth hobbling with to the meatmarket was put out of its protracted misery and long chilling screams ending as abruptly as they had begun reminded him that death were it to come were best to come quickly in his profession in the distance the sight was no less doleful for on the slopes of the ridge at mont stjean the sea wall against which the frenchblue waves had battered all day was the red of wellingtons dauntless infantry but they lay in lines rather than standing upright in squares was there so great a difference twixt a battle lost and this de leau monsieur pour lamour de dieu de leau cried one of bonapartes gunners propped up against a limber wheel his pipeclayedwhite breeches were blooddarkened from the oozings of the slash across his chest a slash which one of the sixths own troopers must have made hervey stooped to pick up a watercanteen from a gunner who no longer had need of it and put it to the mans lips the water trickled down his tunic for he had not the strength to swallow and he slumped to one side eyes open in a look of bewilderment yet stonedead hervey closed them with his thumbs into thy hands o lord he murmured he opened a pocket of the mans tunic to see who this soldier of france might be gaspard juvenal said his papers from saintes in the charentemaritime a provincial frenchman whose blood had flowed into foreign soil had he served these guns in the peninsula had they met before in battle or had gaspard juvenal ventured even further from the gironde perhaps to muscovy and seen the basilicas of the tsars capital that un dead an all sir called an orderly examining each body in what remained of the battery yes just replied hervey more than ever conscious of the slender divide no i avent found any alive this side of the road either whoever caught these poor beggars was orrible neat with the sword i reckon some over there is nought but into their teens what in gods name is boney doing fighting with slips of boys dye reckon sir hervey almost sobbed conscious that this was indeed the sixths handiwork instead he turned his remorse against the orderly angered at being touched thus they were old enough to fetch powder and put a portfire to a touchhole if needs be he snapped ay they were right enough sir replied the man readily found ought worth anything on that one sir he continued breezily the orderly would never know how close he came at that instant to knowing the same sabre that had made its accounts at the battery hervey bit into his glove i have not searched him with any thoroughness he said curtly but still the man was not put off then ill have a look for meself sir if thats right by you there was no regulation of which hervey knew that prevented an orderly of the medical services from relieving the dead of their worldly possessions it was indeed a consideration to many who might otherwise have sought a less sanguinary billet with the commissaries wonder if this did him any good sir said the man after a deal of rummaging holding out a rosary hervey cursed beneath his breath as the orderly threw it aside i will have that if you please he snapped right enough sir came the cheery response but its not worth a hapenny when the orderly had finished his work hervey walked over to the furthest gun and sat on the trail of its abandoned limber he put his head in his hands and searched for a prayer that might transport him from the death and despoiling and from the monstrousness of the orderly and his work lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace he began but his thoughts wandered which of these thousands lying before him had been his servants for mine eyes have seen thy salvation he continued resolutely serjeant strange had been his servant and lankester and edmonds too though he would never admit it edmonds the major had been more to him than his own kin these past six years he shuddered at the lonely prospect of soldiering without him but strange had been worthier than any in the sight of the almighty surely and yet he had not departed in peace would his death torment him for ever only then did he remember the oilskin pouch that strange had thrust at him on parting and reached into the deep inner pocket of his jacket where it rested securely with his other keepsakes sister marias signet ring darcey jessopes watch and the prayerbook his father had given him he took out the pouch and unfolded it carefully there was a lock of grey hair in the first fold stranges mothers then a letter hervey would not open it and then a miniature whose likeness was obscure since water had at some time permeated its case small enough tokens of sentiment he concluded but perhaps no surprise from so taciturn a man as strange the doubts began to gnaw at him again had there been no other course but to leave him and gallop for the trees he took out the prayerbook hoping for some relief in its formularies in the thanksgiving perhaps for peace and deliverance from our enemies o almighty god he began who art a strong tower of defence unto thy servants against the face of their enemies servants again service obligation duty the words came crowding we yield thee praise and thanksgiving for our deliverance from those great and apparent dangers wherewith we were compassed mr ervey sir the voice was its usual insistence he turned to see serjeant armstrong striding towards him looking to neither left nor right the brigademajors come i told im to wait and said id fetch you meself what are you doing out here who are you talking to merely taking time to think serjeant armstrong that is all he replied you dont want to be thinking whats past is past gone he insisted arry strange did is duty and thats it well say some prayers over im in a minute or two with preacher sandbache and then its on for us theres no place for contemplating till everythings over sir hussey vivians new brigademajor harris had all but lost an arm after they had moved to the centre seemed rattled i may tell you hervey that we have a brigade in name only he began and the butchers bill is prodigious uxbridge will be lucky to live by all accounts his leg was taken clean off vandeleur is given command but there is to be no pursuit for the army is not up to it we are merely to follow on the prussians in the event that bonaparte turns although i wager he is making for a ship this very instant america they say will give him sanctuary hervey said nothing instead he rued his own illfortune uxbridge close to death a man who might help him and then he cursed himself for his thoughts so the brigade is to march for nivelles continued the bm the sixth are to lead and none too quickly if you please as i said we are not pursuing the french but following the prussians all we must do is get to paris ere they break every window in the city if hervey had never before seen a battlefield the day after action neither had he followed in the wake of a fullblown pursuit the road to nivelles was a trail of abandoned equipment some of it no doubt jettisoned purposefully baggagewaggons and the like which could only hinder an orderly withdrawal but much else betokened rout smallpacks powderhorns muskets and sidearms the odd fieldpiece even nothing of value however for vigorous though the prussians must have been in their pursuit all the signs of a systematic harvesting of booty were there chests broken open and empty bodies stripped and waggons likewise occasionally they came across a clothed body a prussian dragoon or hussar his sword thrust into the ground and his helmet on its pommel the minimal honouring of the dead before the needs of the pursuit had driven his comrades on in nivelles that night the sixth sold the prizehorses to a livery stables at well over the official price twelve hundred pounds for the relief fund hervey was well pleased and the regiments spirits began to revive with the issue of saltbeef and coffee and the modest purchases of wine as at last the commissary waggons caught up with them subsequent entries in the regiments journal would read like milestones along the high road to paris charleroi maubeuge laon soissons sometimes there were unhurried halts other times they marched through the night but never did they see a frenchman offering resistance except once and for weeks afterwards their gallant allies were in consequence held in some disregard by the regiment already indeed the prussians wanton destruction en route was occasioning resentment the dukes instructions for his own troops had been most particular in this respect as they had been after the pyrenees he had even ordered that troops should only of necessity cross standing crops and in single file yet the prussians had put the torch to anything and everything and so in the late afternoon of the last day of june fewer than ten miles short of stdenis in the very outskirts of paris the plight of a lone frenchman brought the sixth to anger they had seen the small château some distance off it stood in the middle of open pasture a handsomelooking house but without any sign of life had it been later in the day the sixth might have made their billet there but instead hervey determined only on a watering halt as the pointtroopers rode into the yard however a shot rang out from a lower window devoid of all glass and shutterless both men turned at once for the cover of the walls dismounting and snatching their carbines from the saddleboots in which they had rested idly for all but a fortnight scarcely had they pulled cartridges from pouchbelts however than out from the doorless château came an old man in his nightshirt raving like a madman and waving a sabre wildly the pointmen sensing this was no serious resistance clipped the carbines to their pouchbelts and drew their sabres instead disarming the defender of the château took but seconds so that by the time hervey and the forward detachment rode into the yard the old man was simply raving harmlessly je suis bourboniste pourquoi vous me persécutez he was shouting hervey dismounted no one meant him any harm he said estce que vous êtes seul ici monsieur the wild eyes darted about as more of the squadron came into the courtyard and he glanced anxiously more than once towards the house which bore the scars of what appeared to have been a brisk fight oui oui he replied hervey asked what fighting there had been around the chateau rien monsieur pas du tout he replied and then his brow furrowed monsieur vous nêtes pas prussiens as soon as hervey had convinced him that they were not the old man relaxed visibly the surgeon was summoned and hervey asked how he had sustained his headwound for blood matted his hair les prussiens monsieur he began they had attacked him taken everything that could be taken destroyed the rest and then tried to burn the house down them is nowt but bloody fiends protested one of the troopers when hervey translated he and armstrong went into the chateau while the surgeon attended the old man christ mr ervey gasped the serjeant theres not a piece of glass not broken the shards were almost ankledeep the remains of fine chandeliers and mirrors shot to pieces furniture evidently the less portable pieces was now merely gilded matchwood velvet and brocaded curtains hung in tatters flameblackened and the carpets were ingrained with excrement in every room it was the same from the top of the house to the kitchens nothing remained undamaged not a window or a door even except the door from the kitchen to what hervey thought must be the cellar which was firmly fastened though it looked as if it too had been off its hinges looks like the prussians werent partial to wine then sir said armstrong shaking his head in disbelief that hardly seems likely after what we have seen do you not think whys it locked then well i wager it was not locked when they left you reckon the old mans hidden something in there then not something serjeant armstrong someone or more than one where is his family perhaps he sent them to paris for safety but how would he know there was any danger no i think the prussians took him by surprise only with the greatest reluctance did the old man give up the keys and he remained close by as they unlocked the heavy oak door a light was burning below more than enough to illuminate the occupants jesus christ exclaimed armstrong hervey shouted for the surgeon the terror in the girls eyes was enough to relate what must have gone before and their soiled white shifts testified to the violence of their ordeal hervey checked his instincts he wanted somehow to reassure them but he knew it was better to leave them to their father and the surgeon he and armstrong picked their way once more through the debris of the great hall this time without a word but then hervey grabbed him by the arm see there he called peering up at one of the corner bosses on the ceiling all were peppered with bullet holes but the decoration on one was still recognizable see what see the device on that corner boss and see here this he replied taking the de chantonnay ring from a pocket it looks the same does that mean anything asked armstrong indifferently well a fleurdelis within a laurel wreath it is the de chantonnay seal and i should say therefore that we were in a residence of the de chantonnays armstrong shrugged that didnt save them two lassies did it the vicomte de chantonnayfougard fell to his knees even amid the broken glass monsieur cest le travail du grand dieu gaining then his composure he explained how he the entire de chantonnay family indeed knew that the ring had been passed into the hands of an english officer after bonapartes defeat it was a little enough undertaking replied hervey but the family was indebted to him protested the vicomte and now he a widower and cousin of the comte de chantonnay must impose once more on that englishman and ask protection of him for his two daughters for their safe conveyance to their aunt in paris au nom du roy et de dieu monsieur hervey thought a while it was not possible for himself to escort them he explained there was not even a carriage in the mews but he would leave a cornet and quaternion at the château and once they reached paris he would see that a carriage was sent for them vraiment les anglais sont gentilhommes je vous remercie monsieur je noublierai jamais cette gentillesse but hervey hoped he would forget soon enough what had occasioned the need of his gratitude and resolved to make a beginning at once mr lawrence he called into the courtyard and up the steps came running the junior cornet his fresh face and fair locks betraying barely seventeen years fewer even than the younger of the daughters mr lawrence you will choose three of the steadiest troopers married men if you can and corporal sandbache and you will make these people as comfortable as you can do you have any french a little hervey sir i mean then speak softly to the vicomte here and clean up a room so that his daughters at least may try to regain some modesty place each man upon his honour and that of the regiment they are to be as your own sisters lawrence do you understand perfectly sir i am sorry you doubt me he added more puzzled than offended hervey sighed i am sorry william it is just that an outrage such as this armstrong however did not scruple mr lawrence sir just tell whichever bastards you pick and that goes for preacher sandbache too that theyll have me to answer to if one of them so much as looks at them lassies paris july hervey had remained in command a full three weeks the regiment had arrived in clichy at the beginning of the second week in july and he had at once put them to the routine of a garrison where comforts were bought only at the price of tedious proximity to headquarters he was not in most respects greatly exercised but one concern in particular was beyond his capability to deal with the speculation in commissions to which the casualty lists had given rise indeed he was convinced that the regiment might soon have officers on paper only so brisk was the trade purported to be his relief therefore when lord george irvine resumed command was palpable and he welcomed even adjutant barrows return from his sickbed in brussels i were getting nicely used to it barrow lamented silk sheets and fine ladies with china teacups treated as quite the gentleman i were lord george would know how best to spike the trade and all hervey now hoped was that his conduct during his brief tenure of command might be deemed worthy for the stop on promotion to be removed of the armys prizemoney his share as a lieutenant amounted to about of which half by custom would go to regimental alms leaving just enough to replace his losses of uniform and campstores he still had not the means to purchase a captaincy but would his command be deemed worthy who might know that he had led the squadrons in the final hour that he had brought them to paris vivian and vandeleur would have seen nothing out of the ordinary lord uxbridge was already invalided home and replaced once more by sir stapleton cotton the fortunes of war seemed perverse in the extreme the summons to cottons headquarters or rather to lord combermeres for so he had been ennobled after spain came therefore as a harbinger of hope yet what might combermere have to say to him that lord george irvine might not all that lord george knew was that combermere apparently wished to question him on some aspect or other of the battle mr hervey how our paths do cross began the general holding out his hand the room in the place vendôme had a more spartan look than hervey had imagined on entering the building you have had quite a time these past few weeks i understand i think all would say that they have been momentous weeks sir he replied guardedly for there was not enough in combermeres proposition from which to infer that he judged his time to have been singular just so mr hervey just so and i may tell you how keenly i feel the want of those weeks it was by no choice of mine however that i remained in england but that is no matter he continued handing him several sheets of paper here my boy i wish you to read this and tell me if in general terms it is accurate sit down if you please hervey took the papers and began to read the first paragraph made his heart pound by the end it was racing and he struggled hard to maintain an even tone in his reply it is completely accurate sir in its facts that is the opinions expressed are of course lord uxbridges they may be lord uxbridges my dear boy but i warrant they would be shared by any who knew the facts said combermere with a smile wait here one moment he added leaving the room by a side door some minutes later he reappeared still smiling the duke wishes to have words with you come the commanderinchiefs room was if anything even more spartan than his cavalry commanders but he too smiled readily as hervey entered and stood to offer his hand sit if you please mr hervey will you have some coffee or chocolate or perhaps you would prefer madeira he asked gesturing towards an adc standing by for the purpose hervey saw no reason for restraint chocolate if you please your grace now began the duke after waiting for the adc to leave lord uxbridge has sent me a long dispatch from his sickbed and in it he recounts the signal part that you played in bringing the prussians to the field at waterloo and baron müffling has acquainted me with the advice you gave to prince blücher it was well judged mr hervey very well judged for their opening fire even at so extreme a range gave notice of hostile intent and thwarted bonapartes stratagem the duke paused and took a sip of his coffee what you do not know in all probability is that the french will to fight appears to have been dealt a mortal blow thereby for since they believed the firing to be coming from grouchys men the word spread rapidly that grouchy had turned traitor bonaparte was hoist well and truly with his own petard you may have conceived on your own account that the battle was a nearrun thing mr hervey well indeed it was the closestrun thing you ever saw the duke paused again to sip some more hervey was transported with pride scarcely able to contain his anticipation of the recognition which this audience must be presaging now continued the duke with a cautionary inflection which brought up short herveys flight of fancy this all amounts to a situation of some delicacy you may be aware that although prince blucher and i share the very best of relations it is not quite that way with general von gneisenau indeed in the very highest matters of state things are not as they should be hervey nodded his understanding i very much regret mr hervey that i dare not make any recognition of what transpired with the prussians at waterloo and therefore of your part in it we must not say anything which in the least part suggests that the prussians did not make all speed and of their own volition and that they fired on debouching from the forest entirely out of their ardour to engage the enemy i must swear you to absolute confidence in this matter it is known to but a handful of people i understand sir he replied almost choking on the words one more thing mr hervey continued the duke his expression now as intense as when they had first exchanged those few words at the convent in toulouse your service to the de chantonnays i am well pleased to learn that my instructions to protect the civil population have been so punctiliously observed hervey returned the look quizzically the de chantonnays are staunchly bourbon my chief of intelligence colonel grant has much cause to praise their assistance these several past years am i to understand too that you have in your safekeeping a ring for the count that is so sir and do you bear it with you this instant i do sir he replied then i think you may soon be able to discharge your obligation in that respect colonel grant will be able to take you to the count he is here in paris and now my boy he declared rising and holding out his hand the smile once more returned you have my thanks again and i wish you good fortune i am certain you shall have it in lord combermeres office with more chocolate hervey tried to reconcile his exhilaration and disappointment what precisely did the duke say at the end asked the general he thanked me and wished me good fortune i think sir he could scarcely remember the flow of things let alone the exact words there was no mention of reward none that i recall sir no none whatever lord combermere looked surprised though hervey did not notice lord george irvine tells me he is to send you back to england with papers for your colonel i should be very much obliged if you would deliver this to the adjutantgeneral at the horse guards it is of a routine but sensitive nature as i understand he said holding up a sealed dispatch and this other to lord george please i will apprise you generally of its contents it commends your service at waterloo without mentioning anything of the prussians and expresses the dukes hope that you might be advanced in regimental seniority or suchlike i am sure these things augur well for the future mr hervey and with that and a warm handshake lord combermere bade him farewell hervey rode back to clichy more thoroughly confounded than he supposed he had ever been he presumed this express wish of the dukes must annul all bars to his captaincy but combermere had not mentioned anything of field promotion and since he was no nearer possessing the amount required for its purchase the prize looked distinctly hollow he had never expected garlands for what he had done but their absence after the promise implied in the dukes eulogy he felt cruelly the following day colonel grant was an unlikelylooking spymaster his features seemed too distinct his gait too obviously military and his voice too loud but of his business there was by all accounts no greater practitioner and if the duke had felt himself humbugged by bonapartes essay into belgium then not one portion of blame would he allow this gallant officer to bear the colonel arrived at ten oclock at the billets of the th light dragoons and to intense speculation among those officers who recognized him he and hervey left by carriage for the house near the tuileries which was the paris residence of the comte de chantonnay footmen attended their arrival and hervey was at once spellbound by the sumptuousness the fine paintings hangings crystal and gilded furniture unaccountable survivors of both the revolution and the recent occupation and he could not but wonder at sister maria de chantonnays willing exchange of all this for her frugal orders there was champagne neapolitan confections and music do you like soler monsieur enquired the count in the clearest of english if this be his music then yes but spanish he was spanish and a franciscan perhaps that is why he writes with such beauty and lightness of touch better even than scarlatti do you not think do you hear those appogiaturas hervey nodded admiringly as the bewigged musician ran breathtakingly up and down the scales of the eightoctave harpsichord in the corner of the grand salon my daughter would approve only of bach however added the count with mock despair his music is much more attuned with her carmelite austerity well mr hervey interrupted colonel grant perhaps it would be appropriate now for you to return the ring to the count hervey made to take the ring from his pocket but then paused he looked at the two men awkwardly and swallowed hard forgive me monsieur he began but i swore a solemn oath that i would give it only into the hand of the comte de chantonnay himself the count looked puzzled and colonel grant impatient mr hervey do you suppose that i as the dukes no sir i do not suppose anything and that is why i must not suppose an identity without its first being reasonably established colonel grant flushed with anger but the count stayed him no no it is well that mr hervey is so conscientious in the discharge of his oath i may assure you that my daughter will have placed the heaviest of obligations on him in this respect what may i do to convince you that i am my daughters father sir hervey hesitated i that is perhaps you might take her own assurance suggested the count hervey looked blank at the notion be so good as to ask mademoiselle to join us said the count to his footman a clock began chiming the eleventh hour and before it had finished the footman returned good morning mr hervey sister marias voice commanded an end to their polite talk she smiled full and warm as she strode towards him across the grand salon and embraced him unselfconsciously i am glad to see you safe from all that we have heard your life has been in very great danger he did not suppose that she could have had any notion of the particulars so he replied with a simple we were fifty thousand in the most grievous danger sister she smiled again that was what she would have supposed him to say it was a smile he had seen many times in toulouse and at first indeed there seemed nothing about her appearance different from that morning at the convent of st mary magdalen when they had said their farewells she wore the same habit of black homespun there was the same stark white wimple that framed her face at their every meeting and the veil that fell around her shoulders in the way that caithlins omahoneys hair fell about hers and yet there was about her a different sort of composure from that which he had formerly admired ma fille the count interrupted perhaps mr hervey would like to see the garden the garden or gardens for there were three distinct ones an italian geometric with elegant little fountains another owing something to the south of the country with terracotta pots everywhere and one decidedly english was uncommonly quiet the noise of the street was excluded and at this time with the sun high and its heat growing there were few birds with any inclination for singing hervey and sister maria walked for a quarter of an hour first in the italian and then in the provencal garden she pointing to some feature and then he to another they spoke little of the year that had passed there was so much that might be said yet hervey sensed their time together was short and for his part he could not thus aspire to relate anything of substance when they reached the english garden he thought it time they should return to the house conscious that colonel grant remained there waiting well sister he began i am gratified that i have been able to discharge my obligation to you and to find you in such manifest good spirits i believe however that i must now take my leave of you you will understand that there are pressing matters to be about sister maria evidently did not consider any matters to be ultimately too pressing you are right she said i am in good spirits i am at peace with god and restored to my family there is nothing more i could desire but you i perceive are not in such spirits something troubles you hervey recoiled at the intrusion just as he had the first time in toulouse nothing troubles me sister he said briskly making some unnecessary adjustment to his swordslings and turning towards the house mr hervey she insisted i am sorry that one year has put this distance between us her words halted him in midstride he did not wish to share his thoughts with anyone now that he had been able so firmly to place them at the back of his mind or so he thought he had placed them serjeant armstrong had upbraided him for brooding that morning after the battle and he had been careful since to avoid any such occasion for censure but he could not pretend that this woman had no sensibility of his disquiet when she so clearly had nor that their former vocal intimacy was erasable he sighed sister maria there is hardly time to begin to explain the circumstances but i have on my conscience the death of a brave man my head tells me that it should be otherwise but not my heart i should wish perhaps to tell you more but i sail for england shortly time is truly pressing very well mr hervey she conceded turning with him for the house we cannot speak of it but i urge that you do so when you return to your country i have been studying your prayerbook the one you gave me it is how do you say très contestataire disputatious suggested hervey yes disputatious but no matter in its exhortation before mass or communion as you say the priest invites him that cannot quiet his own conscience to go to him for absolution do you know such a priest that might as well as pronounce absolution give just counsel in this yes i do he replied wearily then you must see him with no more delay than is strictly necessary for your other duties hervey agreed and now before you go she smiled my father wishes to make some small gesture of our gratitude come later he would regret much that their tryst was so brief yet in that brief meeting she had again given him a certain peace and strengthened his resolve on a course additional to priestly absolution though she could not know it and he was glad when she said that she would be remaining in paris for when he returned he could take up her invitation to visit at the carmelite house in the city whence she was appointed that afternoon you appear to have made a most felicitous connection hervey grant tells me that count chantonnay has more influence with louis bourbon than condé even said lord george irvine as they sipped madeira after a light luncheon of calfs tongue followed by early strawberries brought from provence let me see that bauble again hervey handed him the velvetcovered case a fleurdelis within a laurel wreath and those are without doubt the finest emeralds and prettily fixed on that skyblue ribbon too it should set off your levee dress handsomely it is a family order sir approved of the court by long custom the count informed me he was insistent that i should receive it of course of course smiled lord george i am sure the prince regent will not be illdisposed to the notion of a foreign decorations adorning one of his officers envious perhaps but not illdisposed and a touching reunion with your nun was had i understand hervey would not be drawn she is a remarkable woman and you will leave for england this night immediately after the service of memorial for captain jessope he replied at once heavy jessope lord fitzroy somersets aidedecamp he is killed too i did not know it i wish in gods name we might see a list soon lord fitzroy himself is not long for this world too by all accounts jessope dead i cannot say i knew him well i met him but infrequently at whites but an engaging officer though and you knew him imperfectly replied hervey softly hoping that lord george would not dwell on it which he did not your captaincy however demanded his commanding officer peremptorily what are we to do as i said sir it is wholly beyond my means it would not do to delay selling any longer ansons widow will need an annuity be that as it may hervey i will not send the papers to craigs court until we reach england have you no prospects of any sort none i am afraid sir lord george sighed pointedly mr hervey let me speak plainly with you are you not to marry the ward of the marquess of bath whitehall july the troopers of the blues standing mounted sentinel at the gates of the horse guards brought their heavycavalrypattern swords from the shoulder to the carry as hervey got down from the carriage and walked between them returning the salute with his right hand he would have preferred the anonymity of plain clothes but he had thought it fit to wear undress instead so that he might gain entry to the duke of yorks headquarters with more expedition he touched his forage cap to the two dismounted sentries at the inner archway and entered the building through an unimposing door in the sidearch within an orderly directed him up the stairs to the adjutantgenerals department where he was received rather distantly he thought by a civilian clerk please be seated mr ahm hartley we shall attend you forthwith hervey sat on a bench comfortably upholstered in buttoned green leather and picked up the copy of the times of that day which lay on an adjacent table he turned to its inside pages and studied the consolidated list of officers who had died at or since the battle he knew more names than he did not he read reports by special correspondents on the movements of the militia along the south coast the condition of the forces in canada and the occupation in paris he read a summary of the parliamentary debates on flogging and his bile rose on seeing the persuasion of so many as to its supposed efficacy all news and opinion devoured he then turned to the front page to amuse himself with the personal notices a single gentleman wishing to domesticate in a genteel private family a respectable young person wants a situation as barmaid he had to read this a second time respectable officers daughter wishes for a situation as a companion a fate he feared for edmondss daughters and when even these had exhausted his attention he looked at his watch the same which jessope had given him restored by the skill of a paris horologist and enquired of the clerk why there should be such a delay in accepting a dispatch from lord combermere i beg your indulgence mr harley we have so much to be about in the wake of events on the continent the clerk replied he turned to the backpage sales a pair of handsome brown chariot or curricle geldings hands inches high thirty very clever active well bred seasoned machine horses in high condition mostly young up and down the columns he went from valuable collection of paintings to singularly elegant gothic cottage they occupied him another halfhour and still there was no activity in the clerk now see here he began putting down the paper noisily i have urgent regimental business to be about will you kindly present that dispatch to the adjutantgeneral now so that i may be released to attend to it mr hurley replied the clerk with an indulging smile papers arrive from paris every day hourly at times if your letter were urgent it would be marked as such you are merely a courier sir courier be damned he stormed i have the welfare of brave mens widows and much else besides to be about if you will not so much as have the courtesy to read the letter then i shall not wait hereabouts he stalked out of the headquarters and marched angrily across the parade ground even as guardsmen were drilling there reaching the middle of st jamess park before his anger began to subside what had become of things he railed the nation seemed driven by selfimportant clerks for whom tallies and ledgers copying and filing were ends in themselves it was early evening almost a week later that he stepped down from the yarmouthtolondon stage at the crossroads near southwold so much had passed since his dismal time at the horse guards the earl of sussex whom he had called on shortly afterwards had been solicitude itself the earl not yet an old man but whose service with the duke of york in flanders twenty years before had ended with a broken hip had been at once animated by the prospect of finding new officers for his regiment and in norwich where it was his business to settle the regimental estate of joseph edmonds he had found the majors widow and two daughters in uncommon spirits and a very safe distance from destitution but unappealing though the prospect of norwich had been he anticipated that southwold would be an altogether more formidable ordeal there should have been a chaise or at least a van from the town waiting at the crossroads but there was not another soul in sight as far as the eye could see in the direction of southwold there was desolate marsh and the forlorn calls of the curlew accentuated the eerie emptiness in the other direction there was open heath with scarcely a tree and those that there were leaned to landward bent halfway to the ground by the wind which often as not drove in from the sea the coachdriver anxious because haywaggons had made him almost thirty minutes late on this stage asked if hervey would take charge of some packages for merchants of the town darent wait no longer zur he explained in suffolk vowels more pronounced than serjeant stranges anything from southwoldll ave to wait till tomorrow there should be summat along soon hervey understood the drivers impatience full well his pay would be docked if he were late at ipswich and there would be little chance of making up any more time along this road as yet unmacadamized and with a team already blowing in truth he was glad of the peace of this lonely crossroads for a while where he might compose his thoughts in respect of widow strange not that she would have been aware of that status for while margaret edmonds might learn from an express or even the times of her husbands death stranges widow would have no such notification he had contemplated writing to her but with no knowledge of whether she might be capable of reading he had demurred and resolved on this call a mile or so across the marshes in the direction the stage now took stood blythburgh church rising from the wetlands with all the grandeur of a cathedral testimony to the countys former woolwealth wealth long past he knew now it was fishing and little else although the war had brought additional business by way of the new naval establishments along the coast victualling yards hospitals signalling stations but he did not suppose the strange family would have much of it after a quarterhour a growler came up from the direction of southwold and the driver began a litany of apologies before even the brake bound on immense was his relief when hervey assured him that it mattered not at all and that he had the packages from the london coach minutes later the parcels and his portmanteau safely stowed they set off at a trot towards the little fishing town only a couple of miles thats all zur began the driver but its a bugger when the tides igh cos the stream tween us and the town gets up and the old orse e doesnt always like it hervey sympathized do you know of a family called strange he added a fisherman i believe peter strange i do not know his christian name he had a son hervey checked himself his son enlisted in the army well there is but one strange in southwold zur or rather there was one strange old peter died last month have you come all this way to see im then he asked in amazement not exactly terrible sad it were alice strange old peters wife of nigh on fifty years died in may an old peter just seemed to give up all will to go on that daughterinlaw of theirs never left is side these past three months but werent to no avail she ad to bury im too where is mrs strange now then asked hervey bless me zur in eaven for sure an peter too for they were fine godfearing folk for all the solemnity hervey found it hard not to smile i meant their daughterinlaw he explained gently the driver looked at him quizzically you know the family then zur no i do not but i have news of serjeant strange serjeant by that young lad as done well oi knew e would mind never a braver man on an oar with a gale blowin reckon e would ave joined the navy ad e not seen is two brothers drown out in the bay said e wanted tave nothin to do wi the sea after that did young arry oim glad e as done well though yes said hervey softly he did well where might i find mrs strange the drivers directions were precise and hervey tipped him a halfcrown after alighting at the swan hotel in the centre of town a place the driver was anxious to assure him that was most appropriate for someone of herveys rank and in exchange for this handsome tip the driver swore not to reveal the purpose for which hervey was in southwold and to be outside the swan at nine the following morning to take him the mile or so to the strange cottage at the harbour inlet he slept better at the swan than perhaps he had since those exhausted few hours at la belle alliance the sea air was clean and invigorating at yarmouth where he had spent the previous night there had been a stench of putrefying fish which had forced him to close the windows of his room and his doubts about leaving strange to the french lancers had again returned to haunt him through the small hours armstrong had absolved him from all blame as lord george irvine had even rsm lincoln had given him his opinion that no other course had been possible but ultimately there was he knew but one power to absolve excepting of course his maker to whom he must answer in the final account and that was the woman for whom his widowmaking had the most direct consequence would she comprehend anything of military necessity though throughout the journey from yarmouth he had turned it over and over in his mind the closer he got to southwold the greater was his dread and the heathland through which the coach trundled its scrubby bushes and sparse trees reminiscent of the landscape of flanders did nothing to quieten it at nine the following morning the growler drew up at the swan and in ten minutes he was in the little estuary harbour which was abuzz with the activity that high water brings the strange cottage was even smaller than he had imagined and smoke rising from the chimney told him there was now no escape from his selfimposed act of contrition he dismissed the driver with a shilling saying that he would walk back to the inn and then looked about him for a moment or so before approaching the door he was glad that he had decided against presenting himself in uniform for though it would have given him some authority some status of disinterest perhaps it would surely have alerted so insular a community to the widow stranges misfortune she might at least enjoy the liberty to reveal her unhappy news in her own time his darkblue coat might however make him pass harmlessly for any profession he had thought carefully during the weeks since waterloo about what he should say with margaret edmonds there was the consolation of knowing that as a loyal follower of the drum she would understand of wives of enlisted men he simply had no knowledge those few who had been in spain had like the gypsies and squatters on warminster common been inhabitants of another world and the regiment had been in ireland scarcely long enough for the picked men to bring wives into quarters there yet there was something about his expectations in the case of stranges wife that he could not fathom though it had exercised him to no little degree for in the pouch which strange had handed him just before turning to face the lancers there was a letter and though he had not read it he saw that the handwriting was very fine there was too a miniature but water had at some stage permeated the oilskin and the likeness was obscure he knocked at the door it was opened by a woman of thirty years perhaps fewer in a black crêpe dress her long black hair tied up with a black ribbon and jet slides all his preparation was suddenly to no avail i that is would you be mrs strange he stammered yes she replied with the rising note which turned the simple affirmation into a question mrs strange he began trying hard to recall the sequence of information he had practised i am lieutenant hervey of the sixth light dragoons your husbands regiment he paused she looked at him coolly would any officer bring ought but bad news he is dead she asked simply standing in the open door of a cottage on a busy quayside was not how hervey had imagined this would be i am very sorry but it is so mrs strange may i come in she listened in silence as he recounted the events of june he had resolved beforehand that he would attempt to explain the significance of what her late husband had done notwithstanding his oath of silence to wellington for surely a widow deserved no less and further if she did not grasp the significance of their mission that day then she could not be expected to understand why he had abandoned her husband and without understanding how might she be expected to absolve him would you like some tea mr hervey she asked at length he was pleased to accept for it seemed that such a gesture might indeed betoken some understanding it offered him too the opportunity to consult the notes he had made previously yet without which he had so far had to conduct this most difficult of counsels her calmness her dignity had all but dumbfounded him he had heard of soldiers widows seizing knives and having to be restrained from doing themselves injury but mrs strange had received the news as well better even than margaret edmonds and she had called him mr not lieutenant here indeed was a sign of some cultivation some knowledge of affairs she spoke too without stranges suffolk accent she spoke without any accent an educated rather than a refined voice but alien surely to the fishermens wharf strange had been a finelooking man of that there was no doubt what might he have been forty fortyfive but she was so much younger and in different society hervey might even have called her beautiful she had cheekbones as high as the most fashionable of the ladies he had seen in paris as high as henrietta lindsays large brown eyes set perfectly apart had the look of warmth and intelligence her hair though he thought it certain never to have had the attention of a ladys maid shone with hale condition he found his place in his notes there will be a little money mrs strange not a lot i fear it is customary when a soldier dies for his companions to auction his personal effects and they by tradition bid generously many of his possessions are still in ireland of course but those he took with him into the field have raised a little over forty pounds that is a worthy sum she conceded there is also the prizemoney for waterloo she looked puzzled after a battle the armys agents assess the value of the enemys equipment which has been captured he explained and this is divided pro rata that is to say i understand pro rata she said it kindly though it did not prevent his feeling awkward this amounts to s d he hastened looking down at his notebook there is regimental prizemoney of s d and arrears of pay amounting to s d with various other payments your late husbands estate amounts to s d there is a full account here mrs strange and if you feel able to sign this certificate i have a bankers draft which will enable you to withdraw the money at any time he did not however explain that the various other payments were his own share of the waterloo prizemoney mr hervey she began i am most touched that you yourself should have troubled to make this journey i sense that you feel responsible to some degree for my husbands death and that this might in some measure account for your coming to southwold i know nothing of battles of course but i do understand that judgements must be made in an instant and that afterwards there is infinite time in which to reappraise them is there any purpose in such reflection though i am greatly touched too that my late husbands fellow men should have been so generous in raising such an amount and i should like very much to write and express that gratitude would you be able to take such a letter yes of course i would maam maam seemed as appropriate as if she had been oh she then added distractedly but i have no writing paper there is writing paper at the swan hotel where i am staying mrs strange you would be most welcome to dine there and to write your letter before or subsequently in peaceful surroundings she seemed relieved it was curious he thought how things of little consequence assumed such importance at these times margaret edmonds had been likewise distressed at having sent away her cook for the day i shall dine at three then for i intend walking by the sea a while with your leave maam he walked by the sea for three hours and he swam too it had been close on eight years since he had swum in the sea and on the last occasion at corunna he had done so for his life the peace of the day for the beach was empty but for seabirds and mrs stranges absolution now contrived in him such contentment that he could not otherwise remember and he lay in the warm sun and thought of henrietta and a homecoming that few could hope to enjoy until it was time to return to the swan at five past three the chaise he had sent for her drew up to the inn and mrs strange stepped down hervey met her at the door and they went straight to the swans dining room a place of some elegance if a little oldfashioned by the standards he had lately seen in paris mrs strange made some admiring remark of the furnishings though she had lived in southwold for fifteen years this was her first essay to the hotel this intrigued him for it seemed likely that a woman of her refinement might at least have taken tea there even if money for anything more substantial had been wanting it is only that temperance denied us access mr hervey she revealed when he pressed her she studied the bill of fare intently and with her eyes so occupied hervey found himself admiring her form she wore a dress of cotton velvet green not mourning even though the day was warm its waist was lower than was the fashion lower indeed than had been the fashion for some years yet it was unquestionably a dress made by a skilled seamstress its neck was high and she wore a necklace of jet she was fullerbosomed fullermouthed than henrietta and she put him in mind of a portrait on the grand staircase at longleat house a painting he had many a time gazed at as a boy reynoldss subject a picture of inaccessible allure do you have any family mrs strange he asked as she looked up no mr hervey my mother died many years ago and my father likewise almost seven years past just after corunna why do you say corunna maam it is an uncommon reference is it not it was after corunna that harry came home to southwold on furlough he was a devout worshipper at the chapel of which my father was minister as was his family when my father died well i was quite alone there was nowhere for me to go harry was a corporal and asked me to marry him i think he did so out of kindness we hardly knew each other he was the finest of men strong gentle dutiful i came to live with his parents and continued to teach at the school these past two years though both his father and his mother have been largely unwell and i have spent all my time in consequence nursing them both they were so good to me it was no hardship well perhaps a little tiring hervey paused before putting to her the concern that now troubled him as a man as much as an officer forgive my directness mrs strange but how straitened will your circumstances be with only two hundred pounds she might purchase an annuity of say fifteen pounds at most hardly enough to keep even the cottage roof over her head and it would go intolerably hard with such a woman i have some savings sir harry sent home the major part of his pay and there was a little family money but i should not remain inactive even with sufficient income though i will not be a governess i used to keep my fathers school before he became ill i might do likewise again to hervey the solution was at once manifest not a fortnight before he had received a letter from elizabeth expressing her anxiety for her fathers school at her own inexpertise and the exhaustion it wrought in him you find being a schoolmaam not objectionable then mrs strange he enquired no indeed though there is little opportunity of an opening hereabout just so he agreed see here mrs strange my father is vicar of a small parish in wiltshire he is having great trouble in maintaining his school for the village children my sister helps but cannot spare all the time that is needed there is a cottage set aside for a schoolmaster and although the stipend is very small i think it might be adequate you are i believe the very sort of person my father has need of mr hervey she smiled you are most kind but you forget perhaps that my father was a dissenting minister i hardly think it fitting for me hervey was undeterred and stayed her protest mrs strange my father has need of someone to instruct the children of the village in the elements of reading and writing and in those of mathematics i am sure that you can contrive to do that without offending against too many of the thirtynine articles he laughed but i should be obliged to attend his church should i not john wesley would have approved of piety wherever he found it think you not maam but there is indeed an independent chapel in the village if the parish church were not fulfilling she laughed i think we need not be so solemn and how shall i apply for this position that much i can do for you myself he replied when might you be able to take up those duties maam she thought for a moment it will take me a week or so to conclude all that needs be done here she said but then i should be ready sad as it will be to leave this place after so many years it has now more unhappy memories than i should wish thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore the moabitess she said returning the smile but ruth had a naomi from whom to draw strength whereas i have not he smiled again you will at least find my sister agreeable but i am afraid that for horningsham it will be a long drive mrs strange first london then salisbury or a pleasant cruise from here to portsmouth perhaps she replied he laughed again you are right maam i am but a landsman and regard the sea only as a barrier he liked this keenness of wit it reminded him of caithlin mrs strange the day is warm and i have taken much exercise would you find it offensive if i took a little hock not in the least sir she replied at once and i if i may shall join you for it was never by my own pledge that we were a temperance household only out of respect for my family and then for harry which i may assure you is no less diminished now i did not suppose it for an instant maam he replied chapter eighteen the interests of the service horningsham wednesday july it was a little before ten oclock and the morning was already hot when a coach drawn by two quality middleweight greys drew up to horningsham vicarage the horses were not fresh their shoulders were in a lather and the dappling on their quarters was accentuated by prodigious sweating the coachman himself looked no fresher his face grimy and his shirt almost black with the dust of the road down from the carriage stepped a tall man in his midtwenties wearing white breeches court shoes and the longtailed coat of a foot guards officer for all the world looking as if he were alighting in st jamess palace yard to attend a levee after stretching stiff limbs brushing the dust from his shoulders and placing his cocked hat under his arm he exchanged a few words with the coachman and walked towards the house vexed that no servant had appeared to assist with the horses he was already disposed to some disdain of it here was no classical architects expertise for sure rather was it the haphazard work of successive country builders the oriel window was quite fine he conceded and there was about it a quaint charm but the house did not betoken a wellendowed living of that he was certain he pulled the bell rope at the door selfconsciously adjusted the aiglets on his right shoulder and waited for an answer at length too great a length he considered it was opened by francis stooping more than usually who after the officers introduction which he did not fully hear showed him into the vicar of horningshams modest library francis was now in something of quandary for the reverend thomas hervey was at the school and his wife was with him elizabeth was taking a walk and the only member of the family at home was engaged in what francis judged to be an affair long overdue this visitor from he had not quite heard could not in calling unannounced presume upon him therefore it may be some time before anyone is at home he said to which the officer replied that he would wait indefinitely meanwhile in the drawing room the overdue affair was reaching some conclusion and that is why i am late in coming here explained matthew hervey he was seated on a long settee with henrietta a further distance along it than he would have liked and he was recounting though not without interruption his movements during the past momentous six weeks believe me i should not have been spared from garrison duties in paris had it not been for these other necessities well matthew dearest began henrietta with a wry smile i should never have supposed that the profession of arms brought such intercourse and with so many ladies of evident charm and accomplishments it seems such a pity that the unhappy circumstances of these encounters should otherwise mar the enjoyment of them he hesitated there was no mistaking the challenge that her smile belied madam he began for her name was still not habitual with him do not think for an instant that but it would have been better had he hesitated a little longer before beginning and then he might have finished his protest with resolution think what sir she demanded her eyebrows arched high think that you might take some pleasure in feminine company no well that is he stammered no you do not take such pleasure or no i should not think it there was a knock at the door and hervey could not conceal his relief when francis appeared begging your pardon master matthew and your ladyship but there is an officer waiting to see someone an officer asked hervey uncertainly to see me i dont rightly know sir im sorry as i didnt quite discern what the gentleman said hervey looked at henrietta who smiled perhaps matthew if you were to receive him his purpose might be revealed i do not suppose it will be any great mystery francis announced their visitor with as much recall as he was able the name howard was all that hervey could glean from this fumbled introduction but he knew him at once to be a lieutenant of foot guards and generals aidedecamp but he could not begin to imagine what might bring st jamess to horningsham good morning to you mr howard he said offering his hand though the officer seemed a trifle reluctant to take it how may we assist you and equally reluctant did he seem to reveal his purpose so that henrietta losing patience felt it necessary to reassure him sir do not suppose that i shall reveal the secrets of the horse guards to the french or even to the people of wiltshire the officer cleared his throat awkwardly mr hervey you will recall delivering a dispatch from his grace the duke of wellington to the horse guards two weeks past of course replied hervey and you did not await an acknowledgement no did not expect one you did not expect one mr hervey were you not on his graces business not so that is not directly even as he answered he felt a gnawing doubt at the time his business seemed clear enough now he was less certain i was on an assignment as regards regimental affairs and carried the dispatch as a supplementary duty the clerk at the horse guards showed no urgency to attend to it i had other matters to be about just so mr hervey replied the officer coolly i am commanded to request that you accompany me to the horse guards immediately a request by a senior officer conveyed as it was by an adc was to all intents and purposes an order a moments impatience with the headquarters clerk and it had come to this for an instant he supposed he might next be asked for his sword was it he wondered the curse of slade immediately did you say snapped henrietta making hervey start almost as much as the officer you must understand that it is quite impossible madam he began i understand that it might not be to your convenience but i have the most explicit instructions to insist that mr hervey accompany me the adjutantgeneral himself sir it is indeed no little inconvenience for mr hervey and i are to be married this coming month hervey was dumbfounded he looked at the officer with blank astonishment and then again at henrietta is that not what we were speaking of this very moment past matthew she challenged a minor commotion in the hall signalled the return of the vicar of horningsham and his lady herveys mother bustled into the drawing room with loud protests that her absence at the school had been in the ignorance of her visitors calling my dear she gushed to henrietta why did not you tell us you were to call and today of all days when cook is at her sisters it is of no moment whatever mrs hervey began henrietta with a smile and a touch of the hand upon her arm matthew and i were met to discuss our arrangements arrangements asked his mother another commotion attended the return of elizabeth who swept into the room pulling off her broad straw hat and throwing it on to a chair arrangements did i hear arrangements she laughed the reverend thomas hervey protested that is what was said and i dare say they are entirely private arrangements and no business of ours elizabeth most unusually now giggled her eyes twinkled her mouth parted and her ringlets danced the sun despite the hat had worked its usual way with her face and freckles dotted her cheeks the officer was staring at her when first she noticed him not awaiting any introduction she strode five full paces over to him and held out her hand and you will be one of matthews friends she beamed only his serjeants call on us as a rule the officer caught his breath as best he could but not before henrietta spoke to her enquiry no my dear not a friend for sure not a friend he is come to take my future husband from me and forcibly if necessary elizabeth hesitated though showing no surprise at henriettas notice of marriage and then narrowed her eyes to a fearsome challenge the officer who had at first disdained this provincial household was routed he blushed and stammered an apology i hope you will understand maam he concluded i have never heard of such a thing said elizabeth and with so much indignation as to make hervey himself wince i had always thought us too far ashore for the pressgang why must you take him at which point herveys father thought fit to reassert sovereignty in his own vicarage i am afraid sir that our manners here are not what they might be in london i am the reverend thomas hervey vicar of this parish and this is my wife he continued turning to herveys mother who frowned and made a small bow my daughter elizabeth and my son and my ah lady henrietta lindsay he said indicating each in turn i am obliged sir lord john howard and he in turn bowed well then sir resumed elizabeth upon what necessity do you take our brother son and soontobe husband from us all i am sorry miss hervey you will understand that the interests of the service do not you tell me about the interests of the service sir she replied sharply do not you presume us to be so countrybred that we know nothing of affairs my brother is only yesterday returned from the continent where he might have been killed on the field at waterloo were you at waterloo sir oh matthew he was a stuffed shirt a real cold fish the interests of the service indeed who does he think we are what can be so important about that dispatch hervey had chided her the instant lieutenant the lord john howard had taken temporary leave for the bath arms where he hoped to find a tub in which to soak and horses for their immediate return no entreaty by herveys father had been able to persuade him to take his refreshment at the vicarage instead it had been agreed that he would return at two to begin their journey to london for such was the address he insisted with which he had been enjoined to act i think it must be a serious matter conceded hervey to his sister though with little more than a frown i have clearly misjudged things but a smile overcame him i do not much care for henrietta and i are resolved to marry the instant i return she declares she will brook no more absence but how serious do you suppose it might be matthew asked his father what could be the nature of the complaint against you well sir what i suppose is this that there is some message which waits upon my return to france i dare say there will be another month or sos duty in paris that is all and for this their lordships would send an officer from london he replied doubtfully hervey merely lifted an eyebrow the fresh pair of livery horses brought from warminster took the carriage at a good speed along the turnpikes repaired in the spring and not yet rutted by the autumn rains the roads admitted comfortable progress and thereby easy conversation but neither of the occupants of the carriage spoke a word by six oclock they were in whitchurch and the coachman hove in to a posthouse to water his team as they stepped down howard broke the silence look hervey he began with a warmth in stark contrast to his earlier cool formality this is very unsatisfactory for you i was sent by general calvert after a great deal of shouting in the commanderinchiefs office when the duke of wellington returned i allowed my own vexation at having to be about this business to intrude upon my courtesies with your family i fear they may not forgive it your sister especially and i had no right to presume your guilt in the matter either i beg your pardon thank you howard but it is no matter replied hervey with a shrug t was unquestionably hasty in leaving the horse guards that morning but it was not on my own account that i did so and as for my family well will you be wantin teat mlord called the driver no we must press on at best speed speed allchurch i want to be through the piccadilly bar by seven we will need to change horses in farnham i would suppose ill sleep a little now and relieve you of the reins in the early hours if you wish you are quite sure of the road oh ay ylordship its changed not a farthinsworth since past years this teamll get us to farnham betimes ill prime the pistols now though it used to be a bad stretch here to guildford in the dark their progress along the turnpike with the fullest of moons was faster even than by day for there was little carting traffic until they reached the outskirts of london in the early dawn allchurch had stopped only once in farnham to change the two bays and by five they were in chelsea village slowed to a walk by the carting traffic into the city and by that already returning with horse dung and night soil a convenient circular trade both passengers were now awake howard strangely animated by the bustle in telling contrast with his languor at horningsham along the kings road he jumped out and stopped an icecart empty but for one block under an insulating canvas he bought three pieces the size of house bricks throwing one up to allchurch and then climbing back inside to give one to his charge hervey smiled at him for the first time in less than an hour they were passing the bar at piccadilly and turning into st jamess street lord john howard could at last feel at home for the coach halted outside whites we shall use my club to dress he said airily but first a barber to shave us and then some breakfast you will have some breakfast hervey for all the anxiety that had been mounting since they had entered the capitals environs readily agreed indeed he found himself wanting to talk in part as distraction from what he now feared must come but also to return howards increasing warmth it is only my second time here darcey jessope once brought me he added ah jessope poor man i fear that i fill his empty boots at the horse guards you knew him well he was an acquaintance in spain he was a great friend of lord fitzroy somerset it was he who had jessope appointed to lord wellingtons staff you know im told that it was the same sharpshooter who accounted for them both at waterloo a cruel irony yes i understand that it was so i did not see jessope fall but i saw lord fitzroy walking back with his arm shot away you were there at that moment asked howard in some awe we were many it is just the way replied hervey have you news of lord fitzroy he is recovering well you have heard i suppose that he had his arm amputated without a murmur and called for it to be brought back so that he could remove a ring his wife had given him but then such bearing is perhaps only to be expected of a colonel of foot guards doubtless howard was unconscious of his presumption but hervey thought none the less to deflate him gently my dear howard he smiled confidentially he was first a cornet of light dragoons and then both laughed they entered the horse guards through the unimposing door in the inner arch the same that had admitted hervey two weeks before and climbed the stairs to the offices of the commanderinchief good morning my lord said the clerk gravely and bowing the same clerk on whose account hervey was now arraigned several officers about the place made inaudible asides and stared at him with obvious contempt his stomach tightened his eyes began to lose their focus and the voices around him became strangely disembodied and yet he remained sensible of his condition and of the proceedings he had known no feeling like it before not at corunna nor salamanca nor even waterloo oblivion had stared at him there but dishonour faced him now infamy even general calvert wishes to see you the moment you arrive gentlemen hervey heard the clerk say as he hurried to the double doors of the adjutantgenerals office and before either officer could plead a moments pause he was announcing them howard beckoned hervey towards the doors but he stared back in confusion was he meant to surrender his sword and remove his shako keep them howard hissed all but pulling him into the entrance they managed nevertheless to halt in step and salute in front of the huge mahogany writingtable sir harry calvert was already on his feet however and holding out a hand mr hervey my dear boy welcome i am sorry indeed that you have been recalled so early i do trust it has not been unduly inopportune the interests of the service you know the interests of the service recalled inopportune herveys astonishment was almost matched by howards and both were apparent to the general my dear fellows whatever can be the matter howard motioned hervey to say nothing choosing to recount himself the circumstances of their return which he now did in all its detail and with unabated particulars of the offending instructions he had acted upon calvert was aghast he walked towards a contrary door and opened it colonel arnold be so good as to come in here he called and then as his military assistant entered with pocketbook open he turned back to the two lieutenants and frowned mr howard if you please repeat for me the information you have this instant apprised me of when howard had done so the adjutantgeneral turned to his colonel and asked him if he did not think it the most shameful thing he had heard arnold agreed then sir be pleased to rid me once and for all of that infernal quilldriver this is one liberty too many and with that the adjutantgenerals staff was peremptorily reduced indeed such was the noisy relish with which colonel arnold carried out his instructions that hervey began to feel sympathy for the unfortunate clerk now gentlemen sit down if you please continued general calvert there is little time mr hervey you will recall bringing lord wellingtons dispatch two weeks ago it did not require an acknowledgement but it is the procedure for the clerk receiving dispatches to peruse them at once and to interrogate the bearer if there be any matter for clarification mellor did not do so indeed it appears that he dealt with it with quite extraordinary laxness i had begun to suspect as much he has for some time been quite incapable of remembering his position i fear his taking a lease on a house in blackheath has given him certain gentlemanly propensities hervey smiled respectfully at the generals attempt at some levity while suppressing a growing indignation at the inference that his presence at the horse guards was merely an instrument for the demise of the offending civilian only when the duke of wellington himself attended here on monday was the import of the dispatch revealed for in it he recounts in some detail your remarkable exploits at the late battle we are to know as waterloo the duke wished that your signal role be recognized but considered that to mark it by public honours would detract from the honour due to the prussians you will understand the sensibilities in these matters mr hervey hervey bowed in acknowledgement his pulse beginning to race he did consider recommending a companionship of the bath along with all other commanding officers since you had commanded your corps in the closing moments of the battle but so many other junior officers had been required to do the same that he thought this impractical he has therefore asked and their lordships of the treasury have agreed that you be awarded ex gratia the amount of five thousand pounds herveys face spoke of his utter shock his pulse beat faster than he could ever remember and he was thankful to be seated he made to speak but general calvert lifted up a hand this is however conditional on your absolute discretion in the matter not a word of the provenance of this sum is ever to escape calverts eyes searched herveys you have my absolute assurance sir he replied but now to more urgent matters continued the general you may know of lord fitzroy somersets incapacitation the duke found him an indispensable aidedecamp and secretary moreover he spoke french with perfect fluency with fluency yes thought hervey but with an abominable english accent but what was this to do with you speak french with equal fluency and german too it seems suggested calvert yes sir he replied cautiously surely he could not be suggesting well it is the dukes wish that you be appointed to his staff forthwith as undersecretary and aidedecamp if you are in agreement you will be given a brevet captaincy given mind which in due season will be confirmed as regimental rank how say you mr hervey hervey sprang up like a flushed partridge i i am astonished sir i i accept of course well then captain hervey there remains but one difficulty the duke has this day left for paris and there are pressing matters for him to be about with both our allies and the french king really my boy you are required there at once and turning to his colonel he asked if a frigate were still stood by yes sir harry she could leave chatham on this evenings tide about eight i think then said general calvert turning to hervey you had better lose no time in making arrangements mr howard will lend you every assistance i am sure now you must excuse me since i have to attend on the duke of york goodbye and good fortune captain hervey the service is indeed favoured to have officers of your faculty do not suppose that this peace is an end to the requirement for such aptitude thank you sir replied hervey simply before replacing his shako saluting and turning for the door howard seized his arm the moment it was closed behind them my dear fellow noone could feel happier with this than do i i could gladly run through that selfimportant ass of a clerk who began it all but for my overhasty presumption too i am truly sorry hervey smiled and touched his arm no matter no matter see then howard pressed we have but a few hours to catch that frigate by tonights tide i shall arrange a coach for chatham you will need meanwhile to see your tailor and agent and look for other necessaries until your campkit is brought to paris though i hardly think you will see hard beds there any longer yes yes thank you howard it is all so but see here what i must do is write to horningsham is there somewhere i may do so of course we shall go to the staff office here but look write only a brief account and i myself shall take it for you the rest i shall say on your behalf i could do no other in the circumstances my dear howard began hervey pleasantly taken by this warm act of contrition no i will hear no objection he insisted it is the very least thing that i may do for a fellow officer and indeed i mean to make some amends with your sister he faltered a fraction i mean your family with whom i seem to have made a disastrous beginning but hervey did not fully grasp this other aspect to his altruism for his thoughts were with henrietta once more with the approval of her guardian we might be married in paris this next month he mused aloud the approval of lord wellington might be the greater impediment suggested howard with a smile and the child samuel ministered unto the lord replied hervey smiling too what first samuel chapter verse his majestys naval dockyard chatham at seven that evening was still bustling herveys chaise and pair stopped at the huge gates the driver took directions from the royal marine sentry and then trotted the team a further quartermile to the quay where the frigate was moored hervey had expected her to be riding at anchor in the roads and he was pleased that he would not after all have to board her precariously from a jollyboat as he stepped down from the coach his eye was caught by the decoration of the gallery window high above the quay on the stillrising tide a figure stared out at him and then disappeared the gundecks yellow side smelled of new paint and the sail even to his untutored eye was furled to perfection efficiency itself he sighed the marine sentry at the foot of the gangway which led to the upper deck presented arms but hervey hesitated the conventions of boarding one of his majestys ships were ever a trap to an unwary landsman and he would truthfully admit of menowar and captains of frigates he was ever in thrall but the brevet captain swallowed hard fastening on his swordbelt and taking up the scabbard in his left hand he touched his shako peak to the marine and strode resolutely up the steep gangway as he stepped aboard and turned to salute aft the one custom of which he was certain the same figure of the gallery window appeared on deck immaculate in frock uniform his face was a year or so older than herveys but not more and it remained motionless while returning the salute then it broke into a quizzical smile captain hervey we presume we are glad you have at last arrived i am captain laughton peto even in the short time it had taken to exchange these compliments three seamen were down the gangway and bringing up herveys chests he struggled to find some apt reply in deference to this courtesy i am afraid my journey here has been in much haste sir i confess i do not even know your ships name peto smiled again nisus you may have heard of her now captain hervey the tide will be turning any minute you may come aft and watch as we get under way so that you will have something favourable to tell the duke of your time with the service have you seen a frigate make sail before hervey glanced at the epaulettes on the captains coat the left one looked distinctly newer by which he concluded that since the regulations required two epaulettes irrespective of seniority he did not wish to peer too closely at them to search for the crowns which would have settled the matter captain peto had held the rank prior to bonapartes exile to elba when indeed hervey had been but a cornet thus it occurred to him that captain peto might have commanded nisus on their dover escort a year before which had made such a show of sail on leaving them but before he could allude thus peto spoke again i should tell you too that in my cabin there are sealed orders for you from paris to be opened only when we are under way sealed orders for me hervey could scarcely contain his wonder at the change of circumstances a few hours before and he had been staring oblivion in the face what do you suppose they say my dear hervey laughed peto i have not the beginning of an idea i am a mere frigate captain you are aidedecamp to the duke of wellington
