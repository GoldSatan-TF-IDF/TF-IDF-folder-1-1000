james rollins bloodline the eighth book in the sigma force series to three brothers and three sisters cheryl doug laurie chuck billy and carrie after being in the trenches this past year it seemed fitting for us to be together here too love you all map horn of africa words from assassinated presidents on the existence and threat of modernday secret societies we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence building a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operations john f kennedy from a speech given at the waldorfastoria hotel on april on life and death surely god would not have created such a being as man with an ability to grasp the infinite to exist only for a day no no man was made for immortality abraham lincoln notes from the historical record throughout history conspiracy theories abound it is only human nature we are forever looking for patterns amid chaos for signs of the invisible puppeteer manipulating the grand scheme of lives governments and the path of mankind some of these shadowy plotters are cast as villains others as great benefactors some of these secret cabals are based on historical facts others are mere fanciful fictions and yet even more are a gordian knot of the two woven so inexplicably together that the line between fact and fiction becomes a tangled tapestry of false history and for no other organization in history has this stood truer than the infamous knights templar in the early twelfth century the order began as a group of nine knights who swore to protect pilgrims on their way to and from the holy lands from those humble beginnings a great order would eventually grow in both wealth and power and spread across europe until even popes and kings feared them then on october the king of france and the current pope conspired to arrest and disband the order claiming great atrocities had been committed by the knights including heresy in the aftermath of that purge legends and myths blurred the true fate of the order stories of lost treasures abounded tales spread of knights escaping persecution to arrive on the shores of the new world and some reports even claim that the order still exists today in secret and under guard protecting a power that could reshape the world but lets set aside such speculations and mythologies and go back to those original nine knights what many do not know is that those nine founding members were all related by blood or marriage arising from a single family eight of them are recorded by name in historical documents the ninth remains a mystery and a source of much speculation today by historians who was this mysterious founding member of an order that would grow in such prominence in history and legend why was this last knight never named as plainly as the others the answer to that mystery is the beginning of a great adventure notes from the scientific record on february the cover of time magazine declared the year man becomes immortal at face value that might seem a wild claim but other scientists have made similar statements dr ronald klatz in his book advances in antiage medicine wrote within the next fifty years or so assuming an individual can avoid becoming the victim of major trauma or homicide it is entirely possible that he or she will be able to live virtually forever we are living in an exciting time when advances in medicine genetics technology and a myriad of other disciplines are opening the newest frontier for mankind eternity how will that manifest what form will it take within these pages youll discover that answer the concepts raised in this novel are based on facts on exhaustive research going back to studies done by soviet scientists during the cold war but before you turn to that first page i must make one correction concerning the startling statements made above they are in fact far too conservative in their estimates for not only is immortality within our reachit is already here prologue summer holy lands they once called her a witch and a whore but no longer she sat astride a gray destrier as the blackarmored warhorse stepped gingerly through the carnage of battle bodies littered the fields ahead muslim and christian alike her passage stirred the feasting crows and ravens chasing them up into great black clouds in her wake other scavengersthose on two legspicked through the dead pulling off boots yanking out arrows for their points and feathers a few faces lifted to stare then quickly turned away again she knew what they saw another knight among the many who fought here her breasts were hidden under a padded habergeon and a hauberk of mail her dark hair cropped to her shoulders shorter than most mens lay under a conical helmet her fine features further obscured by a nasal bar strapped to the side of her saddle a doubleedged broadsword bumped against her left knee ringing off the mail chausses that protected her long legs only a few knew she was not a manand none knew she held secrets far darker than her hidden gender her squire waited for her at the edge of a rutted road the path wound steeply up to an isolated stone keep the hulking structure hidden deep within the naphtali mountains of galilee had no name and looked as if it had been carved out of the hill itself beyond its battlements the red sun sat low on the horizon obscured by the smoke from campfires and torched fields the young squire dropped to a knee as she drew her horse to a halt beside him is he still there she asked a nod frightened lord godefroy awaits you ahead her squire refused to look in the direction of the stonecrowned keep she had no such reluctance she tilted her helmet up to get a better view at long last she had spent sixteen yearsgoing back to when her uncle founded the order of the poor knights of the temple of jerusalemsearching for the impossible even her uncle did not understand her request to join the templars but her side of the family would not be refused so she had been given the white mantle of the order and folded in among the original nine hidden away as faceless as the helmet she wore while the order grew around her both in number and prominence others of her family of her bloodline continued to manipulate the knightly order from within and without gathering wealth and knowledge searching for powerful relics from lost crypts and ancient cr√®ches across egypt and the holy lands despite their best planning theyd certainly had their failures just a year ago theyd missed acquiring the bones of the magithe relics of the three biblical kings said to hold the secrets to lost alchemies she would not let today mark another failure with a snap of the reins she urged her horse up the rocky path with each passing step the number of dead grew as the guardians of the keep put up a final and futile struggle to withstand the assault reaching the summit of the hill she found the gates to the keep broken and splintered battered apart by a massive steelshod ram a pair of knights guarded the way forward both nodded to her the younger of the two fresh to the order had sewn a crimson cross over his heart other templars had begun to take up the same habit a symbol to mark their willingness to shed their own blood for the cause the grizzled and pocked older warrior simply wore the traditional white surcoat over his armor like herself the only decoration upon their mantles was the crimson blood of the slain godefroy awaits you in the crypt the older knight said and pointed beyond the gates to the inner citadel she led her destrier through the ruins of the gate and quickly dismounted with a flourish of her mantle she left her broadsword with her mount knowing she had no fear of being ambushed by some lone surviving protector of the keep lord godefroy for all his troubles was thorough as testament to his diligence all across the open courtyard wooden pikes bore the heads of the last defenders their decapitated remains piled like so much firewood along a back wall the battle was over only the spoils remained she reached a door that opened to shadows a narrow stair roughhewn and cut from the stone of the mountain led down beneath the keep the distant orangered flicker of a torch marked the end of the steps far below she descended her footfalls hurrying only at the last could it be true after so many years she burst into a long chamber lined to either side by stone sarcophagi well over a score of them sweeping through she barely noted the egyptian writing lines of symbols hinting at dark mysteries going back before christ ahead two figures stood bathed in torchlight at the rear of the chamber one standing the other on his knees leaning on a staff to hold himself upright she crossed toward them noting that the last sarcophagus had been pried open its stone lid cracked on the floor beside it it seemed somebody had already begun looking for the treasure hidden here but the violated crypt held nothing but ash and what appeared to be bits of dried leaf and stem the disappointment showed on lord godefroys face as she approached the pair so you come at last he said with false cheer she ignored the knight he stood a head taller than she did though he shared the same black hair and aquiline nose marking their common ancestry out of southern france their families distantly related she dropped to her knees and stared into the face of the prisoner his features were tanned to a burnished shade his skin smooth as supple leather from under a fall of dark hair black eyes stared back at her reflecting the torchlight though on his knees he showed no fear only a deep welling of sadness that made her want to slap him godefroy drew down beside her intending to interfere to try to ingratiate himself into what he must have sensed was of great importance and though he was one of the few who knew her true identity he knew nothing of her deeper secrets my lady he started the eyes of the prisoner narrowed at the revelation fixing her with a harder stare all trace of sadness drained away leaving behind a flicker of fearbut it quickly vanished curious does he know of our bloodline our secrets godefroy interrupted her reverie and continued upon your instructions weve spent many lives and spilled much blood to find this place hidden by rumor and guarded as much by curses as by infidelsall to find this man and the treasure he guards who is he i have earned such knowledge upon the point of my sword she did not waste words on fools she spoke instead to the prisoner using an ancient dialect of arabic when were you born those eyes bore into her even pushing her back by the sheer force of his will a buffeting wind of inner strength he seemed to be judging whether to offer her a lie but from whatever he found in her face he recognized the futility of it when he spoke his words were soft but came from a place of great weight i was born in muharram in the hijri year fiveandninety godefroy understood enough arabic to scoff the year ninetyfive that would make him over a thousand years old no she said more to herself than him calculating in her head his people use a different accounting of years than we do starting when their prophet muhammad arrived in mecca so the man here is not a thousand years old not at all she said finishing the conversion in her head hes only lived five hundred and twenty years from the corner of her eye she noted godefroy turn toward her aghast impossible he said with a tremulous quaver that betrayed the shallow depth of his disbelief she never broke from the prisoners gaze within those eyes she sensed an unfathomable frightening knowledge she tried to picture all he had witnessed over the centuries mighty empires rising and falling cities thrusting out of the sands only to be worn back down by the ages how much could he reveal of ancient mysteries and lost histories but she was not here to press questions upon him and she doubted he would answer them anyway not this manif he could still be called a man when next he spoke it came with a warning his fingers tightening on his staff the world is not ready for what you seek it is forbidden she refused to back down that is not for you to decide if a man is fierce enough to grasp it then it is his right to claim and possess it he stared back at her his gaze drifting to her chest to what was hidden beneath hard armor so eve herself believed in the garden of eden when she listened to the snake and stole from the tree of knowledge ah she sighed leaning closer you mistake me i am not eve and it is not the tree of knowledge i seekbut the tree of life slipping a dagger from her belt she quickly stood and drove the blade to its hilt under the prisoners jaw lifting him off his knees with her strength of will in that single thrust the endless march of centuries came to a bloody haltalong with the danger he posed godefroy gasped stepping back but is this not the man you came so far to find she yanked free the dagger spraying blood and kicked the body away she caught the staff before it fell free from the prisoners slack fingers it was not the man i sought she said but what he carried godefroy stared at the length of olive wood in her hand fresh blood flowed in rivulets down its surface revealing a faint carving along its length an intricate weave of serpents and vines curling around and around the shaft what is it the knight asked his eyes wide she faced him fully for the first timeand drove her blade into his left eye he had seen too much to live as he fell to his knees his body wracking itself to death in ghastly heaves upon her daggers point she answered his last question her fingers firm on the ancient wooden rod behold the bachal isu she whispered to the centuries to come wielded by moses carried by david and borne by the king of kings here is the staff of jesus christ fourth of july five days from now the assassin stared through the rifles scope and lowered the crosshairs to the profile of president james t gant he doublechecked his rangeseven hundred yardsand fixed the main targeting chevron of the usmc ma sniper rifle upon the occipital bone behind the mans left ear knowing a shot there would do the most damage festive music and bright laughter from the holiday picnic filtered through his earpiece he let it all fade into the background as he concentrated on his target on his mission in us history three presidents had died on the exact same day on july on the birthday of this country it seemed beyond mere chance thomas jefferson john adams and james monroe today would mark the fourth steadying his breath commander gray pierce pulled the trigger first present day june am est takoma park maryland gray pierce pulled into the driveway with a coughing growl of the thunderbirds v engine he felt like growling himself i thought the plan was to sell this place kenny asked grays younger brother sat in the passenger seat his head half out the window staring up at the craftsman bungalow with the wraparound wooden porch and overhanging gable it was their family home not any longer gray answered and dont mention any of that to dad his dementia makes him paranoid enough how is that different from any other day kenny mumbled sourly under his breath gray glowered at his brother hed picked kenny up at dulles after a crosscountry flight from northern california his brothers eyes were redrimmed from jet lagor maybe from too many small bottles of gin in first class at this moment kenny reminded gray of their father especially with the pall of alcohol on his breath he caught his own reflection in the rearview mirror as he pulled the vintage thunderbird into the family garage while the two brothers both shared the same ruddy welsh complexion and dark hair as their father gray kept his hair cropped short kenny had his tied in a short ponytail that looked too young even for someone still in his late twenties to make matters worse he also wore cargo shorts and a loose tshirt with the logo of a surfing company kenny was a software engineer for a company in palo alto and apparently this was his version of business attire gray climbed out of the car trying his best to push back his irritation with his brother on the ride here kenny had spent the entire time on his cell phone dealing with business on the other coast hed barely shared a word relegating gray to the role of chauffeur its not like i dont have my own business to attend too for the past month gray had put his life on hold dealing with the aftermath of the death of their mother and the continuing mental decline of their father kenny had come out for the funeral promising to spend a week helping to get their affairs in order but after two days a business emergency drew him back across the country and everything got dumped back on grays shoulders in some ways it would have been easier if kenny had not bothered coming out at all in his wake hed left a disheveled mess of insurance forms and probate paperwork for gray to clean up that changed today after a long heated call kenny had agreed to come out at this critical juncture with their father suffering from advancing alzheimers the sudden death of his wife sent him into a downward spiral hed spent the past three weeks in a memorycare unit but hed come home last night and during this transition gray needed an extra pair of hands kenny had accumulated enough vacation time to be able to come out for a full two weeks gray intended to hold him to it this time gray had taken a month off from work himself and was due back at sigma headquarters in a week before that he needed a few days of downtime to get his own house in order thats where kenny came in his brother hauled his luggage out of the convertibles trunk slammed the lid but kept his palm on the chrome bumper and what about dads car we might as well sell it its not like he can drive it gray pocketed the keys the classic thunderbirdraven black with a red leather interiorwas his fathers pride and joy the man had gone to painstaking ends to restore it tricking it out with a new holly carburetor a flamethrower coil and an electric choke it stays he said according to dads neurologist its important to keep his environment as stable and consistent as possible to maintain a familiar routine besides even if he cant drive it itll give him something to tinker with before kenny could figure out what else to sell of his fathers belongings gray headed toward the door he didnt bother to offer to carry his brothers luggage hed had enough baggage to deal with lately but kenny wasnt done if were supposed to keep everything the sameto pretend nothings changedthen what am i doing here gray swung toward him balling a fist and tempted to use it because youre still his sonand its high time you acted like it kenny stared him down anger burned in his brothers eyes further reminding gray of their father hed seen that fury all too often in his dad especially of late a belligerence born of dementia and fear not that such anger was new his father had always been a hard man a former oil worker out of texas until an industrial accident took most of his left leg and all of his pride turning an oilman into a housewife raising two boys while his spouse went to work had been hard on him to compensate he had run the household like a boot camp and gray as stubborn as his father had always pushed the envelope a born rebel until at last at eighteen years of age he had simply packed his bags and joined the army it was his mother who finally drew them all back together the proverbial glue of the family and now she was gone what were they to do without her kenny finally hauled up his bag shouldered past gray and mumbled words he knew would cut like rusted barbed wire at least i didnt get mom killed a month ago that gutpunch would have dropped gray to his knees but after mandatory psychiatric sessionsnot that he hadnt missed a fewhis brothers accusation only left him ironhard momentarily rooted in place a booby trap meant for gray had taken out his mother collateral damage was the phrase the psychiatrist had used seeking to blunt the guilt but the funeral had been a closed casket even now he could not face that pain headon the only thing that kept him putting one foot in front of the other was the determination to expose and destroy the shadowy organization behind that coldblooded murder and thats what he did he turned and took one step then another it was all he could do for now pm sct off the seychelles archipelago something woke her in the night aboard the anchored yacht instinctively amanda slid a hand over her swollen belly taking immediate personal inventory had it been a cramp in her third trimester that was always her first worry a maternal reflex to protect her unborn child but she felt nothing painful in her abdomen just the usual pressure on her bladder still after two miscarriages the panicky flutter in her heart refused to calm she tried to reassure herself that the other two babiesa boy and a girlhad been lost during her first trimester im crossing my thirtysixth week everything is fine she lifted up an elbow her husband snored softly beside her on the queensize bed in the yachts main stateroom his dark skin so stark against the white satin pillow she took comfort in macks muscular presence in the masculine bruise of black stubble across his cheek and chin he was her michelangelo david chiseled out of black granite yet she could not escape the twinge of unease as her finger hovered over his bare shoulder hesitant to wake him but wanting those strong arms around her her parentswhose aristocratic family went back generations in the old southhad only approved the marriage with the strained graciousness of modern sensibilities but in the end the union served the family she was blond and blueeyed raised in the world of cotillions and privilege he was blackhaired and dark of skin and eye hardened by a rough childhood on the streets of atlanta the unlikely couple became a poster for familial tolerance trotted out when needed but that poster of a happy family was missing one key element a child after a year of failing to conceivedue to an issue with her husbands fertilitytheyd resorted to in vitro fertilization with donor sperm on the third try after two miscarriages theyd finally had success her palm found her belly again protective a boy and thats when the trouble had begun a week ago she had received a cryptic note warning her to flee not to tell anyone in her family the letter hinted at why but offered only a few details yet it was enough to convince her to run a loud thump echoed down from the deck overhead she sat upright ears straining her husband rolled onto his back rubbing an eye blearily what is it babe she shook her head and held up a palm to quiet him theyd taken such precautions covering every step theyd chartered a series of private aircraft under a chain of falsified papers and itineraries landing a week ago on the other side of the world at an airstrip on the tiny island of assumption part of the archipelago of the seychelles hours after landing theyd immediately set out in a private yacht sailing amid the chain of islands that spread out in an emerald arc across the azure seas she had wanted to be isolated far from prying eyesyet close enough to the seychelles capital city of victoria in case there was any trouble with the pregnancy since arriving only the captain and his two crew members had ever seen their faces and none of them knew their true names it seemed the perfect plan muffled voices reached her she could not make out any words but heard the harsh threatthen a gunshot as bright and loud as the strike of a cymbal it set her heart to pounding not now not when were this close mack burst out of the sheets wearing only his boxers amanda stay here he pulled open the top drawer of the bedside table and hauled out a large black automatic pistol his service weapon from his years as a charleston police officer he pointed to the rear of the stateroom hide in the bathroom amanda gained her feet bloodless and weak with terror wobbling under the weight of her gravid belly mack dashed to the door checked the peephole satisfied he opened the door enough to slip out and closed it silently behind himbut not before giving one last command lock it amanda obeyed then searched the room for any weapon at all she settled for a small knife used to carve the fresh fruit placed in their cabin each morning the handle was still sticky from papaya juice with blade in hand she retreated to the bathroom but stopped at the threshold she could not go inside she refused to be trapped inside such a tight space the tiny staterooms head could not contain the enormity of her fear more gun blasts rang outamid shouts and curses she sank to her knees clutching the knife with one hand supporting her belly with the other her anxiety reached the child inside she felt a small kick i wont let them hurt you she whispered to her boy overhead footsteps pounded back and forth she stared upward trying to pierce through the floors to the starlit deck what was happening how many were up there then a furtive scrabbling sounded at her doorfollowed by a faint knock she hurried forward and placed an eye to the peephole mack nodded back at her then glanced quickly back up the passageway had he found a way off the yachtor out of desperation simply come back to defend her with numb fingers she fumbled the lock open and began to pull the door only to have it kicked wide she stumbled back in shock a tall barechested black man stalked into the roombut it wasnt mack he held macks head in his right hand gripping it by the throat shiny blood poured down his forearm from the severed neck in his other hand he clutched an equally bloody machete he smiled widely showing white teeth like a shark plainly amused by his joke she retreated in horror forgetting her tiny blade another figure stepped around the monster a pale man in a perfectly tailored white suit the only color to him was his black hair and a thin mustache above even thinner lips he was tall enough that he had to bow himself into the room he also smiled but apologetically as if embarrassed by the exuberance of his companion he spoke a few sharp words in some african dialect clearly chastising his companion with a shrug the other tossed her husbands head upon the bed its time to go the suited man ordered her in a genteel british accent as if inviting her to a party she refused to movecouldnt move the brit sighed and motioned to his companion he came forward roughly grabbed her elbow and dragged her out the door the brit followed them across the short passageway and up the ladder to the stern deck there she found only more horror and chaos the captain and his two crewmates along with a pair of the assailants lay sprawled in pools of blood the attackers had been shot the yachts crew hacked dismembered by the sheer force of the brutality the surviving assailants gathered atop the deck or off in a scarred boat tied to the starboard rail a handful scoured the yacht hauling out cases of wine bagfuls of supplies stripping anything of value they were all blackskinned some bearing tribal scarring many no older than boys weapons bristled among them rusty machetes antiquelooking automatic rifles and countless pistols pirates under the moonlight freshened by the evenings southeasterly trade winds her mind cleared enough to allow despair and bitter guilt to creep in out here in the seychelles she had thought they were far enough away from the horn of africa to be safe from the modernday pirates who hunted those waters a dreadful mistake she was shoved toward the moored boat accompanied by the brit she had read somewhere in her fathers briefings about how a few european expatriates had taken to aiding and financing the profitable new industry of piracy she stared at the british man wondering how he had managed to avoid getting a single drop of blood on his pristine suit amid all this carnage he must have noted her attention and turned to her as they reached the starboard rail what do you want with me she asked fixing him with a hard stare suddenly glad that all the papers aboard hid her true identity im nobody the brits gaze lowered from her steely resolvebut not out of shame or remorse it is not you we want he stared at her belly its your baby pm est takoma park maryland balancing a bag of groceries on his hip gray pulled open the screened back door to his familys home the smell of a baking pie rich in cinnamon struck him first on his way back from the gym he got a text from kenny to fetch some french vanilla ice cream and a few other odds and ends needed for tonights dinnerthe first family dinner since the tragic loss of their mother a glance at the stove revealed a large pot of bubbling bolognese sauce by the sink a drying bowl of spaghetti in a strainer a hissing pop drew his gaze back to the pot only now did he note the vigorous boil to the sauce unattended and forgotten red sauce roiled over the lip dribbled down the sides and sizzled into the gas burner something was wrong that was confirmed when a loud bellow erupted from the next room wheres my keys gray dropped the groceries on the counter turned off the stovetop and headed to the living room someones stealing my car passing through the dining room gray joined the fracas in the living room overstuffed furniture was positioned around a central stone hearth cold and dark at the moment his father looked skeletal in the recliner by the picture window hed once filled that same seat commanding the room now he was a frail shadow of his former self still he remained strong he attempted to push out of the chair but kenny held down his shoulders he was assisted by a petite woman with a brownishgray bob dressed in blue scrubs down on one knee she held his fathers hand and urged him to be calm mary benning was an rn at the hospitals memorycare unit during his stay there his father had taken a shine to her gray was able to hire her away to serve as a night nurse here at the house to be on hand when his father had the most trouble the plan had been for kenny to keep an eye on dad during the day until gray and mary could interview and hire a day nurse to cover a full twentyfourhour shift it would be expensive but director crowe had arranged adequate compensation a death benefit to help cover the costs and keep grays father in his own house harriet let me go his father yanked his hand free of marys coming close to elbowing kenny in the nose the nurse kept a hand on his knee and gave it a squeeze of reassurance jack its me mary his eyes found hers a confused look passed over his face then he sagged as memory washed back over him mary glanced at gray your father caught you pulling up with the groceries saw the thunderbird just got a little panicked and confused hell be fine kenny straightened a stricken look on his face hed not really seen dad get like this before shook up he stumbled away the motion drew his fathers attention his eyes got huge kenny whatre you doing here kenny didnt know what to say still stunned by the swiss cheese that was his fathers memory mary covered for him not hiding the truth only patting his knee jack hes been here all day his father searched their faces then leaned back in his chair oh yeah thats right i remember but did he or was he only acquiescing in an attempt to feign normalcy kenny shared a glance with gray glassy with shock welcome to my world id better get back to finishing your dinner mary said standing and dusting off her knee and id better finish unpacking kenny said seeking a hasty retreat good idea and wash up his father ordered with an echo of his former bluster your rooms up i havent forgotten where it is kenny cut him off blind to the callousness of such a remark to someone suffering from alzheimers but his dad merely nodded satisfied as kenny stepped away his father finally seemed to notice gray standing there the confusion on his face faded but a stab of old anger took its place it had taken his father almost two weeks to finally acknowledge and ultimately remember the death of his wife so to his mind the wound was still raw he also knew the source of that loss that he always remembered there had been many bad days in the intervening weeks but what could either of them do no words could bring her back a knock at the door startled them all gray tensed expecting the worst kenny already headed to the front stairs opened the door a lithe figure stood out on the porch dressed in black leather and a loose motorcycle jacket over a maroon blouse she carried a helmet under one arm the gloominess of the day lifted at the sight of her as gray headed to the door seichan what are you doing here his father interrupted dont leave the lady standing on the stoop kenny he waved the visitor inside he might be losing his memory but he knew a handsome woman when one landed on his doorstep thank you mr pierce seichan entered slipping inside moving with the leonine grace of a jungle cat all sinew muscles and long curves she cast an appraising glance toward kenny as she stepped past himwhatever she saw there she found lacking her eyes found grays face next and visibly hardenednot in anger more like protection theyd barely spoken since theyd shared a kiss and a promise three weeks ago the pledge was not a romantic one only the assurance that shed work alongside him to expose those who had a hand in his mothers murder still gray remembered the softening of those lips was there more to that promise something yet unspoken before he could dwell on it further his father pointed to the table were just about to sit down to dinner why dont you join us thats very kind seichan said stiffly but i wont be staying long i just need a word with your son those almondshaped eyesmarking her eurasian heritagefixed on gray with plain intent something was up seichan was a former assassin for the same shadowy group responsible for his mothers death an international criminal organization called the guild its real identity and purpose remained unknown even to its own agents the organization operated through individual cells around the world each running independently none having the complete picture seichan had eventually turned against it recruited by director crowe to serve as a double agent until her subterfuge was exposed nowhunted both by her former employers and by foreign intelligence agencies for her past crimesshe was grays partner and his responsibility and maybe something more gray stepped close to her whats up she kept her voice low i got a call from director crowe came straight here theres been a kidnapping off the seychelles by somali pirates a highvalue american target painter wanted to know if you were up for a mission gray frowned why was sigma involved with a simple kidnapping there were plenty of policing and maritime agencies that could attend to such a crime sigma forcemade up of special forces soldiers who had been retrained in various scientific disciplineswas a covert wing for darpa the defense advanced research projects agency sigma teams were sent out into the world to protect against global threats not to address the kidnapping of a single american seichan must have read the suspicion in his face her eyes bore into his she plainly knew more but was unable to speak freely in front of the others something big was happening the realization set his heart to beating harder the matter is time sensitive she added if youre coming theres a jet already fueling and kowalski is on his way to pick us up we can swing by your apartment on the way out otherwise well be briefed en route gray glanced at the chair by the cold hearth his father overheard their talk his gaze fixed to his sons face go his father said do your job ive got enough help here gray took comfort in that gruff permission praying it represented some small measure of forgiveness by his father but his next words spoken with a harsh bitterness dashed such hope besides the less i see of your face right now the better gray backed a step seichan took his elbow as if ready to catch him but it was the heat of her palm more than anything that steadied him the reassurance of human contactlike that kiss weeks ago mary had stepped into the room drying her hands on a towel shed also heard those harsh words and gave gray a sympathetic look ive got things covered here you take some time for yourself he silently thanked her and allowed seichan to guide him toward the door gray felt the need to share some parting farewell with his father the desire burned painfully in his chest but he had no words to voice it before he knew it he found himself out on the front porch he halted at the top step and took in a deep shuddering breath are you okay seichan asked he ran his fingers through his hair ill have to be still she continued to search his face as if seeking a truer answer before she could find it the squeal of rubber on the pavement announced the arrival of his transportation they both turned as a black suv came to a hard stop the window rolled down allowing a pall of cigar smoke to waft out the shaved head of a gorilla followed chewing on a stump of a stogie you coming or what kowalski called hoarsely as much as the man aggravated him gray had never been happier to see his brutish teammate he headed down the steps only to have kenny come rushing out after him blocking his way you cant leave now what am i supposed to do gray pointed back at the house its your turn what do you think ive been doing all this time he shoved past his sputtering brother and crossed toward the waiting suv and seichans parked motorcycle she kept beside him slipping on her helmet who else has been assigned to us he asked weve been ordered to pick up another two teammates local assets already in the region with unique skills to help us on this mission who are they she offered a ghost of a smile as she snapped down her helmets visor her words echoed out from inside darkly amused i hope youve had your rabies shots july pm east africa time republic of tanzania the low growl warned him already on edge tucker wayne flattened against the brick wall of the narrow street and slid into the deeper shadows of a doorway an hour ago he noticed someone following him watching from afar he had managed to lose the tail quickly in the labyrinth of alleyways and crooked streets that made up this crumbling section of zanzibar who had found him he pressed his back against a carved wooden door he intended to stay lost undiscoverable he had been adrift in the world for the past three years now one year shy of his thirtieth birthday two weeks ago he had reached the archipelago of zanzibar a string of sunbaked islands off the eastern coast of africa the name alonezanzibarconjured up another time a land of mystery and mythology it was a place to disappear to live unseen and where few questions were asked people knew better than to be curious still he often drew second glances here not because he was white the ancient port of zanzibar remained the crossroads for people of every race and color and after a full year traveling through africa his skin was burned as dark as that of any of the local merchants hawking wares in the spice markets of old stone town and he certainly struck a tall figure muscularmore quarterback than linebackerthough there remained a hardness to his eyes that made any curious glance toward him skirt quickly away instead what attracted the most attention to him was something else someone else kane brushed up against his thighsilent now with hackles still raised tucker rested a hand on his dogs side not to calm him but ready to signal his partner if necessary and thats what they were partners kane was an extension of himself a disembodied limb while the dog looked like a hardbodied compact german shepherd he was actually a belgian shepherd dog called a malinois his fur was black and tan but mostly black a match to his dark eyes under his palm tucker felt kanes muscles tense half a block away a thin shape burst around the next corner careening in a panic in his haste he collided off the far wall and rebounded down the street glancing frequently over his shoulder tucker sized him up in a breath and weighed any danger early twenties maybe late teens a mix of asian and indian his eyes wide with terror his limbs and face sickly gauntfrom addiction from malnourishment the runner clutched his right side failing to stanch a crimson bloom from seeping through his white shift the scent of fresh blood must have alerted kane along with the panicked tread of those bare feet tucker prepared to step out of the shadowed doorway to go to the young mans aidbut the pressure against his legs increased pinning him in place a heartbeat later the reason became clear around the same corner stalked a trio of large men african with tribal tattoos across their faces they carried machetes and spread to either side of the empty street with the clear skill of experienced hunters their target also noted their arrivaligniting his already frightened flight into a full routbut blood loss and exhaustion had taken their toll within a few steps the victim tripped and sprawled headlong across the street though he struck the cobbles hard he didnt make a sound not a whimper or a cry simply defeated that more than anything drew tucker out of hiding that and something his grandfather had drilled into him in the face of inhumanity a good man reactsbut a great one acts tucker tapped three fingers against his dogs side the signal plain defend kane leaped over the prone body of the young man and landed in a crouch on the far side tail high teeth bared growling the shepherds sudden appearance caused all three attackers to stop in shock as if some demon djinn had materialized before them tucker used the distraction to fold out of the shadows and close upon the nearest of the three men in a swift capture of wrist followed by an elbow strike to the chin the machete ended up in tuckers grip he flathanded the man away as the second assailant wielded his blade in a roundhouse swing rather than leaping clear tucker lunged forward entering the mans guard he caught the deadly arm under his own and snaked his hand fully around the limb and immobilized it with his other arm he slammed the buttend of the steel machete into the mans nose bone cracked blood spurted the man went limp but tucker held him upright by his trapped arm from the corner of his eye he saw the third and largest opponent back away two steps and free a pistol tucker swung around using his captured assailants body as a shield as shots rang out it proved a meager defense at such close range one of the rounds blasted through his captives neck grazing tuckers shoulder then a scream bellowed tucker shoved the body aside and saw kane latched onto the shooters wrist the dogs fangs digging deep the pistol clattered to the street the mans eyes were round with panic as he tried to shake the shepherd loose blood and slather flew only then did the huge african remember the machete in his other hand he lifted it high ready to hack at the dog release tucker cried out the command was barely off his lips when kane obeyed letting go and dropping back on the street but the man continued his downward swing at the dogs neck with a savage bellow kane could not get out of the way in time tucker was already moving heart pounding he dove for the abandoned pistol and scooped it up he shoulderrolled to bring the weapon upbut he was too slow the machete flashed in the sunlight a gunshot cracked loudly the man crumpled backward half his skull shattering away the blade flew away harmlessly tucker stared at his pistol the shot had not come from his weapon up the street a new trio appeared two men and a woman though dressed in street clothes they all had the stamp of military about them the leader in the center held a smoking sig sauer see to him he pointed to the bleeding young man on the ground his voice had a slight texas accent get him to a local hospital and well rendezvous back at the evac point despite the concern about the injured man the leaders gaze never unlocked from tuckers eyes from the hard contours of his face the closecropped black hair that had gone a bit lanky and the stony edge to his stormgray eyes he was definitely military likely exmilitary not good the leader crossed over to him ignoring kanes wary growl he offered a hand to help tucker up youre a difficult man to find captain wayne tucker bit back any surprise and ignored the offered hand he stood on his own you were the ones following me earlier this morning and you lost us a hard twinkle of amusement brightened the mans eyes not an easy thing to do that alone proves youre the man we need not interested he turned but the man stepped in front of him and blocked the way a finger pointed at his chest which only managed to irritate him further listen for one minute the man said then youre free to go tucker stared down at the finger the only reason he didnt reach out and break it was that the man had saved kanes life a moment ago he owed him that muchand perhaps even a minute of his time who are you he asked the offending finger turned into an open palm inviting a handshake commander gray pierce i work for an organization called sigma tucker scowled never heard of it that makes you what defense contractors mercenaries he made his disdain for that last word plain that dark twinkle grew brighter as the other lowered his arm no we work under the auspices of darpa tucker frowned but curiosity kept him listening darpa was the defense departments researchanddevelopment administration what the hell was going on here perhaps we can discuss this in a quieter location the commander said by now the mans partners had gathered up the wounded young man shouldered him between them and were headed down the street faces had begun to peer out of windows or to peek from behind crackedopen doors other figures hovered at the corners zanzibar often turned a blind eye to most offenses but the gunfire and bloodshed would not be ignored for long as soon as they left the bodies would be looted of anything of value and any inquiries would be met with blank stares i know a place tucker said and led the way pm gray sipped a hot tea spiced with cardamom he sat with tucker wayne on a rooftop deck overlooking the indian ocean across the waters the triangular sails of old wooden dhows mixed with cargo ships and a smattering of tourist yachts for the moment they had the hotels tiny restaurant to themselves at the foot of the building a small spice market rang and bustled wafting up with a m√©lange of nutmeg cinnamon vanilla cloves and countless other spices that had once lured sultans to this island and had fueled an active slavetrading industry the island had exchanged hands many times which was evident in its unique blend of moorish middle eastern indian and african traditions around every corner the city changed faces and remained impossible to categorize the same could be said for the stranger who was seated across the narrow table from him gray placed his cup of tea onto a cracked saucer a heavybodied fly drawn by the sweet tea came lumbering down and landed on the table it crawled toward his cup gray swatted at itbut before his palm could strike the table fingers caught his wrist stopping him dont tucker said then gently waved the fly off before returning to his thousandyard stare out to sea gray rubbed his wrist and watched the fly oblivious to its salvation buzz lazily away tucker finally cleared his throat what do you want with me gray focused back on the matter at hand he had read the former army rangers dossier en route to the horn of africa tucker was a superb dog handler testing through the roof in regards to emotional empathy which helped him bond with his subjects sometimes too deeply a psych evaluation attributed such a response to earlychildhood trauma raised in north dakota he had been orphaned when his parents had been killed by a drunk driver when he was a toddler leaving him in the care of his grandfather who had a heart attack when tucker was thirteen from there hed been dumped into foster care until he petitioned for early emancipation at seventeen and joined the armed services with such a chaotic unstable upbringing he seemed to have developed an affinity for animals more than humans still gray sensed there was more to the man than just psychiatric evaluations and test scores at his core he remained a mystery like why he had abruptly left the service disappearing immediately after being discharged leaving behind a uniform full of medals including a purple heart earned after one of the nastiest firefights in afghanistanoperation anaconda at takur ghar gray cut to the chase as time was running out captain wayne during your military career your expertise was extraction and rescue your commanding officer claimed there was none better the man shrugged you and your dog kane tucker interrupted his names kane a furry left ear pricked at his masters voice the small shepherd lay sprawled on the floor looking drowsy inattentive but gray knew better his muzzle rested against the toe of tuckers boot ready for any signal from his partner gray had read kanes dossier too the military war dog had a vocabulary of a thousand words along with the knowledge of a hundred hand gestures the two were bound together more intimately than any husband and wifeand together with the dogs heightened senses and ability to maneuver in places where men could not the two were frighteningly efficient in the field gray needed that expertise theres a mission he said you would be well paid sorry theres not enough gold in fort knox gray had prepared for this attitude readied for this eventuality perhaps not but when you left the service you stole government property tucker faced him his eyes going diamondhard in that gaze gray read the necessity to speak warily to play the one card he had with great care gray continued it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless manhours to train a warservice dog he dared not even glance toward kane he kept his gaze fixed on tucker those were my manhours tucker answered darkly i trained both kane and abel and look what happened to abel this time around it wasnt kane who killed abel gray had read the brutal details in the files and avoided that minefield still kane is government property military hardware a skilled combat tracker complete this mission and he is yours to keep free and clear disgust curled a corner of tuckers lip no one owns kane commander not the us government not special forces not even me understood but thats our offer tucker glared at him for a long breaththen abruptly leaned back crossing his arms his posture plain he was not agreeing only willing to listen again what do you need me for an extraction a rescue where in somalia who gray sized up his opponent the detail he was about to reveal was known only to a handful of people high in the government it had shocked him when hed first learned the truth if word should somehow reach her captors who tucker pressed kane must have sensed his partners growing agitation and let out a low rumble voicing his own complaint gray answered them both we need your help in rescuing the presidents daughter july am est washington dc now the real work could start on the lowest level of the west wing director painter crowe waited for the situation room to clear the whole process was a carefully orchestrated dance of power who left first who acknowledged whom who exited together or alone it made his head spin painter had spent the entire threehourlong strategy session seated outside the inner circle of the white house the toptier officials took posts in the upholstered leather chairs clustered around the main conference table that included the white house chief of staff the national security advisor the head of homeland security the secretary of defense along with a handful of others it was a closed meeting no assistants no deputies no secretaries only the top brass not even the situation rooms aroundtheclock watch team was allowed admittance the secrets discussed here were restricted to as few ears as possible at the start of the meeting painter had been introduced as a representative of darpa which raised a few eyebrows especially the gray ones of the defense secretary dressed in a conservative suit painter was a decade younger than anyone here his dark hair blemished only by a single lock of white hair tucked like a feather behind one ear heightening his mixed native american heritage no one questioned why the president had summoned painter to this closeddoor meeting few of them even knew about sigmas existence let alone its involvement here and that was the way the president wanted it so painter had sat silently in one of the lowertier chairs away from the main table observing taking a few notes both mental and typed into his laptop president james t gant had called everyone into the mornings briefing to get an update on the status of his kidnapped twentyfiveyearold daughter amanda gantbennett it had been twenty hours since the midnight attack on her yacht the boats captain had managed to get out an sos on his marine radio even disabled the engines before the raiders boarded the boat slaying all on board including the womans husband gruesome pictures of the aftermath had been shown on several of the video panels on the walls painter had studied the presidents expressions as those images flashed past the pained pinch at the corners of his eyes the hardening of his jaw muscles the pale cast to his face it all seemed genuine marking the terror of a father for a lost child but certain details made no sense like why his daughter had been traveling under a fake passport that mystery alone cost them critical hours in the search for the missing girl responding to the sos the seychelles coast guard had immediately reported the pirate attack detailing that american citizens had been involved but it was only after fingerprints had been lifted from the yachts stateroom that a red flag had been raised in the states identifying the victims as the presidents daughter and her husband theyd lost precious hours because of the confusion and it could cost the girl her life james gant stood at the door to the situation room and shook the hand of the last man to leave it was a twohanded shake as intimate as a hug thanks bobby for twisting the nros arm to get that satellite moved so fast bobby was the secretary of state robert lee gant the presidents older brother he was cleanshaven whitehaired with hazelgreen eyes a distinguished elder statesman sixtysix years of age no one questioned that hed properly earned his positioneven pundits from the other party wouldnt raise the charge of nepotism for this cabinetpost assignment robert gant had served three administrations on both sides of the political divide hed been an ambassador to laos in the late eighties and was considered instrumental in reopening diplomatic ties with both cambodia and vietnam in the nineties and now he served his younger brother with equal aplomb dont worry jimmy the nro will have a satellite in geosynchronous orbit above the somali coastline within the hour ill make sure no stone is left unturned well find her the president nodded but he seemed unconvinced by his brothers promise as the secretary of state exited painter found himself alone with the leader of the free world the president ran a hand through his saltandpepper hair then rubbed the palm over the rough stubble on his chin the man hadnt slept since word had reached him he still wore the same clothes only shedding the jacket and rolling up the sleeves of his shirt he stood for a moment straightbacked lost in his own thoughtsthen he finally sagged and pointed to another door lets get out of this damned woodshed he said using the nickname for the situation room with the departure of his executive team his carolina drawl grew thicker my briefing rooms right next door painter followed him into a more intimate chamber another conference table filled the room but it was smaller abutting against a wall with two video screens the president dropped into one of the seats with a heavy sigh as if the weight of the entire world rested on his shoulders and painter imagined sometimes it did only this day was worse take a seat director thank you mr president call me jimmy all my friends do and as of this moment youre my best friend because you have the best chance of finding my girl and grandson painter sat down slowly warily feeling some of that weight of the world settle on his own shoulders that was the other concern amanda was pregnant in her third trimester so what was she doing in the seychelles traveling under false papers the presidents iceblue eyes bore into him the force of his charisma was like a stiff wind in the face in the past sigma saved my life and they had it was one of the reasons painter had been summoned by the president to participate in this search i need another miracle director at least the man understood the gravity of the situation for now the somali pirates had no idea whom theyd kidnapped as far as they knew amanda was just another american hostage but if they should ever learn her true identity they could panic and kill her dump her body in the closest crocodileinfested river and wash their hands of the situation or theyd hide her so well bury her in some godforsaken hole that any hope of rescue would be impossible until their demands were metand even then she might be murdered the head of homeland had offered a third chilling possibility this morning that shed be sold to some hostile government used as a pawn to leverage some concession from the us government so the goal was clear find amanda before the kidnappers learned the truth whats your take on this mornings briefing the president asked your team has the larger picture covered i wouldnt do anything differently move a fastresponse team into the region be ready to strike at a moments notice coordinate with cia assets across the horn of africa but until we get a new satellite feed of the somali coast were operating blind in crossreferencing the time of the attack with the logs of satellites passing over the indian ocean theyd managed to download a fleeting view of the actual kidnapping the resolution had been poor but they could make out the yacht and the raiding vessel it had fled east after the attack heading for the african coast but unfortunately within an hour the ship had passed out of satellite range so the exact location where it made landfall was unknown it could be anywhere along the east africa coast but somalianotorious for its rampant piracywas the most probable base of operations a new national reconnaissance office satellite was being commandeered and shifted to help search for the missing ship along that rocky coastline but that wasnt their best hope painter continued sir we need boots on the ground there our highest probability for a success lies in a surgical extraction to drop in a small searchandrescue team under the radar got it if we go in all shockandawe on their asses theyll know their captive is important and theyll bury her painter regretted his choice of words as soon as they passed his lips james gants face went ashen but as a mark of the mans fortitude he waved for painter to go on the team i told you about is already in the area ill continue to coordinate with nsa nro and my superiors at darpa if the pirates location is discovered my team is under strict instructions to attempt a rescue only if success is guaranteed otherwise well pass on the coordinates and summon in the navys fastresponse seal team for extraction a worried nod acknowledged his plan painter continued the kidnappers will move your daughter somewhere safe then interrogate her theyll need to obtain a phone number a contact here in the states where they can forward a ransom demand if your daughter is smart she is then shell keep her identity a secret hopefully shell give them some number outside the presidential circle perhaps a relative or a close friend we have to be ready for that make sure that recipient stays quiet doesnt go to the police or the press ill pass the word painter asked a pointed question can you trust all of your relatives to remain silent they wont say a word the gant clan knows how to keep secrets thats certainly true for the past month painter had been conducting a quiet investigation into the gant family information had come to light during a recent sigma mission that cast suspicions upon the family not that there werent already rumors surrounding such a highprofile dynasty they were nicknamed the kennedys of the south with generational ties going back to the founding of america and as america grew so did this family rooting and entwining into multiple industries corporations the halls of statehouses and now a secondterm presidency but last month a disturbing bit of information about this southern dynasty had come to light documented centuries ago this same clan appeared to be connected to a shadowy cabal of old aristocratic families they went by many names the guild echelon les familles de l√©toile the star families all that was truly known about this group was that they moved throughout history manipulating events gathering power wealth and knowledge often achieving this by enfolding themselves within a series of secret organizations brotherhoods and fraternal lodges they were said to be the secret within all secret societies but the passing centuries had not been kind to them winnowing the lineage down to a single bloodline the gant clan still that did not mean the presidentor his immediate kinhad any knowledge of this organization the gant family tree had roots and branches that spread far and wide on this shore and others it was impossible to say which family members were involved with the modernday incarnation of this criminal organizationthat is if any of them were involved all of it might end up being a wildgoose chase as the true leaders of the guildfor lack of a better name for themremained as elusive as ever but what was known for sure was that the group was deadly resourceful and responsible for countless acts of terrorism global atrocities and an inestimable number of international crimes to consider that the presidentthis man seated across from him heartsick and terrified for his daughterwas a part of that same organization seemed impossible the lack of solid proof was one of the reasons painter kept his suspicions about the gant family to himself trusting no one with this information not even his fellow sigma operatives especially commander gray pierce whose mother had been killed recently by a rogue guild agent if the man learned the president had any hand in that coldblooded murder there was no telling what he would do as angry as he was hed shoot first and ask questions later so the questions were left for painter to ask he stared back at james gant not to be indelicate he started but i still dont understand what your pregnant daughter was doing out among the outer islands of the seychelles why was she traveling under false papers there was something wrong about this whole situation painter pressed knowing this matter might offer his best chance to wheedle more information about the familyand more specifically about the first family is there anything youre not telling me mr president anything youre holding back any detail could make a difference between success or failure this time he purposefully avoided saying life or death james gant stared down at his hands as if trying to find meaning in the lines of his palms amanda was always a wild child he offered painter a wan wistful smile much like her father she was nineteen when i first stepped into the white house even younger when i was running for my first term she hated the limelight chafed against being a presidents daughter i remember she once punched a secret service agent gant laughed leaning back and half covering his mouth as if surprised he could still laugh that was amanda during my second run for office she was twentythree fresh out of college and off on her own she flourished out of my shadow i have to say then she met mack bennett a charleston police officer after they married i thought that would settle her down painter gently directed him back to the mystery at hand and this trip out to the seychelles gant lifted his empty hands and shook his head not even the secret service knew about this unscheduled trip damned if she didnt slip out from under all our noses my only guess is she wanted some time alone with her husband away from the paparazzi and tabloids before the birth of my grandson after that the two would be lucky for a moments privacy painter studied the presidents face looking for any microexpression that would indicate deceit but all he found was a man dissolving into grief and fear if thats all gant said painter stood up ive got what i need my team should be flying into somalia as we speak and i must get back to sigma command very good gant pushed out of his seat ever the southern gentleman let me walk you out the pair left the presidents personal briefing room pausing only long enough for painter to retrieve his blackberry from a leadlined box outside the situation room as he straightened and pocketed his phone a familiar figure appeared at the end of the hall flanked by secret service she was dressed in a sapphireblue twill dress over which she tied a lace cardigan tightly around her belly painter noted her balled fists the scared cast to her eyes as she found her husband the first lady teresa gant hurried toward him balanced between attempting to maintain a professional decorum and raw panic jimmy i heard from your secretary that the meeting was over i waited for as long as i terry im sorry the president caught his wife hugged her and brushed a few loose blond hairs from her cheek i had a few more details to attend to i was going to you next she stared up at his face searching for any news there plainly afraid to question him in front of her bodyguards no one could know about amandas plight come lets return to the residence the president looked ready to scoop her into his arms and carry her to safety ill tell you everything there gant glanced at painter he understood teresa needed her husband at this moment they were not the first lady and the president they were simply two parents terrified for their child seeking comfort in each others arms painter left them to their grief more determined than ever to find their daughter but as he headed down the hall he could not escape the feeling that the events in the horn of africa were masking something far greaterand far more dangerous he checked his watch gray and his team would be landing in somalia in the next hour if anyone could ferret out the true intent behind the kidnapping of the young woman it was commander pierce still painter felt a stab of misgiving for having sent gray in blind for failing to mention his suspicions about the presidents family he prayed that silence didnt cost lives especially the presidents daughter and her unborn child july pm east africa time cal madow mountains somalia the truck continued its slow crawl through the mistshrouded forest amanda gantbennett rode in the back of the oldermodel land rover modified with an open top it must have once served as a safaritouring vehicle a massive grille protected the front end and four large driving lights were mounted on the roof rack shed also noted the two winchesfront and backalong with a shovel and ax secured to the fender ready to help free the vehicle if it became bogged down or stuck from the terrain they traveled she understood the necessity for such modifications the road was little more than a muddy track through the dark jungle somalia suffered from an arid climate but the rainy seasoncalled gu shed overheardhad just ended these highlands bordering the gulf of aden received most of that rain and what didnt fall here as precipitation remained as thick fog a jarring bump threw her high only her seat belt kept her from flying out of the truck she had initially thought of doing just that of leaping free and taking her chances out in the dark jungle but seated beside her was a heavyset guard armed and sweating chewing khat a local stimulant used by nearly everyone a second larger truck followed at their heels making any chance of escape impossible and she ultimately knew that any attempt would put more than her own life at risk she pushed the lap strap of the seat belt lower below the bulge of her belly and above her hip bones she had to protect her child the baby boy growing in her womb was more important than her own wellbeing he was the reason she and her husband had risked this flight halfway around the world to keep you safe and now her baby had fallen into another set of hands becoming a tool to generate a larger ransom by the pirates she remembered the brits hungry eyes on her belly as she was taken off the yacht here life was a commodity to buy and sell even the new life growing in her belly oh mack i need you she closed her eyes her heart constricting with the last memory of her husband the fear and love shining in macks eyes she shied away from the horror that followed his severed head tossed upon the bed where theyd made such careful love only hours earlier but she had no time to grieve for her husband she drew a long steadying breath taking in the damp and redolent smell of junipers and wild lavender of the dense forest though numb with grief and terror she had to stay strong in the south it was unseemly to be caught sweating in public on the campaign trail with her father she had learned to maintain a placid and friendly exterioreven when screaming on the inside instead it was all smiles handshakes and warm pats on the back even with your enemies especially with your enemies so she continued to cooperate with her captors jumping when they said jump remaining always pliant and obedient still all the while she watched it was another lesson from her father his words echoing in her head explaining the best way to gain the upper hand keep your eyes open and your mouth shut and thats what she intended to do so far the pirates gave no indication they knew she was the presidents daughter theyd not even questioned her yet in fact theyd barely said a word a grunt here or there a pantomimed instruction a few terse orders mostly about drinking water we dont want anything to happen to your baby the warning had come from the man seated in the passenger seat up front the brit with his thin mustache and impeccable attire he remained the only consistent presence around herthough hed ignored her most of the day bent over a laptop computer attached to a satellite phone and gps navigation unit she studied the back of his head trying to figure him out searching for a weakness he tapped at his laptop and the screen changed to a topographic map she feigned a kink in her back to stretch forward trying to peek at the screen to discern some idea of where she was and where they were going but her guard yanked her back his hand lingering over her left breast which was tender and swollen she slapped his fingers away which only earned her a lascivious leer defeated she stared sullenly out at the misty forest exhaustion and fear had stretched the days journey into a blur at dawn theyd made landfall at a small coastal town a booming shantytown of bars hotels restaurants and whorehouses all serving the pirate trade and from the number of expensive cars lining newly paved streets and halfconstructed villas along the coast it was plainly a lucrative and thriving business to protect that industry militiamen swerved through the streets in mercedes suvs weapons bristling from rolleddown windows making sure no one attempted to rescue any of their hostages and there must have been others like her as their boat had entered into port shed spotted numerous captured vessels fishing trawlers sailboats a sleek yacht and anchored out in the deeper waters an oil tanker theyd only remained in town for less than an hour there she was handed over to another pirate gang and put on a hot poorly ventilated volkswagen bus out of town they drove half a day through lands hammered dry and flat by the merciless sun the featureless landscape only broken by the occasional village of dry huts theyd stopped only long enough for her to urinate which was often and humiliating each time in the distance mountains had loomed seeming to grow higher with each passing mile soon it became clear that the broken spine of rocky peaks was their destination upon reaching a village nestled in the scrubby foothills the gang changed yet again but not before a heated argument ensued accompanied by a machismo display of shaken weapons and hurled threats finally the brit had facilitated the exchange of additional funds bills banded in thick bundles and amanda found herself transferred into this old safari vehicle headed into the misty highlands a metallic snap drew her attention forward as the brit closed his laptop with an air of finality the reason became clear a fiery glow appeared in the forest ahead turning the wisps of fog into crimson trails threaded through the darkgreen jungle she smelled roasting meat and woodsmoke with a final haul of fifty yards the land rover broke into an open glade in the jungle overhead camouflage netting masked the camp below giving the space a cavernous feel a trio of small bonfires illuminated the hidden glade along with a few electric lamps on poles the land rover pulled to the side and parked beside a handful of other vehicles additionally a trio of camels settled for the night raised their heads to study the newcomers likewise amanda her eyes huge tried to make sense of the camp a neat circle of militarystyle tents surrounded a larger structure that looked like a picturesque gabled house raised on pilings a yard off the ground across the front a quaint wooden porch held a pair of deck chairs draped with mosquito netting it looked like the jungle home of some african missionary furthering that impression a large bloodred cross decorated one side of the building but as the land rover drew to a halt the charming illusion evaporated the house was actually a makeshift tentcabin with white tarpaulin stretched over a wooden poleframe and the crimson cross was less religious in appearance and more medical like something borrowed from the american red cross only this cross had strange markings along its lengths a twisting and coiling pattern that looked vaguely familiar before she could understand what nagged her the brit pulled open her door and held out his hand to assist her home sweet home he said without any sarcasm in his voice she climbed out unsteady supporting her belly and searched around the steady chug of a diesel generator mocked the wild beating of her heart men and women climbed out of tents to eye the new arrivals most of those faces were black african but they didnt have the starved and desperate look of the pirates even the weapons in view looked modern and wellkept what is going on here the other faces matched the brits white european professional this last assessment came from the number of them wearing blue scrubs like theyd freshly stepped out of a modern hospital for a smoke break the brit led her through the circle of tents and toward the makeshift cabin trailed by her guard she climbed the steps to the small porch a springloaded door opened as they reached the cabin a tall woman joined them her blond hair trimmed into a short athletic bob she was young and freshfaced as if she just slipped out of a swimsuit ad and into surgical scrubs belying that image was the severity of her expression especially her narrowed eyes she took in everyone with a single steelblue glance barely noting amanda her gaze settled on the brit everything is ready dr blake amanda swung toward the brit surprised doctor the man noted her consternation im sorry i never did properly introduce myself he held out his hand dr edward blake obgyn she didnt take his hand instead she stared beyond the blondes shoulder and into the cabin a hospital bed rested against the far wall beside it stood an iv pole and a bank of monitoring equipment on the other side a technician lubricated the transvaginal probe of an ultrasound unit dr blake seemed to take no offense that amanda had refused his hand instead he rubbed his palms together okay then mrs gantbennett why dont we step inside amanda bit back her shock at the mention of her name he knows who i am dr blake motioned with his arm we should check on how your baby boy is doing after the long journey we cant let anything happen to him can we hes much too important amanda backed away in horror her worst nightmare coming true not only did they know who she was they knew what she carried no hands gripped her shoulders from behind and shoved her toward the open door please she prayed please someone help me july pm east africa time boosaaso somalia theyll take good care of her amur mahdi promised at least for now why do you say that gray asked seichan looked equally doubtful she was dressed handsomely in jeans and a local guntiino a bright length of crimson cloth knotted at the shoulder and draped to the waist the look must have worked because amur kept casting sidelong glances in her direction next to her kowalski outfitted in regular street clothes simply swirled his tea looking inattentive the four of them shared a table at a seaside restaurant overlooking the somali port of boosaaso the openair patio looked out onto the gulf of aden the moonlit harbor crowded with massive ships bearing flags of various arab states along with the triangular sails of hundreds of smaller woodenkeeled dhows grays team had arrived at the bender qassim international airport outside of boosaaso forty minutes ago traveling under the cover of unhcr the united nations refugee agency the relief group maintained a presence here in puntland the northeastern state of somalia where most of the countrys lawless pirates operated boosaaso was the main crossroads for this region and the best base of operations to begin gathering intelligence this introductory meeting was with amur mahdia former pirate turned cia asset he was an older man dressed in regional attire which included loose trousers and a saronglike kilt known as a macawiis he also wore a traditional embroidered cap atop his grizzled hair the man had lost one leg at the knee several years back an injury that sidelined him from his former profession as a pirate the sight of the prosthetic limb reminded gray of his father whod been similarly disabled a twinge of guilt flared at being half a world away from him but he fought it down and concentrated on the conversation the meeting had been arranged by director crowe channeled through various intelligence agencies the goal of this meeting was to evaluate the current situation in somalia while word was still pending on the search for the raiders ship via satellite painter wanted eyes on the ground meanwhile a pair of black hawks idled at a us base to the north in the neighboring tiny east african nation of djibouti seal team six under the operational orders of joint special operations command waited to be summoned once amandas location was determined but where was the first daughter amur explained his lack of concern for the hostages safety he didnt know about the victim being the presidents daughter only that she was an american woman for the most part somali pirates make decent hosts beatings are rare but they do occur otherwise they keep their guests protected and wellfed it does no one any good if a hostage dies in fact the feeding and housing of captured crews help maintain the economy of puntland gray knew how lucrative the piracy trade was last year alone somali pirates collected million in ransom and that was only the tip of the true cost of piracy in the region the shipping industry and governments spent billion during that same time accruing additional expenses from insurance premiums from heightened security even rescue missions like the recent one that secured the safe return of an american and a danish citizen and what about the somali government seichan asked what are they doing about the rampant piracy amur leaned back in his chair and lifted his arms hopelessly in the air what somali government the central government fell back in throwing the country into chaos without anyone patrolling our territorial waters the tunarich seas around here were plundered and stripped by foreign fishing fleets stealing the food and livelihood from our local people is it any wonder our fishermen armed themselves becoming their own militia and confronted the illegal boats and crews gray had read the briefings on the flight out here and those confrontations eventually led to the fishermen confiscating ships and personnel and demanding ransoms more like a toll amur corrected earning a scoffing grunt from kowalski their informants face reddened his back stiffening with pride though the man had turned informant gray was reminded of the old adage once a pirate always a pirate or maybe amurs justifications were merely a reflection of national pride we deserved some compensation for our plundered seas he continued who else is looking after us look at the port here he nodded to the bustling harbor this place used to be a hellhole with no infrastructure no hope everything crumbling apart kowalski raised a skeptical eyebrow toward the dusty city seeming to think the description of hellhole still fit it after the government fell amur continued we took care of each other a local businessman started our phone system teachers worked for free the police are all volunteers too now were one of the busiest ports in the region a boomtown as you say we export tens of thousands of goats sheep and camels across the arab world kowalskis skeptical eyebrow refused to lower gray understood as he looked out at all the new construction going on across the nighttime city at the palatial mansions rising behind high walls he suspected not all of that largesse came from boosaasos importexport industry gray had read how this city was still ranked as one of the most likely places to get kidnapped not exactly a high honor though the local government was attempting to change that its jails were full of piratesbut how much was that for international show piracy continued to be the main industry running the puntland economy how were they going to make any headway in finding the presidents daughter against those economic odds money could free tonguesas it had with amur mahdibut it also bought silence and now the fishes return to our waters amur said with a note of vindication and finality with the foreign fleets afraid to come near our seas once again teem with tuna and our people are no longer hungry gray had to admit that much was true somali piracy had a positive impact on reversing the overfishing of its territorial waters but at what price amur stood up the night grows late i will see what i can discover about this missing american woman but as you know rescue attempts over the past year have resulted in pirate deaths it will not be easy getting information gray stood and shook the mans hand he read between the lines to break that silence would require additional funds but gray feared if too much money was thrown into the search it could raise the suspicions of amandas captors a delicate balance had to be struck herebut for now they had no choice i understand do what you must gray said he shook the mans hand and wished him good night using his native tongue which earned an appreciative smile from amur haben wanaagsan gray waited for amur to leave the restaurant before motioning the others up we should get back to the hotel they headed out as a group even at this hour the streets were clogged with trucks people and carts sizzling food stands tiny tea stalls and makeshift shops packed both sides of the street all around boosaaso bustled hammered rang and shouted they kept to a tight knot as they traversed the crowded streets on their way toward their hotel seichan spoke at his ear her breath hot on his cheek you were right weve picked up a tail gray stopped at a fruit stand studying the exotic fare while searching the street behind them he noted two figures in street clothes who ducked out of sight as he had stopped two of them three seichan corrected the woman in the green sarong by the door of that internet caf√© gray didnt notice anything out of the ordinary in her appearance but he trusted seichans assessment kowalski remained oblivious he picked up a banana and sniffed at it are we buying something or not gray headed away continuing toward their hotel drawing the tail in his wake so amur is not as loyal as the cia claimed seichan whispered she leaned toward him like a lover physical contact between men and women was frowned upon in this country but there was a strange heightened intimacy in being this close without touching painter suspected as much gray mumbled the director had reviewed the various potential contacts here and selected amur specifically because of discrepancies in his behavior in the past it seemed the man was not above playing one side against the other especially with big money involved once a pirate always a pirate gray sauntered down the road with his teammates not bothering to try to shake the tail he wanted the others following his team amur was playing a dangerous game but one that suited their purpose because two could play that same game pm tucker wayne maintained a safe distance behind amur mahdi keeping a city block between them the radio embedded in his ear buzzed do you have him it was commander pierce tucker touched his throat mike and subvocalized his answer affirmative to blend in with the locals he had pulled a loose plaid macawiis tunic over a thin kevlar jacket and donned a regional turban to hide his hair and further shadow his features not that there werent white faces here it seemed the city drew opportunists from around the globe he heard german spanish and french spoken alongside the continuous dialects of african languages still he kept almost entirely out of sight of his target trusting anothers eyes more than his own several meters ahead kane kept to the shadows ghosting along sticking to the crumbling wall of a palatial estate gliding around and over obstacles few eyes glanced at the shepherds passage plenty of dogshalfstarved waifs showing ribs and bony legsroamed the streets a block away amur turned a corner and angled away from the busier zone of newer hotels and larger estates he moved with determination into a bulldozed section of the city occupied by cranes piles of rubble and metal trailers all in readiness for the expansion of the neighboring business district tucker radioed the change in direction hes heading out of new boosaaso aiming for a rougher part of town definitely not going home tucker had memorized everything he could about his target mapping out the mans life in his head where he lived where he met friends for drinks where his mistress was holed up amur wasnt heading toward any of his usual haunts keep following but maintain your distance gray warned we dont want him spooked i know how to do my job tucker thought sourly as he reached the corner this is what you hired me foror rather hired us kane had already stopped at the corner and glanced back tucker signaled an open palm stay tucker surveyed the terrain ahead tall security fencing screened by barrier fabric lined both sides of the road keeping pedestrians out of the construction zones at this hour no one else was in view he had no choice but to wait if i follow ill be immediately spotted my cover blown for now they had a small advantage gray had gone to painstaking ends to keep knowledge of tuckers involvement in this mission secret theyd even traveled from tanzania to somalia by different planes gray wanted all eyes diverted and focused on his team and away from tucker freeing him to move independently at the end of the street amur stopped at a locked gate in the security fencing a lounging guard with an ak greeted him they leaned their heads together then the guard nodded and unlatched the gate amur vanished inside drawing the guard with him what is he up to tucker headed down a few meters until he discovered a gap between the fence and the sandy ground a tall metal dumpster helped hide the spot he drew kane there then pointed to the gap circled a finger and touched his nose crawl through search for the targets scent tucker knew this was a task kane could handle humans had million olfactory receptors in their nose hunting dogs had million which heightened their sense of smell a thousandfold allowing them to scent a target from two football fields away at the end of the instructions tucker lowered his palm facedown signaling kane to stay hidden if the target was found finished tucker slipped a hand to the shepherds flank running his fingers over the black jacket that blended perfectly with his fur it was a k storm tactical vest waterproof and kevlarreinforced he checked kanes earpiece which allowed them to communicate in the fieldthen flipped up an erasersize lens of a nightvision video camera secured near the collar and positioned it between the dogs pricked ears the team needed eyes and ears in there tucker pulled out a cell phone tapped in a code and a grainy dogseye view of himself appeared on the small screen he leaned down and gave his partners nape a fast ruffle he also shook the vest to make sure nothing rattled to betray kanes position in the field satisfied he knelt and cradled the dogs head in his palms a muscular tremble betrayed kanes excitement his tongue lolled as he silently panted dark eyes met tuckers it was one of the unique features of domesticated dogsthey studied us as much as we studied them whos a good boy he whispered to his friend a ritual of theirs kanes nose shoved forward touching his acknowledging their bond tucker finally stood and flicked his wrist toward the gap in the fence go kane swung and lunged smoothly through the hole his tail vanishing away in seconds tucker checked his phone a juggling view of parked bulldozers and piles of rebarribbed broken slabs of concrete appeared on the small screen the image bobbled and swung like some badly directed horror movie tucker touched his throat mike videos up commander in case you want to watch the show as he waited for a response tucker slipped a bluetooth earbud into his free ear through it he heard the soft whisper of kanes panting breath in his other ear gray responded got it lets see what our friend amur is up to tucker kept to the shadows of the dumpster and watched his partners progress fear prickled over his skin be careful out there buddy kane races low to the ground senses stretching outward hunting for his prey around him night brightens into shades of gray frosted by muted hues piles of stone grow high on either side offering sheltered pathways forward the stir of a breeze shifts a crumpled paper cup the movement twitching for attention but ultimately ignored when sight fails him scent fills in layer upon layer marking time backward and forward building a framework of old trails around him bitter musk of spoor acrid sting of a urine marker burned oil from silent machines he moves through the maze taking in more smells drawing them upon his moist tongue deep into the back of his throat and sinuses his ears swivel at every hushed whisper of sand from breezes from the pad of his paws on always onward he holds his nose high at a turn tracking then familiar sweat spicy and pungent drifts to him basking outward in the wake of the prey his legs slow he lowers his body keeping to the shadowed trails he forces his panting to grow quiet ahead the prey approaches others they are out of sight but their musk betrays them they are hidden behind a pile of metal smelling of rust and burrowed through with the scent of scurrying things the odor of man wafts past it all impossible to ignore stinking and strong his prey walks forward trailed by another with a gun kane knows gunsby scent sight and sound he knows guns the hidden others show themselves at last stepping into the open the prey falls back the scent of his fear spiking sharperthen it quickly fades snuffing out again among the four lips are pulled back showing teeth but not in threat they speak making noise kane creeps closer finding a spot to watch unseen he lies still on his belly but his haunches remain tense ready to flee or charge for now he stays staring obedient because he asked kane continues to draw in the night ever vigilant painting the world around him in scents and sounds he smells his own trail going back buried among so many others but through it all one trail shines like the sun in the night around him connecting him to another both bound together forever by blood and trust he knows that name too by scent by sound by sight he knows that name pm tucker spied on the meeting between amur and his trio of compatriots fellow pirates judging by their tribal scars and harsh manners they gathered near a rusted stack of old iron hbeams and broken cement bricks in his ear he heard their harsh laughter and words spoken in a local somali dialect a translation program converted the conversation into a tinny computerized version how long can you draw them out one asked how much money can you get another added hassan habib trust me amur smiled lifting his arms there is more going on than they tell me for that i can make them dance on a string at my whim so you say the third said doubtfully as proof of his word amur removed a wad of bills and stripped out several for each but first he said i must give these americans something to chew on to keep them hanging on my words yes the others ignored him counting their bills and stuffing them away what have you heard about this american woman amur asked drawing back their attention only rumors amur these words earned nods among the three another voice spoke in tuckers other ear at this point ill take rumors that assessment came from commander pierce it seemed the team leader was listening into the feed with as much interest as he was then what is the word amur pressed a friend of my brothers uncle up near eil he says a white woman came through his village he says they were moving her into the mountains the cal madow mountains a shrug answered him that is much territory to cover amur said but he didnt seem disappointed he rubbed his chin thoughtfully if she is among those mountains she will never be found i can easily give that information to the americans without truly telling them anything and with allah shining upon us i should be able to tease out our relationship for several profitable days and after that then i will no longer have a use for the three americans it would be unfortunate if something happened to themunfortunate but not unusual in these treacherous lands yes grins followed shared all around so it seems amur is not the hospitable host he pretends to be gray said in his ear i think well have to the commanders words were cut off by a low growl the view on the small screen shifted as his partner retreated clearly sensing something whats your dog doing gray asked also noting the sudden movement hold on somethings spooked him the grainy image leaped and joggled as the shepherd bounded and circled around a steep pile of concrete debris it looked like the dog was trying to outflank amur and his group then the view settled again farther out in the construction zone a team of six men descended toward amurs group they were outfitted in black body armor and wore helmets equipped with nightvision goggles at their shoulders they carried assault rifles these newcomers were no rough pirates they clearly had military training their intent seemed anything but friendly amurs inquiries must have reached the wrong ears not good not now tucker watched as hand signals from the squads leader split the group they spread out to either side a pincer move intended to trap amurs group between them unfortunately the former pirate was not the only one caught in the trap tuckers heart thudded in his throat july pm east africa time boosaaso somalia stay put gray ordered seichan stood at his shoulder kowalski at the other they had stopped at the mouth of an alleyway a few blocks from their hotel observing the feed from the shepherds camera the armored commando team had swept wide circling amurs group clearly intending to let no one escape cant do that commander captain wayne responded not until kanes out of harms way gray knew there was nothing he could say to stop tucker he had no authority over him and if the man was spottedor worse caughthed jeopardize the entire mission then at least wait until i get there gray pressed well do this together a long pause followed long enough for him to worry that the man had already gone then an answer came ill wait tucker said for the moment but no promises that was as much concession as gray would get from him im on my way gray radioedthen faced the others and pointed down the street you two head to the hotel keep the tail chasing after you convince them weve retired for the night seichan stepped closer you shouldnt be going alone you barely know the city he tapped up a streetview map of boosaaso on his phone ill manage besides we have no choice amur surely has other friends in the city we need an alibi if he comes to a bad end in that construction yard we dont want his murder pinned on us whatre you going to do seichan asked from the corner of an eye he caught sight of the threeman team sent to tail them the trio had gathered near a cloth stand feigning interest in the stacked fabric rolls at the next corner ahead when were momentarily out of sight ill head down a side street you two rush to the front of the hotel let them see you going inside cause some commotion hopefully theyll believe ive already entered from the furrow between seichans eyebrows she had little confidence in his plan he reached for her hand and gave her fingers a quick squeeze it was a reflex move more intimate than he intended ill be fine he mumbled if nothing else the brief and surprising contact left her speechless lets go gray said before any further discussion could start they headed together down the street sauntering at a leisurely pace once gray passed around the next corner he hurried to the mouth of another alleyway ahead if the map was correct he should be able to circle back and join up with captain wayne as he turned away seichans last glance remained unreadable kowalski was more blunt watch your ass out there he planned on doing just that behind him seichan and kowalski rushed headlong aiming for the broad steps to hotel jubba at the end of the block at least they knew how to take orders he prayed tucker wayne would do the same but with each step gray hurried faster knowing that was not likely tucker was as much a creature of instinct as his furry partner the man would react before thinking especially if his dog was in danger kane huddles in the shadows under a protruding slab of broken concrete beyond his hiding place the night around him is a complex weave of scent trails echoing sounds and movement he stares unblinking at it all allowing the landscape to build before him as much a map of the present as the past the whispery crunch of a stone under boot the leathery tap of a rifle strap on cloth the heavy pant of excitement of a predator closing in on prey his original prey remains clustered with his pack deaf to the danger approaching kane tracks the newcomers as they cut through old scent trails even his own creating a new one stinking of man it fully circles the others now then draws tighter as they move in on their prey kane stays in his hiding place unmoving placing his trust in shadows and one other pm tucker crouched outside the fence hidden behind a dumpster his attention fixed to the feed from kanes camera still following his original instructions the dog remained focused on amurs group who continued to discuss where to spend the money in hand where to eat a late dinner and how to get more payments out of commander pierce all the while a deadly noose tightened around them all even kane tucker dared not risk calling his partner back to him the movement would draw the commandos attention as if the dog had heard his silent worry the view on the screen shifted as kane glanced backward over his shoulder the angle turned enough to reveal a commando in black body armor closing toward kanes position the shepherd remained at his post as tucker had ordered kane thinks hes hidden well enough tucker realized but the dog was wrong nightvision goggles hid the approaching commandos eyes kanes shadowy shelter offered no protection from such technology in a moment the shepherd would easily be spotted along with the foreign vestthen all hell would break loose tucker glanced up and down the street commander pierce was nowhere in sight and he had to do something now twisting around he dove for the fence to the gap along the bottom where kane had crawled through it was too small for him but coils of razor wire blocked the way over the top with no other choice he placed his phone on the ground and dug with both hands into the hardpacked sand all the while he stared at the phone beside him watching the commando draw closer to kane he dug faster scooping out sand deepening the hole bloodying his fingers finally unable to wait any longer he squirmed his way through the gap the loose tunic ripped on the fangs of the fences lower end exposing his kevlar vest beneath he reached back and grabbed his phone the view of the video feed stopped his heart on the screen the grainy image of the commando jerked to a stop plainly startled and the reason was obvious the soldier shifted his rifle and pointed it directly toward the camera directly at kane pm damn that fool seichan moved briskly angrily into the tiled lobby of the hotel jubba kowalski followed at her heels she hated abandoning gray and hated that it bothered her so much but in the end she also recognized the necessity the pair had succeeded in drawing their tail to the steps of the building hopefully leaving them unaware of grays disappearance still she could not relax the tense knot between her shoulder blades gray shouldnt have gone out there alone if theyd taken an extra few moments to plan some other ruse could have been calculated to fool the ones tailing them instead his action had been unusually rash even reckless and not just here theyd come close to losing tucker wayne and his dog back in zanzibar not a mistake gray would normally make and she could guess the cause a deep current of fury and frustration still flowed through his core she recognized it in the stormgray of his eyes in the hard set to his jaw in the clipped edge to his conversations there was a manic edge to gray that shed never seen before and it made her nervous not for herself but for him maybe it was too soon for him to be out in the field but they were committed and there was no retreating from here kowalski slipped out a cigar and set about lighting it a thick pall of smoke already filled the lobby making her eyes sting a soccer match played on a largescreen television in the hotel restaurant drawing in a boisterous crowd that spilled into the lobby and obstructed the way toward the stairs her partner nodded back toward the hotels entrance looks like our friends are setting up camp out there making sure we dont leave seichan glanced over at the trio who had followed them they sat at a coffeehouse that offered a view of the hotels front steps clearly amur intended to protect his investment ensuring no other informant intruded on his territory a loud cheer drew her attention back to the restaurant the match between brazil and germany was heating up a group of german patrons began singing their national anthem lets get out of here she said intending to return to their rooms kowalski lingered puffing on his cigar adding to the pollution in the lobby his eyes had drifted to the soccer match on the television his legs drew him toward the machismo camaraderie of the live sportscast at least that should keep him out of trouble for the night she was wrong within a few steps he bumped into a harried waiter holding aloft a huge tray full of teacups and pots of steaming water the tray went flying crashing into the mass of men crowded at the entrance to the restaurant shouts and curses erupted as scalding water splashed over those closest then a push became a shove and a fist struck a nose in a matter of seconds bedlam broke out the restaurant emptied into the lobby escalating into a full brawl kowalski backed seichan in a corner as a bottle flew past his nose and shattered against the wall what did you do seichan scolded kowalski grinned back at her keeping the stogie crushed between his teeth as he spoke theres a rear exit through the kitchen let me get this party going full swing and you can duck back into the streets unseen he locked eyes with her she read the sharp glimmer buried within that dim exterior so she wasnt the only one worried about their partner are you ready he asked she nodded which made his grin spread wider a terrifying sight with a roar he turned and leaped into the raucous fray a veritable bull let loose among the others in moments the fighting rolled like a tide toward the hotels front doors and spilled out into the streets spreading the commotion and chaos seichan twisted in the opposite direction slipping out a scarf and wrapping her head and most of her face kowalski bellowed behind hersounding disturbingly happy finally in his true element now to find gray she had tucker waynes call sign and last position noted on her own phones navigation system thats where gray would be headed she burst out the rear door leaving behind the clatter of pots and pans from the kitchen and into the dark silence of the back alley before she could take a step a bright light speared her blinding her a harsh voice with a thick british accent accosted her punctuated by the cocking of a pistol take another step and ill put a bullet through your pretty skull july pm east africa time boosaaso somalia standing by the fence tucker watched the rifle lower toward kane the grainy image on the phone set his heart to pounding hed never reach his partner in time reacting instinctively he yanked out his pistol a black sig sauer pointed it into the air and fired two rounds the gun blasts stung his ears and echoed across the empty construction site on the screen the soldiers aim shifted away as he dropped low startled by the gunfire tucker was already moving heading toward kanes hiding place on his phone he pressed a green icon in the shape of a small ear and lifted the phone to his lips he spoke two commands transmitting them to the receiver behind kanes left ear takedown disarm the image on the screen blurred into chaos tucker continued to sprint staying low im coming buddy kane tastes blood feels the crack of bone under the power of his jaws he holds tight as a pained cry pierces the night then a booted blow to his ribs finally knocks him loose the night spins but rights itself as he rolls his legs under him his prey crouches holding his limb to his chest wrist crushed gun on the ground both hunters face each otherbut only for a breath kane dives low snatching cloth at the ankle and throwing his body to the side yanking the preys limb from under him the other falls head striking broken stone goggles knock away revealing narrowed eyes kane smells his fear still tastes the blood on the back of his tongue but the other is a hunter too a flash of a blade in the other hand it stabs downbut kane is already gone spinning away running low into the night but not without a hardwon prize clutched in his jaws pm gray sprinted along the barrier fencing as fresh gunfire erupted from the construction zone the chugging coughs of automatic weapons along with the sharper blasts of smaller arms a moment ago as he reached the street hed heard the initial pistol cracks two shots they had risen from a different part of the site well away from the current firefight had to be captain wayne this was confirmed when gray heard tuckers radioed command to his partner there was no sign of the man on the street so gray rushed toward a gate at the next corner he found it unguarded and pushed inside his gun already in hand a bulldozed road led straight toward the fighting he spotted bodies on the ground amurs men gray ducked to the side into the shadows of a pile of broken concrete a commando stepped into view and kicked one of the bodies an arm lifted off the ground a pleading gesture the soldiers pistol pointed down a single crack and the arm fell limply they were killing everyone as quickly as the firefight had started it ended the last few sputters of automatic gunfire died away gray subvocalized into his throat mike tucker respond the answer didnt come from his radio a fresh flurry of gunfire erupted to the left away from the pile of dead bodies the commando in view dashed in that direction biting back a curse gray rolled around the pile of concrete and headed that way too gunplay spattered out as tucker played cat and mouse with the hunters gray struggled through the maze straining to track the gunfire while keeping a watch around him at last he spotted tucker the man pistol in hand ran along a row of parked dump trucks at the edge of the rubble field trying to stay out of sight gray headed toward himbut before he could take more than three steps a shadowy figure appeared a few yards ahead his back to gray blocking the view it was the same commando who had been slaughtering the last of amurs men the soldier spotted tucker and fired a flurry of rounds at his target ricochets pinged off the dump truck exposed tucker tried to twist away but a round struck him square in the chest knocking him against the bed of the dump truck with a loud clang he fell hard to the ground his pistol flying from his grip gray raised his own weapon strode two fast paces and shot the commando through the back of the neck the soldier collapsed to his knees then to his face gurgling harshly as he died gray stepped past him kicking the assault rifle away from his fingertips ahead tucker struggled to stand up a palm on his chest damned lucky the man had been wearing a kevlar vest but luck only lasted for so long a fresh crack of a pistol came from the right from out of grays field of view tucker ducked as a round buzzed his ear and struck the dump trucks huge tire more shots rang out blasting sand from between tuckers legs and by his left hand tucker scrabbled away disappearing from view gray hurried forward but the shooter was still out of sight where then the commando burst into the open running low heading toward where tucker had vanished pistol raised forward his other arm was clutched to his chest his wrist held at an impossible angle dripping blood judging by the wild blasts fury fueled this attack gray struggled to fix the attacker in his sights but the target was moving too fast and heavily armored gray fired anyway emptying his weapon but the soldier was so focused he didnt even flinch from the rounds pinging off the trucks side even at a shot that glanced off his helmet then his target was out of sight again pursuing tucker gray ran forward ejecting his spent magazine and slapping in another in a few more steps he spotted the gunman leaning over tucker his teammate one shoulder bloodied was sprawled on his back by the trucks cab the armored commando held his pistol at tuckers face ready to shoot pointblank gray could not stop himthen a miracle happened pm the smoking barrel of the pistol lowered and pointed between tuckers eyes his shoulder burned but not as much as his blood he stared past the gun to the eyes of the assassin he recognized the fury there it matched his own as the gunman ran up tucker had spotted his broken wrist the ripped bloodied flesh he recognized kanes handiwork this was the commando who had threatened his partner in the others eyes he read the satisfaction of the kill to come it matched his own and anothers a fierce growl erupted from the shadows drawing the gunmans attention his pistol jerked in that direction using the distraction tucker yanked out the rifle hidden under the truckthe commandos own weapon he twisted the barrel forward and fired at the gunmans face blowing him backward as his body fell away gray appeared behind him racing forwardthen skidding back in surprise how where did you get tucker still on his back turned to the shadows under the dump truck kane crouched there panting his eyes glowing brightly out of the darkness as commanded his partner had not only taken down his opponent but also disarmed him tucker pictured his partner dragging the rifle by its leather strap in his teeth ever obedient obeying down to the word good boy tucker said staring back into those clever eyes good boy pm gray headed down the street toward hotel jubba after he found tucker the pair had quickly retreated out of the construction area they found no further resistance with the mission completed the remaining commandoslikely hired mercenarieshad pulled out and vanished into the night whoever had employed those assassins plainly wanted amur silenced his inquiries must have alerted the pirates involved in amandas kidnapping and triggered this swift reaction now gray and tucker were back among the street throngs in the new section of the city stopping only long enough to bandage tuckers shoulder luckily the bullet had only grazed his upper arm tucker finished explaining what happened from the video feed i saw that kane had retreated somewhere among these dump trucks and went looking for him and you got ambushed tucker scowled and glanced down at the dog at his side hed stripped off the dogs vest and held it bundled under his good arm i wasnt leaving him in harms way commander and i never will kane looks after me with equal diligence i wouldnt be alive now if it wasnt for him and you wouldnt have been in danger if youd obeyed orders but gray let that lie for now tucker continued once at the trucks kane must have tracked me down keeping hidden closing in on my scent and he brought you that rifle gray could not keep the tinge of respect out of his voice id ordered him to disarm his opponent hed been trained well gray suspected such coordination went beyond training that it had more to do with an inexplicable bond between dog and handler tying them together by something deeper than just hand signals and spoken commands whatever the reason theyd all made it out with only a few scrapes and scratches amurs group might have been killedsilenced by the hired assassination teambut because of kanes help they now knew the presidents daughter was being held somewhere in the cal madow mountains to the west before gray could formulate a plan of action from here he noted the tumult outside of hotel jubba tables were overturned stalls broken windows shattered men sat in the street nursing injuries it looked like the aftermath of a small riot what happened tucker asked i dont know gray hurried to the steps of the hotel he found the lobby equally ransacked a televised soccer game played in the neighboring restaurant a few men stood idly sipping tea amid the carnage of tables and chairs as if nothing had happened gray touched his throat mike and radioed both kowalski and seichan no response tucker shared a worried look with him together they mounted the stairs their rooma twobedroom suitewas on the second floor gray led the way down a tiled hallway softened by a threadbare persian runner he kept his tread quiet as he approached the door from inside the cheers of an audience echoed out coming from a television likely broadcasting the same soccer match gray pulled out his pistol and grabbed the door handle tucker held a palm toward kane readying his partner gray burst into the roomonly to find kowalski sprawled in his boxers on the sofa in the suites common room a washcloth full of ice held to his right eye kowalski barely acknowledged them still focused on the game gray searched around the room nothing seemed amiss why didnt you respond to my radio call gray asked kowalski stared sheepishly toward the table his radio and earpiece rested there he ran a hand through his wet hair i took a shower and forgot to gray cut him off never mind what happened downstairs kowalski heaved his legs to the floor with a pained groan you said to cause a commotion when we got here i meant a diversion not world war three kowalski shrugged so things got a little out of hand i gotta say these muslim guysno sex no alcoholthey sure needed to blow off some steam gray relaxed holstering his weapon wheres seichan kowalski lowered the ice from his face revealing a swollen bloodred eye i thought she was with you guys us why grays chest tightened painfully kowalskis next words only made it worse she left to go find you july pm east africa time boosaaso somalia seichan sat in a windowless cementblock basement a single bare bulb hung above her head the space stank of bleach and had a drain in the middle of the floor never a good sign her left hand throbbed from where shed sliced the meat of her thumb on a piece of broken glass when she was forced to drop on her stomach in the back alley theyd immediately stripped her of all communications equipment and dragged a hood over her head forced at gunpoint she traveled a few blocks by foot stumbling alongthen by open truck judging by the wind the sound of the engine and the jolting of the suspension she had to cling to the door frame to keep her seat her cut hand stinging with every bump the gun shoved in her rib cage discouraged any attempt at escape theyd gone no more than ten minutes before stopping so she couldnt be far from the hotel but in the jumbled maze of the city they might as well have taken her to another planet once here the hood had been removed and shed been ordered to strip down to bra and panties and been thoroughly searched again afterward her wounded hand had been tended to though blood still seeped down her fingertips and dripped to the floor theyd allowed her to slip her clothes back on but she still felt halfnaked she tugged at the plastic slip ties that bound her to a metal chair she tried rocking but her seat was bolted to the concrete floor resigned she silently cursed her carelessnessplacing an equal amount of the blame on gray if the bastard hadnt gone off so recklessly on his own but she knew she bore as much guilt she had acted no less rashly than gray and that troubled her especially since she knew the cause she remembered that kiss in the hospital both needing each other but for very different reasons her carelessness this night was born out of that kiss fear for his safety worry that shed lose him blinded her and made her sloppy she should have known better than to run headlong into a back alley hadnt their premission briefing warned of the rash of kidnappings in the city the only balm to her ego was that her captors hadnt been pirates the single door to the room finally opened two figures stepped inside one carried a thick file folder the other a chair identical to her own the seat was placed in front of her and the man who had ambushed her in the alley sat down resting a file on his knee he had short sandyblond hair balding at the top ruggedly handsome in his own way his companiona slender indian woman with mocha skin and smoky eyestook a post behind the chair stiffbacked one hand resting on a holstered sidearm like the man she was dressed in khaki pants and a buttoned blue blouse all crisply creased giving the casual clothes the look of a uniform seichan locked eyes with her you were one of the three following us this evening wearing the green sarong the woman gave no reaction seichan glanced between the two she spotted an older photo of her grainy but unmistakable clipped to the folder let me guess you all have nothing to do with amur mahdi at all the man answered his british accent polite but firm i think ill be the one asking questions he flipped open the folder and glanced through the first few pages considering your number of aliases i dont even know what to call you how about your worst enemy she said sourly this earned the smallest uptick of the womans lipnot out of amusement but disdain the man ignored her comment your employer committed an act of terrorism on our soil a few years back at the british museum orchestrated by a terrorist named he sifted through some papers cassandra sanchez a nasty piece of work that one a chill iced over seichan cassandra had been a guild operative like herself planted beside painter crowe before he was director of sigma seichan knew little else about that operation except the woman was dead since her capture seichan had been struggling to determine who had ambushed her running various possibilities through her head she was on the watch list of multiple foreign intelligence services for her past activities with the guild from the mans accent she narrowed down the possibilities they could be sisthe british secret intelligence service sometimes referred to as mibut she caught the whiff of military about them youre srr seichan concluded the man straightened staring back at her impressive the special reconnaissance regiment was a newer division of the british special forces established recently to engage in covert surveillance operations specifically to conduct counterterrorism actions they were also the most selective and most secretiveand the only british special forces unit to recruit women she stared at the indian woman few knew anything substantial about srr activities but it made sense theyd employ field operatives in somalia pirates had kidnapped several british nationals over the past decade and the lawless rural areas of this country were the training grounds for a handful of islamic terrorist factions unfortunately she must have been swept up by their surveillance net by accident the man confirmed this we have facial recognition software hacked into the security cameras at the airport here you were lucky it was us who found you as i understand the mossad have a shootonsight order regarding you seichan continued to put the pieces together in her head your tail on us it had been purposefully sloppy you wanted us to know we were being followed and we expected youd try to shake it escaping out a back doorand right into our hands the man leaned forward but who are you traveling with the two men weve identified them both as former us armed forcesbut nothing after that their records are clean spotless suspiciously so are they guild operatives or merely mercenaries for hire or were you using them in some manner seichan hesitated unsure how to respond no one knew shed turned traitor against the guild and now worked for sigma only a handful of people in the us government even knew about her involvement her past crimes precluded her from being officially sanctioned so if she were ever caughtlike nowshe would be denied she was on her own certain to vanish forever down some blackops hole if you continue to refuse to cooperate the man beganwhen the door exploded behind him ripped off its hinges a silver object bounced into the room seichan closed her eyes wishing she could cover her ears the flashbang exploded in the confined space searing through her eyelids and deafening to the point of nausea she gasped out as it faded and opened her eyes blearily she saw a small shape dash into the room running low to the ground she felt the brush of fur against her bare calf and the cold nose exploring her bloody fingers about time you got here she croaked out deaf to her own words gray and tucker swept into the room pistols in hand the two srr operatives were down on the floor in postures of agony having taken the full brunt of the flashbangs impact still the female had enough wherewithal to aim her weapon at seichan though sightless at the moment she kept enough of her senses to free her weapon and blindly shoot in the direction of seichans chair the muzzle flashed and the shot sparked off the concrete floor stinging her toes with stone chips the shepherd leaped away from her chair startled gray swung his weapon toward the shooter seichan yelled stop dont shoot tucker closer pistolwhipped the woman and dropped her to the floor then collected her weapon theyre british special forces seichan shouted finally beginning to hear her own words as the effect wore off gray pointed to the pair keep them down he ordered tucker until we can sort this all out he turned next to seichan a small military dagger appearing in his hand he rushed to her side and sliced her bonds free careful of her bloody hand as he crouched he rested his palm on her bare knee his fingers electric on her inner thigh are you okay with her ears ringing she still understood enough to nod im fine i cut myself on purpose made sure i kept the wound open as i clung to the trucks door frame on the way here figured it was time for that damned dog to earn his kibble tucker heard leaving a blood trail for kane to follow smart it wasnt smart it was planning on the flight to africa she had studied up on their potential new teammate ascertaining the dogs strengths and weaknesses as she would any partner in the field a report she read stated that a trained dog could distinguish a single drop of blood in an olympicsize swimming pool she hadnt planned on testing that sensitivity but she was more than happy to prove it true now she gained her feet still unsteady from the auditory assault but at least she could hear what about the other srr personnel we took down one outside the hotel gray said with a worried look hes still tied up in the back alley out cold kowalski has the other secured upstairs took him down like a battering ram when we burst inside mightve broken his leg definitely broken a gruff voice answered at the door kowalski stepped to the threshold and pointed his thumb toward the stairs leading out of the basement got him gagged and tied up there so how much trouble are we in for kicking some british soldiers asses the answer came from the floor the man had also regained enough of his senses to glare tearyeyed at them i think your american colloquialism is a shitload he stared at the assemblage in the room who the bloody hell are you all gray holstered his weapon and offered out an arm to get him back on his feet someone who needs your help the man took grays hand suspiciously but he allowed himself to be pulled back to his feet this is a fine way to ask for it kowalski offered the only possible explanation were americans its how we do things pm an hour later gray had everyone gathered back at their suite at the hotel jubba they sat in the common room a call to director crowe followed by a flurry of communiqu√©s between the two countries intelligence agencies facilitated some candid conversation the kidnapped woman out of the seychelles captain trevor alden said holding a steaming teacup in the palm of his hand shes the presidents daughter thats right gray said amanda gantbennett the two groups sat on opposite couches americans on one side brits on the other a tea service tray rested on the table between them kane kept near his handler as tucker balanced on the arm of the sofa but his nose kept drifting toward a stack of tea biscuits captain aldens eyes shifted to seichan seated next to gray and she works for you chaps now gray simply nodded not bothering to go into the complicated details of their professional relationship alden leaned back someone couldve informed us all of this before you got here wouldve saved major patel a great deal of hardship kowalski paced behind the sofa near the balcony doors where the smoke from his cigar was less offensive sorry maybe i shouldnt have sacked him so hard but he got in my way he shrugged showing little remorse but arent you guys supposed to wear special berets or something not on a mission were a covert team alden explained just the four of usor three now i guess patel had been shot up with morphine and was sleeping in the next room awaiting evacuation due to his broken leg on the sofa the captain was flanked by his two other associates the indian womanmajor bela jainand a black wiry soldier major stuart butler gray redirected the conversation to the problem at hand captain alden any local intelligence you can supply us to help figure out where the presidents daughter might have been taken would be most appreciated no appreciation necessary weve been ordered to offer our services alden winced then gently placed his teacup on the tray my apologies that came out less sincerely than i intended i have a young daughter of my own if shed been kidnapped alden leaned forward and offered his hand gray took it and found the mans grip firm and dry you have our full cooperation alden promised gray found himself warming to the man once past the stiff british reserve he seemed likable enough and he had captured seichan not an easy thing to do however from the way seichan sat with her arms folded over her chest fingering the tiny silver dragon pendant at her throat with her bandaged hand she didnt share grays opinion of the srr captain likewise major jain barely said a word her features hard and unreadable her posture rigid gray imagined the womans head still ached from the effects of the flashbang not to mention being pistolwhipped by tucker not the most opportune way for allies to meet still theyd all have to find a way to work together do you have any clues at all to the whereabouts of the young woman alden asked getting down to business where she made landfall who took her not much gray had briefly related their encounter with amur mahdi and the attack by an assassination squad in the construction yard the captain was unaware of any of it so gray got him up to speed next he reached to the table and unfolded a topographic map of the country alden leaned closer as gray ran a finger along the mountain range to the west of the city it cut clear across northern somalia all we know gray said is that she was likely taken somewhere up in these mountains thats a lot of rough territory jungles chasms caves you could spend years searching up there and only scour a tenth of those peaks do you have any other intel were still waiting for an nro satellite to search the coastline for the raiders ship needle in a haystack alden pronounced grimly with a shake of his head and they move those ships regularly even if you found it that doesnt mean thats where the boat made landfall gray couldnt disagree he closed his eyes and replayed the conversation between amur and his men the mans group had been silenced for a reason there had to be a clue there something useful then he remembered and straightened one line of that conversation played out in his head a friend of my brothers uncle up near eil he says a white woman came through his village he says they were moving her into the mountains gray opened his eyes and stared at the map do you know some town named eil alden nodded studying the coastline its a small place a tough town pirate run he finally tapped the map right here by this deepwater cove one of amurs men said theyd heard of a white woman a hostage who had been through that village if we went to that town alden cut him off youd be shot on sight and even if you did somehow survive theyd tell you nothing anyone squeals there and its an instant death sentence gray pictured the last of amurs men being shot still alden did not seem despondent if they went directly from eil to the mountains that could narrow your search he ran a finger inland id suggest you call your director and ask him to have the nro give up the satellite search for the ship and concentrate on this section of the mountains he marked off a box with his fingertip thats still hundreds of square miles gray said true what about an infrared sweep tucker offered if the satellite can pick out heat signatures narrow the search parameters maybe but as hot as it gets here in summer those rocky peaks retain plenty of heat throughout the night alden leaned closer to the map but i may have a better idea what alden smiled and glanced at the closed bedroom door i think i just found a good use for our poor major patel july pm est washington dc painter sat in his office struggling with a puzzle that set his teeth to aching since this mornings briefing with the president hed been ensconced in his windowless office at sigma headquarters buried several floors beneath the smithsonian castle yet steps away from the halls of power and many of the countrys best scientific institutions and think tanks earlier hed reviewed the video feed from somalia listened to the audio recordings without a doubt amur mahdi had been executed in order to silence him the cia was already squawking about the murder of one of its local assets even though amur was clearly playing one side against the other and in this case the turncoat had gotten crushed between them still the assassination of amur offered further support to the idea that there was more to the kidnapping of amanda gantbennett than simple piracy painter was sure of it but what so far no ransom demand had been made there continued to be no chatter among the various regional terrorist groups no one claiming responsibility if they had the presidents daughter theyd be crowing from the rooftops about it so what game were they playing out there painter could not shake the feeling that amandas kidnapping was somehow tied to the guild perhaps she was being used as a pawn by a competing criminal organization to put pressure on the gantsthat is if the gants were indeed the true puppet masters behind the shadowy guild he had a hard time balancing that with the raw fear hed seen in the presidents eyes the anguish and grief in the first ladys embrace of her husband in the hallway even gants older brother the secretary of state had seemed openly sincere about finding amanda but that didnt mean other family members were not involved he returned his attention to the large lcd monitor on his desk using a mouse he scrolled through the long list of names glowing on the screen each of them connected by branching and crisscrossing lines marking family ties marriages and births even infidelities and children born out of wedlock it mapped out the genealogy of the gant family clan stretching back two centuries it was less a family tree than an interlacing matrix so complicated it required being diagrammed out in three dimensions clicking and dragging he spun the matrix in a slow turn a spiral galaxy of power and influence going back to before the founding of this country and it was still incomplete he had historians and genealogists from around the globe working piecemeal on the puzzle to keep the project secret building a picture of the true breadth and extent of this ancient clan he doubted anyone had ever performed such a comprehensive analysis of the gant clan he also noted lines that crossed into and out of the matrix distant cousins marrying back into the familynot an unheardof situation in such a powerful aristocratic family it seemed generation after generation no one wanted to drift too far from that wellspring of power and wealth and what a wellspring it was painter had lost count of the number of inventors scholars statesmen and leaders of industry that shone like stars amid the lineage not to mention rogues and several persons of ill repute but every family had its bad apples he frowned at the screen seeing his faint reflection superimposed over the matrix was the truth of the guild hidden here or was it all a wildgoose chase to remind himself of the true nature of his adversaries painter clicked on an image file and brought up a symbol onto the screenor rather a nested set of symbols it represented the guild at the center stood a tiny crescent moon and star it was one of the oldest symbols in the world going back to an esoteric order out of ancient egypt enclosed around that the more familiar square and compass representing another secret fraternity the freemasons and at last circling them all the shield of the knights templar a medieval order infamous for its hidden mysteries the secret in all secret societies he whispered repeating the dying words of a guild associate that was the significance of the nested symbols it was said to represent the guilds path tracing its treacherous footsteps deep into the past the same dying man also suspected there were more levels and tiersother secret societiesbeyond those revealed in the old symbol secrets continuing into modern times leading at last to what he called the true bloodline the ultimate masters of the shadowy guild one family painter mumbled staring at the vast lineage of the gant clan to survive the scrutiny of time the guild had hid itself within one secret society after another was he staring at the same subterfuge here was the true heart of this shadowy organization buried within the breadth and majesty of this family dynasty if so how many were involved he studied the threedimensional map sensing he was missing something that it stared him square in the face but whatever nagged him refused to come to light a knock at his door interrupted him a tall auburnhaired woman in dress blues stood at the threshold painter tapped his keyboard and wiped the gant genealogy off the screen it was meant for his eyes only kat he said and waved the woman inside captain kathryn bryant was his secondincommand specializing in intelligencegathering services for sigma painter pulled his attention fully to the present to the matters in somalia have the brits settled down after the mess in boosaaso barely but the srr has agreed to keep things under wraps and to offer their assistance out there very good but thats not the only reason i stopped by kat said i brought someone to see you she stepped aside and a familiar face draped by blond hair peered coyly around the corner lisa he said delight filling his voice he stood up and crossed around his desk i thought you werent getting back until tonight dr lisa cummings slipped inside dressed in jeans and a loose paleblue blouse she tapped her wrist what time do you think it is as usual hed let the day escape himbut he wasnt going to do the same with his girlfriend he pulled her into a warm hug kissing her cheek appreciating how right this felt she sagged into him expressing a similar thought its good to be home they lingered in each others arms for another breath until finally falling away leaving only their hands clasped together lisa had been gone a week at a medical symposium he had not realized how much he missed her until this moment he guided her to one of the chairs and settled her there before letting go of her hand i heard about the presidents daughter lisa said dourly i remember her from one of those blacktie affairs at the white house several months ago she had just found out she was pregnant speaking of which kat took the other seat director you asked me to gather information about amandas pregnancy painter leaned back against his desk he had a full dossier on the presidents daughter but almost nothing regarding the baby she carried he wanted every base covered something was odd about this entire affairfrom the false papers to the trip to the seychelles and now this kidnapping he dared leave no stone unturned first of all her unborn child is not her husbands kat began painters brows rose in surprise this was news to him kat explained apparently mack bennett had fertility issues that required the use of a sperm donor and in vitro fertilization interesting painter folded this new knowledge into the case testing various permutations different possibilities could there be some motive here a custody issue where was this done he finally asked a fertility clinic in south carolina outside of charleston i looked it up very cuttingedge using the latest technology with a client list from around the world and the donor for the child kat shook her head confidential painter hated loose endsthey had the tendency to unravel into a mess kat read his expression i can make some calls but without a court order painter shook his head a legal action would raise too many red flags get others inquiring about amandas whereabouts we cant risk that exposure not to mention it would be a significant invasion of her privacy lisa reminded him and in the end the child might have nothing to do with this kat added painter crossed his arms unconvinced amanda fled to the seychelles just a couple of weeks before she was due to deliver traveling under false papers like she was running from someoneor protecting someone youre thinking its about the baby kat said but why i dont know but some answers might be found at that clinic i could send a team to investigate or i can go lisa offered im an md simple professional courtesy could open doors easier than a commando raid painters lips hardened lisa had helped sigma multiple times in the past her medical expertise especially in regards to amandas pregnancy could prove usefuland likely why kat had involved her today and painter had to admit that lisas suggestion made sense risked less exposure but he hated to put her in danger i can accompany her kat offered possibly posing as a potential new client but youve got a newborn and a toddler at home and ive also got a husband with too much time on his hands she argued monk can keep an eye on harriet and penelope for a couple of days monk kokkalis her spouse was a former sigma operative who had opted to retire so he could spend more time with his wife and family hed also had one too many close calls during prior missions and called it quits i dont think your husband would want you out in the field painter warned its not like im traveling halfway around the world its barely a day trip kats face betrayed her her eyes danced at the thought of getting her hands dirty again after two backtoback pregnancies she clearly needed some fresh air to stretch her legs with a little fieldwork as proficient as she was in her role at sigma headquarters she was still a soldier at heart she had not graduated from the us naval academy and gained the rank of captain in order to be stuck in an office all day he sometimes forgot that about her he nodded i can get you a flight out first thing in the morning she smiled glancing over at lisa who wore a similar grin painter realized the truth at that moment the two women had played him from the outset intending this result all along rather than calling them on it he simply resigned himself to the inevitable we should return to my office kat said to lisa get everything in order before our morning flight lisa stood gave him a quick peck on the cheek and headed after katbut not before hanging back in the doorway with a smile that held infinite promise ill see you tonight painter watched them head down the hall it was not an unpleasant sight as they disappeared around a corner the worries settled back over his shoulders he reached to a file on his desk and slipped out the top photo inside it was the last picture taken of amanda smiling next to her husband one hand supporting her belly protective proud painter stared harder at the picture noticing for the first time the edge of fear in her eyes the way she leaned close to her husband almost sheltering herself even the arm clutched around her partners waist clung a bit too tightly what were you so scared of amanda pm east africa time cal madow mountains somalia the needle sank into amandas belly delivering a burning sting of anesthetic her fingers dug into the thin sheets of the hospital bed she watched it all refusing to look away her hospital gown had been pulled up over her stomach exposing her swollen belly and protruding navel a privacy sheet covered her from the waist downnot that theyd spared her from any indignities up to now that should numb her well enough dr blake the tall blond woman said disposing of the used syringe in a red sharps container she had a slight german accent maybe swiss thank you petra the british doctor patted amandas arm like his nurse he wore scrubsbut rather than the typical blue his were oldfashioned solid white well be done in a few minutes and you can get some rest for the night i know its been a long day the pair left to finish final preparations for the procedure amanda had no choice but to wait in the bed she kneaded her belly reassuring herself and the child inside she noted the leather restraints hanging from the rails it frightened her that they hadnt bothered to tie her down it demonstrated their unflagging confidence in the security surrounding the cabin she stared at the ultrasounds monitor dark at the moment but waiting to be used in the procedure to come theyd already performed a scan of her abdomen when she arrived here recording her babys position measuring the dimensions of his skull and approximate body length she hadnt resisted that first ultrasound at the time she had wanted to know the status of her child as fiercely as the doctor had in the end it had brought her great relief to see the flutter of his heartbeat his tiny curled fists his small sleepy movements after a close examination of the sonogram the doctor pronounced her boy wonderfully healthy but it seemed the medical team was not done with her dr blake returned petra carried a tray holding a large syringe equipped with a fiveinchlong needle amanda had already had an amniocentesis when she was eighteen weeks along so she knew what to expect petra swabbed her stomach with fresh antiseptic then powered up the ultrasound and handed the lubed probe to dr blake with an eye on the monitor the doctor guided the needle deep into her belly the pain was minimal like a mild menstrual cramp she looked away from the monitor as the tip of the needle approached her sleeping child it was too disconcerting to watch one slip and she could only imagine the damage that might be done in the end all went well fluid was drawn skillfully from the amniotic sac around her boy and the needle withdrawn she finally let out the breath she had been holding tears suddenly blurred her vision monitor her for fever the doctor ordered petra watch for any vaginal bleeding petra nodded dr blake turned to amanda theres no need for tears at least not now we wont have the genetic test results until the morning her first amniocentesis had been routine done to rule out various chromosomal abnormalities like down syndrome or genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis but she knew that wasnt all the doctors had been searching fornot then not now the note that sent her running from the states had warned of something genetically different about her baby something others wanted to possess she didnt understand much else only enough to run before they came for her child blake continued if the genetics are stable your child will livethe very first of his kind if not well well worry about such matters then wont we again that paternal pat on her arm even if the results were stable she knew awful consequences would be in store for her baby boy and if they werent the medical team here would likely perform a lateterm abortion she turned her head to the side not knowing which result to hope for in the morning tears welled again as her hands found her bellybut she was certain of one thing with the last breath in her body she would die defending her baby i wont let them harm you a bonfire in the outer camp glowed through the canvas wall highlighting the crimson cross shed noted earlier again she saw the odd almost fanciful decorations along its spans a twisting and coiling pattern that traversed both crosspieces only nowafter the amniocentesis after the worries about chromosomal abnormalitiesdid she recognize the structures they were helices of dna genetic code she stared disbelieving coldness crept through her body though shed never seen this cross before she had heard whispers about this symbol marking an ancient mystery that traced back to the founding of her family to a secret buried at its heart she had thought its existence a myth a story meant to scare children but now she could no longer deny the horrible truth it was what that cryptic note had warned her about what had sent her running to the seychelles in terror the bloodline theyve found me july am east africa time airborne over somalia gray adjusted the bulky earphones muffled against the roar of the helicopters twin engines he stared out the cabin window as captain alden pointed there it is the british srr officer yelled the aircraft swept low over a sunblasted rolling landscape of parched fields broken red rock and occasional patches of scraggly trees herds of goats scattered from under the pummeling wash of the blades in the distance a mountain range thrust into the morning sky breaking the horizon into jagged lines but the medical transport chopper would not be flying that far alden pointed to a large camp of tents and huts sprawled at the intersection of two gravel roads the top of many of the tents bore red crosses parked vehiclescivilian cars and united nations trucksdotted the surrounding fields along with many camels it was a relief camp run by unicef and operated by the french organization m√©decins sans fronti√®res known in the states as doctors without borders it lay sheltered in the foothills halfway between the mountains and the ocean acting as a way station for those living both inland and at the coast a groan drew grays attention back to the rear cabin of the helicopter major patel remained strapped in a stretcher on the floor his morphine wearing off from the hourlong flight from boosaasos airport to this medical enclave the french doctors here would have no trouble casting his broken tibia and stabilizing him enough for travel back to europe but that was not why theyd really come patels condition was merely a cover to explain this inland journey alden leaned closer but used the radio built into the headphones to communicate i have a contact who should be waiting for us after we land if any word of the kidnapped woman passed through the camp hell ferret it out gray nodded and glanced over at tucker and seichan kowalski was up front with major butler who was flying the helicopter it wasnt a bad plan the camp lay within the shadow of the cal madow mountains as the only relief facility for hundreds of miles the site was the major crossroads for the entire region as somalis from all walks of life travelers and nomads came seeking medical help continually flowing into and out of the place because of that the camp was also a strategic and important clearinghouse for information it was no wonder the srr had someone posted on the inside here with care grays team might learn something vital about amandas whereaboutsor at least narrow the search parameters back in dc painter was coordinating a satellite scan of the neighboring mountains between boots on the ground and eyes in the skies the hope was to pinpoint amandas location before nightfall sand suddenly swirled beyond the windows kicked up as the chopper descended with a final stomachlifting drop the skids finally kissed the ground alden hauled the cabin doors open sand and heat pounded inside as the roar of the engines whined away they all exited the helicopter and were met by a medical team of four who rushed forward to help offload major patel his stretcher was carried away to an idling jeep major butler accompanied his injured partner to make sure he was properly attended to and to spread the cover story that their group were foreign aid workers tucker patted his dogs side reassuring the shepherd after the long noisy ride kowalski merely scowled at the grim surroundings once just once why cant we end up at some beach where women are in bikinis and where drinks come in coconuts seichan ignored him and stood at grays shoulder what now this way alden answered heading off accompanied by the last member of the british srr team major bela jain the captain pointed toward a cluster of thatchedroof huts as a group they crossed through a parking lot of rusted trucks skeletal sandrail buggies and beatup motorcycles guarding them all stood an older daimler ferret scout car painted united nations white and emblazoned with their blue symbol it looked like a minitank with a fully enclosed armored cabin and mounted with a belgian l machinegun turret a united nations peacekeeper leaned against the vehicle eyeing them suspiciously as they passed alden noted grays attention camps like this need to be protected raids are common for drugs even for water drought has devastated much of this region contributing to famine and death driving the people to the coasts or up into the mountains they reached the circle of huts to find a french doctor kneeling beside a long line of somali children a nurse prepped a syringe and handed it to the doctor who jabbed it into the bony arm of the first boy in line gray had read how the civil war going on in the southern part of the country had displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians and their children leading to outbreaks of cholera dysentery and hepatitis but a vaccination program against measles and polio along with the administration of simple deworming tablets and vitamins was saving countless young lives heres the contact i was telling you about alden said pointing to the doctor he hears everything going around the camp misses nothing hes a great asset gray studied the french md a middleaged man with bulky glasses and sunburned nose and ears but gray was wrong about the focus of attention baashi alden called out and waved an arm stepping forward the spy at the camp winced as he was injected in the arm the young darkskinned boy thanked the doctor in french merci pulling his tunic sleeve down the child headed over ah mr trevor you come this is your contact kowalski mumbled under his breath plainly not pleased what is he fourteen thirteen actually major jain said softly she stared at her superior with raw admiration captain alden rescued the boy from a group of muslim insurgents outside mogadishu a child soldier only eleven at the time hyped on bloody amphetamines brutalized and bearing scars from cigarette burns grays heart ached at the sight of the boys milewide smile as he rushed forward and hugged captain alden who had dropped to one knee it seemed impossible to balance such simple joy with the horrors major jain described alden hooked an arm around the boys thin shoulders and led him back to the gathered group here are the people i wanted you to meet baashi the boy smiled staring around but gray saw the hint of fear in his eyes a wariness of strangers he leaned more tightly against alden here were the cracks that exposed the past trauma tuckers dog squirmed forward sniffing wanting to get the scent of the newest addition to their pack baashis eyes got huge a small squeal of terror stretched out of him ayiiii kane come here tucker ordered at the sound of the boys distress the shepherd returned to his handlers side down tucker reinforced the command with a flathanded gesture he sank to a knee next to his dog but his words were for the boy he wont hurt you i promise hes a good dog tucker held out a hand asking the boy to come forward baashi remained frozen at captain aldens side just let the boy be seichan warned hes clearly afraid of dogs kowalski made a grunt of agreement even jains eyes pinched with concern tucker ignored them all and kept his arm up seichan looked to gray for help he simply shook his head remembering the mans empathy scores they had been through the roof tucker had a preternatural ability to interpret anothers emotional core and maybe it wasnt just with animals clearly bonded to the child knowing the boy alden also seemed to share tuckers understanding its okay baashi if you want the boy stared at the dog for a long breath cocking his head perhaps searching inside himself for that lost bond children have for all things furry and warm finally he stepped clear of aldens legs trembling a bit his gaze never shifted from kane he good dog baashi asked tucker nodded once baashi crept forward approaching as if toward a perilous cliff kane remained alert only the tip of his tail twitching with excitement baashi reached out the back of his hand toward the dog kane stretched his nose nostrils flaring snuffling baashi moved an inch closerit was far enough a long pink tongue slipped out and licked the boys fingertips the tail twitch turned into a big wag he likes you tucker said softly baashis smile returned shyly at first then stronger he moved near enough to touch kane on the top of his head the dogs nose sniffed along the length of his arm baashi giggled and said something in a somali dialect tickles alden translated moments later the boy was sitting on the ground ruffling the dogs fur and trying to avoid an onslaught of licks gray stared at them both remembering kanes savage attack on the commando yesterday likewise he tried to picture the boy with a rifle at his shoulder in different ways the twoboy and dogwere both warriors and maybe tucker had recognized that such harshness needed an outlet of innocence and playand also trust alden joined gray baashi is slowly coming around the base here works with such children they try to rehabilitate them to bring out the scared child still trapped within the nightmares of those past horrors he eyed baashi and the dogthen tucker youve got a good man there gray had to agree tucker stood off to the side studying the distant mountains after seeing how the handler and his dog had operated back in boosaaso how the shepherd had tracked seichans blood trail through the myriad scents and smells of the city gray wondered if it wouldnt be better to simply drop the pair into the mountains let them hunt amanda down by themselves and radio back her location but that could take days days he felt sure the presidents daughter didnt have am cal madow mountains somalia from the shouts and calls beyond the tentcabin amanda knew something was happening she heard the coughing choke of several truck engines accompanied by the barking of orders one of the african soldiers burst into the cabin talked to dr blake then turned on a heel and dashed back out again blake crossed the medical ward and disappeared behind a privacy screen that hid another bed the outline of his nurse shadowed the screen they bent their heads together talking softly amanda strained to hear if she couldve slipped quietly out of the bed to eavesdrop she would have attempted it but stealthy was not a word that best described her current state still another reason also fired that desire the outline of the other hospital bed clearly showed someone occupied it she had no idea who it was an injured soldier another of the medical staff who had fallen ill whoever they were theyd been slipped into the tent in the middle of the night when shed been sleeping she woke to find the privacy screen up and the doctor and nurse going back and forth to attend the new patient all she knew was that it was a woman hearing at one point a small cry rising from beyond the screen definitely feminine but the new patient had been silent ever since likely sedated at last blake appeared again and headed over to amanda with a chart in his hands he must have read her worry nothing to concern yourself with my dear he waved an arm toward the commotion going on outside it seems someone has been making inquiries as to your whereabouts practically knocking at our doors hope surged in amanda at his words stirring the child enough to kick shhh she whispered rubbing her belly having traveled under false papers she feared that no one knew she was the true target of the midnight raid in the seychelles she avoided glancing at the cross symbol with the genetic markings knowing the truth the highseas kidnapping had not been random bad luck it had been purposefully planned and executed but now could someone be trying to rescue me icy water quickly doused that momentary hope as blake continued but theyll be dealt with swiftly enough his eyes settled on hers we wouldnt want to be interrupted especially with such good news in hand she understood looking at the chart he held you got back the amniocentesis results blake flipped through a couple pages your baby tested perfectly the genetics remain stable better than we hoped he smiled at her youre about to give birth to a miracle am unicef camp somalia seichan huddled with gray inside one of the huts at the edge of the hospital encampment kowalski and major jain kept guard outside making sure no one overheard their conversationand considering how loud they were arguing that wouldnt be a problem because beef is murder jain said hindus believe that god and if god didnt want us to eat cows he wouldnt have made them so damn tastyespecially smothered in barbecue sauce thats not an argument youd probably eat your own shoe if it had barbecue sauce poured on it i mean look at your ass what about my butt ive seen cows with smaller rear ends a sputtering sound followed then quit looking at my ass tucker stared toward the door diplomacy at its finest he mumbled your friend out there sure knows how to mend fences tucker had been included in the meeting inside the hutnot because his expertise was needed it was because of the skinny black arm around his dogs neck baashi had taken a real shine to kane and what had started as terror now seemed a source of strength no i tell you again the boy stressed i heard no one speak of a white woman in the mountains not here not at all a map had been spread out on the dirt floor captain alden crouched on the far side of it next to the boy okay baashi he leaned back and sighed im sorry commander i may have sent you miles out of your way for nothing word may have never reached here gray stared at the map it was a gamble he conceded seichan heard the tick in grays voice without even seeing his eyes she could imagine the gears turning he wasnt giving up not yet and it wasnt just him i can go out again baashi offered into the camp ask questions not just listen no seichan snapped the vehemence of her response surprised her still gray backed her up seichans right its one thing just to eavesdrop and pass on what hes heard but to actively ask questions will put him in the crosshairs of our enemy remember what happened to amur mahdi back at boosaaso and its not just the risk to the boy seichan started its more than that gray gave her a concerned look perhaps hearing the sudden stress in her voice she gave a small shake of her hand not wanting to continue not trusting herself the boy had already been used and brutalized as a child soldier how would they be any different if they turned the boy into their spy it was bad enough that the british srr was using the kid as an informant seichan stared at her hands and found her fingers tightly bound together she knew how easy it was to twist such innocence to foul purposes as the strong preyed on the weak twisting children into monsters turning them into soldiers or scouts or even sending them ahead of an advancing army as living mine detectors she forced her hands apart her fingers found the silver dragon at her neck she recognized why the boys situation struck her so deeply so personally the realization made her both angry and ashamed she remembered little of her own childhood in vietnam bits and pieces none that included her father and what she remembered of her mother she wished she could forget of being ripped from her arms of her mother being dragged out a door bloodyfaced and screaming by men in military uniforms afterward seichan spent her childhood in a series of squalid orphanages across southeast asia halfstarved most of the time maltreated the restuntil finally shed taken to the streets and back alleys it was there when she was little older than baashi that the guild found and recruited her over the course of the next year the trainers stripped away not only her remaining childhood but also much of her humanity leaving behind only an assassin i was this boy she thought abused and tortured into bloody servitude but she also knew there was one distinct difference between them she pictured baashi playing with the dog carefree and happy unlike her he was still young malleable enough to rediscover his humanity she let her fingers drop from the dragon pendant the memory of her mother dissolving away into faded whispers in the night and soft kisses on her cheekbut even then there had been tears as if her mother knew she was about to lose her child the memory sparked a sudden insight regarding their current mission shes a mother too seichan said drawing grays attention the presidents daughter his eyes narrowed on hersthen widened with understanding his fingers found her hand and squeezed his thanks then remained there she stared down wanting to feel more but at this moment all she felt was lossfor her childhood her mother even gray how could she ask more of his heart when she wasnt sure what was left of her own amandas not only unusual because shes white gray explained to the others but also because shes pregnant alden nodded such a condition is rare in a kidnap victim someone might have made note of it and hopefully talked about it gray turned to baashi have you heard anything about a pregnant woman being moved into the mountains near here someone with a large belly to emphasize gray pantomimed a swollen stomach baashi twisted his lips in thought and sat quietly for a moment then slowly sagged no i hear nothing about a bigbelly woman with the pirates seichan studied the boy he stared too hard at the map kept his attention diverted away even his arm fell from around kanes neck he knows something seichan said tucker wasnt the only one capable of reading emotions buried under the surface especially this boy i was this boy he wouldnt lie to me alden said hes not lying seichan agreed but angrily were just not asking the right question baashis gaze met hers fear shone thereand resistance how many times had the same emotions warred inside her tucker came and sat next to the boy its okay baashi kane and i wont let anyone hurt you a silent hand signal followed a flick of fingers a digit pointed at the boys lap baashi didnt see it but kane obeyed the dog came forward and rested his muzzle on the boys knee baashi placed his palm on the dogs shoulders drawing strength there its okay to tell us alden said softly no ones mad baashi glanced sheepishly up at his father figure i no lie i hear no stories about bigbelly woman i never thought you did my boy but what is scaring you what are you so afraid to tell us he finally broke down i hear other stories of a demon man in the mountains he make a place like this baashi waved his other arm in a circle like the hospital here baashi nodded but he only look after the big bellies on the woman he takes care of pregnant women alden asked repeating grays pantomime of a swollen stomach yes but they say bad things mothers go there never come back a very bad place tucker patted the boy on the shoulder you did good baashi the boy refused to look up showing no relief gray shifted to the map do the stories say where in the mountains this doctor works yes baashi said but he still wouldnt look at the map can you show kane tucker said the boy glanced from soldier to dogthen slowly nodded i show you but its a bad place as the boy reached for the map kowalski burst into the room weve got a chopper inbound alden seemed unconcerned they have medical drops all the time could be another patient supplies or major jain shoved past kowalski and dove inside incoming get down gray rolled seichan to the floor tucker and alden sheltered the boy pinning him under their bodies baashi clung tightly to kane a sharp whistling screamed across the roof of the hutfollowed by a massive explosion that shook thatch from the roof jain returned to the door another sharp scream of a rocket erupted she leaped back with even worse news this ones coming straight at us july am est washington dc painter woke to the ringing of his cell phone a crescendo of escalating notes that set his heart to thudding hard in his chest he lay in bed next to lisa their naked limbs tangled together his hand resting on the curve of her backside she sat up with him going instantly alert trained from years of being oncall at a hospital the sheets shed from her breasts her eyes shone in the predawn darkness she also knew that particular ringtone set for extreme emergencies painter grabbed his cell phone from the nightstand and answered it director weve got a problem it was kat bryant calling from sigma headquarters he glanced at the clock it was barely after five in the morning when hed left last night with lisa kat had still been in the bunker running logistics for grays operation and coordinating the various intelligence branches had she ever left whats happened he asked im fielding some frantic soss out of that unicef camp in somalia where gray was headed reports of rocket fire some sort of attack do we have eyes on it not yet im already working with nro i tried to raise gray but so far theres been no response likely a tad busy what about support we have the navy seal team cooling its heels in neighboring djibouti i can get them airborne but itll still be forty to fifty minutes for them to reach that inland camp painter closed his eyes his mind racing through various parameters and scenarios if he called in the seal team it could threaten the entire mission expose his hand too early seal team six had been assigned here specifically to extract the presidents daughternot to play un peacekeepers do we have any idea who is attacking painter asked the camp has been raided twice in the last ninety days both drug runs and two months ago a doctor got kidnapped by one of the local warlords this attack may have nothing to do with gray or the search for amanda painter wasnt buying it he pictured the assassination of amur mahdi the enemy seemed to know their every move with all of the various intelligence agencies engaged in this missionand now the british srrsomething was leaking out painter trusted his own organization but there were too many cooks in this international kitchennot to mention the presidents family the leak could be coming from anywhere painter had to make a tough decision he could not lose focus he had to preserve the seal team and its operational readiness for a possible fast extraction director kat asked he kept his voice firm get me eyes in the field as soon as you can but for now grays team is on their own a short pause followed then kat responded understood lisas hand slipped into his she didnt say a word offering only her warmth should i delay the mission to south carolina kat asked painter remembered the scheduled investigation into the clinic where amanda had her in vitro fertilization performed he could not escape the feeling that amandas sudden flight to the seychelles had something to do with her child first the assassination of amur and now this new attack on the hospital campsomebody intended for amanda never to be found no he said glancing at lisa well head over to sigma command right now i want you both out on that first flight to charleston a longer delay followed painter wondered if hed lost katthen she came back on the line director ive got a few captured still shots of the camp from a french weather satellite theyre not the best but im sending them to your phone painter pulled the device from his ear and switched to speaker as he waited for the image to fill the small screen line by line the horror of the situation in somalia revealed itself the image offered a high aerial view few details were discernible especially with the thick pall of smoke obscuring most of the camp tiny dots represented people and vehicles trying to escape the attack overhead the blurring image of a helicopter hovered above the chaos like some predatory bird waiting to pick off the weak kats small voice emerged over the speaker did you get the satphoto got it lisa peered over his shoulder covering her mouth with a hand painter struggled to keep to his original plan it was easier to abandon grays team to a bad situation when it wasnt staring him in the face but no matter how tough or callous he knew his original decision was the correct one with a few final instructions he signed off with kat and lowered the phone he stared out into the darkness someone desperately wanted to stop amanda from being found but who pm east africa time cal madow mountains somalia dr edward blake held the radio handset to his ear he stood in the communications tent crammed with gear and festooned with satellite dishes the swelter of the day drew beads of perspiration down his forehead but he knew all of that sweat was not from the heat alone he even held his white safari hat in his other handnot because he was indoors but because of the presence at the other end of the line few personages ever intimidated him he had been raised in an aristocratic family in leeds whose lineage included earls and dukes all distantly related to the royal family at estate dinners throughout the ages their home had hosted famous figures of past and present from the wartime leader general george patton to entertainers who had been knighted by the queen in oxford his roommate had been a billionaires son a prince out of saudi arabia a deadly man who would eventually head a muslim fundamentalist group until hed been caught and hung still none of that affected him or impressed himnot like now edwards fingers tightened on the handset the voice on the other end was computerized masking the identity of the speaker edward had no idea to whom he spokebut he knew the power behind that cloaked voice it was somehow appropriate the voice was computerized because he knew he was speaking to a vast machine a powerhouse that had moved throughout the ages destroying all in its wake and retooling the chaos to suit its ends and edward wanted to be more than a cog in that vast machine he intended to drive that massive engine it had been luck that landed amanda on his doorstephis eggharvesting clinic one of many in this region had been chosen to facilitate this matterbut it would take his skill to turn that good fortune into an opportunity to move up the ladder to achieve that he needed success the problem is being addressed edward promised the americans will never reach the mountains in time and the fetus the voice asked the dna is stable as we all hoped he dabbed the sweat from his brow with the back of a sleeve at least that was good news plans could move forwardbehind schedule yes but still salvageable edward continued as to that other matter i can perform the csection immediately get things ready very good though the voice was flat and affectless edward imagined the satisfaction behind those inhuman inflections and what of the mother edward asked suspecting this was a touchy matter the answer came without hesitation shes no longer of use her death will serve a greater purpose understood the voice moved on to exacting detail about how preparations and procedures would continue from here one last item concerning the mother was addressed burn her body it should be unrecognizable the sweat down his back went cold the pure callousness both appalled and excited him what would it be like to move through the world with such utter disregard for moralitydriven only by purpose the call finally ended lost in preparations he vacated the communications tent strode through the sunspeckled glade of the camp and up the steps to the makeshift medical ward he tried his best to wear such a mantle of amoral drive as he stepped through the door and let it clap shut behind him petra glanced up shifting a fall of blond hair her face open and questioning edward looked beyond her to the hospital bed at the back of the ward amanda stared at him he must have failed to fully don that cold mantle something must have still shone in his face the patient pulled her legs up an instinctive desire to protect her child but its not your child that needs protecting at the moment edward turned to petra get everything ready were doing this now july pm east africa time unicef camp somalia with the blast still ringing in his head tucker pulled the dazed boy to his feet kane shook off dust and pieces of thatch smoke and sand floated in the air the air reeked of burned flesh and flaming fuel the rocket had hit outside the hut collapsing a corner of the claybrick structure a large blackened crater opened a few yards away bodies lay strewn at the edge tossed and torn like so many rag dolls tucker found his breathing growing heavier flashing back to prior firefights in afghanistan he pulled the boys face into his chest not wanting him to see baashi didnt resist though deafened he still felt the boy crying in terror felt his wracking sobs captain alden groaned and rolled onto his rear end blood covered half his face but it appeared to be only from a scalp wound he must have caught a piece of the blast debris get him out of here alden yelled flopping his arm weakly toward the door others rose out of the smoke shedding rubble bearing cuts and abrasions gray stumbled forward with seichan kowalski helped major jain to her feet she wobbled slightly but found her footing you okay he asked she shook free of himteetered sideways then grabbed his arm again maybe not when the indian woman spotted her captain she still tried to go to him concern on her face alden waved her off go with them jain help get them clear what about you gray grabbed the map from the floor and passed it to baashi they still needed the boy to pinpoint the secret medical encampment rumored to be up in the mountains even rattled the commander never lost sight of the mission objective captain you need medical attention alden grinned through the gore then i guess im bloody well at the right place arent i commander he teetered back to his feet besides ive got two men here im not leaving them until i know theyre safe or dead tucker added silently punctuating that dour thought another blast rocked deeper into the camp kane flinched ducking lower gray grabbed the captain by the upper arm youll do your men no good on your own he dragged the brit out the door come with me alden looked ready to argue but major jain backed gray up commander pierce is right sir maybe we can argue later kowalski shouted at them by the door choppers swinging back this way out of here now gray ordered the captain reluctantly followed they rounded the hut and moved out among the field of parked vehicles tucker guessed where the commander was taking them he wouldve done the same to utilize every resource to survive gray led them straight to the minitank painted white and emblazoned with the un world logo the daimler ferret armored car still sat where theyd seen it earlier the peacekeeper posted beside it had climbed into the turret manning the machine gun the weapon smoked from prior shots but the helicopter was currently beyond range on the other side of the camp although it wouldnt take long for the chopper to circle back around gray called to the peacekeeper as a handful of refugees fled to either side of them youre a sitting duck up there soldier you need to get this vehicle moving help defend the camp the man darkskinned and helmeted yelled back in a french accent he was young likely not even twenty fear frosted his words i am alone i cannot shoot and drive monsieur gray turned to alden here is how you can best help your men put this tank in motion draw the choppers attention and take that bastard down alden understood ill do what i can to cover your escape the captain pointed to a pair of sandrail buggies fifty yards away the skeletal dune runners looked perfectly suited for this rough terrain if there are no keys theyre easy to hotwire just jam something sharp into the ignition and twist to get them started the captains next words were for his fellow soldier stay with them jain get them all clear and ill see what i can do from here the major looked exasperated but she knew how to take orders and nodded gray shook aldens hand as they parted ways be safe you do the same the captain stopped long enough to give baashi a fast hug do what they say i i will mr trevor the captain nodded and climbed into the armored car gray hurried them forward ordering them to secure their radio earpieces in place ahead the sandrail cars were little more than engines strapped to roll cages with some seats bolted in place they had no windows fenders or doors but tucker had played with them back in the dunes near camp pendleton their advantage was a low center of gravity and high flotation tires perfect for skimming over sand and hopping over obstacles kowalski must have had a similar experience and rubbed his palms together as they reached the vehicles which ones mine machinegun fire erupted behind them they all leaped forward and split on the run dividing between a smaller twoseater which gray and seichan commandeered and a larger fourseater with a bench in the rear jain reached the drivers seat first but kowalski wasnt having any of it ill drive he yelled listen boyo ive had plenty of tactical driving and i didnt just get a concussion so move it sister she looked ready to bite his head off but she was still wobbly on her feet she finally relented and abandoned the drivers seat to kowalski he discovered a screwdriver already jammed in place in the steering column serving as a key judging by the roar next to them gray started his vehicle with no more difficulty jain took the passenger seat up front leaving the rear bench to tucker and the boy kane crouched between them panting flinging a bit of drool in his adrenalinefired excitement hang on kowalski yelled grinning way too big the buggy leaped forward like a beestung horsejust as an earshattering explosion flung a nearby truck into the air another rocket blast tucker twisted around behind them the helicopter roared out of the camp and aimed toward them an m chaingun on the choppers undercarriage chewed across the sandchasing after them but they werent defenseless the ferret armored car raced into view as fleetfooted on its large tires as its nimble namesake it crossed into the path of the attack helicopter from the minitanks turret the machine gun chattered firing up at the bird in the sky captain alden manned the weapon himself shrouded in gun smoke and swirls of dusty sand the minitank skidded around to face the diving helicopter headon rounds cracked into the choppers windshield driving the bird to the side as the pilot panicked the armored car spun a full circle and took off driving wildly through the parked vehicles the chopper twisted in midair and took off after them like a hawk after a fleeing rabbitor in this case a fleeing ferret tucker settled back around looking forward kowalski hit a ridge at full speed and jumped the buggy into the air the driver hollered his joy tucker and baashi flew into the aluminum halfroof over the bench seat tucker managed to get hold of kanes leather collar as they crashed back down the dog growled angrily ready to bite someone tucker couldnt blame him he glared at the back of kowalskis stubbly head suddenly wishing he were back with the rockets and chain guns it would be safer than this backseat no wonder gray had fled to the other buggy he was no fool pm maybe this wasnt so smart grays buggy twisted sideways down a steep hill made treacherous by loose shale and slippery scree he broadsided a patch of brittle bushes at the bottom of the slope and crashed through them seichan ducked away as thorns and broken branches exploded through the open roll cage once clear she yelled at him make for the gravel road we saw from the air thats what im trying to do he had set off overland initially thinking the road would be too obvious an escape route if the helicopter decided to give chase hed already spotted other cars trucks even camels fleeing up that road driven all in the same direction by the attack he didnt want to be trapped in that traffic jam if there was a firefight his original plan was to travel as far as they could then cut back to the road but the hilly terrain proved tougher than it looked broken up into rocky hummocks sudden cliffs and thick patches of bushes and trees ahead it looked even worse as the land pushed up toward the mountains risky or not the road had to be safer than this with that in mind he drove the car up the next rise to get a better view and gain his bearings in the rearview mirror he spotted kowalski following him and farther behind him an ominous column of oily black smoke marked the horizon lets hope thats the helicopter there seichan pointed he turned his attention forward a quarter mile away the road looked little better than a dry riverbed winding across the bitter terrain it disappeared into the higher hills and scraggly lower forests kowalski skidded up next to him gray touched his throat mike as he nosed his vehicle down the far side of the rise kowalski were heading back to the road well make better time there too bad his partner responded in his ear it was just getting fun from the whiteknuckled grips of his passengers gray doubted theyd describe his driving in such a positive light though the dune runners were made for spinning jumping and turningall necessary skills to traverse this torturous terrainit still felt like riding a jackhammer on top of a cement mixer and the last quartermile journey back to the road was no gentler on his kidneys at last he fishtailed his buggy onto the gravel which after the offroad trek felt as smooth as a freshly paved highway he sped gratefully down the road which climbed in sweeping switchbacks up into the mountains over the next hour he kept a hard pace passing the occasional slower truck the forest slowly grew thicker and taller as they gained elevation rounding a sharp turn he came close to a headon collision with a camel the creature dodged around the buggy with a bleating complaint gray noted the empty saddle and the bundle of gear tied to it as the beast continued downhill worried he slowed his buggy to a stop kowalski flew around the corner with a rumble of his engine and a throaty grind of gears he came close to rearending gray but swerved to a halt in time gray cut his engines and signaled kowalski to do the same in the silence gray strainedthen heard a distinct poppoppop rifle fire he pictured the empty saddle ambush he said seichan immediately understood too someone set up a roadblock ahead theyre sweeping up after the helicopter gray nodded any refugees who attempted to flee into the mountains were being gunned down ahead but another cold certainty settled in his belly it had been nagging him since the first rocket blast he had hoped the air attack had been orchestrated by local insurgents or warlords drugs and medical supplies were as good as gold here especially in the wartorn south but this ambush on the road into the mountains removed any uncertainty this was about amanda gantbennett and worse this is too bold a move for pirates he said the chopper attack now this roadblock theyre not trying to hide their actions any longer theyre pulling out the big guns and making a final stand what are you getting at seichan asked this isnt defense this is an endgame he turned to seichan they wouldnt move so openly so brazenly unless they saw no further need to keep their mountain enclave secret realization dawned in seichans eyes either theyve moved amanda already she started gray finished or shes dead pm amanda tugged against the padded leather cuffs tying her to the hospital bed minutes ago theyd placed an iv catheter in her right arm and given her an injection that fogged the edges of her mind a saline bag slowly dripped next to her she wanted to panic but couldnt more than the drugs what kept her calm was the steady beeping of a fetal heart monitor the nurse had strapped a sensor belt around her belly it communicated wirelessly to the bedside device my babys fine my babys fine it was her mantra to keep her sanity especially with all the commotion in the room bluesmocked medical personnel came and went busy behind the privacy screen of the other bed elsewhere soldiers hauled out equipment under the direction of dr blake movement to the side drew her muddled attention to petra the nurse hauled a portable anesthetic machine to her bedside at the sight of the clear mask hanging from the hoses amanda fought against her cuffs but she was already too weak dr blake came over and touched her wrist he raised a syringe filled with a milky fluid dont worry we wont let any harm come to your baby she was unable to stop him as he inserted the syringe needle into her iv line and slowly pushed the plunger petra lowered a mask toward her face she twisted her head away across the room she watched one of the medical staff push aside the privacy screen at long last she saw who shared the ward with her who lay in the other bed horror swelled through her she screamed as petra grabbed her head and forced the mask down over her nose and mouth now now itll be all over in a few seconds blake promised her three two darkness closed around her narrowing her view of the world to a pinpoint one then it was gone july pm east africa time cal madow mountains somalia gray paced the shoulder of the road while the sun baked the gravel into a shimmering mirage he and the others kept to the shadows of the neighboring forest it sang with the buzz of cicadas and the calls of songbirds farther up into the highlands green forests beckoned draped in mists like a sliver of eden emphasizing this the occasional breeze carried down the scent of wildgrowing jasmine he clutched a satellite phone in his hand and weighed the risks of opening an encrypted communication channel to sigma command from the series of attacksboth in boosaaso and hereintelligence was clearly leaking to the enemy and right now his team had a thin advantage no one knows were still alive gray wanted to keep it that way but more than that what would be gained in the end if he reached out to sigma what support could they offer to mobilize an adequate response would risk exposing both their survival and their location even seal team six awaiting word in neighboring djibouti could not be activated such an overt force had a limited window to get in and get out safely it was up to grays team to first pin down the whereabouts of the presidents daughter if gray attempted to call the states and if word should reach her captors that his team was closing in on her position the enemy would be more apt to act rashly to kill her on the spot knowing what he had to do gray shoved the satellite phone back into his pack were on our own until we find her with that settled he waved seichan over to him she approached with baashi a hand resting on his shoulder gray noticed how protective she was with the boy he had never seen her bond so quickly to another person gray knelt in front of baashi can you show us on the map where the other hospital camp is hidden the one with the bad doctor the boy looked down at his toes and shook his head i no cant baashi looked scared gray imagined the gunfire must have spooked him likely triggering memories of other firefights he had been in as a child soldier kane could probably help soothe those rattled nerves but tucker knelt with his dog at the edge of the forest suiting his partner up in a kevlar vest the pair readied themselves for a reconnaissance mission to get some eyes on the ambush ahead and ascertain what sort of force lay between them and the mountains farther away kowalski and the srr woman major jain had returned to the last switchback blocked the road with their two buggies and turned away any vehicles trying to use the road to get into the mountains jain knew the native dialects well enough to persuade them to take a different route though gray suspected jains pistol and kowalskis rifle did most of the persuading for them gray had to admit the british major was an asset and considering how she handled kowalski matching him toetotoe she was one tough soldier they would need that ahead gray returned his attention forward the best chance for grays small team was to slip past that enemy line unseen they didnt have the manpower for a full frontal assault but once past that roadblock gray needed to know where to goand fast the clock was ticking down for amanda he was sure of it he leaned closer to baashi and coaxed those large dark eyes to face him again we wont let anyone harm you i promise the boys face hardened offended i no afraid of course youre not i know captain alden is very proud of you so then why dont you show me on the map where the secret camp is located baashi sagged crestfallen and admitted the reason for his reluctance i no have the map gray hid his shock not wanting to scare the boy he had given baashi the topographic map back in the hut so he could study it where is it baashis eyes looked wet with pending tears he waved toward the way theyd come i no have it blow away gray realized the boy must have lost it during the rough trek here its not his fault seichan said if the rattling had gotten any worse i mightve lost a filling or two myself she was right and gray knew where the true blame lay hed not been thinking when hed trusted the map to the boy baashi looked so much older than his few years aged by his rough treatment but gray also knew this wasnt his first mistake during this mission the hard glint to seichans icy eyes suggested those errors hadnt gone unnoted but i show you baashi said brightening he tapped a thumb against his skinny breastbone no mapbut i map i take you there seichan fixed gray with a resolute stare we cant put the boy in such danger we dont even know what lies ahead he nodded and glanced to tucker and kane well wait to see what they discover well only move forward if theres a safe path around this ambush pm tucker knelt in front of kane he pointed into the forest and touched a finger to his lips from here they needed the utmost stealth he roughed up the fur of the shepherds neck and stared kane in the eyes whos a good boy the dog touched his nose to tuckers thats rightyou are tucker felt the others eyes upon him he didnt care unabashed by the display of affection lets go tucker commanded and held up five fingers instructing kane to keep five meters ahead of him together they moved into the deeper shadows of the forest kane slipped away vanishing with the barest rustle of leaf tucker followed stepping carefully letting his dog take the lead becoming an extension of his senses in his earpiece he heard kanes quiet breath along with the whisper of birdsong and creak of branches he kept one eye on the shielded screen of his phone that gave him a survey of the upcoming terrain from a dogs point of view they slowly but steadily paralleled the road through the forest kanes nightvision camera stripped away shadows making sure they didnt stumble upon any sentries hidden in the forest but more than the night vision tucker trusted his partners nose when kane slowed so did tucker when the dog circled wide tucker kept the same wide berth though separated by several yards they moved in tandem like a choreographed ballet all the while tucker radioed soft instructions via kanes earpiece keeping the dog following the rough turn of the gravel road through the sensitive microphone on kanes camera harsh voices suddenly reached tuckers ear slow he subvocalized to his partner creep left the view through the camera dropped low forward movement became a stepbystep approach back to the road the trees grew thinner three trucksall land roversappeared ahead blocking a choke point where the roadway had been blasted through a steep ridgeline soldiers paced in front more stood on the hoods other men rolled vehicles to the side of the road or dragged bodies leaving bloody trails the entire force wore black vests helmets and carried assault rifles same as the crew who had assassinated amur mahdi tucker counted at least fifteen men down he instructed kane stay he touched his throat mike and reported to gray commander do you see this affirmative we arent getting through that logjam without a major firefight can you find another path around them do my best he left kane to guard his back to maintain his post by the road earlier while en route here he had heard the faint tinkling of water through his dogs microphone he crept through the woods slowly heading away from the road searching for the source it did not take long to discover a thin stream of water trailing along a sandy gully it flowed only a foot wide and a few inches deep runoff from the highlands the last vestiges of the rainy season trickling away so small it would never reach the arid plains below still he dipped his finger into it remembering an old adage of his survivaltraining instructor where theres water theres a way he headed upstream hoping for that to be true within fifty yards the feeble wash reached the steep ridgeline that blocked the way forward there he bore witness to the power of water even a flow as anemic as this one centuries of wet seasons had slowly eroded a cut through the sandy rock it was narrow dropping through a series of short falls and easily climbable giving them ready access to the highlands above focused upward he failed to note the figure kneeling by the pool at the base of the cataracts filling a canteen a rifle resting beside him tucker had forgotten his other survivaltraining instruction never let your guard down pm the heat of the day even in the shade wore on gray he kept a watch on the phone screen viewing the feed from kanes camera the assault team remained a quarter mile up the road he watched them mill heard their harsh laughter but at any time they might send a scout or one of the trucks down this way they needed to be gone before that happened he checked the clock on the corner of the small screen tucker had been gone for ten minutes no word that was long enough he raised his fingers to activate the radio mike at his throat before he could speak a rustle drew his attention back to the woods seichan raised her pistol tucker shoved through some bushes and into the open his eyes had a wounded tired look found a way he said lets go gray quickly gathered the others he and seichan flanked tucker as they hurried into the forest kowalski and jain followed with baashi between them the woman had an arm around the boy intending to keep him safe any problems gray asked tucker sensing something troubled the man only a small one he said sourly they reached a tiny creek and followed it uphill moving as quietly as possible the waterway led to a steep ridge eroded throughout by a series of cataracts who is that jain asked pointing the muzzle of her rifle at a soldier gagged and hogtiedout coldsprawled beside a small pond at the base of the falls seichan moved warily closer searching the remaining woods hes alone tucker said dully came for water but someone could come looking why didnt you just kill him kowalski asked hide his body tucker mumbled almost did kill him caught me by surprise seichan dropped to a knee and examined the soldier then glanced at baashi her voice held a sharp edge hes only a boy gray got a better look at the soldiers face he looked even younger than baashi i jumped him tucker said breathing harder i moved fast barely thinking didnt want him to alert the others had my arm around his neck ready to snap it like a twigonly then saw he was a child still i squeezed him until he passed out tucker stared down at his arms in disbelief and shame gray remembered the fly tucker had spared back in tanzania blocking his hand from swatting at it the man clearly had enough of killing any killingunless it was in selfdefense or to protect others to the side baashi stared at the boy on the ground unblinking did he see himself lying there baashi looked at tuckerand took a step away scared that fear more than anything wounded the man cmon gray said hell be fine someone will find him but we dont want to be anywhere near here when that happens tucker radioed his dog as the others climbed the steplike cataracts through the ravine gray waited beside him you had no choice gray said we always have a choice tucker answered bitterly kane came silently into view rushing forward not gleefully but subdued he sidled next to his handler rubbing against his legs as if sensing tuckers dark mood tucker patted him reassured him gray suspected some of that went both ways he had worked with military handlers and their dogs in the past they had a sayingit runs down the leaddescribing how the emotions of the pair became shared over time binding them together as firmly as any leash watching tucker and kane he believed that now the two consoled each other supported each other found reserves of strength that could only be forged by such a deep connection finally tucker stared over at gray so did kane he nodded back at the pair they were ready they were soldiers all three of them and they had their mission july am est washington dc painter found himself back in the situation room his boss the head of darpa general gregory metcalf had summoned him to this earlymorning meeting the other attendees gathered in the presidents private conference room general metcalf was already seated he was africanamerican a graduate of west point and though in his midfifties he was as sturdy as a linebacker the general leaned his head toward his superior the secretary of defense warren w duncan who wore a crisp suit and whose stark gray hair looked oiled and combed into rigid submission the three remaining members of this intimate summit were all of one family two were seated opposite the military men the first lady teresa gant looked like a faded lily in a beige twill dress her dark blond hair had been piled neatly atop her head but strands had come loose and hung along the sides of her face framing eyes that held a haunted look next to her resting a large hand on hers was her brotherinlaw the secretary of state robert gant sitting stiffly defensive his steely gaze upon painter hid daggers and the greeting from the final member of the group was no friendlier president james t gant stalked the far side of the table with his usual crisp directness honed from his prior years as the ceo of various gant family enterprises he laid into painter what is this about an attack on some hospital camp in somalia why is this the first im hearing about it painter had suspected this was the reason for this sudden call to the white house the intelligence communities were already abuzz in regards to this attack further complicated by the involvement of british special forces painter had hoped to keep a lid on this smoking powder keg for at least another couple of hours to keep its connection to amandas kidnapping secret that wasnt to be warren duncan put a nail in the coffin i heard from the british special reconnaissance regiment they said they had men in the field there that they were assisting some covert american team james gant pointed a finger at painter your team he swung around unable to hide his disgust show him bobby the presidents brother tapped a video remote and brought up a live satellite feed from the unicef hospital the camp was a smoky ruin pocked by mortar craters survivors rushed about seeking to aid the injured or kneeling over bodies or trying to put out fires president gant shoved an arm toward the screen you said to avoid shockandawe to keep amandas kidnappers from knowing theyd acquired a highvalue targetmy daughter this last boomed out of his barrel chest making him sound like a confederate general rallying his troops to a fight and plainly this was going to be a brawl with painter as the punching bag that looks like shock to me director gant said and im certainly not awed by such a hamfisted operation as youre running not when my daughter and unborn grandson are at risk painter bore the brunt of this tirade without breaking eye contact with the president the man needed to vent to lash out he waited for the fire to die back enough to let reason slip past the panic of a frightened parent what do you have to say for yourself gant finished running fingers through his saltandpepper hair his voice cracked on the last couple of words that was his opening he kept his response just as blunt and direct mr president the kidnappers know they have your daughter i suspect theyve known from the very beginning for some unknown reason she had been targeted for abduction his statement both deflated the president and flared the fear brighter in his eyes from this attack painter continued with a nod to the wall and other incidents its clear amandas kidnappers have forgone hiding their knowledge the boldness of this assault suggests two things he ticked them off on his fingers one the enemy must be spooked to act so brazenly which suggests my men are closing in on her true location two amandas best hope for recovery lies with that same team support came from a surprising source painters boss cleared his throat i agree with the director mr president metcalf said we have no other assets available even the fastresponse seal team in djibouti needs a hard targetsomething we dont have as much as this operation has blown up in our collective faces we have no other viable options for securing your daughter okay it was lukewarm support but painter would take that from his boss after bumping heads the two of them had a professionally respectful but uneasy relationship and metcalf was savvy enough in washington politics not to stick his neck outat least not out too far but how do we know your team is still out there gant asked getting a nod from his brother at the table they might all be dead painter shook his head theyre not how can you be so certain from this painter stepped forward took the remote and tapped in an encrypted code hed preestablished the feed with one of the situation rooms watch team on the wallmounted monitor a grainy video appeared stuttering full of digital noise i apologize for the reception i collected this feed via an isr plane cruising at thirtyeight thousand feet above somalia teresa gant stirred enough to ask isr her brotherinlaw answered intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance basically ears in the sky from there i patched through the nro satellite in geosynchronous orbit warren duncan sat straighter this is live maybe a sixsecond delay i acquired the feed only half an hour ago the president squinted a bit what are we seeing the view was low to the ground racing along a dirt track fleeting images of trees and leafy bushes flashed past at the edges from the gps coordinates transmitted were seeing a road through the highland forests of the cal madow mountains on the screen the view zoomed up to a pair of legs then the face of a small black boy audio was even worse cutting in and out here over by hurry the boy fled from the camera racing away with the exuberance of youth whos filming this the defense secretary asked painter allowed a moment of selfsatisfaction one of my newest recruits pm east africa time cal madow mountains somalia kane chased after baashi come see the boy exclaimed and skittered to a stop his arm pointed toward the jungle to a rutted track that cut off the main road if you could call it a road gray thought his team had been hiking into the highlands for the past fortyfive minutes leaving the ambush miles behind they had returned to the gravel road after giving the murderous choke point a wide berth gray kept a continual ear out for the growl of truck engines behind him as he set a hard pace into the heart of the mountains slowly over time the gravel under his boots gave way to dirt then once into the misty highlands to nothing more than tire tracks worn into the sandy silt soon the arid lowlands were a forgotten world here verdant high meadows rolled down into valleys filled with misty forests of junipers and frankincense trees and all around them like broken dragons teeth jagged peaks thrust toward the sky that shimbaris baashi said pointing to the highest peak in that direction it looked like a toppled skyscraper covered in emerald forest they say the bad doctor in karkoor valley that way he thrust his arm again toward the rutted track off the main road tucker crouched at the turnoff picking up clods of freshly turned dirt been recent traffic through here mud tires the land rovers at the roadblock gray said meeting his eye they were on the right path gray turned to the boy i want you to stay here baashi off the road hidden entirely out of sight you dont come out until you see one of us but i help he said youve helped enough i told captain alden id protect you seichan pointed a finger at the boys nose and you promised him youd listen to us right the two of them sounded like scolding parentsand got the usual sullen teenager response baashi sighed heavily crossed his arms expressing his disappointment with every fiber of his being with the matter settled the boy went into hiding out of harms way while gray and the others headed down the shadowy turnoff a tunnel made by a canopy of woven branches theyd not taken more than a few steps when major jain called from the rear hold gray turned the british soldier still stood at the edge of the main road in the sunlight she held a hand up then pointed it toward her ear gray cocked his head listening he first heard kane rumbling deep in his throat sensing something too then in the distance echoing off the surrounding peaks the deeper groan of truck engines company coming kowalski said jain ducked off the road and into the shadows to join them tucker grimaced mustve found the boy i tied up or theyve had enough killing for one day kowalski said or theyre looking for more jain added kowalski grimaced you had to say that didnt you she shrugged no matter how you cut it boyo were bloody screwed gray couldnt argue with her but they had no choice they had to forge ahead find amanda and do their best to survive lets go gray pointed his arm forward tucker i want kanes eyes and ears ahead of us ive had enough surprises for one day tucker gave a curt nod and went to his dog they hurried down the road staying at the periphery the forest to either side offered better protection but the dense growth would slow their progress make too much noise right now he needed to put some distance between them and the approaching trucks we cant do this on our own seichan said striding fast next to him a guarded camp ahead of us mercenary soldiers behind usnot great odds gray had already come to the same conclusion he had to trust his gut that amanda was here that there was a reason for such lethal and overt reaction to their presence in the mountains he shifted his shoulder pack and removed his satellite phone it was time to call in the cavalry that meant reaching washington gray dialed up sigma command hoping the quantum encryption built into the phone would keep the call from reaching the wrong ears after a long moment and a series of passwords he heard a familiar voice commander pierce gray let out a hard breath of relief director i believe weve found where amanda was taken im not sure shes still here but as a precaution we should mobilize seal team six to my coordinates so theyre ready when already done painter said cutting him off i got approval from the defense secretary a few minutes ago the seal team is en route to your position with orders to engage only if the presidents daughter is positively identified theyre about forty minutes out forty minutes that may be too late confirming this the roar of engines in the distance grew steadily louder amanda didnt have forty minutes a disconcerting question rose in grays mind director how do you know our position weve been monitoring your progress for the past halfhour how gray searched around him then saw tucker send his shepherd running ahead hugging the forests edge kane tucker must have left his dogs camera running since the roadblock it was kats idea painter explained of course it was if anyone had the brains to find them without raising an alarm it was kat bryant she had proved countless times to be an elusive and crafty spider when it came to the intelligence web kat set up a passive search algorithm set to the wireless frequency of the dogs camera nothing that would trigger any alarm bells we could watch over your shoulders without giving away your location gray was grateful for the covert support but it also made him vaguely uneasy in the future hed have to make sure to circumvent that ability if he wanted total privacy audio is bad though painter finished cuts in and out so keep that in mind we can see you but not always hear you got it ahead tucker came running back toward him that had to mean trouble have to sign off gray said painters voice went hard i can see why go but be gray cut him off before he could warn him to be careful it didnt need to be saidshouldnt be said it was like wishing an actor good luck instead of break a leg tucker came up breathing hard another land rover is blocking the road ahead counted six men around it another handful in the camp a worried frown creased his face look at this tucker held up his phone displaying a dogseye view of the facility a large tentcabin raised on pilings stood in the middle of a cold camp around it ash pits marked old bonfires garbage rusted stakes oil stains along with a few collapsed tents abandoned in haste were all that was left of a large campsite a few shreds of camouflage netting still draped from the trees at the forests edge but that was it looks like most of the camp bugged out already tucker said id say no longer than an hour ago gray felt the pit of his stomach opening to despair were they already too late but i did see shadows moving inside that cabin tucker offered someones still there seichan overheard maybe they left their victim here fearing reprisals and scattered gray grasped at this thin hope kowalski joined them so what are we doing jain stood at his shoulder bearing the same question on her face they needed a plan from here he ran various scenarios in his head we cant risk panicking the remaining soldiers we also dont want to needlessly expose ourselves to the enemy combatants if amanda has already been moved well do her no good dead then what kowalski asked gray turned his focus upon tucker we need to see inside that cabin july pm east africa time cal madow mountains somalia tucker lay on his belly with kane at the edge of the forest forty yards of open space stretched between his position and the cabin with men milling at the entry road and three more soldiers scavenging the grounds ahead for anything of value any attempt to cross here would be readily spotted even a dog on the run tucker stared through his rifles scope studying the terrain a lone soldier pushed a dented wheelbarrow past his field of view stopping occasionally to pick something out of the discarded debris the radio scratched in his ear it was kowalski reporting in from his post down the road acting as rear lookout company has arrived trucksthree of emare reaching the turnoff gray responded on all channels kowalski rally back to our position the rest of the teamgray and the two womenhad crept forward through the forest and lay in wait several meters from the lone land rover that guarded the ruins of the camp they all waited for tuckers signal if amanda was in the tent theyd ambush the vehicle trusting the element of surprise and the cover of the jungle to overcome the enemys superior odds if amanda wasnt here theyd all retreat into the woods and regroup gray spoke with a note of urgency tucker now or never still not clear tucker whispered under his breath thirty yards away the man with the wheelbarrow picked up a sleeveless dvd judged it then flung it away with a flip of his wrist it seemed everyone was a critic keep moving asshole tucker gray pressed the other trucks are turning and heading this way youve got two minutes or we have to start shooting and hope for the best tucker stared at the ak slung over the soldiers shoulder as the man continued sifting through the debris im not going to send kane out just to be killed tucker flashed back to that painful moment in afghanistan he again felt the pop of his ears as the rescue helicopter lifted off felt the rush of hot air he had been clinging to kane both bloodied by the firefight by the exploded ordnance but tucker had never taken his eyes off abel his partners littermate whod knocked them both clear before the buried ied detonated if kane had been tuckers right arm abel was his left hed trained them bothbut hed never readied himself for this moment abel raced below limping on three legs searching for an escape taliban forces closed in from all directions tucker strained for the door ready to fling himself out to go to his friends aid but two soldiers pinned him restraining him tucker yelled for abel he was heard abel stopped staring up panting his eyes sharp and bright seeing him they shared that last moment locked together until a flurry of gunfire severed that bond forever tuckers grip tightened on his rifle now refusing to forget that lesson he had a small black paw print tattooed on his upper left shoulder a permanent reminder of abel of his sacrifice he would never waste another life like that to send another dog to certain slaughter i need a distraction he radioed back fiercely to gray something to pull attention away from here kanell get shot before he can get halfway to the cabin the answer to his desperate plea came from an unexpected locationfrom directly behind tucker i do it said a squeaky voice with the strain of forced bravery no want kane shot tucker rolled around in time to see baashi dart away into the forest cursing under his breath he radioed gray baashi followed us heard me i think hes going to do something stupid kowalski responded see him ill grab him then seconds later defeat tinged his voice kids a friggin jackrabbit a shout cracked across the forest coming from the direction of the narrow road iska waran baashi called out ha ridin tucker pictured him approaching the land rover hands in the air a rapid exchange followed in somali jain translated via the radio hes telling them his mother is sick he came a long way from his village to see the doctor here tuckers fingers tightened on the stock of his rifle the three soldiers adrift in the camp moved toward the gate drawn by the commotion for better or worse tucker got his distraction he reached and gave kane a warm squeeze on his ear they didnt have time for their usual goodbye ritual with a twinge of foreboding he flicked his wrist leaving a finger pointing toward the cabin kane took off like a shot dashing low across the open field daawo baashi called out hes asking for medicine jain said he got something else a savage spat of gunfire burst forth pm seichan watched baashi dance backward dirt exploding in front of his toes laughter followed from the soldiers gathered in front of the land rover enjoying their sport a hard man with a jagged scar splitting his chin and turning his lower lip into a perpetual scowl waved the others to silence and sauntered with the haughtiness of a reigning conqueror he had his helmet tilted back his flak jacket open he rested a palm on a holstered pistol as he approached baashi who cowered halfbowed under the others gaze jiifso he commanded maxbuus baad tahay major jain hid on the other side of the road with kowalski the british soldier translated softly subvocalizing into her radio hes telling baashi to lie down that hes his prisoner baashi obeyed dropping to one knee placing a hand on the ground groveling in submission the soldier grinned made meaner by his scarred lower lip he pulled his pistol out hes going to execute the kidbut not before terrorizing him seichan remembered another man another weapon he had held a knife at her naked throat his breath on her neck twice her weight thick with hard muscle they sent him against her when she was seventeen a training exercise a sadist of the darkest ilk a perverse predator he wouldnt just kill her he intended to degrade and savage her before taking her life to survive she had to submit to tolerate his touchonly long enough to secure his knife when he let his guard drop for a hot breath she had gutted him in the endbut she still remembered the ruin of that day the utter degradation of the powerful over the weak and worst of all what was destroyed forever in her she wouldnt let that happen to another seichan shifted her sig sauer pistol toward the soldier gray crouched at her side where they hid meters into the forest shielded by a thicket of bushes he touched a finger to her shoulder warning her not to shoot not yet metal glinted as baashis other hand halfhidden by his thin body slipped a military dagger out of the back of his pants it looked as long as the boys forearm the sight shocked her proving her earlier assessment she and the boy were the same i was this boy but baashi was going to get himself killed seichan steadied her aim feeling grays fingers tighten on her shoulder ordering her not to act she obeyed but it left her body trembling with rageand not a small amount of shame what is taking tucker so long they needed confirmation from himor more precisely from his partner kane abandons bright sunlight for darkness as he ducks through heavy posts and under the raised wooden structure it is cooler here for a breath he is blind as his pupils dilate and adjust to the darkness still his ears prick stretching senses deep into the shadows he takes it all in to fill the darkness with meaning and substance the creak of wood above the beat of boot heels on planks the dripdripdripping farther back he tastes the shadows with tongue and nose waste and spoor oil and sludge farther back a sharper taint that sets his hackles to rising fetid with the promise of meat he follows the trickling sound sniffs where it falls in fat droplets from above blood but that is not why hes come he has been given a scent trapped in a wad of cloth smelling of sweat and salt and oil and a feminine musk he was sent on the hunt for it he lifts his nose toward the planks above where the blood seeps he sniffs drawing in the richness there expanding trails in all directions so many but through it all a single thread matches connecting here to that wad of cloth he has found what he hunted he points his nose to the scent and voices his successnot the howl of wildness buried in his bones that is not his way he lets flow a soft whine deep in his throat proclaiming his victory he hears words in one ear that melt through him good dog he breathes in his satisfaction and lowers to his haunches only now do his eyes fill in the spaces left bare by scent and sound out of the darkness a pair of red lights shines back at him tiny and sharp they come from devices attached to large barrels reeking of rusted metal and bitter oil his hackles shiver sensing danger at the edge of the forest tucker lived half in his skin half in another he had heard what kane heard creaking and boot steps and he saw what kane saw fluid seeping through the planks from above but was it blood oil water he couldnt say for sure then kane pointed his nose followed by a soft whine success he radioed it to gray kane found amandas scent at the cabin she was there and maybe still is understood came the response tense clear a path and get in there ill join you as soon as i can as gray finished the image on the small screen swung to the side the gritty night vision of kanes camera revealed two large barrels spaced at equal distance in the crawlspace under the tentcabin he read the word kerosene stenciled on one of them worst of all attached to their sides two glowing transmitters illuminated explosive charges panicked he touched his throat mike commander gunfire cut off the rest of his warning pm seichan fired clipping the scarred man in the left knee he toppled with a scream of surprise gray strafed the soldiers gathered on their side of the land rover kowalski and jain did the same on the other seichan dashed out of hiding to protect the boy who had dropped flat as the firefight commenced she strode to the downed soldier while firing two rounds at another commando sheltered behind one of the land rovers open doors the scarred monster on the ground swung his pistol at her but she put a bullet through his throat collected his weapon and fired both guns at the truck pistols now blazing in both fists get off the road she hollered at baashi he leaped like a frightened doe into the sheltering forest a commando got behind the wheel of the land rover cranked the engine and hit the accelerator the truck barreled toward her she stood her ground aimed both guns and fired a single round from each left to shatter the windshield right to put a round through the drivers eye she stepped aside as the trucks momentum carried it toward her veering drunkenly at the last second and crashing into the woods the firefight lasted another ten secondsand ended as abruptly as it started soldiers sprawled limp and unmoving on the road gray cleared the forest holding a hand over his left ear listening likely to tucker he glanced toward the tentcabin with a grimace of worry he pointed his other arm down the road the loud rumble of trucks drew her attention around brakes squealed those coming had heard the gunplay keep them off our backs for as long as possible he orderedthen took off into the campsite on foot seichan stared down the forested tunnel her group had the element of surprise before that was no longer the case and the enemy had three times their force vastly outnumbering and outgunning them kowalski and jain joined her sharing concerned but determined looks seichan glanced over her shoulder as gray disappeared from view she hoped the presidents daughter was still here still alive either way they were committed now she waved the others back into hiding you heard gray she said we hold our ground here it had better be worth it pm tucker dropped the last of the three soldiers in the camp the one with the wheelbarrow the kills felt cowardly but he had no time for delicacy all he could do was grant them clean head shots but he knew there was at least one other enemy remembering the creak of boards from inside the cabin whoever was holed up there had surely heard the attackbut what would they do gray appeared to his left pistol in hand running for the lone structure tucker had managed to get word to him as the firefight ended warning of the fiery bomb hidden under the tent tucker took a fast glance at his phones screen a bobbling image showed kane still struggling to yank away the first glowing transceiver from the explosive charge tucker had lost precious seconds trying to get his dog to understand directing kane via radioed commands even as close as they were there were limits to their communication tucker had to do something he burst out of hiding and sprinted toward the cabin too he was closer but gray had a head start they should reach the door at the same time he lifted his phone on the screen kane yanked his head and the bright glow of the transceiver died good boy kane turned to the other charge shining brightly in the dark he took a step toward itwhen the light began to blink rapidly illuminated digits flared into existence on the device cursing tucker skidded to a stop the bastard inside had activated the charge set to a timer rifle blasts drew tuckers attention from the screen the last soldier slammed out of the cabin door weapon at his hip firing wildly trying to make a break before those seconds ran out gray dropped flat sliding on his belly pistol pointed forward gripped in both hands he fired three fast rounds the gunman tumbled headlong down the steps from the raised porch he landed hard but from the placement of grays rounds all to the face he was surely dead before he even hit the ground tucker stared at the tiny screen as kane closed in on the second barrel the dog would never be able to work the transceiver free in time and with the device activated any attempt to remove it could set it off prematurely kane he yelled not bothering with the radio to me gray scrambled to his feet and looked over at him tucker pointed toward the crawlspace between the pilings its set to blow twenty seconds the two men sped toward the tent kane flew into view tail high and ran to tuckers side the group reached the porch steps together pounded up and shoved through the springloaded door the makeshift medical ward looked as stripped and vacated as the rest of the camp upended boxes stray pieces of hospital gear a toppled privacy screen the place had been abandoned in a hurry they must have suspected time was running out for them but the ward had not been entirely emptied at the rear a hospital bed rested against the back wall it was not vacant a blond woman lay under a thin blanket an oxygen mask over her face her limbs secured with leather straps the bedding over the mound of her belly was stained red soaked through more blood ran from under the blanket and pooled on the plank floor gray rushed forward yanked away the mask then ripped back the covers he exposed what had been so chastely hidden tucker fell to his knees in horror they were too late july am est washington dc no the anguish in that single word that long sustained note of pain and grief echoed off the walls of the small conference room the first lady swung away from the screen covering her face as if to make the sight go away her husband stood stiff frozen staring unblinking at the screen no one said a wordteresas cry encompassed everything the last image remained fixed in painters eye when gray pulled back the bedsheets someone had operated on amanda sliced her open from rib to pelvis exposing the ruins of her empty uterus theyd performed a csection stolen the baby and left amandas dead body behind like an empty husk on the screen now painter watched gray swing away grabbing up tucker from the floor the image bobbled wildly as the two men and the dog fled the cabin he understood their haste theyd all seen the barrels of kerosene the glow of the explosive charge and the timer counting down an image of running legs a distant forestthen a bright blast that sent everyone tumbling forward a fireball rolled overhead the second barrel of kerosene rolled off to the side jettisoned clear by the blast wave leaving behind a trail of oil before it vanished out of view the audio feed frazzled then went silent a moment later tuckers face appeared as he checked on his dog his mouth moved but there was no sound in the background gray got up on his hands and knees hurriedly shrugging free his shoulder pack which was on fire he threw it aside and rolled in the dirt to put out the smoldering back of his shirt theyd live painter should have felt reliefbut he was not there yet teresa burst out of her seat and into her husbands arms it was not to seek comfort her fists pummeled his body sobs shook through her weakening the effort tears flowed down her face this is your fault she yelled into his chest as james gant pulled his wife tight to him all our fault they they cut my baby open she sagged in her husbands arms pressing her face into his chest still shaking her head trying to dismiss what she saw he held her up looking over the crown of her head at painter anger burned through the raw grief in his stony eyes directed at painter at sigma the presidents brother stood and gently coaxed the grieving parents toward the door go jimmy robert urged take care of your wife we can handle matters from here gant didnt resist the pair still wrapped together bonded by unimaginable grief and horror slipped out of the room gathering secret service men in their wake the defense secretary warren duncan placed a hand on roberts shoulder sir why dont you go too family should be together during times like this roberts normally gentle and even tone turned acerbic his gaze passed over painter scorching him with his bitterness someone in the family should bear witness to the end of this fuckedup mission painters boss closed his eyes and gave the smallest shake of his head utterly embarrassed and defeated on the screen the dogseye view showed a pair of trucks careening into the campsite guns silently blazing from their side windows despite the futility of the operation it wasnt over pm east africa time cal madow mountains somalia go for cover gray hollered he ran with tucker and kane away from the blasted ruins of the cabin black smoke swirled across the camp as flaming debris littered the ground and continued to drift down in flaming bits of tent fabric the thick pall of smoke offered them enough cover to make a break for the forest as two land rovers skidded into the camp from the road automatic fire sprayed from windows mostly directed back the way theyd come aiming for the others hidden in the forest a furious firefight continued back there likely his team had managed to ambush the third vehicle from the roadblock but that battle was still far from over before gray tucker and kane could reach the shelter of the forest their retreat was spotted gunfire ripped toward them kane yelped and sped faster tucker gave chasebut not before gray grabbed the mans rifle out of his fingers he swung it toward the rovers and fired cracking one of the side windows and forcing the shooter to duck go gray yelled to tucker make for the others gray ran to the side drawing fire one of the rovers fishtailed in the sandy soil and sped back toward the road intending to go to the aid of the embattled third truck the last rover circled the smoking ruins of the cabin coming around to face gray headon then a new noise cut through the peppering blasts the gunplay lulled for a breath as the others heard it too the thumpthump of a helicopter grew louder gray searched the skies knowing it was too soon for the seal team to arriveand he was right a familiar militarygray chopper rushed across the treetops coming from the direction of the main road it was the same attack helicopter that had laid waste to the unicef base it seemed all of the hens were returning to roost a whistling rocket screamed from the choppers undercarriage blazing a trail of fire and smoke it streaked down and slammed into the hood of the rover headed toward the forest the truck flipped endoverendthen exploded as it landed gray crouched stunned overhead gunfire chattered from the open door of the choppers rear cabin as it rushed past a familiar figure hung out the door pointing his weapon below captain trevor alden gray remembered his last view of the british soldier manning the turret of the ferret armored car guns blazing he must have somehow forced the chopper down and commandeered it for the british special forces then hed come looking for them a decision the captain might still regret the second rover which had braked to a stop with the arrival of the helicopter believing them allies gunned its engine and raced across the camp the chopper had to swing around twisting in midair to bring its rockets to bear a soldier popped out of the rovers open sunroof hauling and balancing the black tube of a grenade launcher on his shoulder at such close range the shooter could not miss gray lifted his rifle but the rover zigzagged crazily across the fiery camp hed never hit the soldier holding the launcher but he found something that wasnt moving the second barrel of kerosene blasted free by the explosion lay on its side in a pool of leaking oil the rover its driver focused above sped toward itor at least close enough gray couldnt trust firing into the barrel itself despite what had been portrayed in movies such shots seldom caused an explosion instead he needed to light the barrels wick cocking his eye to the scope he fired into a neighboring smoking section of floor planking the wood exploded and rained fiery slivers across the pool of kerosene flames flared where they landed and chased across the oils surface aiming for the leaking barrel the rover then sped across and blocked his view had he timed it the explosion blew a fireball into the sky and shoved the truck to the side flaming oil blasted through the open windows setting fire to everything screams rang out a door fell open revealing the hell inside then the stockpile of grenades exploded within the cabin shattering apart the rover gray ducked the helicopter dove away churning through the smoke straightening back up gray realizedafter his ears stopped ringingthat all the gunfire had ended he turned and saw kowalski and seichan enter the camp from the road shouldering the thin form of jain between them the trio must have dispatched the last truck on their own but not without a cost the major limped on one leg the other bled fiercely shes shot kowalski bellowed jain frowned up at him im fine its your bloody body odor that might kill me before this little scratch still alden must have witnessed the injury to his teammate the chopper tilted to the side and sought a safe place to land tucker also returned from the forest with his dog gray noted the eye of the camera facing him his satellite phone was likely melted to slag inside the ruins of his smoldering shoulder pack the sting of the burn along his back flared as he searched the debris he needed to communicate with painter this couldnt wait but the director had warned him that the audio pickup was crap on the dogs video feed gray could not let this next message be misconstrued he found a piece of tent fabric burned at the edges and used the tip of a charred stick to write a short note he prayed it reached painter am est washington dc smoke obscured most of the view of the fiery camp there was little else to see on the video especially as the helicopter landed stirring up a whirlwind of debris painter wasnt the only one to realize the same the defense secretary still stood beside robert gant with a hand on the mans shoulder go duncan said this is over bobby join your family they need you now more than we do robert continued to stare at the monitor but painter suspected he didnt see anything lost in the depths of the tragedy finally a rattling sigh escaped him he stared at painter but the fire there had snuffed out in his eyes leaving only a dull grief he looked a decade older than his sixtysix years he simply patted duncans side and exited without a word but the defense secretary was not done he pointed at painters boss his voice stonecold i would have a word with you general metcalf in private i understand metcalf cast painter a withering glance the two men exited but not before duncan poked a finger into painters chest i want a report on my desk within the hour he waved to the monitor and a copy of this feed i want a full accounting of this tragedy every detail on how this all went to hell the two men exited leaving painter alone in the conference room on the monitor the smoke cleared grays face swelled into the camera his lips moved but the audio was still down then gray stepped back and lifted a bit of burned fabric into view he had written something on it as painter read the scribbled words he stumbled forward in disbelief he caught himself on the edge of the table how could this be he stared toward the door ready to run out to call the others back he even took a step in that directionthen stopped his mind working furiously running various permutations through his head he covered his mouth with his hand there remained too many variables too much unknown and unexplained the truth revealed on the screen was too valuable to release without thought but it was also a cruelty beyond words to remain silent still he slowly turned to the table picked up the remote control and switched off the monitor he would have to edit away this last bit of video before he handed it off to warren duncan he stared at the dark monitor judging if he was capable of doing this but his job was to make the hard decisions no matter who got hurt and this was one of the hardest he pictured teresa dissolving into despair and grief he heard again her scream of denial her railing against what could not be true in the end the first lady had been right though the monitor was off grays last message still burned in his minds eye god forgive me no one must know july pm east africa time airborne her senses returned like a bright light that slowly pooled outward watery at the edges she felt as if she were a swimmer rising from the depths of a black sea faces hovered over her voices spoke muffled and indistinct her throat hurt her tongue was dry which made it hard to swallow coming around a familiar voice said in a germanswiss accent she made out the severe blond bob the icy eyes petra the horror of her situation swelled through her again sharpening her senses as she surfaced into the cold hard reality of the moment another face leaned over her a bright light flashed into her eyes stinging searing into the back of her skull she shied away turning her head she lay in a shallow box cushioned all around she heard the drone of jet engines felt the vibration of flight pupillary response is good dr blake said shes tolerating the sedation well what about the fetus petra heartbeat and oxygenation continue to remain within normal parameters doctor with the wireless transmission from the fetal monitor around her midsection well be able to assess her condition from a distance after we land how long is the flight another three hours dr blakes face pulled away no need to revive her fully then for now keep her lightly sedated with a propofol drip we can send her deeper once were in final approach to land we should also allow at least fifteen minutes to secure the royal diplomatic seals around the coffin coffin amanda turned her watery focus to the pillowed sides of the box fear spiked through her youre right petra even with all the palms and wheels greased by our benefactors we dont want any trouble going through customs with the casket luckily everyone now believes shes dead dead blake continued so no one will be looking for her with everyone off our backs well finally have the time to deliver this baby safely in another couple of hours it will be good to wash the stink of the jungle off and return to a proper medical lab footsteps retreated im going to the cabin bar can i get you a drink water with a sliver of lime always the professional petra he scolded with an amused tone stop fretting well have the package delivered by nightfall then maybe youll relax petras face loomed larger her breath smelling of cinnamon and cigarette smoke ill relax once we have her fetus on the vivisection table at the lab i keep forgetting thats your specialty my dear i thought i was skilled with scalpel and forceps but you put me to shame with your ability to tease a body into so many perfect anatomical sections thats the easy part petra said straightening up of course a small laugh accompanied his words where you truly shine is how you keep those sections alive alive what did they mean what were they talking about amanda tried not to picture such a horror but it filled her head anyway she wanted to clamp her hands over her ears she had known her baby was under threatit was why she had fled the statesbut she never imagined anything as horrific as this it went beyond her worst nightmares i dont want to hear any more her silent plea was answered the creak of hinges rasped to the left a dark shadow rose and fell heavily over her shutting out all light and sound the lid of her coffin had been closed amanda shuddered in the blackness praying that this casket truly became her coffin that shed suffocate before they landed better that than allowing her baby boy to suffer the atrocities planned for him how you keep those sections alive those dismaying words haunted the darknessalong with an allconsuming question where are they taking me pm cal madow mountains somalia she was definitely being held at the camp here gray said holding the satellite phone to his ear reporting in to sigma command tuckers dog confirmed amandas scent before all hell broke loose his choice of words was appropriate he stared at the smoldering wreck of the cabin at the fiery remains of the two rovers his other teammates were making sure no other enemy combatants remained a threat captain aldens helicopter rested across the way engine idling rotors turning slowly a british medic from aldens rescue crew worked on jains leg kowalski looked on concerned despite the differences in size and gender the pair were two peas out of the same pod a scary proposition a female kowalski gray had retrieved the satellite phone from the big mans pack he didnt know if painter had received his frantic handwritten note and wanted to follow up as quickly as possible but why do you want to keep amandas survival a secret gray asked questioning again the need for such a cruel deception i understand the fear of an intelligence leak but to keep the president and his family in the dark it must be killing them it is but the administrationif they suspect shes still alivewill insist on bringing all forces to bear in finding her and look how that turned out this time around for amandas sake weve got to restrict this knowledge to as few ears as possible gray took a deep breath it was a ballsy move on the directors part but it made brutal sense especially in light of his own suspicions he shared them with painter director im almost certain that events here were purposefully staged to make it look like amanda was killed why do you think that painter asked the woman in the bed she was blond the same size and body shape as amanda from the distension of the uterus and belly she was obviously once pregnant possibly an equal number of weeks along but more incriminating when i removed the oxygen mask i saw her mouth was a bloody ruin someone didnt want amandas dental records pulled to identify the charred remains painter remained silent digesting the information even the rushed csection suggests the same conclusion gray said i think they feared any fetal remains might not match those on record from amandas prenatal exams painters voice grew hushed at the horror of it all so they cut out the baby exactly and disposed of it to cover their tracks i also smelled an accelerant soaked into the bed i think thats what the last soldier was doing here prepping the remains they wanted to assure the body was burned so thoroughly that no dna could be extracted but we caught them off guard before they could complete their task why would amandas kidnappers go through such effort painter asked but it sounded more like he was pondering the question thinking out loud still gray answered they obviously wanted to throw off anyone still looking for her if the world thinks shes dead the hunt ends here true but i fear our enemy is even smarter than that what do you mean think about it they knew you were closing in forcing their hand they had to move her but they turned the situation to their own ends staging amandas deathbut also achieving another goal grays mind raced alongside the directors line of reasoning he knew everything that had befallen painter at the white house he suddenly understood the enemy was able to blame amandas death on our operation at least partially as gray considered who might have such an end goal his blood went cold there was only one organization harboring such a vendetta against sigma director are you suggesting the guild is somehow involved in amandas kidnapping gray felt his vision narrowing picturing his mothers casket lowering into the cold dirt commander pierce we dont know that for certain but either way it gives sigma a black eyeif not a fatal blow gray knew that had been an ultimate goal of the guild for years they had tried multiple times to destroy sigma once even leading an assault upon their headquarters he closed his eyes have i played right into their hands here done their work for them this time what are we going to do gray asked your mission objective remains the same to find amanda thats all that matters at the moment gray choked down the anger that flared inside him he forced his fingers through his hair triggering a twinge of complaint from his blistered back the director was correct he had to stay on mission which meant answering one allimportant question concerning amanda where to begin looking for her painter voiced the same question were you able to get any clue from inside the cabin anything that might point to where they were taking amanda gray stared at the smoking pile of debris we didnt have any time she could be anywhere painter let out a long sighnot in defeat but in renewed determination then we start from scratch were not giving up ill see what i can do at my end you and captain alden canvass any locals in the area someone must know something in the rush to evacuate something might have fallen through the cracks gray agreed the enemy clearly hadnt expected his team to arrive at the camp so quicklyif at all pierce the call came from tucker he turned and found the man waving to him from the road that exited the camp tucker stepped aside to allow a small figure to run into view it was baashi gray had last seen the boy diving into the forest after almost getting shot seichan had gone out to look for him she appeared steps behind him dragging a prisoner with her clutching him by the shirt collar as he stumbled alongside her gray spoke into the phone director ill call you back in a few minutes we may have caught a break signing off he strode over to the group captain alden headed over there too seichan met grays eyes as he reached her i found baashi leading this kid back out of the forest heading our way baashi vigorously nodded i tell him you all good tucker looked pale its the same boy i jumped earlier by the creek gray saw he was right it was the child tucker had strangled and hogtied so the bound boy had been discovered by the enemy no wonder the crew had hightailed it back to camp kid mustve fled during our attack on the third truck seichan said but baashi tracked him in the woods and convinced him we were okay from his wide scared eyes the new boy must be wondering if hed made the right decision mr trevor baashi burst out brightly and ran to meet the british captain as he joined them he patted alden on the chest and spoke to the other boy this the man i tell you about seeing the confused look on the captives face baashi repeated what he said in somali then he stepped over like an excited tour guide and patted kane too ending with he good dog gray sidled next to alden during all of this see if baashi could ask the boy if he knows where amanda was taken ill do my best gray had to wait while a fervid series of exchanges commenced it involved a lot of backandforth and not a few suspicious glances cast his way finally the boy seemed to relent pointing this way and that he spoke briskly in somali alden eventually straightened and rejoined gray it seems like with baashi people are willing to speak more openly around a child he overheard some of the medical staff at the camp talking making preparations to move the young woman to an airfield used by drugrunners he says he heard them speak of flying to dubai but i dont know if thats just a stopover or a final destination because he also said theyre planning to go to heaven to go to heaven what did that mean was it some sort of suicide pact that didnt sound like the enemyand certainly not the guild alden must have read his confusion and shrugged he had no better explanation still grays mood lightened at least dubai gives us a solid place to start looking to hopefully pick up her trail again alden stared over at jain on a stretcher one pant leg cut away good luck commander ill see to the boys here he motioned to baashi and the other kid in the meantime the thumping of a helicopter cut him off drawing his attention skyward i believe thats your seal team the captain said a bit late to the bloody party but they can help secure the area id suggest you and your team borrow that helo of mine clear out before too many questions get asked before that gray started about amanda alden winked at him i heard she died here a real tragedy so the good captain had already perceived as painter had that amandas best chance of survival lay in everyone continuing to believe that lie thats what ill be reporting to my superiors thank you gray said and shook the mans hand grasping his forearm with the other no thanks needed mate if it wasnt for your quick thinking there wouldve been more casualties at that unicef camp including possibly my own men with matters settled gray drew his group together and hurried toward the idling chopper he wanted to be out of here before the seals clamped things down the seal team was under orders to retrieve the charred body to return the supposed remains of the presidents daughter back to the statesnot a duty he would wish on anyone he called painter again reported what hed learned and coordinated logistics on their next move were pulling up stakes here gray said any intelligence kat can gather while were en route would help us hit the ground running once were wheelsdown in dubai city understood ill put a team on it but ive got kat working another angle gray paused as everyone loaded into the helicopter tucker lifted his dog what other angle as painter explained his worry that all of this bloodshed and terror somehow involved amandas unborn child gray pictured the brutality of the cesarean performed on the anonymous woman her body charred beyond recognition in his gut gray knew the director was correct this was all about the baby as he signed off and strapped into his seat aboard the chopper another concern nagged him it also centered on amanda and her child gray couldnt escape the sense that painter had been withholding something from him the directors decision to keep amandas survival a secret from her own parents never sat right with him painter was certainly a master chess player and could be coldhearted and tough when he had his back against the wallbut never this callous his explanation felt forced like there was something he didnt want to share about amanda or her family but what could it be with a roar of its engines the helicopter slowly rose from the ruins of the camp stirring smoke and ash leaving the horrors below he might not know what gambit painter was playingbut he knew one thing for certain this was just the beginning much worse was still to come am est washington dc robert gant stepped through the air lock and entered the class clean room a stark white chamber with glass walls that looked out into the rest of the genomics lab staffed only by three researchers the entire facility lay in an industrial area on the outskirts of alexandria virginia and was listed as a private dna test lab but that was not its purpose its true function had been etched into one of the glass walls of the clean room a frosted cross decorated with spirals of dna along its crosspieces show me he said using the deep baritone that served him well in the past as a us ambassador and now as secretary of state he allowed some of his irritation to ring out hed left jimmy and teresa to their grief to attend to private family business but he wanted to keep this visit as short as possible the researcher dr emmet fieldingdecked out in white coveralls gloves boots and hooddrew him to a laboratory table a sealed crystal cylinder about the size and shape of a hockey puck held a murky aquamarine fluid beside it on the table rested a titanium sculpture that looked like a clawless crab supported by six articulated legs its flat metal carapace measured a foot across reminding robert of the land mines that still peppered southeast asia where hed spent the bulk of his ambassadorship fielding lifted the cylinder from the table and held it in the palm of his hand this is the latest generation he said proudly half a million neurons harvested from human fetal cortical tissue to form this new brain and once implanted it will communicate via five thousand microelectrodes a fourfold improvement from the last generation and a huge advance from where this all started this was roberts pet project he had learned of the first tentative steps taken by the university of reading in england back in a researcher in neurorobotics discovered that a handful of neurons collected from the cortex of lab rats and grown in a culture medium could be wired into a small wheeled robot and through electrode stimulation it could control and operate the tiny vehicle learning over time as new synapses formed to avoid objects and work through mazes shortly thereafter another scientist at the university of florida upped the ante wiring twentyfive thousand rat neurons to a flight simulator over time that tiny brain learned to fly a jet flawlessly through mountains and thunderstorms years later utilizing the familys financial and technological resources robert had moved that bar much higher initially the research had been folded into a larger project one going back decades investigating the fusion of man and machine as a means of extending lifea goal sought by the bloodline for centuries but this research into cyborg technology proved to be a dead end it became clear that it would never be a feasible means of sustaining or prolonging life especially with the more promising advent of stemcell research at that point in time the bloodline turned its eye in a new direction forsaking the macro world of robotics for the micro world of genetics but even robert didnt have full access to that newest venture instead hed been left to oversee this older project neurorobotics still showed the potential to be a lucrative new weapons technology for the military if rat brains could fly jet planes years ago why not something more ambitious for the battlefield of the future let me give you a demonstration of the hexapod fielding said the researcher opened the titanium carapace of the metal crab exposing the microelectronics inside he seated the neural cylinder into the electrode base at the heart of the pod and secured everything in place next he carried the device to a neighboring chamber in the clean room it had been set up as a test mazebut this was no ordinary flat puzzle this labyrinth filled the entire tenbyten chamber rising through fifteen levels of tunnels chutes and spirals i ran the hexapod through this maze once already today now watch fielding inserted the crablike machine through a lower slot sealed the door and used a bluetooth device to activate it tiny green lights flared along a groove that ran around the periphery of the hexapods carapace titanium legs stretched and tapped robert leaned closer unimpressed why isnt it the creature shot away dancing on its six legs gaining speed until it was a silvery blur it sped through the maze with unerring accuracy no doubling back to correct a wrong turn it had remembered the complex path through the maze perfectly im estimating the new brains neural intelligence is about that of your average canine fielding said proudly a halfminute later the hexapod reached the exit platform near the top skidding to a stop robert grinned impressive fielding matched that expression thrilled at the rare praise he reached to the door and unlatched it before he could swing it open the hexapod rammed forward it burst out and latched its legs onto the researchers forearm the sharppointed legs dug into his flesh blood seeped through his white coveralls motherf fielding yelled and hit the bluetooth controller powering down the hexapod still he had to return to the table and manually pry each leg out of his arm to get it to release the aggression of this newest generation is also through the roof fielding said wincing and nursing his bloody arm as proof id say weve engineered the equivalent of a limbic region of the mammalian brain the lizard intelligence buried beneath the cortex driven by base needs for survival for a battlefield weapon thats not an undesirable trait true and speaking of battlefields you promised a field trial of the latest hexapods thats why i came all the way down here in person of course i have a monitor set up over here with live feed from the lodge everythings ready theyve been waiting for the green light robert followed fielding to a fiftytwoinch hd monitor the screen was subdivided into sections each offering a different birdseye view of a remote and isolated patch of woodland hills hundreds of miles away the centermost square showed a small concrete bunker sticking out of a meadow like a giant anthill a metal door sealed it shut if youre ready fielding said get on with it robert snapped fielding spoke into a cell phone moments later the metal door burst open and a woman was shoved outside she wore a hospital gown and nothing else she stumbled to her knees shielding her eyes against the midday sun robert absently wondered how long it had been since the young woman had seen actual sunlight from the way she jumped and glanced back to the door someone must have barked at her theyre telling her to run if she wants to live robert frowned not appreciating the sadism this was an experiment not a bloody sport and should be conducted as such the subject took off for the forest at a dead run there fielding pointed to movement through the grasses a dozen arrows aiming for the fleeing woman a pair split off zipping away faster intending to flank her look how theyre patternswarming i employed a new wireless communications system and linked the individual hexapods to one another allowing them to function as a group or pack look how quickly theyre learning robert watchedhalfaghast halfexcited the woman made it to the edge of the woods but she must have heard the hunters she looked over a shoulder and the horror of what she saw tripped her feet she fell to her knees her mouth open in a silent scream then the hunters reached her it did not take long fielding held his chin in one hand appraising the trial the new battlefield modifications of the pods seem to be working as engineered the circular blades the razored leg flanges all performed flawlessly i may want to tinker with the digging spades see if i can get them to burrow better ive seen enough robert said straightening and stepping away fielding followed him with your approval id like to move the testing forward into the larger quadruped line that would be fine fielding pressed him but id need a few more test subjects something more challenging robert pictured the macerated remains of the woman on the screen im sure we can find them somewhere second heaven and hell july am est charleston south carolina captain kathryn bryant had come to sell her body she stepped off the crosstown bus into the steamy swelter of a charleston summer her worn sneakers crunched in the gravel at the shoulder of the road she pulled on a pair of cheap sunglasses purchased at the airport against the glare of the sun but they did nothing for the heat ninety degrees with ninety percent humidity i thought washingtons summers were bad in a feeble attempt to compensate shed gathered her long auburn hair into a ponytail and wore a ball cap to shade her face she also wore a pair of light shorts and a nondescript loose blouse no bra finishing her appearance as a downonherluck woman looking for a little extra money the bus pulled away with a choking cough of diesel fumes she followed in its wake the north charleston fertility clinic rose two blocks ahead the complex covered a full city block set amid a small park of towering oaks and palmettos the rest of the neighborhood was a mix of commercial businesses and trailer parks she was not unfamiliar with the area having spent a few months while in service at the naval weapons station which hugged the cooper river three miles away as she headed toward the clinic she slipped out her cell phone to keep a promise the phone was a disposable tied to her alias she connected her call through sigma to ensure it couldnt be traced if anyone tried to pull the luds the phone records would only discover a call placed to a local pawnshop the line clicked and a gruff voice answered so youre still alive her husband monk did his best to make it sound like a joke but she heard the undercurrent of tension in his voice he hadnt been thrilled shed taken this assignment but he understood the necessity for the moment she replied with a smile im just heading toward the clinic you give them hell her smile widened thats the plan she pictured monk at their apartment balancing one of their babies on his knee he was not what most women would consider handsome with his shaved head and stocky but muscular physique but he still could make her melt with his smile and shed never met a man with a bigger heart a heart that only grew larger with each addition to the household did you give harriet her second bottle she asked an exasperated sigh followed yes dear and i went to costco and got the pampers you go save the world ive got things covered here she had hoped her call would erase that edge of apprehension hiding behind his jovial banter but it only seemed to make it worse monk im almost at the clinic give penny and harriet a kiss for me done and ill save what ive got for you until you get home ah always my gallant knight she said sarcasticallybut it was forced because he was her knight and always would be his voice grew husky just get back here safely i promise youd better im holding you to it after she hung up the world seemed slightly less bright a twinge of guilt plagued her as she pocketed her phone what am i doing here i should be at home still she could not discount the electric thrill that coursed through her as she reached the grounds of the clinic and turned her attention to the task at hand it happened with every mission she had a duty and she was good at what she did and knowing her family was safeand always would be with monkhelped steady her he was her rock even hundreds of miles away with renewed determination she crossed along the tall stackedstone fence of the clinic and stepped through the wroughtiron gates entering a garden oasis set amidst the surrounding commercial parks a path led alongside the entry road winding through manicured hedgerows small burbling fountains and perfumed beds of blushpink roses someone had gone to great expense to make the clinic feel warm and inviting a veritable garden of eden where dreams of infertile couples could not help but come true no wonder this place drew celebrity clients and people from around the globeincluding the presidents daughter then again the complex was owned by a subsidiary of a gant family enterprise one dedicated to biotech and genetic engineering the clinic established in the early eighties was the end result of much of that research offering the latest innovations to the public the clinic also employed its own research protocols drawing reproductive scientists from as far away as japan the place continued to be at the forefront of fertility studies and stemcell research over the past eighteen hours kat had investigated the clinic extensivelyfrom its staffing and clientele down to its latest tax filings she knew everything about the clinic where they got their bed linens the average weight of their hazardous waste material per day the deeper she delved the more certain she grew that the reason for amandas kidnapping lay hidden somewhere within the four buildings that made up this facility this conviction came not from anything she uncoveredbut from what she didnt after a full decade gathering global intelligence she had developed a nose for when something was being hidden from her during her investigation she had reached too many dead ends that made no sense certain matters that didnt balance in her head worst of all she stumbled across an impenetrable corporate firewall at one point employing encryption algorithms that were militarygrade even if she could she feared smashing through it the act alone could set off too many alarm bells alerting the powers that be at the clinic that someone was sniffing at their door so she opted for a more direct approach on foot she reached the parking lot and spotted the rental car a silver audi a sedan lisa cummings had beaten her here but her friend hadnt had to navigate through two bus transfers from the airport to reach the clinic they had come separately each with her own mission kat climbed the steps to a wide porch that fronted the main building it looked nothing like a medical facility the fa√ßade was typical for charleston a georgian stone mansion with wroughtiron railings three floors of balconies and a gambrel roof covered by mossyfringed slate tiles she stepped through the doors into an airconditioned main lobby refreshing after the hot bus ride and short walk a reception desk beckoned she approached it noting out of the corner of her eye that lisa sat in the waiting area a space as sumptuously furnished as would be expected from the exterior decked out in velvets and overstuffed cushions lisa matched the d√©cor in a handsome st john platinum dress with a drawstring waist her blond hair hung loose and shone under the soft lights her makeup was flawless she came posing as the private doctor for a select washingtonian clientele coming to interview the clinic for possible referrals for her patients she had an appointment to meet with the head of the facility in a few minutes lisa was conducting this cursory investigation from the top down kat was taking the other extreme how may i help you the receptionist asked she was a small woman with large eyes made even more prominent by her harsh eye shadow kat moved closer to the desk pressing against it leaning a bit too forward as if trying to keep the conversation from being overheard i heard someone told me that you all are looking for donors the receptionists brows pinched in irritation kat pushed even closer glancing surreptitiously over her shoulder raising an embarrassed blush to her cheeks you know looking for a womans eggs i heard you pay good money the receptionist sat straighter her voice growing hushed if not a touch condescending made worse by the patronizing tone of her carolina accent hon thats handled elsewhere this is for patient intake if youll stand over there she waved a manicured hand away from the waiting area toward a corner ill have one of the staff assistants come fetch you and bring you to the donor facility if thats all right kat nodded and slunk back thank you the woman made a noncommittal noise and picked up the phone as kat retreated to her corner she met lisas gaze at the moment they were divided by a cultural and financial gulf lisa represented the end buyer kat embodied the product to be sold there continued to be much ethical and moral debate about the sale of human ova once a price tag was put upon such a commodity it became tied to the power of supply and demandand the inherent abuse in much of the third world entire villages now sold kidneys or became surrogate mothers selling rental space in their wombs it was called the red marketthe wholesale buying and selling of body partsand it was a booming business both legally and illegally she had read a report of bolivian murderers who sought out victims to sell their fat to european beauty supply companies in china prisons were harvesting the organs of dead inmates gutting them out with whispers that some prisoners were being purposefully killed for profit and in one case in nepal a dairy farmer had turned from delivering milk to supplying blood he captured local hikers imprisoned them in his barn and repeatedly drained his new livestock of their blood keeping them forever at the edge of death worst of all such a marketplace moved in only one economic direction from the poor to the rich it was an unfortunate side effect when a price tag was placed on organs inevitably flesh moved only up the social ladder never down movement across the room drew kats attention a mahogany door opened and a ruggedlooking man in his midforties stepped into the waiting room he had jetblack hair stood six feet tall and was decked out in a kneelength white lab coat over expensive navyblue trousers a crisp white shirt and a crimson tie his smile was overly broad as he approached lisa who stood to greet him welcome to ncfc he said and shook her hand it was dr paul cranston head of the clinic kat knew everything about him even his social security number and where his passport had last been stamped new zealand he led lisa out of the waiting room and into the inner sanctum of the facility as that door closed another opened a man likely a hospital orderly stood at the threshold of a doorway neighboring the front desk he looked like a pit bull in scrubs the receptionist beckoned to kat she stepped forward if youll follow me the man grunted not bothering with her name she hurried forward but stopped at the reception desk to grab a business card she fumbled and purposefully knocked the holder off the counter and onto the reception desk im so sorry she said reaching over to help collect the scattered cards the receptionist sighed heavily and picked a few cards off the floor by her chair kat used the moment to slip the ballpoint pen palmed in her hand into the receptionists cup it held a tiny camera that recorded audio and video passively to a micro sd chip a small antenna allowed burst transmissions of the saved data with the pinged call from a cell phone she had four more pens in her purse with the goal of strategically placing them in key locations throughout the facilityor at least where she could reach without raising an alarm if given the chance it would be easy for a confused girl to get lost in here and wander where she didnt belong but first she had a role to play just go the receptionist said and pointed to the side door kat apologized meekly and followed the orderly waiting for her he led her out of the world of gardens and velvets and into a sterile environment of vinyl floors and stark white walls here was the hospital hidden behind the fa√ßade sparse and utilitarian they eventually reached and entered a short enclosed walkway that connected the main building to a more drab structure at the back of the grounds as she marched she noted each of the four clinic wings was connected in a similar manner it seemed there was no need to leave the airconditioned splendor for the summer heat she also eyed the windowed walls to either side the glass was thick appeared bulletproof then again the clinics clientele were often celebrities or foreign dignitaries maybe the extra protection was necessary still a chill that had nothing to do with the airconditioning swept through her the space felt less protective than it was imprisoning they entered the next building and kat was taken to a small examination room one of a long row of them in this wing the orderly handed her a series of forms to fill out secured on a clipboard fill everything out someone will be in to talk to you in a few minutes he left looking as bored as when hed first collected her she began to fill out the forms when she heard a small click at the door stepping forward she tested the handle locked she frowned fighting back a flicker of panic securing the door might be protocol to maintain confidentiality either way she was committed shed have to keep playing her handbut something was definitely wrong about this place she hoped lisa was faring better pm as you can see we do all of our work inhouse dr paul cranston said stopping before a window that looked into a sealed in vitro fertilization lab lisa studied the space with a critical eye the room was stateofthe art with enclosed workstations equipped with laser oocyte scanners and narishige micromanipulators for egg fertilization nothing was substandard from makler counting chambers to automatic spermanalyzers advanced warming blocks and cryogenic chambers her guided tour had already included the surgical suite used for both egg collection and embryo implantation the clinics hightech operating theater would put most hospitals to shame even the neighboring recovery rooms were private spaces that could have graced the pages of architectural digest with fine linens subdued lighting and tasteful decorations clearly this tour was meant to impress and it did we are a onestop shop cranston finished offering a beaming selfeffacing smile from sperm and egg collection to fertilization and implantation we do all of our own patient monitoring but were certainly happy to work in collaboration with a primary care physician lisa nodded im sure some of my clients would prefer the anonymity of care outside the dc circles understood his eyes lingered a bit too long on her plainly he desired to know more about whom she represented but he knew better than to inquire directly lisas ironclad cover had been built to draw the personal interest of the clinics head and obviously succeeded she had been given the grand tour along with the fullcourt sales press why dont we return to my office i can supply you with brochures detailing each level of service including fact sheets containing our success rates and of course ill be happy to answer any other questions that would be perfect she checked her watch in a move to urge him to hurry along i wont take up much more of your time his office was up a level from the workspaces it was like walking into a mahogany library with bookshelflined walls trophies and framed diplomas including one from harvard his alma mater like the rest of the tour the room was also designed to impress huge arched windows overlooked the parklike grounds with views to the other three buildings that made up the complex cranston circled around his desk where a prepared binder was already waiting for her atop his leather desk blotter he handed it toward her but she ignored it focusing her attention out the window she also kept a keen eye on his reactions besides a medical degree she had earned a masters in physiology she understood bodily responses and could read them as accurately as most lie detectorsbut unlike those detectors she also knew how to manipulate those responses for a desired result now to get to work what happens in those other buildings she asked he lowered the binder and followed her gaze outside the wing directly behind this one is for donor evaluation and collection lisa eyed the threestory structure that must be where kat is the other two buildings are strictly for research he said we run reproductive studies for a dozen different universities including as far away as the university of tokyo and oxford she turned her back to the window im assuming that any biological specimens eggs or embryos from my patients wouldnt be used for such purposes without their consent of course not we have a robust donor program that supplies such material let me assure you dr cummings our research programs and patient services are completely separate there is no crossover very good lisa returned to the chair in front of his wide desk and sank into the seat shifting her purse into her lap now let me be frank with you dr cranston please call me paul she smiled giving him that much paul i must be honest that i have been considering other facilities its come down to here or a clinic outside of philadelphia of course he kept an even demeanor but she did not mistake the flicker of desireto poach another client was even better than merely to win one that was the bait but i assure you he continued youll find no other facility with the level of technological advancement the latest tools and the professional staff to oversee each stage of the process cranston definitely wanted her imaginary highprofile client listbut how badly first to let some slack in the line intended to unnerve him i understand and appreciate that paul but philadelphia is also much closer to dc i must take that convenience into account my clients time is very important he looked crestfallen i cant argue with that now to dangle hope but your clinic has one distinct advantage beyond your stellar medical reputation you have an unmatched social reputation an excellent pedigree if you will how so amanda gantbennett the edges of his eyelids grew more strained at the mention of amanda several of my patients are well acquainted with the first family she continued they know of the delicate situation regarding the presidents daughter and how matters were handled at your clinic in many ways washington is a small town she offered him a modest smile he echoed itthe desired effect one patient of mine in particular is faced with a similar situation an infertile husband she asked me to specifically inquire into your donor program to put it bluntly using my patients words if its good enough for the presidents daughter its good enough for me she rolled her eyes feigning amused disdain in certain washingtonian circleswhether its the latest purse or the seasons designer fashionsname brands are all that matter and this even extends to the choice of medical facility and in this case even the preference of donor he gave her an understanding nod and steepled his fingers under his chin there is of course no way to divulge who was the male donor in this situation but i can guarantee you that each of our donors must pass the most thorough and exacting background check and evaluation each is ranked on several criteria physical appearance iq medical history ethnic background and many others and if someone wanted to pick a donor of let us say equal criteria as the presidents daughter his smile grew steadier as he discovered a way to win her over it was human nature to almost have something in ones grasp then suddenly lose it only made the desire to win it back that much stronger it was why gambling was so addictive im sure that could be arranged he said wed hate to lose you im sure you would wonderful she rewarded him with a genuine smile of delight and would it be possible to obtain a list and description of such donors something tangible i can present to my client as they say the proof is in the pudding cranston swung to his computer certainly if you can give me a few minutes she settled back into her chair painter wanted that shortened list of donors a way to narrow down the number of potential biological fathers for amandas unborn child but he also needed a way to turn the anonymity of those donors into real names that meant gaining access to clinic records as cranston worked lisa snapped open her purse and pretended to check her phone she pressed a button on it as instructed by painter then slipped the thin device into the seat cushions of her chair using her purse to hide her actions the phone had a wireless microrouter built into it allowing sigma to link and hack into the clinics server painter had tried to explain it in more detail but electronic engineering was not her specialty all she knew was to follow his instructions wait until cranston had logged into the computer and used his password then activate the wireless router and leave it running nearby she clicked her purse closed her work here was done it seemed too easy but then again it was supposed to be painter had described the mission here as a soft infiltration rather than a fullfrontal storming of the gates kat and lisas only goal was to leave a trail of electronic bread crumbs listening devices cameras wireless taps most of the tools had been engineered by painter made for easy concealment and minimal signature but anything can be detected given enough time painter had warned so the second part of this mission was not to loiter and she obeyed that now in short order she had everything she needed from dr cranston including the binder of brochures and information he walked her back to the lobby left her with promises to keep in touch and she soon found herself back under the swelter of the midday sun she headed over and climbed into her audi sedan a luxurious rental to match her cover though her part of the mission was complete a knot of tension remained in her neck the plan was for kat to meet her back at their hotel in downtown charleston she would be relieved only when they were rejoined from there the electronic devices could do all the spying for them she swung her sedan out of the parking lot and onto the street still worried about kat feeling guilty for abandoning her partner her only reassurance kat was a pro nothing fazed her pm what the hell is going on here pacing the small exam room kat checked the clock on her disposable phone it had been over an hour since she first walked through the clinics front door she shouldve been in and out by now she had completed the sheaf of paperwork and handed it to the same orderly who marched her here and locked her in the room hed told her to sit tight that the initial approval process could take some time and that it wasnt all paperwork a doctor will be in to do a pelvic exam and ultrasound in a few minutes you will be paid a small stipend now in order to draw your blood and collect a urine sample within five business days you will be informed by phone whether youre selected as a donor this was all related in a bored monotone as if hed repeated the same speech a hundred times each day and maybe he did through the walls she heard other men and women coming and going doors opening and closing along the long exam hallway she had hoped to get a cursory tour of the donation center to plant another pen camera here maybe even attempt to reach the other two research buildings that didnt seem likely unless she was bolder she stepped to the secured door she had a lock pick incorporated into the sole of her right shoe and a folded combat blade hidden in her left but her escape out of a locked room would be hard to explain if she was caught later there was an easier way she knocked loudly and raised a plaintive lilt to her call hello i need to use the bathroom can someone help me please it didnt take long for the door to be unlocked she expected to see the same orderly as beforebut instead it was a whitesmocked doctor a svelte woman with gray eyes the orderly hovered behind her holding a tray with a rack of vacuum tubes for blood collection and an array of syringes the only warning of trouble one of the syringes was full before she could react the doctor stepped forward and jammed a black wand against her stomach the snap of electricity was loud in the small space agony shot through her body centered on her belly contracting her abdominal muscles her limbs betrayed her and she toppled to the side a slim edge away from a full convulsion anticipating this the doctor caught her and lowered her to the floor the orderly closed the door and came around her other side syringe in hand even through the electric pain she felt the needle jab in her neck her vision began to immediately close down kat fought against it wondering how her cover could have been blown shed been so thorough to craft her alias as a shiftless transient with no familial or local ties nothing that could be easily verified or tracked back to her unfortunately that proved her undoing she seems in better than average shape the doctor said to the orderly examining kat as if she were a prized pig at a county fair unusual feel this muscle tone i dont see any track marks on her arm or signs of chronic drug use youre sure she met the standard protocol everything checked out dr marshall she just moved here no job no family changed cities three times in the past year before coming here gainesville atlanta now charleston no one to miss her kats world folded and closed over her their conversation followed her into oblivion then its perfect timing i received a message from the lodge a short time ago theyre demanding more research subjects kat felt her body lifted by the muscular orderly the lodge he asked do you know what they do up there trust me you dont want to know july pm gulf standard time dubai city uae gray stood before the hotel windows and stared out at the jeweled nightscape of dubais skyline an emerald oasis perched between the desert and the blue sea towers and cloudscraping spires blazed with lights rising from a modern mecca of huge malls hotels and trendy residential complexes all wired and connected by ribbons of flowing neon of every fathomable hue the panorama looked less like a city and more like a glowing circuit board buzzing with the electricity of the entire region it seemed impossible that five hours ago hed been in a country devastated by war famine and drought a land ruled as much by pirates as any government now he floated above a miracle grown at a blistering pace dubai had risen like a mirage out of the desert with the crown jewel being burj khalifa over two hundred stories high the tallest skyscraper in the world appearing like a thin mountain pinnacle at the edge of the sea architects from around the world continued to compete to construct the most aweinspiring designs seemingly with one common theme the defiance of nature and its elements within the city one could lounge on a sunbaked beach and an hour later be snowboarding down the slopes of the worlds largest indoor ski resort and if one wanted the best of both worlds the newly opened palazzo versace hotel had its own refrigerated beach to keep tourists cool while sunbathing but the greatest of the naturedefying projects lay beyond the beaches dubais famous manmade islands their hotel neighbored palm jumeirah an artificial archipelago in the shape of a palm tree so large it could be seen from space its trunk grew out from the mainland and burst forth with sixteen fronds all circled by a crescentshaped breakwater another two such islands were being constructed along the coastline multiplying the amount of dubai beachfront tenfold gray had read of other projects still in the works for dubai a twentysevenacre underwater hotel called hydropolis a germandesigned floating palace made entirely of ice fancifully named the blue crystal and even farther out to sea the partially completed deepsea island of utopia shaped like a starfish and sheltered by a breakwater crescent intended both as a tourist destination and a corporate enclave due to its unique isolation here in dubai nature held no sway against the lofty dreams of man you gotta try the shower pierce kowalski came out of the bathroom a towel wrapped around his waist they got jets that hit you in all the right placesand a few wrong ones it seemed the dreams of some men werent as lofty as others gray turned his back on the cityscape with his shoulders still blistered and sore a shower held no appeal at the moment maybe a long bath the group shared a twobedroom suite kowalski and gray had one room seichan the other tucker and kane staked out the couch in the common room equipped with a pool table a wet bar and a flatscreen television gray heard a bbc broadcast playing out there im going to see if tucker wants to lose a few bucks playing pool kowalski said and headed toward the door hauling on a robe and letting his wet towel fall to the floor gray stepped toward the bathroom there wasnt much else they could do except to continue waiting for an intelligence report from sigma command painter was gathering data on flights into and out of somalia comparing all routes that could bring amanda and her kidnappers to dubai he was also checking passenger manifests searching custom records specifically looking for faces that matched amandas in case someone tried to sneak her through with a fake passport he also had a team scouring security footage from dubai international airport gray didnt hold out much hope his team had already spent an hour at the airport tracking all the exits and baggage areas checking to see if kane could pick up her scent nothing maybe she never came hereor came and left but gray didnt think so and couldnt exactly say why it was more than a gut feelinglike something that beckoned at the edge of his awareness something he was missing in the bathroom he turned on the tubs tap tested the water and once satisfied he slowly peeled off his shirt pieces stuck to his shoulders pasted in place by his blistered skin with a groan he tugged the shirt off stripped out of the rest of his clothes and climbed into the tub it was wonderful agony to sink into the steaming heat he left the tap running letting the waterline climb up his belly he leaned forward hugging his knees carefully stretching the stiffened skin across his shoulders dear god gray your back looks horrible he twisted halfaround to face the open door seichan stood there her gaze not shying from his nakedness he was too tired to be selfconscious theyd both seen each other at their best and worst what was a little bare skin he turned off the flowing tap im fine what is it youre not fine why didnt you tell someone your burn was this bad im getting the med pack here she stepped forward and passed him the satellite phone call from sigma he took the phone director gray i just wanted to give you an update while i have a spare moment he sat higher in the tub any leads no im afraid not weve searched every record and videotape from dubai international i can find no evidence that amanda ever passed through there ill keep monitoring the airport and inbound manifests but ive also expanded the search for flights out of the city we have to take into account that she may have already been moved if thats the case were not likely to ever find her at least not alive ill keep looking painter said but for now well keep your team onsite even if she has shipped out it might not have been far and i want you and the others close by understood gray signed off as seichan returned she took the phone set it aside then tapped the edge of the tub up here back to me she opened the combat med kit and pulled out a tube of burn cream and waterjel tactical dressing i dont need you to i could get kowalski to do it but i dont think either of you would like that he sighed heavily pulled out of the bathwater and balanced on the lip of the tub she patted his skin dry with great care from the corner of his eye he caught her reflection in the mirror she rubbed the cream between her palms and placed them against his heated skin the balms cooling agent sank deep into his flesh outlining each of her fingers a small moan escaped him am i hurting you no he said more huskily than he intended her hands spread outward washing away the worst of his pain he stretched his back loosening his shoulders even further his breathing grew heavier deeper as she worked his eyelids drifted closed she remained silent he heard only her breath sighing in and out fingers rode up to his neckline and down his spine he found himself leaning back into her touchand not just because of the cooling effect of the balm in fact warmth was returning to his skin but not from the burn it rose from a fire deeper inside his body responded but he didnt bother to hide it not that he could gray he heard the need in her voice that matched his own he reached back and caught one of her hands he held it poised between pulling her closer or pushing her away trapped between heaven and hell her fingers soft and silky trembled in his palm like a bird fluttering to escape not this time his hand tightened on hers making a decision at last he chose heaven as he drew her arm around him twisting to face her their lips brushing against one anotherthen he suddenly knew the truth he froze with shock gray what is it he tilted back his eyes widening as his certainty grew i know where amanda is pm you should keep walking dr blake said supporting her by the elbow it can help the baby get into a better position amanda shambled down a featureless white hallway she had no idea where she was nor the time of day shed woken in a windowless hospital room four hours ago the medical team had performed another ultrasound on her along with a pelvic exam removing a spongelike object from inside her dr blake had explained we inserted a synthetic osmotic dilator while you were sedated to gently help open your cervix its an oldschool technique but still effective in preparation for labor it was only then she had learned they were inducing her forcing her to deliver her baby early she protested but the protests fell on deaf ears all she got for her trouble was a patronizing reassurance that she was well enough along and that there would be little risk to the baby or herself that failed to relieve her she remembered what shed overheard during the flight the plans for her child to be dissected like some lab animal she had to find a way to stop them as she walked she supported her belly with one hand as if trying to hold her baby where it was safe willing her body not to surrender but ten minutes ago a prostaglandin gel had been applied vaginally the first step toward inducing labor i wont let them have my baby ahead she saw a wide window on one side of the hallway bright with light she hurried forward breaking free of blakes grip maybe there is a way out or some sign of where i am and deeper down lurked darker thoughts of throwing herself out a high window of plummeting to her death rather than letting them torture her baby boy she reached the window and fell back in horror the light did not come from the sun but from the stark halogens of a biological clean lab she flashed back to a similar facility in charleston where her in vitro fertilization had been performed like back home this lab had multiple workstations and microscopes it was all polished stainless steel or nonporous surfaces but what made her weak in the knees was the research project facing herliterally a disembodied human head hung before her bolted to a stanchion above a rack as tall as a man a foot below that horror a nest of plastic tubing suspended a human heart a pacemakerlike device had been wired into the dark muscle and sat atop the tissue like a silver spider the heart contracted every couple of seconds jumping slightly in its webbing and below that a set of pink lungs hung in a glass vat the disembodied tissue bellowing in and out hooked to a ventilator other body parts loomed in murkier jars farther down but she shied away from them fearing what she would find instead she found her gaze transfixed on the victims face his mouth had been taped shut his eyelids drooped at halfmast the stump of his neck was sealed in a tight bandage that trailed bloody tubes and tangles of wires all flowing to a desksize machine behind the rack it was as if someone had stripped the man down to his component parts separating them each for some macabre study she could no longer look and swung away running into dr blakes chest he caught her in his arms what is all of this she cried were saving lives he answered calmly continuing a russian research program started back in the forties they were using dogs back then discovering how long they could keep body parts alive via artificial means even seven decades ago using the crude tools available at the time the researchers were able to keep the severed heads of their subjects vital for days animated enough to respond to sound to attempt to bark to twitch their ears amanda shook her head aghast at such a thing ah but you see amanda as gruesome as that may sound those early experiments eventually led to the development of the first ventilator and the first cardiopulmonary bypass machine a leap forward in technology that saved thousands of lives over the next decades but this amanda waved a hand weakly toward the window this is just as important and groundbreaking the animal model could only take medical science so far and with the accelerating advances in nanotechnology microsurgery neuroscience cardiopulmonary medicine and pharmaceutical sciences there is no limit to what were on the threshold of accomplishing what were doing hereexperimenting with longevity studies of major tissuespromises not only to save lives but to extend them as well she heard the exaltation in his voice he openly worshipped at the altar of cold science where morality had no sway he believed as fervently in the truth of his convictions as any preacher and like any devoted disciple sought to convert the nonbeliever but she wasnt about to drink that particular koolaid movement in the lab drew her eye back to the horror show inside a figuregowned in a onepiece hooded clean suitstepped from a rear chamber carrying a tray of surgical tools the worker noted the audience at the window and looked over above the white mask amanda recognized those cold watery eyes petra at the same time she remembered blakes praise for his nurses ghoulish skills a talent to be applied to the child in her womb she stared between petras face and the disembodied head did they intend to do the same to her boy petras earlier words rang in her ears ill relax once we have the fetus on the vivisection table at the lab amanda stared at the tray of sharp stainlesssteel tools blood drained to her legs making her swoon why she cried inside how could her child be important to these grisly longevity studies what were they looking to find in her baby boy petra crossed and dropped the tray atop a workstation steel clanged on steel as sharp as a gunshot the eyelids of the corpse popped open dead pupils stared back at amanda she screamedletting all the days horrors crash out of her she fell to her knees felt something give way deep in her belly hot fluid washed down her inner thighs dr blake dropped beside her cradling her under one arm her waters broke he called to petra through the glass then turned his attention back to amanda he patted her leg it wont be long now amanda closed her eyes knowing at last where she was im in hell pm shes in heaven gray said speaking to the group gathered in the suite and to painter back in washington with the satellite phone on speaker he stepped again to the large window that overlooked the city and beachfront far out near the horizon a glow shone against the midnight sea like the reflection of the moon but it wasnt a reflection or the moon but another celestial body gray fogged the glass with his breath and drew on the window with his finger a fivepointed star the new island of utopia out there is in the shape of a starfish gray faced the others as painter listened on the line the boy back in somalia said that amanda was being taken to heaven maybe he misinterpreted utopia translating the name as best he could as a heavenly place or maybe he heard the destination of the kidnappers was shaped like a star a piece of the heavens or maybe youre grasping at straws kowalski said seichan stood with her arms crossed similarly unimpressed gray remembered their brief intimate moment in the bathroom in that fleeting instance the worries of family and mission responsibilities faded he existed in the simple purity of touch and possibility with his mind cleared the nagging puzzle stuck in his head broke through the muddle of his awareness the answer burst forth fully formed shining with the certainty of truth but maybe he was the only one convinced even painter put a noncommittal spin on his revelation its something i can look into maybe by morning we cant wait until morning amanda could be moved again or harmed we need to take advantage of the hours of darkness left to us youre talking about putting a lot of resources to bear on a hunch painter argued you could burn your cover expose the fact that you know amandas still alive all for nothing i know im right gray said how can you be so sure seichan said gray returned to the window because of the breakwater around utopia the same as can be seen out the window surrounding the palm islands he fogged the glass again with a hard breath and filled in the rest of his map of utopia drawing in a crescent breakwater around the starfishshaped island a moon and a star gray said poking at the symbols a gasp rose from seichan kowalski swore tucker shrugged i dont get it gray glanced at him remembering the man knew nothing about the guild its the root symbol for a shadowy organization one thats committed acts of terrorism around the world the director already suspected this group might be behind amandas kidnapping now you tell me kowalski grumbled if id known that i wouldve sat this one out tucker still shook his head the crescent and the moon you can find that emblem on most arab national flags the emirates is an islamic country the design of the islands might simply be representing that muslim symbol painter agreed hes right gray but youve convinced me enough that the island is worth investigating ive ordered a team to assemble an intelligence brief on the place i already pulled a picture off the web photos showing the towers under construction on the main island impressive several are already occupied by businesses with the remainder of the spaces nailed down by corporations from around the world from what im seeing security is tight around that island thats why i wanted to head out there tonight go in dark no good it sounded like painter was reading from a report theyve got a radarmonitoring system that circles the entire island theyll know youre approaching from a mile away then we can get as close as we can and use scuba gear to i may have a better way painter said letting out a long sigh theres someone in the area i can reach out to his name came up during the initial intelligence sweep of dubai a deepsea salvage operator hes got a pair of submersibles possibly something we can use to ferry your team to utopia hes been doing survey and engineering work on the seabed for an underwater hotel being constructed offshore hydropolis gray said remembering the latest addition to the dubai waterfront thats right from the sound of the directors voice painter was still not too keen on involving a third party especially this person director if you dont trust this guy its not that he can be trusted hes performed many highsecurity clearance projects for the government even for the military then whats the matter again that heavy sigh hes lisas exboyfriend kowalski turned away mumbling under his breath oh thats not going to be awkward july pm est charleston south carolina and jacks agreed to help lisa asked she stood by the open balcony door on the second floor of harbourview inn a historic building in the heart of downtown charleston that overlooked the river and a waterfront park he did painter said even agreed to keep this midnight mission a secret from the rest of the crew of the deep fathom hell be taking the sub out personally she closed the french doors returning inside to the airconditioned luxury her room was appointed with a fourposter bed and period pieces and featured an exposed redbrick wall and working fireplace a richness of accommodation to help bolster her cover she hadnt thought about jack kirkland in some time she had been fresh out of ucla medical school working under a national science foundation grant to study the physiological effects of deepsea work on the human body jack had been the captain of an eightyfoot salvage ship the deep fathom manned by a team of scientists and treasure hunters the two had a brief fiery relationship that burned out as fast as it started it was all physical but not from lack of tryinglots of trying multiple times a day she smiled at the memory though almost a decade had passed it felt like a lifetime ago what happened to that bikiniclad bronzelegged girl a pang of melancholia swept through her painter redirected her to the present stoking the worries that had died down by the distraction of his call and kats still not back no she checked her watch it was almost five oclock shed been back at the hotel for over two hours and expected kat to join up with her shortly thereafter they werent supposed to communicate with each other until reunited at the hotel to keep their distance from each other and youve not heard anything from her she asked not a word but when you called an hour ago i pinged her recording devices the pen camera in the reception area is still operational but offered no clue to her whereabouts the other devices in her possession were never activated and the remote hacking device you planted continues to transmit data so far theyve not found it and weve been gathering reams of data anything about amanda i got the profiles you emailed but weve hit a wall when searching for amandas medical filea firewall i have a skilled engineer trying to sap a way under that digital barrier but its delicate work to keep from raising alarm bells still if kat had been caught i doubt our surveillance devices would still be operational theyd sweep the place clean so then where is she i dont know the clinic doctors could be running tests or maybe she got nabbed by inhouse security for trespassing and its taking extra time to talk her way out or maybe its as simple as traffic she does have to take the bus back to the city lisa let his words calm her due to construction delays it had taken her an hour to wind her way across town to reach the hotel and kat would have to change buses twice to get here maybe painters right still she couldnt escape the feeling that something was wrong wasnt the original plan to rendezvous at the hotel at six oclock painter asked thats true but why hasnt she at least reported in to you if shed left the clinic painters reply took too long i dont know he finally admitted well keep monitoring what we can well give kat until six oclock to break silence before we make a move lisa knew that would be an agonizingly long hour for her painter spoke in her earnot talking to her this time but to somebody who must have stepped into his office though he lowered the receiver away from his face she still heard his voice sharpen send me everything he ordered then returned to lisa kat activated a second pen camera technicians are downloading the cameras sd card and sending the contents to my computer a knock on the door drew her attention someones at the door she said in her ear lisa heard a commotion over the phonethen painter swore brightly lisa dont answer it get out of there wood splintered as someone kicked the door panic spiked she twisted away another kick sounded behind her the door crashed open pm kat let her hand drop away accidentally dragging her purse off a metal table beside her gurney the contents spilled across the floor but she was too weak to stop it from happening it had taken all her effort to lift her arm and groggily reach into her bag fumble for one of the surveillance pens and press its disguised clip to activate the camera inside no video would be recorded inside her purse but audio would still be picked up the same could be said for kat in her current drugged state her vision remained a blurry pinpoint her stomach churned queasily but she could hear well enough to know someone came running into the small room drawn by the clatter of her upended bag looks like she was going for her cell phone a shadowy shape dropped next to her bed and began scooping up the contents of her purse shoving them back inside it sounded like the orderly from earlier the next voice supported that supposition judging by the frosty new england accent it had to be dr marshall the woman who cattleprodded kat into convulsing submission roy i thought you said shed be out for another ten to fifteen minutes from the dosage her body weight she shouldve been i just stepped out to grab a fresh gown before stripping her for the intake exam didnt i warn you she was fit robust shes not like the usual malnourished strungout subjects that land here you should have anticipated that roy she might have injured herself sorry it wont happen again judging by the gist of the conversation they remained unaware of kats true identity blind to her connection to sigma but where was she her head lolled around trying to get some bearing as to her location she innately sensed that not much time had passed all she could tell was that theyd moved her to another room likely within the same facility the space looked sterile too many bright surfaces pained her eyes and the air definitely had the antiseptic smell of a hospital painters instinct had been correct about the fertility clinic something was wrong here but what why had they drugged and kidnapped her im not ready for her exam yet dr marshall said so you might as well take her to her cell cell let her shake off the rest of the sedative the doctor finished shell be easier to work with if shes not as limp as a rag doll besides the sooner she learns to behave the better dr marshall still held her cattle prod tapping it against the gurney emphasizing who was the boss the orderly roy hauled kat onto the gurney and drew her out of the room and down a poorly lit corridor though there were no windows she sensed she was underground in a basement level roy stepped to a locked door and used a key card hanging from a lanyard around his neck to open a set of swinging doors stepping to the head of the stretcher he wheeled her through and into a large circular ward painted a soothing light blue with tables scattered around and a television playing silently in the background a set of double doors lay directly opposite painted a warning shade of red likely it was locked as securely as the doors into the ward the orderly swung her gurney to the side she noted the living space had bookshelves a showering facility and all along the periphery small roomscellsa dozen in all each sealed by metalframed glass doors a single woman stood framed in one of the doorways behind glass dressed in a blue smock her hair shorn to a crew cut her face expressing fear and sorrow she placed a palm against her glass door either as a sign of solidarity or to warn her off but there was nothing kat could do at least not yet she leaned her head to the side and studied the red steel doors only now noting the raised symbol spanning that exit it was a cross adorned with stylized representations of helical dna she sensed that whatever secrets were hidden at this clinic the answers lay beyond that threshold but right now she had another door to worry about roy reached a vacant cellthere seemed to be manyand used a master key to unlock the door and haul it open next he shouldered kat up into his arms dr marshalls descriptive use of the term rag doll was appropriate she couldnt keep her feet under her her arms felt cast in cement the orderly hauled her to the unmade cot in the room and tossed her on top of it stay out of trouble this time kat had enough strength to watch him leave as he shoved the door shut and wheeled away the stretcher she spotted her purse atop the gurney she pictured the surveillance device inside dear god let someone be listening pm washington dc were still not picking up any audio or video a technician reported another analyst called from across the room ive got security feed from harbourview coming up over here painter pointed to the tech keep monitoring all of kats surveillance devices he stepped toward the analyst show me that feed from lisas hotel painter crossed sigmas communications nest moving the eye of a hurricane with him he had other intelligence analysts and agents laboring across the banks of computers and monitors that formed a semicircle across the back of the room to his left an adjoining windowed office looked into the space it was kats command center her nest within the nest a single monitor glowed in that dark space illuminating the young face of her chief analyst jason carter who hunched over a keyboard working on a separate project out here chaos reigned as painter sought answers to the fate of kat and lisa he kept one ear fixed on the flow of information in the room while his left hand held a bluetooth earpiece in place awaiting any more audio from kats surveillance device a pair of wall monitors displayed the video from the two pens she planted one showed the reception area of the north charleston fertility clinic the other was dark receiving no video painter had heard the initial conversation that was downloaded after the second pen was activated it sounded like someone had drugged and kidnapped kat and was now holding her prisoner but after that nothing the feed had fallen unnervingly silent for the past twelve minutes at the moment he didnt know if kat was still at the fertility clinic or taken somewhere else they tried to track her disposable cell phone but ended up hitting a blank wall either reception was being blocked or her phones battery had been stripped out he was ready to contact the charleston law enforcement have them storm the clinic but to what end kat might not be there and if she was her captors would likely kill her before warrants could be issued such an effort would also lay bare sigmas continuing investigation into amanda and the gant family that must not happen his mind raced through countless stratagems while his heart pounded in his throat fueled by yet another fear another unknown where are you lisa when he received kats transmission hed been on the phone with his girlfriend when he recognized that kat was in trouble his anxiety shifted immediately to encompass lisaespecially when seconds later an analyst burst into his office to inform him that the hack into the clinics computers had suddenly got severed he got a brief warning out to lisathen heard the crash of a door in the background and the line went dead ive got the hotel feed now the agent pointed to a monitor in front of him a stuttering image flickered silent showing three assailants in a hallway all wearing ski masks so they knew about the cameras one knocked on the door shook his head then another stepped back and kicked the door in the three rushed inside vanishing out of view without a camera inside the hotel room there was no telling for sure what transpired after that as he watched painter found himself holding his breath he had to force himself to breathe panic would not serve either lisa or kat after lisas phone went dead he had immediately called hotel security and reported the breakin the head of security called back within five minutes it had been the longest five minutes of his life when he finally heard back he was relieved with the report but far from settled we chased the intruders off but the hotel room was empty we found a purse and a cell phone and luggage no occupant painter watched the same scenario play out again on the screen a twoman security detail came racing down the hall but the three assailants dashed out one shooting at the approaching guards forcing them back the three then took off disappearing down a stairwell a neighboring analyst swung around in his chair director i have harbourview security again patch them through when he last spoke to the hotel they were still searching the premises for lisa his earpiece clicked and a gruff voice could be heard shouting orders before centering back to painter it was the head of security im sorry to report sir that weve found no sign of your girlfriend anywhere in the hotel ive interviewed staff and guests no one saw any woman being manhandled off the property painter felt the smallest flicker of relief if lisa wasnt in the room or spotted by the hall cameras or staff then she must have escaped out the window the man on the line came to the same conclusion the police are on the scene but it appears to me that she fled thank you if you hear anything or learn anything youll be the first i call painter pictured lisa running scared through the streetsno money no phonedoing her best to keep ahead of the hunters and not knowing whom to trust she needed to reach a public area get access to a phone then he could facilitate her rescue he already had field operatives flying into the area thered be boots on the ground in charleston within the hour hopefully by that time hed have more information on kats whereabouts too painter glanced at the technician assigned to monitoring kats surveillance equipment he got a shake of a head in return still no new feed from kats second camera with an extra moment to think painter paced the length of the communications nest he began putting together the most likely scenarios somehow lisas cover got blown after the discovery of the wireless router hidden in the head clinicians office and since kats cameras were still functioning her cover must still be intact no one connected them together yet it was the only silver lining in this black cloudbut hed take it still pacing painter turned to find his way blocked by jason carter the young man was railthin former navy like kat only twentytwo years old according to kat the towheaded kid was some sort of savant as an intelligence analyst he also knew his way around computers hed been kicked out of the navy for breaking into dod servers with nothing more than a blackberry and a juryrigged ipador so the story went still kat had snatched him up in the aftermath for sigma jasons face was paler than usual he blamed himself for accidentally alerting the clinic during his attempt to hack the last firewall and for exposing lisa he was also deathly worried about kat the young man worshipped at her feet to keep the kid distracted and focused elsewhere painter had assigned him to finish the intelligence brief on utopia director theres something you should see he lifted an arm toward kats office painter followed him and closed the door he could still smell a whiff of jasmine in the air a ghost of its former occupant jason led him to a large computer monitor upon it spun a d rendering of the starshaped island of utopia the surface of the manmade superstructure bristled with towers clustering up each leg rising in height from the tip to the center like the spines of a starfish and in the middle rose the tallest of the spires appearing like a molten pyramid whose tip had been stretched taffylike into the sky to the height of five hundred feet where did you get this schematic made it myself that was fast jason shrugged before all hell broke loose you had me already doing a search into the various corporations and businesses involved with utopia i just pulled the architectural schematics from each building paired them with their gps locations on the island and had it all rendered in d the hard part was showing the levels of completion of each phase of the various towers i shaded the completed projects in gray the other ghostlier sections denote floors or phases of construction either unfinished or still in the planning stages impressive can you forward this schematic to commander pierces team no problem sir but thats not why i wanted to talk to you he waved to the screen this was all busywork while i waited for my data to compile on the various businesses invested or renting space in utopia let me show you he tapped a screen and the grayscale schematic burst forth with tiny patches of color in every imaginable hue filling in office floors and apartment spaces each color represents a different company with vested interest in utopia jason explained two hundred and sixteen in all painter gaped at the view grays team faced a daunting task to hunt through that corporate maze for amanda but apparently jason was not done you also had me search business records and financial reports to discover the true owners involved painter nodded he had assigned jason to strip away the shell and dummy corporations to expose the various front and holding companies all to discover who was truly investing time and money in utopia to reveal the real peas under all those fake shells that took some work jason said with a proud grin and hit a keystroke now watch on the screens schematic the various dots and splashes of colors began to change blinking through a cascade of shades then settling and blending togetheruntil most of the screen glowed one uniform color a deep crimson once the shell game settled out jason said i discovered seventyfourpointfour percent of the island is actually owned by a single parent company painter felt the cold creep of dread in his gut he could guess the answer gant corporate enterprises jason glanced up at him his eyes surprised how did you know what does the presidents family painter cut him off and leaned closer rotate that schematic to get a birdseye view of the island jason manipulated a toggle to swerve the view up and over the starshaped island to look down upon that crimson corporate tide the kid whistled appreciatively amazing jason exclaimed the pattern forms a perfect cross atop the island a templar cross painter mumbled picturing the symbol hed studied only days ago the mark of the guild doubt evaporated inside him the gants are the guild and grays team was sailing blindly toward their newest stronghold july am gulf standard time dubai city uae gray led the others down a long dock that cut through the center of a massive marina a full moon and the blaze of dubais skyline turned night to day here while jazz music tinkled across the water from an openair nightclub a soft breeze blew gently off the sea cooling the warm night and smelling of ocean salt and diesel fuel the tiny harbor lay at the tip of the manmade island of palm jumeirah they were to meet their escort at a berth in a remote section of the marina where fewer eyes were likely to pry to grays left the giant trunk of the artificial palmshaped island stretched two kilometers to shore sparkling in the night with hotels and residences divided by an eightlane motorway he hadnt appreciated the sheer magnitude of this archipelago until here on its shores each engineered palm frond was a mile long lined by villas and mansions and to his right across the water from the marina stretched the sevenmilelong breakwater crescent turned into a playground of hotels and water parks and two more palm projects were in development each bigger than the next the largest would be seven times the size of palm jumeirah another of grays party was also fixated by the enormousness of everything in dubai i guess size does matter kowalski said gaping at the megayacht docked at the upcoming berth it had its own helicopter tied down at the stern and it wasnt even the biggest boat here somebodys compensating for something if you know what i mean seichan strode alongside him we all know what you mean kowalskiits why none of us have commented on those cigars you keep sucking on he took out his stogie and frowned at her whatcha talking about she shrugged tucker bent down and unclipped kane from his leash the shepherd freed at last trotted ahead nose in the air tail high the dog had been confined to a leash while in dubai not the most dogfriendly city but out here in the marina at this late hour no one was around to complain his handler hung behind them lost in his own thoughts gray followed kane down the dock the number of empty berths grew as they neared the end leaving the opulence and grandiosity of modern dubai behind moonlight shone off the dark water ahead no longer competing with the reflected dazzle of the citys towers and playgrounds a slight breeze took the edge off of the warm night looking out to sea with stars twinkling and with the call to prayer echoing hauntingly from the shoreline it was easy to get transported back to another time to the medieval era of ali baba and lost desert kingdoms despite the excesses and extravagances of dubai the ancient world still glimmered through the cracks a shimmering mirage of past glories about time you all got here a voice called out of the shadows of the next berth the only evidence of his presence was the smoldering tip of a cigar the figure stepped into a pool of light cast by a pole lamp he wore a pair of black bermuda shorts flipflops and an unbuttoned white shirt on edge gray searched to make sure the man was alone kane seemed to have no such qualms the dog ran forward and greeted the newcomer warmly bouncing a bit on his front legs stay down kane tucker warned i dont mind him at all the man leaned over and gave the dog a vigorous rub reminds me of my old dog elvis he was a shepherd too german that is whats this boy kanes a belgian shepherd tucker said a malinois hmm war dog im guessing thats right army retired if you dont mind me asking what was kanes rank major kowalski glanced at tucker wait major kane your dog outranked you gray knew that wasnt unusual a military dog always ranked one level higher than its handler so any abuse was a courtmartial offense not that tucker would ever harm his partner straightening the man thrust a hand toward gray jack jack kirkland introductions followed all around their escort stood over six feet with saltandpepper hair from the scarring down one side of his body hed seen some action in the past the man also carried his rugged ageless masculinity with a boyish graceeven seichan was struck by it gray had never seen her so enthralled he heard her giggle at something the man said seichan never giggled it slightly pissed him off a reaction that caught him by surprise in a matter of minutes the man had charmed everyone on his team or almost everyone kowalski shook his hand whatre you smoking jack glanced at the cigar balanced in his fingers cuban el presidente oh man kowalski stared at his own stogie disappointed ive got a whole case aboard the ghost jack nodded his chin in the direction of the dark berth im sure i wouldnt miss one if it happened to grow legs and walk away jack headed off in that direction kowalski stayed put that guy really gets me gray shook his head okay now ive lost everyone seichan sidled up to gray brushing his shoulder and leaning closer wow that one word pretty much summarized the man gray sighed and followed jack toward the berth no wonder painter was so hesitant to drag this guy back into his life if i were painter i wouldnt want jack within a thousand nautical miles of lisa at least the man was wearing a wedding ring here she is jack said stopping ahead my new pride and joy the ghost gray didnt see anything moored in the neighboring berth jack leaped from the dock as if to plunge into the water but he landed on a firm surface only then did gray appreciate the docked vessel as it rocked under the mans weight even still it was hard to discern its presence against the dark water the submersibles bulk remained below the waterline only a conningtowerlike hatch protruded above the surface and a fraction of its upper deck what made it so hard to discern what made it blend so well with the water was that it appeared to be sculpted out of glass jack tapped his toe against the clear surface her shells made out of a new borosilicate polymer strong as steel yet with a low refractive index perfect for underwater viewing and the deeper you go the harder the glass becomes up to a point of course im not planning on testing that limit today i see why you call it the ghost seichan said shes my new lovecomes with all the bells and whistles a guy could want he ticked them off proudly the latest sonar and communications equipment flybywire joystick electronic buoyancy controls expanded air supply but what really gets me purring is her sexy curves i designed her after the old x minisubmarines sleek fast and seductive kowalski snorted at the hyperbole do you need a moment alone with her do you still want that cigar jack countered kowalski hung his head a bit sorry i should know better than to insult another guys girl shes sexy very very sexy thats more like it jack encouraged with a huge bawdy grin cmon aboard lets get you all settled we have a bit of a jaunt to reach utopia but then again whoever said getting into heaven was easy ignoring the mans joviality gray stared toward the horizon unable to shed his dark mood knowing amanda was not having this much fun am the next contraction wracked her body amanda sobbed tears streaming down her heated face waves of nausea swept through her sweat soaked her gown to her skin the worst of the pain was dulled by the miniepidural theyd given her but not all of it dilated eight centimeters petra reported from between her legs right on schedule dr blake stood at her bedside evaluating a labor monitor that was a good contraction but im pushing another bolus of pit pit was slang for pitocin a laborinducing drug he injected the medicine into her iv line then turned his attention to amanda he took her hand which was strapped in place to the bed and gave her fingers a squeeze would you like some more ice chips fury cut through her she dug her nails into the tender flesh of his wrist fuck you she spat at him she never swore but it felt good to do so now you goddamned monster ill get you some ice chips he said unfazed by her outburst he gently but firmly freed his arm then patted her hand everythings going well youre doing great other medical staff worked at the periphery monitoring vitals trading out dirty linens that shed soiled dragging in equipment a pair off to the side were preparing a radiant warming crib in anticipation of the newborns arrival blake returned with a tiny paper cup full of crushed ice chips he lifted it to her lips but she turned her head away refusing to cooperate in even this small measure she willed her body to resist too i wont let them have my boy but naturefueled by strong drugscould not be stopped minutes later pressure again rose inside her abdomen a storm front rising from deep inside her as relentless as the tide she squeezed her eyes shut knowing what was coming no please no her plea fell to ashes the next contraction tore through her she screamednot so much in pain as knowing she was losing this last battle push blake said but he sounded far away she fought against it but her body was no longer her own transforming into a primitive machine one forged in the evolutionary furnace of survival willing or not all her flesh drove toward one function to procreate to move her genes forward into the future she had no will but to obey abdominal muscles contracted in a crushing heave tissue ripped blood flowed pain became purpose the babys crowning petra called out her voice ringing in triumph lost deep in the violence of birth amanda cried out to the world surrendering to the inevitable driven now by the most basic of all maternal needs someone save my baby am seated inside the ghost gray swiveled his chair to face the curved glass wall of the submersible a pool of light cast by the subs headlamps illuminated the dark waters around the vessel as it coasted away from palm jumeirah the sandy seabed flowed a few feet below his toes the effect was unnerving the clear borosilicate shell allowed a full spherical view of the surrounding waters like floating in an air bubble he thought which wasnt far from the truth the ghost was little more than a tapered glass cylinder strapped into a hydrogencellbattery propulsion drive ancillary electrical mechanical and engineering systems acted as an exoskeleton around the living quarters curious denizens drawn by their light would dart up stare googlyeyed at the strange sight then flash back into the blackness he could imagine what they saw the vessel reminded him of the neon tetras he once raised as a kid hed lie on his bed for hours staring as the tiny fishes darted back and forth inside his aquarium tetras were best known for their iridescent blue and red racing stripes but gray had always been fascinated by their translucent skin their spine ribs even their quivering tiny hearts were exposed for the world to see at the moment he felt similarly naked like hed been swallowed up by a giant version of a glassy tetra still he had to admit the panorama was stunning one passenger was not as impressed this is so wrong kowalski said he was seated across from gray the big man had one palm against the glass window another on the ceiling he stared between his legs how long is this going to take what if we run out of air gray recognized the space was cramped especially for someone of kowalskis bulk jack piloted the craft from a single seat up in the nose the four chairs in back left little room to maneuver even kane had to balance on tuckers lap panting at the view ears high trembling all over seichan sat behind kowalski and reached a reassuring hand to touch his shoulder calm down weve got plenty of air she patted his back id be more worried about us springing a leak kowalski swiveled in his seat searching around the cabin with wide eyes gray gave her a scolding look all they needed was a panicked bull in their midst how much farther kowalski moaned the answer came from up front we have to cross the entire world to reach your destination jack tapped a button on a touchscreen interface a headsup display appeared above his controls glowing against the window it depicted a map of the surface showing hundreds of tiny islands forming silhouettes of the seven continents gray recognized it as another of dubais projects the world was one of the citys latest endeavors three hundred miniislands off the coast each offered for sale to private buyers but financial concerns and problems with sand erosion threatened the development the islands remained mostly deserted with the sea reclaiming some on the display a red blip marked their progress as they navigated through this manmade archipelago beyond the window a dark hummock of one of the tiny islands loomed as they circled past it a large ray disturbed by their passage shook out of the sand and sailed away from the light and back into the gloom other sea life appeared growing more abundant as they glided through the shallows and wound past the small isles hermit crabs scuttled along the sandy floor pink anemone and green sea grass waved a lone barracuda torpedoed past them and schools of fish flashed and swirled in shimmering silvers and dazzling colors tucker suddenly swore kane barked gray turned to see a shoal of hammerhead sharks come lancing out of the darkness and shoot past overhead they all inadvertently ducked there was no real threat but it was a sobering reminder of the dangers ahead after a few more silent minutes they left the world behind the deeper seas beckoned the ghost sailed out into the blackness slowly sinking into the depths as the coastal shelf fell away as they dove the watery glow of the moon died overhead the only lights now were their own and even that had to end going dark jack warned youll find your goggles under your chairs before gray could find his all the exterior lamps clicked off blackness crushed around them kowalski gasped the small lights from the control console were the only illumination inside the submersible and even those went dim grays fingers discovered the strap for his nightvision headgear and tugged them free he pulled the goggles over his head and settled them in place the world beyond the sub reappeared again lit now by the infrared led emitters along the nose of the vessel the goggles were able to perceive this spectrum of light turning the world into a grayscale shadow of its former brightness dont want to ride up to utopia with our lights blazing jack said even with the sub submerged someone might see us coming luckily we dont need lights i incorporated this naval ir system to accommodate for night dives makes for less of a rude intrusion into the dark world of our deepsea denizens or when you need stealth like now the plan was to sneak under the islands security net the surface radar defense system was meant to discourage pirate ships like those in somalia from reaching the islands coast undetected additionally armed security guards watched the docks and shorelines and a small fleet of jet boats patrolled the waters around the island painter and jack had already worked out an alternate entry pointbut first they had to reach it the ghost traveled another twenty minutes soaring swiftly with the quiet burble of its engines jack worked his pedals and joystick to glide them along the seabed riding over teeming reefs and across stretches of open sand positioned ten miles from shore utopia had been built in waters eighty meters deep it was an engineering marvel the first deepsea artificial island the headsup display continued to track their path away from the coast mapping a birdseye view of their passage at the top of the screen the tip of one leg of the starshaped island poked into view and slowly stretched downward as the ghost closed in on its destination more of the island appeared revealing its unique shape but its shape was the least unique feature of the island as they neared the tip of one corner of the star a massive concrete pylon appeared out of the darkness twenty yards wide a forest of such towers lay farther ahead this was the secret behind the engineering of utopia it wasnt so much an island as a massive fixed platform with a landmass sitting on top of it gray had read the history of utopia its engineering was not new or groundbreaking but based on technologies developed many years ago patterned after the hibernia oil platform constructed off the coast of newfoundland in the same engineers and construction company had been hired as consultants for this dubai development in many ways utopia was an easier project the hibernia platform had been built in deeper waters and constructed in seas prone to rogue waves atlantic winter storms and floating icebergs the waters here were calmer and the environmental threats less severe on top of that this location had been chosen for utopia because of a natural coastal ridge the outcropping had been reinforced and built up with boulders and compacted sand to form a protective crescent stretching four miles wide within those sheltering arms utopia was slowly constructed like hibernia and other oil platforms the island was basically a gravitybased structure meaning the more weight on top the more stable and secure it became so while hibernia was taller utopia was wider the equivalent of twenty such platforms connected in a honeycomb cluster to form a starshaped base atop this massive foundation whose upper surface lay submerged to the depth of five meters the same engineering techniques that built palm jumeirah were employed here laying down a thick base of massive boulders on top of the platform then flooding and covering it with dredged sand and compacting it all to the hardness of concrete and within five years a new island had risen out of the sea now comes the tricky part jack said he guided the ghost into that brobdingnagian forest of massive steelreinforced concrete pylons that supported the island the columns rose from the seabed set amid piles of boulders and mountains of ballast he slowed their pace to a crawl gray craned his neck staring up through the clear roof in the distance he could make out the bottom of the foundation platform he imagined the crushing weight overhead pictured the stack of corporate towers topside kowalski groaned this time seichan didnt tease him the sub suddenly rolled heaving to one side jack swore fought his controls and righted them sorry about that he said currents are tricky under here in fact one of the auxiliary power sources for the island is a series of tidal turbines driven by the daily ebb and flow of the ocean that same flow makes maneuvering through here a thorny bitch they continued on for five more excruciatingly long minutes the starshaped island was two miles wide but they only had to delve a quarter of that distance under its bulk still that journey was nervewracking enough sonar says were here jack pointed up everyone searched in that direction far overhead a tiny star shone in the darkness jack aimed for it spiraling around one of the columns as he headed up as they rose the star grew larger and brighter revealing itself at last to be a crack in the foundation platform a handful of such breaks had been engineered into the project serving as pressurerelieving points in turn the city planners had taken advantage of those construction necessities and turned them into various urban design features im turning off the ir emitters jack said you can take off your goggles you should have plenty of ambient light to see gray pulled his nightvision headgear off the blackandwhite world brightened into shades of aquamarine the pool of light overhead bathed them in its glow jack set the sub to hovering in one spot he dumped ballast to adjust their buoyancy and the ghost floated smoothly upward rising through the crack in the foundation platform a sixmeterthick wafer of concrete and steel once through those industrial walls tilted back sloping into sandy beaches the sub slowed its ascent and glided forward until sand once again swirled a few feet under grays boots jack studied a small monitor on his control console spying over his shoulder gray caught a glimpse of the world topside as jack employed a digital periscope looks clear the pilot concluded the burble of the engines faded to nothingthen a few seconds later the subs nose gently ground into the beach thats as far as i go jack said twisting around the top hatch is poking a couple of inches out of the water you should be able to reach the shore without getting more than your boots wet that proved not to be the case by the time gray reached solid ground he was soaked from the knees down seichan fared no better tucker disembarked last assisted by kowalski the pair worked together to get kane out of the sub gray had his team assemble beneath a grove of palms planted at the edge of the dark pond it was hard to believe what lay hidden beneath that placid surface an industrial hell of pylons boulders and ballast it stood in stark contrast to the world above kowalski joined them his gaze swept the landscape surrounding the pond his face shining with awe gently rolling hills spread outward covered in manicured lawns and dotted by other stands of palm trees beyond the parklands towers and spires rose forming a palisade of glass and steel some of the buildings were dark girdled by cranes under various phases of construction others thrust brilliantly into the sky windows aglow their exteriors flooded by lamps amply demonstrating signs of life and occupation closer at hand the rolling park was broken by patches of closecropped greens feathered with numbered flags elsewhere silvery patches marked moonlit sand traps we beached in a friggin golf course kowalski said with a shake of his head you gotta hand it to the arabs for working with what they got true enough gray returned to the pond which served the island in multiple ways as a landscape element as a water hazard and as a structuraldesign feature jack remained aboard the ghost leaning half out of the hatch he pointed a thumb toward the middle of the pond ill be hovering just under the surface but ill keep a watch for you with my scope if you cant make it back here youve got my signaling device set it off and ill find you thanks gray patted his shirt pocket indicating he had it jack hesitated before ducking away his expression turned a touch embarrassed like he wanted to ask something but held back what is it gray asked jack sighed maybe its not my place but hows lisa doing gray had already spoken with painter back in dubai so he knew the dire situation with lisa and kat worry for his friends remained a knot in his gut but that wasnt what jack was inquiring about gray read the real question in his eyes is she happy with her life gray answered that question as honestly as he could but in regards to what jack had asked directlyhows lisa doinghe thought it best to lie shes doing great july pm est charleston south carolina get somewhere safe off the street but stay in public the instructions rang in lisas head agony lanced up her leg with every step down east bay street she tried her best to hide her limp baking under the lateafternoon sun when painter had shouted his warning over the phone to get out of her hotel room shed not hesitated she ran four miles every morning did yoga most nights and her brother who climbed mountains for a living had taught her a few mad skills panicked and needing her hands free she had dropped her cell phone twisted away from the door and dashed to the balcony she heard the splintering crash as the door burst open behind herbut she was already moving through the french doors and vaulting over the wrought iron she caught one hand on the railing and swung around with her legs dangling free she lowered herself handoverhand down the secondstory balcony ironwork once at the bottom she let go and dropped the rest of the way to the sidewalk even wearing sensible shoes she landed hard enough to jam her left ankle a glance up showed a masked assailant staring down at her he raised a pistol but she dashed forward under the balcony out of the line of fire shouting erupted abovethen gun blasts she ran there had been no plan except to put distance between her and the hotel she had a choice of fleeing out into the neighboring waterfront park or into the narrow maze of historic homes with their quaint porches filigree woodwork and colorful gardens she chose the latter not trusting the open spaces of the park plus tourists and locals crowded the streets shops and coffeehouses of the area she instinctively knew to keep to public spaces it took her another twenty minutes to calm her heart to let the adrenaline seep from her brain enough for her to think still she kept peering behind hernot that she knew whose faces to be watching for or how many were searching for her anyone could be a threat with no money no phone she didnt know anyone in the strange city to trust so she reached out to the one person who could help she borrowed a phone from a patron seated in a patio coffeehouse and called painter she couldnt say who was more relieved to hear the others voice but painter stayed stern authoritative he ordered her to get off the street out of direct sight fearing her attackers might be closing a net around the district and looking for her but stay in public that meant she needed an indoor space a bar a restaurant a hotel lobby a commotion drew her attention down a cobbledbrick alleyway off the main thoroughfare a clutch of women in handsome gowns and men in tuxedos gathered a short distance away laughing and hugging their hellos it appeared a wedding reception or engagement party was under way at a restaurant back there and from the richness of the attire from the haughty edge to their genteel carolina accents the event had the air of old money perfect she hid her limp touched her hair to assure herself she was presentable for a restaurant of this caliber she hoped the affair was in a private room and that she could still get a seat in the main dining room or bar a small gas lantern flickered above the sign mccradys reaching the restaurant she excused herself as she slipped through the partygoersas she hoped they were all filing upstairs to a private room she stepped up to the hosts station excuse me im afraid i dont have a reservation but i was hoping i could still get a table the host a slender man with a soft manner smiled that shouldnt be a problem this early in the evening if youll give me a moment lisa stepped away but she remained standing she was afraid if she sat down shed never get back up again her leg throbbed all the way to her knee to distract herself she read a small sign about the restaurant how the building dated back to over the centuries it had served as a warehouse a tavern and even a brothel it stated that george washington had once attended a grand dinner party herehopefully not when it was a brothel still with such a pedigree it was no wonder the upper crust of charleston chose this place for special events laughter and music echoed down from above another few stragglers of the party pushed into the lobby from the amount of lace and piles of coiffed white hair they were clearly a few of the grandes dames of charleston high society if youll follow me the host said to lisa drawing her attention away your table is ready one of the older women glanced in her direction eyeing her from the lofty height of her class positionthen leaned to another and whispered other eyes stared toward her judging her suddenly selfconscious lisa smoothed a hand down her st john dress and stepped away from them joining the host he leaned conspiratorially toward her its cotillion season theyre having a small debutante ball upstairs lisa glanced up picturing a party of chiffon and diamonds the official debut of a young woman to her highsociety peers balls like this functioned in the past as an antiquated dating service to present an eligible daughter to available bachelors within a select upper circle basically a highsociety livestock show its a very exclusive affair the host said as he led her to the table he raised one eyebrow toward her some grandniece or second cousin of the president lisa felt better surely no one would dare intrude here crossing into the main dining room she did her best not to hobble still something must have shone in her face maybe the sheen of her skin something in her eye are you all right maam the host asked as they reached the table pulling a chair for her im fine she offered him a smile but it felt stiff on her face just a long day of shopping of course he said graciously but his gaze flicked around her a bit likely noticing her lack of a purse were you expecting someone else she checked her watch hopefully so painter had told her to find a spot and call him he had a security detail already headed downtown to extract her she picked up the menuhopefully theyd also square her bill she needed something stiff in a tall glass no ice i believe my party is running late lisa said and im afraid ive forgotten my cell is there a house phone i might use id be happy to bring you one perfect thank you she sat back soaking in the quiet chatter of the early dinner crowd the restaurant had a colonial charm with its woodbeamed ceiling oiled plank flooring exposed brick walls and a fireplace tall enough to climb into without ducking the host returned with a cell phone she passed on a drink order to her waitera single malt whiskey the macallan please the sixtyyearold expensive but as a doctor she prescribed it for herself anyway and this is definitely going on sigmas tab she dialed painters secure linenot only to inform him about where she had holed up she was also anxious to hear any news about kat the connection clicked through where are you he immediately asked she told him including the address painter sighed in relief the team is fifteen minutes out stay put im not going anywhere the waiter arrived with her drink the whiskey trembled in the crystal as she held it she took a sip to steady herself letting the aged liquor evaporate along her tongue heating all the way down im safe here she said attempting to reassure both painter and herself ive got a drink and im surrounded by people the elite of charleston she heard the tinkle of music flowing from the cotillion upstairs in fact theres a party going on here some distant relatives of president gant then again you probably cant turn a stone over here in charleston without finding someone related to that family painters next words came too fast choking a bit did any of them recognize you an amused snort of disbelief escaped her of course not why would anyone in the presidents family are you sure the panic frosting his voice passed to her she stared up toward the wood beams hearing the thump of music the trickle of laughter she remembered the grande dames eyes glancing her way the sudden whispers painter whats this about i want you to get out of thereright now lisa stared at the expensive drink in her hand i dont have any way to pay if i bolt now ill cause a commotion draw more attention to myself and she wasnt sure she could bolt not with her ankle now that shed been sitting a few minutes even shifting her left leg sent shooting stabs of pain all the way to her hip she lowered her voice what arent you telling me i can barely walk i need to know what im facing a short silence stretched she imagined painter rubbing a finger along that line between his brows debating how much to say or calculating his next step over the years that crease had gotten deeper as he sat in the directors officeand all that rubbing wasnt going to make it go away tell me she said tired of all the halftruths and secrets he finally spoke talking fast i havent told anyone this not kat not gray not anyone at sigma not even you it was just a dangerous suspicion before but a few minutes ago i got what i believe to be substantial verification about what about the guild lisa went cold she knew painter had been concerned that amandas plight could be tied to that deadly cartel did he have proof now painter spoke his next words carefully as if testing them aloud for the first time i know who is running the guild who its the presidents family the shock took an extra moment to break through her surely painter was joking her mind struggled to put all of the pieces together in her head trying to comprehend how that could be true she came to only one conclusion thats impossible lisa said her voice faint thats why i didnt tell anyonenot until i knew the truth ill explain more once youre back in dc his next words hardened with warning but lisa now you understand i need you out of there as silently as you can despite her fear she fought against a stab of anger at him for keeping this secret from herand not just from her what about kat dont worry about her just get out of that restaurant promising to do just that she snapped the cell phone closed she looked up toward the ceiling still struggling to believe she had to trust painter was right readying herself she downed the rest of the whiskey in a single gulpa waste of such a fine single malt but she needed the fortification she pushed gingerly back to her feet one hand clasped to the back of her chair there was no hiding her limp any longer she hobbled back to the hosts station maam are you sure youre okay no not in the slightest im fine she lied and lifted the house phone receptions bad in there is it okay if i step outside to finish my call of course let me help you no need she hurried toward the door and back out onto the street she took a few steps but the uneven cobbles proved too challenging her hobble became a fall a man lunged to her aid his arms caught her thank you she began to mumblethen stared up into the face of dr paul cranston the head of north charleston fertility clinic a gun pressed into her side another two men came up behind her the doctor smiled ah dr cummings its high time we finished our previous conversation he motioned to the others strong fingers clamped on to her upper arms hard enough to cause bruisingbut a little manhandling was the least of her worries she glanced back up to the bright lights of the secondstory window heard a piano playing cranston made a scolding noise i can guess what youre thinking but fear not youre not that unlucky that side of the family knows nothing important except how to spend money and sniff their noses at common folk no weve been following you since the hotel i had men positioned outside when you made such a bold escape lisa stared back at him we hoped youd lead us to whomever youre working with cranston said and pulled a pen from his pocket it was kats surveillance device they must have found it in the lobby but clearly they still didnt know who left it a shame he said and led her away looks like well have to do this the hard way but difficult or not well find your partner pm the buzzing shears rode past kats left ear long locks of auburn hair tumbled down falling past her shoulder and sliding to the floor to join the mound of hair already piled around the chair still cottonmouthed from the sedative kat sat on the seat in the center of the circular ward with only a sheer hospital gown between her and the cold metal with her wrists cuffed behind her back she had to tolerate the humiliationand that was surely the goal here to break her down the other prisonera doeeyed young woman in her midtwentieswatched from behind the glass door of her cell offering her silent support she and kat were the only ones here the rest of the cells appeared empty the facility was clearly running low on raw material kat remembered dr marshall mentioning something about a lodge theyre demanding more research subjects clearly that was one of the purposes of this place to supply human guinea pigs for various projects collecting women who had no past no families who could easily vanish and likely this was not the only such facility in the world she imagined there were many other collection sites hidden around the globe but to what end what was going on here from the corner of her eye kat studied the red steel doors and the embossed genetic cross something important was happening at this particular clinic and she knew any answers lay hidden behind those doors earlier kat had been forced to strip naked in her cell while dr marshall performed a thorough physical assisted by the orderly roy afterward marshall had vanished with a tray of vacuum tubes full of kats blood kats fingers curled into tight fists as roy sheared the last of her hair away they might have taken her clothes and most of her dignity but she bided her time to win it back all done roy said running a palm along the stubble of her scalp raising a slimy chill over her entire body always like it when youre freshly shaved kat whipped her head away go to hell feisty he said with a laugh glancing toward the locked door likely looking for dr marshall clearly the man spent most of his day being browbeaten and ordered around by the female clinician he seemed to take pleasure in taking out his frustration on those left to his tender care his hand reached to the weapon attached to his belt it wasnt an electric cattle prod like dr marshalls means of punishment simply an extendable baton hed used it on kat once already smacking her across her calves when she was too slow in getting undressed her skin still stung kat had noticed welts on the other inmates arms and legs bastard roy snapped his baton off his belt and with an expert flip of his wrist extended the weapon to its full length likely compensating for shortcomings elsewhere theres not going to be any trouble is there roy sneered in her ear she gritted her teeth and hung her head thats more like it he rested the baton on her shoulder as he leaned down and undid her cuffs stand up keep your hands behind you she obeyed her head spinning slightly from the aftereffects of the drugs cold air blew through the slitted back of her hospital gown as she turned to face roy she kept her hands behind her roy reached the tip of his baton under her chin forcing her head up thats more kat whipped her arm around and grabbed the baton yanking it toward her roy caught off guard got pulled closer she swung her other arm wide silver flashing in her fist she drove the knife into his throat below the larynx severing the trachea roys eyes stared at her stunned gurgling unable to screambut she understood his silent question how she answered him in a hiss because this cat has claws kat twisted the combat dagger hard blood sprayed a full yard across the spotless vinyl floor in seconds he bled out and she let his body tumble to the floor she wiped the blade on his clothes and folded it closed when roy had first tossed her into the cell waiting for the sedatives to wear off before stripping her and taking away her clothes she had fought through the fog freed her left shoe and removed the folded combat dagger concealed in the sole she left the lock pick hidden in her right shoe unfortunately her cell door did not offer access to the keyhole outside as she put her shoe back on she hid the blade under a fold of the blanket later when they had stripped her examined her and poked her full of needles she waited until she had a moment alone while putting on her hospital gown through the opening in the back she slipped the folded dagger between her buttocks and held it clamped therenot the most seemly way to conceal a weapon but sometimes a lady has to do what a lady has to do then she had to wait for a time to get roy alone she knew she would have only the one chance taking advantage of the moment kat worked fast and stripped roy of his keys electronic pass card and baton she rushed to the other cell and unlocked it the young woman came staggering out staring at the ruin of roys body thank you my names amy cmon kat said encouraging her she hurried across the ward toward the pile of her clothes and quickly pulled on her shorts blouse and shoes she pocketed her dagger and handed the baton to amy amy squeezed the weapon in her fingers and glanced toward the exit there are armed guards down the hall i dont know how well get past them she noticed kat staring at the red steel doors on the other side of the ward they they took my sister through there two weeks ago then thats where were going kat said she wasnt leaving without finding out what was going on here amy remained at kats side looking ready to follow her lead grab the key card kat ordered were going to find out what happened to your sister amy gave a sharp nod of acknowledgment kat used the moment to grab her purse which had been set aside with the rest of her clothes she snapped it open and pulled out the surveillance pen shed activated earlier she tucked it into her blouse pocket with the camera end poking out if i dont make it i want some record of all of this together they sprinted to the other side of the ward as they reached the doors kat took the keycard from amy and passed it over the electronic reader a heavy shift of gears rumbled a red light blinked brightly overhead likely wired to an alarm at that guard station outside as secure as this place was someone knew this vault was opening how long until they came to investigate before her the heavy doors parted wider accompanied by a soft sigh of pressurized air kat stared insideas amy began screaming pm washington dc interview everyone at that damned restaurant painter paced the communications nest at sigma headquarters holding his earpiece in place as he directed the security detail in charleston in the search for lisa the team had finally arrived onsite he turned next to one of the analysts seated at a console how long on getting that feed from the local street cameras five or ten minutes he turned his back in frustration lisa where did you go after ordering her to leave the restaurant he had expected a return call within minutes alerting him to her location so his security team could sweep her up but as time stretched with no word panic had set in director another technician said pointing to a dark monitor i still cant get anything more from captain bryants pen camera the one planted in the clinics reception area either its been discovered or the battery has drained painter nodded acknowledging the information he spoke to the head of the security team split off two men send them to the fertility clinic i want a full report on the status there yes sir also we finished questioning the restaurant staff they confirmed a woman matching dr cummingss description had arrived she ordered a drinkthen suddenly with no provocation fled the building the host saw her talking to three men outside said she left with them according to his statement she informed him that she had been expecting guests painter closed his eyes lisa had been expecting his team it made no sense widen the search grid painter said see if anyone saw where they went yes sir blood pressure pounded in his earsbut he still heard the deep bass of the voice at the door director crowe a word he turned to find his boss the head of darpa general metcalf standing at the threshold the man wore the same suit as this morning still looking fresh and expertly creased the same could not be said of the generals face he looked worn his eyes red his jowls sagging sir we need to talk that statement never ended well underscoring the seriousness metcalf rarely stepped into sigma headquarters he preferred email faxes and conference calls his presence here did not bode well painter clenched and unclenched a fist he didnt have time for interruptions but he had no choice we can use captain bryants office he led metcalf to the windowed space off the communications nest and chased jason carter out of kats chair the young analyst was continuing to work on a private project for painter give us a few minutes painter told the kid once alone he faced metcalf whats this about ive been in meetings with the secretary of defense and the joint chiefs the president made a brief appearance painter heard the drums of war beating in time with his heart and he asked sensing what was coming were shutting sigma down painter shook his head not in insubordination just disbelief he expected a strong negative reaction from the commander in chief but not this and certainly not this soon when he asked metcalf wore an expression of regret but his voice never wavered youre to cease all operations immediately painter felt suckerpunched sir ive got agents in the field many in dangerous situations call them back turn any of those situations over to local authorities or up the military chain of command and if i refuse if any agents resist any further actions will be considered unsanctioned disavowed and criminal charges may be pressed depending on a casebycase inquiry painter took a deep breath and stared at the men and women working furiously in the nest beyond the window from the corner of his eye he noted the project jason had been working onthe genealogical map of the gant family spun slowly there a spiraling galaxy of power as cold and relentless as any celestial movement painter knew the truth in that moment the guild had won shut it down metcalf ordered pull everyone out of the field july am gulf standard time off the coast of dubai gray crouched with his team at the edge of the dark golf course hidden in the shadow of its clubhouse the moon had set while they crossed the greens hurrying from one patch of palms to another despite the dark night the lighted floors of several of the neighboring towers acted as shining beacons casting a stark illumination across the rolling lawns according to the premission briefing most of the islands security patrolled the shorelines and docks but they could not discount a stray guard spotting them but now they had another problem to address as he lowered the satellite phone moments ago he had checked in with painter confirming theyd reached utopia and in hindsight maybe he should never have made that call whats wrong now seichan asked reading his face weve been ordered to cease all mission objectives and return to the states gray told the others apparently the powersthatbe in dc need a scapegoat for the death of the presidents daughter and that would be us kowalski mumbled sourly painter is working on an appeal but he has to officially instruct us to pull up stakes here but amanda isnt even dead tucker said why doesnt the director tell the president that gray had already explained painters reasoning back in somaliahow amandas best chance for recovery lay in a surgical strike to hit the enemy while they believed no one was looking for her still this decision sat wrong with him gray believed the presidents family had a right to know and now they were all suffering the fallout gray also sensed that painter wasnt telling them everything that he was holding something close to the vest but whatever it was it would have to wait they had a decision to make maybe painter will inform the president as a part of his appeal process but what is he going to tell him we dont know for sure that amanda is still alive all we know is that the charred body at the camp was not his daughter so we have to make a choice to retreat back to the ghost or to move forward if we defy these direct orders and arent successful we may face criminal charges and even moving forward well have limited support gray stared around the small group seichan shrugged im already a wanted fugitive whats one more crime and i was never an official member of sigma anyway tucker said nothing says kane and i have to follow those orders gray turned to his last teammate kowalski sighed my pants are already soaking wet so what the hell then lets figure out where to start our search gray gripped his phone and brought up a detailed d rendering of the island he rotated it to show the outline of a cross these are the businesses and properties with possible ties to the guild organization wait seichan said how does painter know that gray glanced up at her crinkling his brow in the rush of information he never thought to ask that question seichan must have read that realization in his eyes she shook her head silently scolding him for yet another oversight gray tightened his fingers on the phone irritated as much at the mistake as at seichan catching him pull it together go on seichan said if amanda is on the island shes likely to be found somewhere within the properties highlighted thats a lot of territory to cover tucker said thats why well start here the most likely target and spiral out from it gray pointed to the center of the cross x marks the spot kowalski mumbled what the hell we are looking for a pirates buried treasure gray straightened and lets hope its still there he lowered his phone and started toward the center of the island toward the shining central axis upon which this star turned and it was turningthe tower not the island the floors of the spire each rhomboid in shape and slightly offset from the next formed a massive corkscrewbut the most amazing aspect of the engineering was that each story rotated independently of the others creating a dynamic structure powered by wind turbines and solar panels it was mesmerizing to look at shifting slowly melting into new shapes meant to mimic a shimmering mirage burj abaadi tucker said naming this central hub of utopia the eternal tower the fiftyfloor skyscraper had been built in only eighteen months constructed in conjunction with the islands creation the two projects rising together out of the sea gray sensed that if anything were hidden on this island it would be there at the heart of utopia there was only one way to find out for sure he turned to tucker and kane time to go to work am tucker led the wayor rather kane did the shepherd ran a full block ahead along a deserted avenue that cut down one leg of the star he heard his partners panting breath in his left ear and kept one eye on the video feed watching for any signs of armed guards or the rare resident of utopia he and the others stuck as much as possible to the shadows as they headed the quartermile to their destination palms lined both sides of the road and along a center median several stretches of trees were still in massive boxes waiting to be craned into place and planted the entire island had that same surreal feelinglike a childs model of a city where pieces sat to the side waiting to be fitted and glued into their proper spot but as they traveled closer to the stars center the cityscape became less fragmentary buildings grew taller more polished shining with lights evidence of life began to appear an occasional golf cart or car in an empty parking lot a tiny grocery store with stocked shelves a neon sign glowed in the window of a korean restaurant still tucker suspected only a skeleton number of people actually populated the island and most of those were likely connected in some manner to the guild to tucker that terrorist outfit still sounded like something out of a dimestore novel but then again he had dealings in the past with many different mercenaryforhire groups private military companies with equally colorful names saber titan globalenforce and while he didnt subscribe to conspiracy theories he knew that the militaryindustrial complex was rife with corruption and collusion generating scores of shadowy organizations that merged armed forces intelligence services political ambitions and even scientific ventures so what was one more earlier kowalski had pulled him aside and told him what had happened to pierces mother and hinted at previous altercations with this organization so no matter what this new enemy was named tucker and the others were trespassing on their home turfand he intended to watch his step and that applied to his partner too slow he radioed to kane the jumbling view on his phone steadied as the shepherds lope became a deliberate pace turning tucker motioned the others behind a parked yellow hummer a tow rig behind the truck held a sleek watercraft and offered additional shelter in another block the avenue dumpedlike the other four spokes of the starinto a central park that surrounded the twisting spire of burj abaadi the eternal tower rose like a glowing sculpture into the night sky each floor slowly turning making it appear as if the entire structure were gently swaying in the wind off the sea only the bottom five stories were stationary encompassing the buildings lobby and maintenance levels including its power station that collected energy generated by the horizontal wind turbines positioned between each floor shouldnt we be closer gray asked no need tucker said that park ahead is full of shadows with lots of trees and hiding places dont want to stumble upon a guard by mistake leave this to kane seichan agreed hes right works for me kowalski said running his fingertips longingly along the sleek side of the yellow jet boat outvoted gray nodded for tucker to continue the man sent kane forward with a single command go scout kane stalks slowly forward remaining in shadows he moves against the breeze flowing from ahead letting the scents wash over him catching what he can with his upturned nose he smells salt and wet weed from the distant waves and sand closer he is hit by the crisp bite of cut grass the trickle of sweetness from petals opening to the night but through it all a rank undercurrent flows reeking of sweat and oil and ripeness of body men in hiding he hunts each scent drawing in its heady foul richness he stays in shadows behind bushes along the edges of benches he tracks each one down until he hears the satisfying whisper in his ear spotted then moves on he creeps deeper tail low haunches tense ears pricked to every tick tap and creak the smell of man fades behind him carried away by the wind leaving spaces for new scents then he stops a trickle of thrill stirs his hackles he tests again nose higher taking that odor deep inside tasting it recognizing it he moves again tracking its trail through the air it rises from a truckhe knows trucks and rides and hanging his head into hard winds but now is not that time he dashes across an open stretch and into the shadows beneath the truck a darkness reeking of oil and grease he slips out the other side twisting stretching his neck he circles and paces making certain then whines his triumph and points good dog tucker radioed back pride spiked through himand a raw affection that ached they had all watched kanes hunt huddled around his phones tiny screen his shepherd had spotted four guards stationed out in the groundsthen he snuck up to a pickup truck parked crookedly in the circular drive fronting the entrance to burj abaadi hes found amandas scent there tucker said shes on the island can you get kane up into the bed of that truck gray asked no problem it was never hard to get kane to take a ride he sent the command up in the truck the dog immediately backed a yardthen with a burst of speed he launched from his haunches and flew over the side and landed in the rear bed skittering slightly to avoid hitting what lay there kane danced around it sniffing intently seichan leaned closer is that an open casket gray pointed out the bits of tape along the edges thats how they moved amanda no wonder she was never spotted at the airport they crated her here likely under diplomatic seals kowalski looked over his shoulder yeah but where is she now they all stared up at the fiftystory tower spinning slowly in the night they all recognized the truth the hunt was just beginning but were they already too late am the tiny boy rested on amandas bare belly quiet now the furnace of her body stoked to a fiery dampness by the delivery kept him warm a small blanket covered him but a tiny fist protruded no bigger than a walnut amanda stared consuming him with her eyes with her arms bound to the sides she could not hold him that was the worst cruelty even giving her this moment with her child was necessity not compassion she had read all the baby books the newborn was placed facedown to encourage the draining of any fluid the skintoskin contact encouraged her body to release its own natural oxytocin to help with the final contractions to push the placenta free her body had performed its ageless duty spent exhausted she tried to stretch this moment for an eternity my baby boy she whispered tears streaking through the sweat of her heated face she wanted him to hear his mothers voice at least once she willed all her love christening him with the name murmured in the night with her husband mack his broad hand resting on the bump of her stomach my little william but sadly the child was not her husbands at least not genetically she knew some of the truth saw the medical records in the terrifying note that sent her fleeing in terror out to the seychelles still mack had loved the baby as much as she did it shone in his face even after the truth was known he loved you so much william new tears flowed for the family that was never to be voices intruded but she never took her eyes off her child petra make sure you collect at least five milliliters of blood from the umbilical cord well need the sample serumtyped in addition to the standard tests ill also want to harvest some umbilical stem cells amanda listened realizing the truth they were already parsing her child into parts dr blake the radiant bed is ready petra called from the side ive prepared the vitamin k and the eyedrops did you want to perform the apgar assessment no you can do it i should pass on word about the delivery as soon as possible blake shifted from the foot of the delivery bed to amandas side he reached to scoop up the child no please amanda begged another minute im sorry its better this way you did beautifully she strained forward a sob breaking out of her hoarse throat nooo ignoring her plea he lifted william from her belly taking away his warmth leaving a hollowness that she knew would never go away blake walked her boy toward a tiny bed under harsh lightsand the nurse with cold eyes amanda pictured the shining tray of silver dissection tools her sobs turned into wracking cries she rocked within the limits of her restraints still she never took her eyes off her boy my little william am dr edward blake stood by his desk bonetired and blearyeyed a deepcushioned chair beckoned but he remained standing he didnt want to be relaxed not during this call yes everything went smoothly he reported the genetics continue to remain stable after we run the baselines well be testing the stability of the helix assembly under various environmental rigors and stresses that was the purpose behind petras macabre work in her lab to separate out various vital organsbrain heart lungs and othersto keep those tissues alive indefinitely so that rigorous tests could be performed upon them amandas child was destined for that lab i believe we have reason to be optimistic about this boy he finished optimism is irrelevant the speaker countered the voice digitally flattened and tweaked to an arctic severitythough edward suspected that iciness wasnt all computergenerated only hard facts matter he swallowed of course well start generating actionable data within the day tissue samples should be harvested and couriered stateside as soon as possible understood i received the list my assistant is already prepping stem and skin cells well have intestinal and alveolar biopsies within the hour and cortical and spinal sections by days end but i do have another question silence encouraged him to continue the mother was there a final consensus on what to do with her edward could guess the answer a massive graveyard had been dug into the jungles outside of his somalia camp she may still prove to be biologically useful as of now we dont know if these results are broadly replicable or if there is something unique about her genetics edward was surprised at the depth of his relief he pictured amandas tender love shining through the sweat and tears the strength in her eyes when he took her baby away that blend of toughness and maternal protection must have touched him more than he imagined or maybe im simply tired getting too emotional should we confine her here he asked hoarsely on utopia no our plans require her to be shipped back to the states surprised edward absorbed this and ran various scenarios through his head he had lightly sedated amanda for the short hop from somalia to facilitate her passage through customs but a trip to the states was a longer journey with a much higher risk of exposure how do you plan on moving he was cut off shes intended for the fertinc lab edward had to rest a hand on his desk hed visited the fertilization and incubation lab only onceand once was enough he immediately understood what was demanded of him well expect her prepped and at the dubai airport by eight in the morning the speaker finished consider it done the line went dead before he got out his last word they didnt need to hear his acquiescence it was taken for granted he remained standing for two long breaths the relief he felt at amandas reprieve drained away better she had gotten a death sentence he tapped an intercom petra well need the surgical suite readied her tinny response followed for what procedure he told her picturing again what hed witnessed at the fertilization and incubation clinic that flawless representation of scientific purity where morality held no sway a world where only methodology and outcome mattered he felt bile churn in his gut poor amanda july pm est charleston south carolina kat stepped across the threshold amy followed shadowing behind her quiet now after her initial cry of shock and dismay the large steel doors shut behind them closing on their own with a pop of pressure kat knew they didnt have much time until their escape was discovered with the doors sealed the ambient light remained low tinged slightly red reminding kat of working in a control room of a submarine during her years in navy intelligence where the unique lighting preserved night vision or maybe the subdued illumination was meant to blunt the horrors residing in here a long hall stretched ahead splitting two rows of tanks full of a pinkish gelatinous fluid thin translucent drapes that lined the front of the rows failed to hide what rested in those tubsize steel vessels kat stepped to the side and parted one of the curtains dont amy moaned clutching her stolen baton in both hands but she still followed clearly needing to stay near katnot for protection merely to remain near a flicker of humanity in such an inhuman lab kat had noted the sign hanging above the hallway fertilizationincubation lab here lay that purpose given flesh a naked woman floated shallowly in semiviscous fluid a gelatinous bed to prevent bedsores and to keep tissues moist her abdomen swelled with gravid promise navel protruding close to parturition her breasts hung loosely never to suckle the life growing within the patients head hung over the edge of the tub eyes taped shut neck arched back as if waiting for her hair to be shampooed but there was no hair the bald scalp shone in the weak light revealing sutured scars and wired electrodes snaking into the skull other tubes violated mouth and nose all running to a rack of monitoring ventilating and liquidfeeding equipment what have they done amy asked in a horrified whisper kat stared down the long row at the other women resting in identical tanks posed in the same frozen posture of torture all in various states of fetal gestation she understood what she was seeing the women here had been reduced to no more than living brainstemswith only one clear function theyve turned them into mindless human incubators kat said trembling between impotent rage and bonedeep sorrow she gaped unblinking bearing silent witness this is where i wouldve ended up amy wore the same mask of revulsion kat shied from imagining herself here unable to balance this monstrous act with the simple wonders and mysteries of her own pregnancies of carrying those tiny lives inside of her she staved off the paralysis of horror by remembering her babies first cries the suckle of a tiny mouth on a tender nipple the grip of little fingers so demanding so needy she pictured the other four buildings of the clinic complex of the levels of research and development performed here the cuttingedge retrieval and cryopreservation techniques for ova and sperm the advancements in in vitro fertilization procedures and the latest innovation in embryo culture and transfer many of the greatest reproductive and genetic scientists from around the globe worked here or had in the past how many if any knew what trickled down from their groundbreaking research seeping like toxic waste to pool here with poisonous purpose kat swung away knowing she had only half the answers to the mysteries here she knew where to find the others cmon kat said sensing time running short she returned to the central alleyway between the rows she had noted glassenclosed offices at the back and headed there striding quickly with amy in tow as her mind raced she considered various exit strategies there was not likely to be a back door out of this lab not with what this facility was hiding down here the only escape was back the way theyd come through those red steel doors and past that gauntlet of armed guards she searched as she strode to the end of the roomfor a weapon for some other means of escape she wasnt the only one searching amy gasped behind her denise without turning kat reached an arm back and grabbed amys wrist before the young woman could dart to the side toward one of the shrouded tanks amy had come along with kat to discover the fate of her sister thats not her kat said drawing amy closer thats just a husk a shell your sister died when she was taken through those doors amy resisted for a couple of steps then surrenderedknowing kat was right they hurried together each needing the warmth of the other the hallway ended at a line of three glasswalled offices all facing the horror show other hallways branched to the left and the right likely leading to smaller labs storerooms and mechanical spaces kat noted the names etched on the three doors she memorized them intending to hold the persons accountable if she ever got out of here but she moved to the centermost and largest of the three the name on the door read nancy marshall md dsc phd abog it seemed the more abbreviated letters followed a name the less humanity remained through the glass door kat spotted a computer glowing with a screensaver depicting a slowly spiraling helix of dna she found the lock unfastened and hurried inside crossing to the computer she reached to wake the monitor up then paused noting something odd about the screensaver the glowing highdefinition image detailed a thick double helix of dna slowly spinning all colorcoded mapping out nucleotides codons and chemical bonds she leaned closer studying a strange abnormality a third strand of protein wound within the double helix entwined into the genetic matrix like a snake in the grass biology and genetics were not her specialtybut she knew someone at sigma who could better analyze this data reaching to the mouse she woke up the computer a standard desktop appeared she needed to secure as much of the data stored on that hard drive as possible and transmit it back to dc but she also knew she didnt have time to crack whatever passwords locked this system from the outside world there was no way to email or send files electronically the firewalls around this complex were fierce and militarygrade she would have to improvise and hope for the best reaching to her breast pocket she removed her surveillance pen the cameras video and audio were recorded to a secure digital sd card linked to a cellular transceiverbut the data could also be manually ported over if necessary via a builtin usb connection she twisted the pen shedding the camera features leaving behind the twoterabyte storage card linked to a usb adapter working fast she found the usb port in the desktops tower and shoved the drive in place her intent was not to download the cards content but to upload files to it hoping theyd eventually reach sigma with the guts of her pen exposed kat noted the cellular transceiver glowing a pinpoint green it remained active but was anyone picking up the signal she straightened as a new icon blinked onto the screens desktop representing her flash drive a rumble drew her attention around amy stood at the open office door staring back to the far end of the lab the steel doors had begun to slowly open unsealing and cracking with a sliver of light dr marshalls sharp bark carried through find them kat returned to the computer no time to be picky about which files to grab using the mouse she dragged the image of the computers hard drive and dumped it all onto the thumbnail for the sd flash drive files immediately began transferring thats all she could do for now except survive pm what the hell was that painter stared over at general metcalf hed never heard the man swear seldom saw him lose composure the pair stood before the bank of monitors in the communications nest minutes ago the technician monitoring kats surveillance pen reported new feed coming from her second device this was the first video transmission since the pen had been activated theyd picked up some initial audio snatches of conversation but nothing afterward then suddenly the screen had bloomed to life the first few minutes were a jumbled confusion until the camera settled on a set of red metal doors with a cross symbol emblazoned on them metcalf had just been leaving when the monitor sprang to life exciting the technician the general accompanied painter to observe what was picked up together they viewed in growing dismay as kat surveyed a dark lab revealing rows of women in tanks then she continued to some offices at the back of the room did you get those names painter asked the technician the ones on the office doors yes sir after that the monitor went dark once again is that everything metcalf asked where was this footage taken painter knew he had to come cleanabout everything he drew the general back into the side office once inside with the door closed he explained captain bryant was investigating a fertility clinic in south carolina the same facility where amanda had her in vitro fertilization performed but it hadnt been just kat conducting that investigation lisa had gone down there too fear for her stoked brighter but he had to stay focused metcalf turned toward him what fertility clinic are you talking about who authorized painter cut him off before he worked up a full head of steam he needed to shock the man into listeningfor all of their sakes amanda may still be alive as he expected those few words knocked the man back a step painter continued not letting the general recover he needed to present the entire picture before metcalf started to put up mental roadblocks only the complete story could win this stubborn man to their cause painter started at the beginning with amandas kidnapping and his belief that it was tied to the unborn child she carried they ended in front of kats office computer painter showed him the cross atop the island of utopia realizing just then that it matched the symbol on the red steel doors what did that mean metcalf sank into the desk chair his eyes fixed to the screen the general was a tough man a skilled player in the ways of power and politicssome would say even an opportunistbut that was a requirement to function in the beltway politics of dc painter also knew the general to be a shrewd strategist capable of putting logic before emotion he hoped that proved to be the case now and all of these properties are owned by the gant family the presidents family metcalf asked staring at the island and youve already received confirmation that amanda was taken there yes behind that glaze of shock painter saw the gears churning through all the evidence finally metcalf shook his head not in disbelief more like defeat dear god if youre right he placed a palm on his forehead and stared painter square in the eye even if the gants are the puppet masters behind the guild how could the president involve his own daughter with something like this the general glanced to that dark monitor in the other room obviously picturing the horror show from a moment ago james gant may not know painter explained we dont know which of the gants are in that inner circle the true bloodline thats why ive been playing this game so cagily i have a gut feeling that inner circle is not without internal friction or dissent why do you say that something sent amanda running to the seychelles almost like she was tipped off like someone was trying to protect her or maybe they purposefully tricked her into fleeing in secret so she could be nabbed out of the public eye it was a more cynical hypothesis one painter hadnt even considered proving yet again that metcalf was an expert chess player youve built a case against the gants metcalf conceded but its far from solid none of this is strong enough to confront them especially the administration if we tried wed end up tipping our hand too soon exposing that were onto them the backlash would burn us down and that bloodline would bury itself even deeper theres only one solution painter understood we need amanda metcalf met his eyes confirming this any hope for sigma to rise from these ashes depended on recovering and securing the presidents daughterand surely the bloodline knew that too a knock at the door drew both their attentions it was kats chief analyst jason carter painter motioned him forward but the kid only stuck his head through the door director were receiving new data from captain bryants device painter stared past the young mans head the monitor was still black is it new video or just audio again neither theyre digital files painters eyes pinched with momentary confusionthen realized what kat was doing downloading information off one of the labs computers clever kat very smart start forwarding those files to me painter said jason nodded and ducked back out metcalf waited with painter i wish you hadnt told me any of this he said id certainly sleep better not knowing for that matter why did you tell me why trust me whos to say im not on the guilds payroll it was a good questionand painter had only one answer because youve been a thorn in sigmas side from the beginning you mean ive been an ass painter didnt argue with his wording but youve also had our back sir when weve truly needed it and besides i cant do this on my own not any longer i need an ally someone to hold the wolves at bay if were to have any chance of recovering amanda youll get itbut theres only so much i can do after what happened in somalia sigma has a big target on its back and you know washington once they smell blood in the water the feeding frenzy begins the intercom buzzed director the initial files are up on your desktop ill leave you to this metcalf said standing and letting painter take his seat this castles about to be stormed and im better off manning the gates and fortifying the ramparts painter knew his statement was more than a metaphor sigma headquarters lay in the bunkers beneath the smithsonian castle within the shadow of the white houseeven now the battle lines were being drawn between them as metcalf left painter turned his attention to the computer to the files gained at such risk he worried about kat and even more about lisa still he sensed that all the mysteries the true pulse of the bloodline lay in the life or death of another woman gray you must find amanda july am gulf standard time off the coast of dubai gray held the mans neck in the crook of his arm the flat of his hand against the side of his head a twist and a sharp crank on the chin shattered the guards cervical vertebrae the strangled body fell limp he lowered the guard to the lawn and began stripping off the mans helmet vest and shirt the gear was identical to that worn by the commandos back in somalia offering further proof that amanda had been moved here in his earpiece done that was seichan she had taken down her man as gray strapped on the dead soldiers helmet he glanced at the phone in his hand on the screen a dogseye view revealed a lone guard posted beside a park bench kane moved nearer drawing the mans attention while tucker closed in from behind with a blade as silently as the others he dispatched the last guard that stood between grays team and the twisted spire of the burj abaadi the eternal tower move in gray radioed he ran low through the remainder of the nighttime park still wary in case kane had missed any hidden guards but no alarm was raised as he reached the edge of the grounds as he waited for the others he looked up at the sheer majesty of the slowly turning tower each floor revolving independently of the others he imagined the view must be breathtaking from up top the scene eternally changing spanning from the panoramic brilliance of dubais skyline to the dark mystery of the starlit sea still something bothered gray as he stared upward something about its everchanging shape a rustle drew his attention back to the ground the others converged from different directions seichan and tucker came similarly outfitted in stolen gear kane kept out of sight slinking wide upon a signal from his handler as they gathered to him gray studied the front entrance to the burj abaadi he expected there would be cameras watching the steps and lobby possibly other guards inside the disguise was a feeble one but the ruse could buy them an extra few seconds of surprise if needed kowalski finally pushed past a grove of palms struggling to pull a small vest over his wide shoulders the helmet sat on top of his head like a crown my guy was pintsize he explained gray pointed his rifle at the big man drop all of that and put your hands on your head kowalski frowned what the hell pierce seichan sighed just act like a prisoner she waved toward the lobby stairs for the cameras understanding slowly sank through kowalskis thick skull widening his eyes he shed his stolen gear and laced his fingers atop his head with a final few instructions gray marched kowalski forward flanked by the other two from the corner of his eye he caught a blur of shadow easy to miss unless watching for it kane vanished into the bushes at the base of the building and crept from there toward the same stairs bright lights lit the steps but the lobby was dark with only a few pools of subdued illumination inside it looked deserted maybe their disguises werent necessary the guards in the park had certainly been easy to take down gray had even caught his target sleeping the enemy plainly must have thought themselves safe out on this islandespecially since they suspected no one was looking for amanda gray marched with the others up the stairs they kept their faces lowered from the cameras gray motioned for tucker to run ahead and check the tall glass doors that led into the lobby the man ran forward and tugged the door swung open unlocked tucker looked relieved it saved them the trouble and exposure of using the minipellets of c to blast the deadbolts or larger pyrotechnics if necessary the only one disappointed by the ease of entry was the teams explosives and demolitions expert aw man kowalski groused i was all set to blow some crap up gray poked him in the back with his rifle keep moving kowalski stumbled across the threshold gray and the others crowded in behind him the lobby soared five stories high drawing the eye up in the center rose a grand spiral staircase made entirely of glass and sparkling in the wan light with swarovski crystals and figurines depicting sea creatures it wound up from the grand entry hall spiraling around the central axis of the tower and continuing ever upward the only illumination came from a ring of huge pillars also made of glass they formed massive vertical aquariums glowing with an inner soft radiance that slowly shifted along a spectrum of hues initially gray thought the aquariums were empty merely bubbling on the inside catching and multiplying the glow then his eyes adjusted and the bubbles became palmsize jellyfish swarming and drifting within the giant pillars the wonder of the moment was interrupted by a harsh call a towering beefy figure rose out of hiding from behind a security desk and stalked forward rubbing a knuckle in one eye somebody else had been caught napping the man shoved a black beret on his head clearly the leader of this african contingent a second figure crawled from behind the desk and stood a darkskinned girl of thirteen or fourteen slim fraillimbed wearing a soldiers uniform she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand the leaders pants were unbuttoned so the man hadnt been caught sleeping fury roiled up inside gray he knew many of the village children nabbed by the warlords of somalia werent all turned into soldiers like baashi but instead were brutalized as sex slaves or both the monsters gaze remained fixed on kowalski as he stalked across the wide lobby clearly mystified by the sudden appearance of this prisoner the ruse would only last another couple of sec the leader froze halfskidding on one foot his hand lunging for his holstered pistol seichan whipped her sig sauer out dont shoot gray snappedthe noise of a firefight even a single shot in this crystal echo chamber would surely draw any other guards and alert the enemy hidden within the leader freed his sidearm under no such restraint but gray had seen the flicker of movement from tuckers wrist heard a whispered command over the radio kane burst out of the shadows behind the man and barreled forward the girl squealed dancing to the side the dog hit the man in the ankle hamstringing him and flinging him into the air he flew highthen landed hard his head striking the marble floor his pistol slid away into the shadows tucker was already moving charging forward blade in his fist he slid on his knees passing kane whose momentum carried him in the opposite direction tucker reached the downed man raised his dagger then simply lowered it necks broken tucker said so we each got a soldier kowalski said lowering his arms rubbing his shoulders i gotta get me one of those dogs from the shadows to the side the young girl reappeared she held the lost pistol in both hands pointed at tucker her face was a mask of terror tucker dropped his dagger and raised his palms its okay the man intoned softly the girl spat something in somali they didnt have a translator but it sounded more angry than scared she steadied her pistol her finger finding the trigger then the girl suddenly jerked back a stepcoughed blood she dropped the pistol her fingers scrabbling for the silver blade sticking out of her neck gray turned to the source seichan had a second throwing dagger in her fingers ready if needed it wasnt the girl slumped to her knees then toppled forward tucker gave out a soft cry of dismay he lunged forward going to the childs aid but it was no use what did you do what needed to be done seichan said her eyes glassy and cold tucker stared across at her she was just a child no she wasnt seichan whispered under her breath not any longer logically gray knew she was right the girl would likely have shot and killed tucker and the noise would have jeopardized everything and a sad truth of the matter some brutalized war orphans never recovered never healed becoming no more than animals in childrens bodies still his heart ached at the death echoing tuckers anguish seichan merely headed across the lobby lets find amanda thats what we came here for still he noted her fingers trembled as she tried to return the unused blade to its wrist sheath seichans right gray said and pointed to tucker get your dog we need to pick up amandas trail tucker glowered at seichan but he obeyed as dog and handler worked in tandem sweeping through the lobby gray moved to the security desk there he found a bank of monitors it appeared the desk was wired to the lobbies on each floor he began hitting each button bringing up one view after the other looking for any evidence of habitation reaching the penthouse lobby on the fiftieth floor he came up empty every lobby was dark offering a dim view of marble elegance fine rugs and the continuation of the spiral stair everything looked deserted untouched over here tucker called quietly i think we found something kane sniffed furiously at one of the doors along a curved bay of elevators gray crossed toward him collecting seichan along the way she stood off by herself staring into one of the aquarium pillars her face unreadable as he reached her she nodded to the glowing and swirling pillar of jellyfish in front of her reading the sign its a giant hybrid of turritopsis nutricula he shook his head not understanding at the end of this species life the adult jellyfish reverts back to a juvenile state this cycle repeats over and over again starting fresh each time she stared over at the bloodied girl her eyes were damp with tears possibly seeing herself lying there did she wish for such a chancefor both of themto be reborn to start again pure and untainted to have their childhoods back the process makes the jellyfish immortal she whispered he nodded understanding this unusual marvel of nature no wonder its the mascot for the eternal tower but seichan had a different viewpoint about life everlasting and mumbled it aloud its so horrible gray didnt comment as she turned away he followed silently with her and allowed her to work through her grief to process it he did keep close to her side letting fingers brush along the back of her hand the one that had thrown the dagger he expected her to pull away but she didnt they joined tucker and kane kowalski stood nearby neck craned staring up following the coil of the crystal staircase through the heart of the eternally spiraling tower gray followed his gaze again nagged by something something about the shape pm est washington dc the dna molecule slowly spiraled on the computer screen a dance of code that mapped out the human body in all its glorybut this fragment of genetic material was unlike anything painter had ever seen diagramed a third strand snaked within the heart of the typical double helix what do you make of it painter asked using the mystery here to keep him distracted from his worries about kat and lisa its a triple helix renny quinn said his voice flush with awe the holy grail of genetics renny leaned his large fists on kats desk to stare closer sigmas resident biogeneticist had been summoned to help painter sift through the huge volume of data coming from that labs servers the man was of irish descent with a ruddy complexion and dark auburn stubble over his scalp and cheeks he was also a former college boxerwhich included a fair amount of bareknuckle brawling a habit that got him discharged from the army rangers afterward sigma grabbed him renny proved the stories true of men with big handsbut in his case it meant he had a huge brain and renny was going to need it to slog through this mountain of data the files from charleston arrived disordered and unclassified much of it in raw code kat must not have had time to pare the data down to the most essential files instead what arrived was the definition of a data dumpa load far more than the sd card in her pen could handle a lot of the files came corrupted others not fully decrypted as a consequence it could take days if not weeks to decipher decode and repair the damaged files still it didnt take a computer engineer to ascertain that most of the files dealt with advanced genetics and reproductive studies all tracing directly or indirectly back to this one image a triple helix of dna painter said staring at the monitor as perplexed as he was intrigued actually renny leaned over and dragged a finger down two of the spiraling backbones these strands are deoxyribonucleic acid or dna the thirdthis snake wrapped around the tree of lifeis peptide nucleic acid or pna renny tapped the new helix this strand is artificial man engineered this not god what were looking at is the result of cybergenetics the merging of biology and technology is that even possible not only possible its been done a team over at the university of copenhagen have already managed to insert a pna strand between two dna strands in a test tube of course but the only obstacle to moving their research to the next stage is a simple hurdle renny nodded to the screen that triple helical assembly isnt stable in water build a raincoat around that strand and the whole world changes painter frowned up at him what do you mean renny explained our entire genetic code is built on four chemical bases guanine adenine thymine and cytosine g a t c from that fourletter vocabulary all life is formed he cocked an eye at the spiraling molecule but pna is not restricted to those four letters can you imagine what could be created with more letters of the alphabet we could rewrite mankind despite rennys obvious excitement painter imagined only horrors but far more importantly renny pressed this cyberstrand of pna can be designed to specifically turn on and off certain genes pna has already been used to cure a form of muscular dystrophy in lab mice but thats just the beginning the potential is limitless were talking about blocking cancer treating hundreds of genetic diseases even extending life renny stared longingly at the computer if dna holds the key to life then pna is its lock pick for whoever holds that tool in hand nothing would be impossible painters dismay grew darker picturing the lab in charleston the women floating in tanks jason tapped at the open office door and saved him from having to ponder worse director im sorry to interrupt but we just finished receiving an extremely large file from charleston i thought you might like to see it the folders name is history and origins painter sat straighter happy to forgo any more biological discussions for now he wanted to get to the root of everything and that file name sounded promising history and origins jason dashed some of that hope but sir the folder is badly corrupted were working on it but i can forward what we have so far a couple odd pictures and documents do it painter said jason pointed to the computer already done no wonder kat loves this kid painter swung to the keyboard and clicked open the first few uncorrupted documents a drawing filled the screen it showed a trio of men in colonial attire with their arms clasped together gripping right hands above their heads and left hands below in both of the upper corners of the sketch a threeheaded snake coiled what is this painter mumbled not expecting an answerbut he got one thats the holy royal arch renny said sounding equally surprised to know the answer painter turned to him how do you know that because im a member of the guild renny must have read painters stunned look not that guild im talking about the masons my family has been members going back to our time in ireland painter pointed to the screen and this dont know a whole lot about it whats drawn there is the ritual of threetimesthree a sacred number in freemasonry its a part of the initiation into the royal arch degree but plenty of mystery surrounds that exclusive degree like its exact origin its said to be tied back to the knights templar the threetimesthree ritual in other words nine represents the original nine founding members of the knights templar painter stared at the screen what is this drawing doing on the servers of a genetics lab despite the oddity he had a suspicion of the answerbut only because of the previous discussion with renny painter studied the three men entwined together the threeheaded snakes it was eerily similar to the threestranded helix three wound together as one even renny had used the term a snake wrapped around the tree of life to describe the triple helix painter read the annotation at the bottom of the drawing stating the source a book titled duncans masonic ritual and monitor printed back in how could a book dated almost a century and a half ago be referencingat least symbolicallya triple helix painter was reminded of the file folders name history and origins sensing the importance here he wanted the rest of this folder decrypted as soon as possibleif it was possible jason suddenly dashed back to the door with grim news director we just lost connection to charleston the feed from captain bryants device suddenly ceased in midtransmission painter sat straighter the pens battery did it die no sir this time we were monitoring the charge levels it was still good painters heart sank knowing there was only one explanation left jason stated it aloud someone must have discovered her bug and disabled it but what did that mean for kat july pm est charleston south carolina find them kat slipped silently into a side room off the dark lab hallway before disappearing inside she caught a peek of dr marshall at the far end storming out of her office surrounded by a cadre of security guards split up search every closet storage space and lab on both sides kat closed the door quietly struggling with the handle due to her greasy palm the room was lit only by the glowing screensaver of a computer monitor again it depicted that strange triple helix kat hoped the files shed been downloading had reached somebody at sigma as her eyes adjusted to the gloom she noted the neighboring wall contained shelves of fiveliter glass jars reflecting the meager light dark things lurked and floated inside kat caught the barest glimpse of curled tiny fingers she turned her back not wanting to see more not after witnessing the horrors out in the main room the women in the tanks these jars likely held the end product of that research kat still held her folding combat blade dulled now from all the hacking and sawing shed had only two minutes to ready herself for the siege ahead barely enough time to get amy hidden and out of harms way in her head calculations continued to run as a mental timer ticked down seven tanks psiatank estimated volume of laboratory space she heard doors opening and slamming men shouting orders working swiftly down the hall toward her position she had left a door open farther backbut the guards would reach her first as planned she closed her eyes taking several deep breaths she used the extra seconds to smear more of the gelatinous fluid over her face and shaved scalp leaving a thick film her clothes and the rest of her body were equally slathered and dripping with the hydrophilic gelthe same pinkish material that was filling the monstrous tanks in the main room footsteps pounded up to her hiding place she faced the door as it was ripped open a guardthen anothercame charging inside with pistols pointed at kat drop the knife one of them screamed she obeyed lifting her hands to the top of her head the other yelled out the door found one of them bring her to me marshall ordered the guards manhandled her out the door and into the hallway she did not resist and allowed herself to be led at gunpoint toward the pool of light radiating from marshalls office the woman stood with her hands on her hips she ground a boot heel against the vinyl floor kat heard a crack and saw a bit of black plastic go flying across the floor theyd found her surveillance pen plugged into their network marshall faced her her cheeks livid her eyes fiery she already had her palm resting on her cattle prod kat expected to be punished needed to be punished where is the other girl marshall demanded kat made sure never to break eye contact not to betray amys hiding place with the flicker of a glance ill make you talk marshall stalked up to her and jammed the prod at her belly kat twisted at the last second as blue sparks spat from the black wands end pinned by the guards behind her she still caught a glancing shock on her hip electric fire lanced along her side crippling her left leg into an agonized spasm forcing her into a painful crouch kat ground her teeth against the painand in frustration too low pushing up with her good leg kat lunged and caught marshalls wrist one of the guards tried to pistolwhip her but kat dodged enough to take the blow to her shoulder kat struggled with her quivering leg grabbing a handful of plastic curtain that hid the tanks to keep her upright she still had a grip on marshalls wrist and shoved her cattle prod high the metal tip struck the curtain rod overhead sparks danced then the world became fire the detonation blew kat backward sent her flying through the air overhead blue flames chased across the ceiling after herand spread outward she covered her eyes with her arm picturing that fire racing down the hallway toward the farthest room a storage and mechanical space holding all manner of pressurized gas tanks that serviced the many labs of the complex including seven large tanks marked with the symbol h hydrogen gas odorless fourteen times lighter than air highly explosive she had hacked through the lines earlier bleeding the massive tanks into this enclosed space knowing the gas would stay high and be undetectable to the nose kat landed on her back on the floor and slid the heat blistering overhead broiling all beneath the only thing that kept the skin on her body was the thick hydrophilic gel that covered her the same watery properties that kept the patients in the tanks moist and free of bedsores offered her some meager insulation the same couldnt be said for the others screams cut through her blastmuffled ears bodies flailed clothes on fire faces burned away in that split second during the explosion kat had watched marshalls hair ignite turning into a swirling nimbus of flames a fitting end for a woman who played god kat struggled up choking from the smoke from the heat from the lack of air her tearing eyes turned the view into a watery hell all around fires danced plastic draping melted in blackened flows and charred equipment sparked and sizzled she gained her feet and took a stumbling step backward another figure rose from the floor two yards away climbing from behind the shelter of a tank her scalp was burned and cracked pouring blood marshall lifted her arm holding one of the guards pistols in her hand and stumbled around the tank kat tried to get to shelter but her legs betrayed her she fell on her side supported by one arm marshall came another step forward the pistol pointed at kats face her gaze showed no glee at the kill to come only a pained necessity a last act of revenge but it wasnt she who got that revenge from the tank next to her the naked body rose sitting up like a corpse from a grave marshall turned toward the movementher deadened eyes suddenly going bright with terror an arm pulled out of the gelatinous muck drawing out a long black baton the weapon swung with the heavy grief of a sister in mourning the hard metal cracked marshall across the bridge of the nose shattering through bone the doctor dropped kat realized then this is a more fitting death for a woman who played god amy climbed out of the tank and hurried to kat and helped her back to her feet i thought you were dead i thought i was too earlier kat had dragged deniseamys sisterout of her viscous crib replacing her sibling there instead kat had stripped amy of her hospital gown and made sure the girl was sunk deeply into the tub well coated with the insulating gel afterward kat had scooped handfuls of the same and covered herself toothen carried denises thin body to the storage room kat had wanted amy hidden in plain sight knowing no one would look too closely at the occupants of those tanks she also wanted the girl close to the exitnot trapped down the fiery hall confirming that wisdom a massive explosion ripped from that direction spraying shrapnel and shattering glass kat pictured all the other pressurized tanks back there overheating leaking gas catching fire she also envisioned flames chasing through the gas tubing and conduits spreading to other floors other buildings lets go kat gasped out hoarsely she retrieved the pistol from marshalls limp fingers and together they fled through the smoke and fire and back through the red steel doors in the ward alarms blared and sprinklers overhead sprayed fiercely kat stopped long enough to grab another gown for amy and hurried out the doors down the hall they discovered the guard station empty no one tried to stop them as they fled up out of the fiery bowels of the building and onto the ground floor of one of the rear buildings of the campus the view outside showed the rest of the facility succumbing to the spreading flames the summer sun was still up but it looked like dusk outside as smoke obscured the gardens across the way fire danced behind other windows an explosion blew out an upper section of the main building showering bricks and broken roof tiles it was all coming down kat grabbed amys arm and hurried her through the exit and out into the parklike grounds other researchers fled for the gates to the street looking shellshocked kat followed them doing her best to keep her pistol hidden in the distance sirens echoed kat and amy ran down the entry road and out the gates chased by more blasts and deepthroated explosions debris rained down around them smoke rolled thickly now making it hard to see they fled farther down the street trying to break clear to get some distance away from the conflagration at last they reached a clear section of road they both panted hands on knees sirens grew louder converging all around as emergency crews responded from throughout charleston kat straightened and pointed toward the blue lights flashing through the smoke you should the crack of a pistol echoed amy fell back sitting down on the road she reached a palm to her chest as blood bloomed through her gown kat twisted and dropped to a knee swinging up her weapon an suv sat on the side of the road a back window open movement inside she fired wildly at the dark car pm lisa dropped low in the backseat as the windshield cracked and shattered she was pinned between two burly guards in the front the driver and dr paul cranston crouched christ the shooter next to her said shes got a gun lisa covered her head whats happening after nabbing her off the streets of downtown charleston cranston and his men had returned to the fertility center confident after their huntonly to be greeted by a loud explosion as they turned into view the concussion rattled the suvs windows smoke curled up from one of the back buildings flames began to spreadthen more blasts as the place ripped apart cranston had them retreat a block to observe the incineration and destruction of his hard work unable to look away he hissed from up front take her out goddamn it before she escapes if she gets loose while surveying the aftermath from a safe distance cranston had spotted a pair of women running out of the smoke both shavenheaded one in a hospital gown he recognized them immediately theyre from the lower lab hed ordered them shot gunned down like rabid dogs but it seemed one of the women had teeth the gunman next to lisa returned to the open window shoving out one arm his weapon pointed another spat of gunfire peppered the side of the truck the man swore but held his post lisa risked a peek she saw the woman with the pistol drag the wounded girl toward the shelter of the thicker smoke sirens screamed now and the flash of emergency lights grew brighter through the haze then the woman glanced over her shoulder back toward the suv it was the first time lisa got a good look at her face recognition rocked through hereven with all her friends hair shorn away kat got her the shooter said with deadly satisfaction no lisa lunged and hit the man with her shoulder his pistol fired his aim thrown lisa got her head out saw kat unharmedand she intended her friend to stay that way kat run her other guard yanked her roughly back cranston raised enough to peer into the backseat he fixed lisa with a knowing gaze she immediately read the understanding there so thats who you were working with cranston said and ordered his men to secure kat the gunman balled a fist in lisas hair and dragged her out using her body as a human shield kat had found thin shelter behind a recycling bin cranston called from up front drop your weapon come out or well put a bullet through the back of your friends head dont lisa screamed at her friend the fist in her hair shook hard ripping follicles she watched in despair as kat threw her pistol outthen stepped into view go get her cranston ordered the other guard i want some answers but dont hesitate to shoot her if she gives you any trouble kat must have sensed the same and came along willingly her fingers laced on top of her head what about the other one cranston asked when the guard returned with kat dead kat and lisa made their reunion in the middle of the backseat trapped between the pair of armed men im so sorry lisa whispered kats face was a hard mask of ragebut not directed at her kats hand found hers and squeezed holding so much promise in that small gesture reassurance forgiveness and a guarantee of revenge emergency vehicles began to appear whipping past their parked vehicle sirens ablaze and lights blinding where now the driver asked as he started the engine cranston stared toward the burning wreckage of his clinic out of the city its a little too hot here now he turned from the fire and smoke well take them for a ride in the country to the lodge pm washington dc from his post in the communications nest painter watched the fiery footage from south carolina it was a live feed shot by one of the two men hed sent out to investigate the north charleston fertility clinic his team had arrived onsite fifteen minutes ago a chaos of fire crews fought the blaze towering arcs of water sprayed from trucks and ladders paramedics along with other firstresponse teams serviced burn injuries and smoke inhalation other victims had lacerations and bruises from flying debris and glass four bodies had tarps over them painter expected there would be more would kat or lisa be among them when the security detail first reported in painter had hoped the destruction was kats handiwork but it could just as easily have been a failsafe measure someone had found kats bug and the guild was notorious for its scorchedearth policy hed seen it himself multiple times in the past if anyone got too close the guild would burn all bridges that might lead to themto their secrets it didnt matter the cost consequences or lives director he turned to find jason carter at his shoulderagain i want you to see something the kid said and drew him to a monitor where another analyst worked though the seated man was a decade older jason rested a hand on his shoulder like an encouraging father linus and i were working on a research project for kat before she left weve been working on it for about three months linus added whats this about painters patience was threadthin but he waved for them to continue i asked linus to test our new protocols in the search for captain bryant and dr cummings jason said i hope that was all right of course at this point hed take any help what were you testing a new surveillanceandtracking system similar to current facialrecognition programsbut instead of faces we applied it to motor vehicles once on the road the wear and tear on an automobile creates a unique pattern as individual as any persons fingerprints or facial features is this going somewhere painter asked jason rushed ahead i took the liberty of gathering the database from your security team in charleston you asked them to collect video from the traffic and security cams around that restaurant and nothing came up right so i had linus collect similar data from the cameras in north charlestongathering video footage from all the vehicles passing through that neighborhood we took all that information and ran it through our new vehiclerecognition program and jason squeezed linuss shoulder he brought up sidebyside images on his monitor it showed two partial views of a nondescript ford suv jason continued i think our targets were purposefully avoiding traffic cams its not hard to do if you know which intersections are monitored and they would know that painter thought its their home turf we got these images off a couple of bank atm cameras the picture on the left was taken three blocks from the restaurant where dr cummings vanished the second crossed a bridge about four blocks from the clinic jason faced him theyre the same vehicle painter countered skeptically there are a lot of ford suvs on the road not that match the exact same pattern of wear and tear but i wanted to be sure thats why i called you over jason patted linus again his partner zoomed into the second image and set the footage in motion like i said the image is grainy but we enhanced it the best we could painter leaned closer the expanded view peered through a back window the shadowy figure of a man could be seenand beside him a woman though the features were far from clear she was definitely lighthaired similar profilebut it was more the way she carried herself the way she moved that made painters breath quicken hope surged in him its lisa i wasnt sure jason said i am what about kat painter asked other figures were in the car but they were just indistinct blurs i cant say for sure jason admitted and unfortunately we never did get a clear take on the license plate if theyd gone through a traffic cam it was unfortunate but it was also a start and more important lisas alive he took a deep breath not letting his relief overwhelm him knowing matters could change at any moment painter only had to look at the neighboring monitor at the fiery ruins of the clinic to remind himself again of the guilds scorchedearth policy the bastards would not leave loose ends and right now that was the definition of lisa and kat the same could be said of grays team they were penetrating the latest guild stronghold on the trail of the presidents daughter painter watched the last of the clinic buildings crumble into flame and smoke it was a fiery warning for gray too tread lightly july am gulf standard time off the coast of dubai they took amanda into this elevator tucker said gray stood with his hands on his hips he watched kane sniff along the floor the shepherds tail wagging vigorously he didnt doubt the dogs nose but he still hesitated the lobby bay had a dozen elevators banked in a semicircle he stared up following the spiraling curve of the translucent staircase both the elevators and the stairs ascended the central shaft of the burj abaadi each floor revolved around this stable core fifty floors kowalski said at least we dont have to climb each one but well need to stop at each one seichan said have kane see if amandas trail continues out onto any of those levels grays three teammates looked to him for their next step even kane stopped his sniffing to glance in his direction gray ignored them for a moment longer something doesnt make sense gray had studied each of the floors on the security cameras he saw no evidence of life up there but he had to trust kane the dog had gotten them this far settled he reached and hit the call button for the elevator the doors opened immediately they all stepped inside the posh lift appointed in rich exotic woods and crystal lighting so should we start at the top and work our way down tucker asked or the other way around neither gray said an edge of certainty hardening inside him as he bent down toward the elevators controls he pointed to the rows of buttons lined along a flat touchscreen display illuminated numbers designated each floor as he watched each numeral slowly transformed and rotated through various characters in other languages chinese japanese arabic definitely trying to appeal to the global traveler here i dont get it kowalski said if were not going up then where are we going gray watched the lowest button glow in arabic then it shifted to the english equivalent theres a lower level seichan said kowalski looked to his toes wait how could there be a basement on a floating island gray knew this tower had been built in conjunction with the islands construction the bedrock upon which the foundation of this tower had been placed was the immense platform holding up utopia that concreteandsteel stage lay approximately ten meters under them leaving plenty of space for a basement here must be a service level for the tower seichan said and maybe more gray added pressing the button the letter flashed green and the cage dropped silently so smoothly it was hard to tell they were moving at all be ready gray warned weapons appeared in hands tucker signaled his dog who lowered his haunches readying to spring it felt like the elevator dropped much farther than just one floor but at last the doors opened gray took a shooters stance and quickly inspected a small utilitarian lobby dimly lit and drab he searched for any guards but it appeared empty he stepped out cautiously leading the way hallways branched off with colordesignated lines painted on the floor likely to direct the hotel staff toward kitchens laundry facilities maintenance closets and storage spaces it looked like a maze down here gray waved everyone forward tucker have kane hunt for amandas trail she could be anywhere tucker set to work with his partner gray noted that two other elevators flanked this one it seemed only three of the twelve elevators came down to this level he had kowalski hold their door open in case they needed a fast exit a tall set of windows along one wall drew grays attention he moved closer and stared into a cavernous neighboring space the room was encased in concrete and climbed two stories high inside sat a row of massive turbine generators looking like oversize metal elephants control panels covered another wall the buildings power plant seichan said joining him gray remembered jack kirklands description of the tidal turbines that powered this building this must be them tucker came back after only a minute nothing he said gray turned around surprised what tucker shrugged kane checked all of the hallways leading out from here found no sign of amanda impossible she has to be down here have him check again he ordered ill do it but its a waste of time ill vouch for kanes nose hes right seichan argued coming down here made sense but that doesnt mean its the only path there are fifty other floors the longer we wait the more danger amanda faces he sighed heavily conceding to the logic but not happy about it back upstairs then the others piled inside the elevator gray paused at the threshold staring at the two doors that flanked this one hold on he stepped over pressed the call button and summoned the other two elevators what are you doing seichan asked from inside the cage as kowalski continued to hold the door open the other two elevators arrived gray inspected both cages he returned to the others and studied the touchscreen display in their lift what seichan pressed all three of these cages reach the service levels so why did amandas captors use the middle elevator human nature says they would have just gone to the one closest to the lobby gray pointed to the first set of doors i checked those other two this control panel is two inches longer than the others so kowalski asked seichan bent down and studied the lower section of the touch screen you think there are other buttons here hidden ones he nodded leading to restricted levels that only this elevator can reach seichan searched the edges of the screen but i dont see any keyholes or slots for pass cards to activate those levels gray hit the lobby button sending the cage back up demonstrating the screen is touchsensitive seichan got it her eyes smiling it could be keyed to a fingerprint gray stepped back into the lobby as the doors opened the soldier who kane took out he looked like he was the head of the security escort from africa he might have been granted access below gray turned to kowalski the big man rolled his eyes and sulked out mumbling under his breath why do i get all the dirty work he returned a minute later wiping a blade on his pants he held out his hand i brought both just in case resting on his palm were a thumb and a forefinger kowalski also carried the dead mans beret and tugged it on his head that guy was more my size he said and pointed toward the ceiling of the cage in case of any more cameras im not playing prisoner again gray took the severed thumb pressed it against the empty space below the ll button and kept it there he held his breaththen a new button bloomed to life under the thumb if he had any doubt before it ended as that odd symbol appeared gray flashed to somalia to running across the abandoned camp toward the tent cabin he remembered the same marking had been painted on the outside of the jungle hospital a crimson cross with tiny finial decorations along its crosspieces the cage fell again dropping much deeper now kowalskis face had a sick tint to it how far down did these pirates bury their treasure gray pictured the giant concrete pylons that supported the island the outer ones were twenty meters across but the centermost pylon the one directly under burj abaadi was far larger he knew that it was not uncommon for the support pillars of oil platforms to have caissons engineered in them hollow pockets used for storing oil so why not here too but instead of oil an entire base could be hidden inside a pillar this huge gray knew amanda was down there his doubt centered on a larger concern it weighed heavily as they dropped like a rock toward the heart of the island is she still alive am dr edward blake watched the sheen of hatred fade from amandas eyes as he injected the last of the propofol into her iv line her lids slid to halfmast her breathing deepened her last words had been a curse a promise of revenge i will see you both in hell but it was an impotent threat amanda the person the loving mother would be gone in a few more minutes all sentience would be wiped away leaving behind nothing but the most basic of functions you should scrub up petra said his nurse was already gowned and adjusting a monitor that showed amandas ct scan the young woman lay on a surgical table draped from the neck down her bald head gleaming under the surgical halogens overhead small blue markings decorated her scalp like so much scientific nomenclature tattooed in place the markings delineated the multiple drill sites and electrode insertion points petra prepared the stereotactic system for the pending surgery it integrated his surgical workstation with an intraoperative mri and microscopy setup for visualization she secured amandas head inside a fluidfilled alignment cuff a vast improvement from the older head frames that had to be screwed into a patients skull after working in the mountains of somalia and having to deal with tools that seemed antiquated in comparison edward felt a surge of childish joy at having such fine equipment to play with the station in somalia had served its purpose for the past few years allowing him to harvest eggs embryos and collect viable or promising subjects for the various other reproductive labs around the world but he had always had larger ambitions it was pure happenstance that amanda gantbennett had landed on his doorstep versus one of the many other reproductive facilities and eggcollection centers in india malaysia australia or countless other points around the globe it allowed him the opportunity to shine in the eyes of his superiors to climb higher up that ladder so far besides a few hiccups matters had been proceeding smashingly amandas death had been framed as an unfortunate encounter with somali pirates the child had been delivered and secured in the new hightech research lab here and after this last bloody bit of work amanda would be shipped off no longer his problem leaving him in peace to dissect and test the new research material the newborn slept in a small crib down the hall waiting his turn but first to attend to his mother an array of surgical instruments shone brightly drills bone curettes cranial rongeurs scalpels suction and irrigation tubing he couldnt help but be excited though the technique had been developed here he had only performed this procedure once a few of the regions reproductive scientists had been rotated through here to learn it but it had been fairly easy the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex were connected with a layer of neural tissue using the surgical imaging as guidance he would first perform a procedure known as a corpus callosotomy which cuts the brain into two halves it was a radical technique originally developed to treat severe epileptics to sever that wild flow of electricity through the brain which caused seizures the second stage of the procedure was one developed by another of his superiors agencies it was called Œ±ect or alphaalternating electroconvulsive therapy electrodes would be permanently inserted into the two severed hemispheres small electric shocks of alternate polarity would be administered to those two halves the resultant whirlwind of miniseizures trapped within either cranial hemisphere swirling in opposite polarities caused total shutdown of the cerebral cortex leaving only the brainstem functional which continued to control such vital tasks as heart rate and rhythm respiration even gastrointestinal activities in the end the body was left intact but the mind was gone a perfect tool for reproductive studies edward glanced one last time toward amandas prone form after this there would be no more amanda as he exited the surgical suite for the scrub room a chime sounded from a wall monitor overhead it was a security feature of the station announcing the arrival of the elevator every room had such a screen a name scrolled across the bottom of the monitor buggas abdiwalli it was the captain of edwards personal security force the screen showed a blackandwhite view of the tops of helmets and a black beret what does that bloody bugarse want now he wondered irritated using the slang for the mans name he knew the captain was in a foul mood after losing so many men back in somalia but edward didnt have time for this he would let security deal with buggas if the captain became obstinate the new automated systems would discourage him from putting up a fuss nothing could get through that layer of defense petras voice came over the intercom as he began scrubbing doctor were ready for you july am gulf standard time off the coast of dubai now comes the hard part gray prepared his team in the seconds before the elevator doors opened he expected another layer of security beyond a fingerprintcoded elevator key the guild was much too paranoid anyone could hold a member of their staff at gunpoint and force their way down here or cut off a finger no there had to be a second level of defense but grays team didnt have the luxury of planning which meant only one thing no time for subtlety only one man fit that job description and kowalski wasnt happy about it why the hell did i grab that bastards beret youll do fine gray said besides the beret kowalski also matched the height and bulk of the somali leader it wasnt much but they only needed the ruse to continue for a few seconds he had to trust that the guards down here were as confident in their safety on the island as the somalis had been earlier he didnt expect to catch the enemy napping or with their pants down but he could hope for some momentary carelessness gray pointed to tucker you and kane take point as soon as were through you dont wait you track amanda well be on your heels as soon as possible tucker rose from preparing his partner and nodded seichan had her sig sauer in her hand a chime sounded as the elevator settled to a stop with a small shudder of its cage gray waved everyone to the side as the doors rolled open keeping their faces shadowed by their stolen helmets except for kowalski the big guy was out of the elevator before it finished opening with the beret pulled low over his eyes he stalked ahead as if he owned the place in a single sweep gray took in the view beyond the doors a small security lobby sealed access to the rest of the facility the floor and walls were bare concrete gone was the opulence of above the ceiling was raw steel in a honeycomb pattern a single metal door opened off the space next to it rose a bulletproof window like those found at a bank only the teller here wore a black uniform and carried a rifle over his shoulder the guard didnt look up he leaned to a microphone present identification and place your palm on the reader a panel glowed atop a narrow counter a small drawer was shoved through the window and popped open awaiting papers kowalski reached and dropped a fistful of marblesize pellets into the tray curious the guard finally looked up with the heel of his hand kowalski slammed the drawer back to the other side he pressed a transceiver in his other fist the c pelletsnormally used for blowing deadbolts and locksexploded in the guards face and chest his body went flying back a smoking ruin kowalski was already in motion spinning to the side and slapping a square of c against the steel door fire in the hole he bellowed kowalski dove back into the elevator ducking with the others to the side the explosion rocked the cage deafened their covered ears gray rolled out into the smoke inspecting the damage the remains of the door glowed a fiery red through the pall spatters of molten steel splashed the walls and floor the air stung with a chemical signature that wasnt just c he glanced at kowalski who shrugged my own recipe added polymercoated thermateth to the c gray inwardly cringed thermate was the primary ingredient in incendiary grenades used for cutting through tank armor but overkill or not kowalski had gotten the job doneand gray hadnt asked for subtlety nothing moved beyond the doorway he spotted bodies back there but to be certain the way was clear gray tossed two flashbang grenades into the outer hall everyone looked away and covered their ears the flashbangs eruptedthen gray gave tucker his signal dog and handler burst across the room avoiding the molten pools of steel on the floor gray and the others followed weapons ready then the sky began to fall hexagonal pieces of the roof rained down from above clattering to the floor gray thought they were just ceiling tiles shaken loose by the blast then those tiles sprouted legssteel articulated razorsharp appendagesand came swarming at them like a horde of metal spiders am doctor petra stood frozen by the tray of instruments she had been prepping the neuroendoscope when the first thunderous blast sounded then an even louder detonation rocked through the facility rattling everything in the room including edwards nerves his first thought was that the concrete walls of the pillar had given way that worry always lurked in the back of his mind immobilized by terror edward remained at his workstation fully gowned and masked he had been manipulating and aligning the microrobotic arm and its fine cranial drill getting ready to start additional smaller explosions continued were under attack petra said looking to him for guidance her words finally shattered through his shock they had to get out of herebut not emptyhanded not without their hardearned prize if they survived without the newborn in their possession the backlash would be deadly the child he said locking eyes with petra we still need him alive for now grab him well make for an evacuation station she dropped the endoscope turned toward the door then back again what about the patient her eyes flicked in the direction of amanda not important the voice on the phone had all but admitted it the young woman could be replacedbut not the child we have all of her tissue and blood samples that should be enough ill grab those you see to the child still edward hated to leave matters unsettled he picked up a scalpel stared at his hand then placed the instrument gently back down he couldnt muster the strength to do it himself not by his own hand he turned back to the workstation and activated the laseraligned trajectory preset into the machine the robotic arm began its slow descent the drill whining into a fierce whirr the burrs path into the cerebral cortex was already plottedonly now no one would be here to stop it as it penetrated deeper and deeper like a slow bullet through the skull this is better he consoled himself she wont feel a thing with everything in order edward abandoned his workstation and rushed for the door a final glance behind him showed the tip of the drill burr piercing the small blue x marked on amandas skull a drop of blood welled and rolled down her scalp like a crimson tear goodbye amanda am gray fled through a hellish landscape of black smoke and fiery molten metal made even worse by the horde of metallic hunters scrabbling toward him racing atop legs as sharp as daggers kowalski crushed one of the hunters under his boot the legs splayed out like a squashed spiderthen reversed themselves swinging up and latching onto kowalskis boot the legs began sawing through the leather seichan went to his aid cutting free his bootlaces in a single thrust of her throwing dagger she pointed to the wall kowalski kicked his leg sending his footwear and the clinging spider flying gray held others off with his pistol knocking them back with each shot together they retreated through the molten remains of the door creating a fiery choke point against the hunters kowalski tried to bring his rifle to bear hopping on one bloody foot but gray pointed down the hall go after tucker well hold them off here kowalski didnt have to be told twice mumbling hate friggin spiders seichan popped off a couple of shots with her sig sauer must be some sort of automated defense system he agreed he had expected the base to have builtin countermeasuresbut never this he knew darpa was working on research projects along these lines an experimental program to develop robotic swarms for coordinated attack surveillance and defensive systems hed seen footage from a university in england where theyd successfully developed such a swarm and it wasnt just small robots hed witnessed the completion of a cheetahsize robot in a darpa lab that could run faster than a human likely the countermeasures here at the base were meant to hunt distract and stall the enemy until a security team could mobilize still the automatons by themselves were deadly enough and bullets hardly slowed them down here they come seichan warned a wave of razoredged steel came crashing toward them am tucker tore down the hallway chasing after kanes tail he strained for the sound of any threat eyes unblinking breath shallow but he didnt have to rely on his senses alone a growl reached his ears a warning a man in a white lab coat stepped into the hallway ahead raising an arm tucker shot him in the face as he rushed past the man he saw his hands were empty a twinge of guilt flickeredbut it quickly died the two other people hed already shot had been holding weapons he couldnt take the chance besides after all hed seen in the past minute no one down here deserved to take another breath hed passed lab after lab saw things he wished he could unsee a chill remained at the base of his spine picturing the disembodied head hanging from a rack above a beating heart who the hell does something like that and why kane continued his headlong rush his nose sniffing at corners or in the air he had found amandas scent finally kane skidded to a stop sliding a couple of feet then returning to a closed door tucker met his partner there a tiny window revealed a long washbasin a wall of sterilized green packs and packets of cellophanesealed scrub brushes a surgical prep room amandas trail led here that earlier chill spread up his spine holding his pistol at the ready he shouldered through the door and scanned the space for any hostiles empty but a wide window looked into a neighboring surgical suite a woman lay sprawled and draped atop a stainlesssteel table her upper body locked into some device a robotic arm vibrated above her shaved head amanda he had studied the photo of the presidents daughter well enough to recognize her from her features alone kane pawed at the door into the operating theater he knew the truth too tucker hurried into the surgical room finding the place otherwise deserted a whirring buzz drew his attention back to amanda he stepped to her side aghast as he recognized the source of the noise blood flowed in a thick rivulet from a drill bit burrowing into her skull he dashed around the table unsure what to do kane danced at his side reading his anxiety but not knowing how to help its okay buddy he assured his friend but it was far from okay tucker followed the electrical cord from the robotic arm to a workstation not knowing what else to do he yanked out the wall plug the whining drone died away tucker studied amanda watching her chest rise and fall at least shes still alive he studied the length of steel still embedded in her head he had to free her but how he dared not yank that drill free or risk more damage to her skull he searched around and saw what looked like a miniature set of bolt cutterssurgical pin cutters he grabbed them up positioned them along the shaft of the burr about an inch from amandas skull and pinched the cutters closed a loud snap and she was free of the robotic arm next tucker set about detaching her from the cushioned head clamp and unhooking her from the anesthetic machine focused on the task he was startled to hear a voice ask whats that sticking out of her head he swung around kowalski limped toward him on a bloody foot how did you find me tucker asked followed the trail of dead bodies then saw him in the hall kane panted at the doorway guarding tuckers back as usual making sure no hostiles crept up on him kowalski again pointed to amandas skull what is that a drill bit what why how the hell do i know just help me i got her kowalski stepped over and scooped amanda into his arms as if she weighed no more than a scarecrow and maybe thats all she isa scarecrow with no brain either way she needed help where are gray and seichan tucker asked collecting his dog kowalski headed toward the door with amanda trust me youre better off not knowing am seichan and gray retreated farther down the hall away from the silvery horde as it crashed against the fiery melted doorway a brush against the molten metal incinerated several of the automatons those that made it past then did a strange thing they circled and returned to the doorway ignoring gray and seichan for the moment the horde remained clustered at the doorway scrabbling over the redhot metal attacking it burning themselves even melting into the molten remains of the door its the heat seichan said thats what draws them they must be programmed to hunt body heat and it seemed any hot source would do beyond the doorway gray watched several of them rushing to the molten patches of steel on the floor destroying themselves but as the steel began to cool the occasional automaton tried to skitter their way a few wellplaced rounds discouraged such trespassing seichan glanced back should we start looking the entire world shook with a sonic boom strong enough to knock gray to one knee after that thunderous eruption a strong vibration persisted humming strongly enough to make his back molars ache a change in air pressure made his ears pop seichan shared a glance with gray the fear in her eyes matched his own a few inches of water suddenly flowed into the hallway as if from a burst pipe gray pictured the pylon that hid this base it was really just one monstrous pipe more icy water began surging swirling kowalski appeared around a corner of the hall splashing toward them holding an unconscious woman in his arms her head lolled toward gray as kowalski shifted her higher in his arms despite the lack of hair he immediately recognized her amanda shes alive but they didnt have time to celebrate whats happening kowalski hollered tucker and kane followed him both looking equally concerned seichan bent down dipped a finger and tasted it salty that left no doubt theyve busted their own pipe gray said and pointed to the elevator place is flooding out now am we often give our enemies the means to our own destruction edward remembered that quote from aesop learned back in his eton college days when he was a young boy though taken out of context now it still felt apt as he watched the annihilation from the window of the small evacuation boat the airlocksealed boats were positioned like blisters along the circumference of the center pylon tracks ran up the outside of the column and across the underside of the support platform traveling out along the five arms of the staruntil they were jettisoned free of the island patrols already awaited the evacuees arrival especially the precious cargo edward held in his lap the newborn swaddled warmly and mewling softly held so much promise both for those edward served and himself the child was insurance that he would be saved from a watery grave he had placed a frantic call upon securing the child reporting the attack but word had already reached the source of that cold computerized voice matters are being taken care of ensure the child is safe he intended to do just that he stared out the window the boat could hold ten people but he and petra had the vessel to themselves beyond the boat the world was as dark as the deepest cavern he had watched the flashes of blue lightning along the length of the central pylon as they made their escape the explosive charges shattering the steel inside the concrete walls weakening the entire structure the immense mass of the tower above would continue that destruction pulverizing and crushing all beneath it and it wasnt just this one pylon out in the darkness blue lightning bloomed and burst across the forest of stone out there corrupting the entire understory of the island thunder echoed and shook their boat for a moment the world beyond appeared like an electric forest in the night wondrous to behold breathtaking in its devastation he remembered another proverb as he stared pining for the simpler times of his youth all good things must come to an end am run gray yelled and pointed to the elevator together the team slogged through calfdeep icy water kowalski hauled amanda highstepping his way wary of any straggling steel spiders in the lobby but the last of the automatons had succumbed to the icy flood they made it to the elevators which still had powerbut for how long gray hit the call button to open the doors another violent quake shook the facility accompanied by a muffled boom as something gave way a surge of water rolled down the hallway funneling toward them building power the doors opened too slowly the wave of water hit them driving them into the cage they were waistdeep in seconds the cold cut to the bone already shivering seichan hurried and pressed the lobby button gray held his breath they all stared up silently praying the motors still had power he pictured the turbines hed seen abovethe key word being above the main power generators should still be high and dry this proved to be the case as the elevator began to rise the water level steadily drained as the cage lifted out of the rising flood they all let out a loud sigh of relief a soft groan rose from amanda as the effects of the anesthetic began to wear off a promising sign despite the piece of surgical drill still lodged in her skull once safe they could attempt a mighty shake threw them all to one side of the cage again grays ears popped a low rumble rose beneath them growing louder sounding like a freight train hurling straight at them he pictured a column of water chasing up the elevator shaft as the pylons caisson finally imploded beneath them were passing the service levels seichan said reaching a hand to his forearm squeezing all her hope into that rockhard grip almost there they should be safe once the elevator climbed above sea level and reached the dry lobby above then the lights went out their ascent came to a shaky stop kowalski swore brightly in the darkness the generators seichan whispered the floodwaters must have swamped that leveland continued to rise the roar of the freight train grew to a howl beneath them hold on gray shouted a force struck the underside of the carriage driving the cage up the shaft in a bonejarring rattling ascent at least they were headed in the right directionbut for how long tucker help me get the doors open gray knew they would have only one chance once the powerful surge receded the cage would go crashing back down with it with urgency firing their efforts the two forced the elevator open the walls of the shaft blurred past themthen the outerlobby doors sprang into view the cage settled to a bobbling shaking stop there balanced on the tip of a powerful fountain but only for a moment water flooded into the open cage swamping the space and causing it to slowly sink hurry gray and tucker hauled on the outerlobby doors cracking them wide enough for the others to evacuate seichan helped kowalski with amandas limp form all the while the cage continued to flood and submerge deeper tucker used a free arm to push kane through the shrinking doorwaythen nodded to gray they were both chestdeep in water only half the cage was still at the lobby level go tucker said together gray argued they didnt have the luxury of counting to threeboth simply dove through the opening their feet pulling free of the cage just as it sank away down the shaft behind them gray helped tucker stand they sloshed a few steps relieved to be alive seichan crouched by kowalski examining amanda checking her condition when she stood she wore a worried look what gray asked shes had her baby tucker splashed closer but her bellys still big was bigger i guess kowalski carried her to the steps to get her out of the water shes early seichan said either stress caused her to deliver prematurely or they induced her to get the baby tucker stared toward the flooded elevator his face crushed with guilt i didnt know if i had i couldve searched longer tried to find the baby gray placed a hand on his shoulder we barely made it out as it was if youd delayed even another minute amanda could have died we all could have died and theres no saying the baby was born alive or maybe he was already evacuated out tucker looked little comforted by this logic and stared at the door his dog came up and nudged his hand with his nose tucker rubbed the side of kanes face finding solace there instead of words gray turned away splashing acrosssplashing he stared down at his feet still ankledeep in water why is it still flooded up here its not just here seichan said from a few yards away she pointed across the lobby to the glass entrance of the burj abaadi gray stared out shocked the starlit park beyond the tower was flooded black waves washed through the trees and crashed against the steps of the tower he understood immediately the guild never took halfmeasures when it came to covering their tracks they hadnt just shattered the one support pylon as a failsafe they had shattered all of them he knew what that meant a dreadful and frightening truth the whole island is sinking july pm est orangeburg south carolina theyd been on the road for an hour heading west out of charleston kat noted a sign that read orangeburg her captorsthe head of the fertility clinic dr paul cranston and his three menkept mostly to the back roads racing at speeds too fast for the rural areas cranston spent most of the trip on his cell phone kat eavesdropped but she learned little from his end of the conversations plainly he and the others still didnt know what had happened at the clinic didnt know the true source of that fiery destruction sat in the backseat of their ford explorer kat wasnt about to fill him in but from the glance over his shoulder cranston clearly suspected the cause but apparently any questions would wait until they reached their destination she gleaned that last bit of intelligence from a phone conversation moments later cranston sat straighter for that call the perpetual edge of disdain in his voice gone his tone turned subservient frightened well bring them both straightaway whoever lurked at the other end of the line left the man shaking and ashen cranston sat for several long minutes cell phone on his lap not moving staring dully out the window at the passing cotton and tobacco fields eventually he snapped out of it and made one last call to his wife im fine sweetheart i wasnt even at the clinic when the fire broke out maybe a gas leak i know i know but i have a slew of other fires still to put out give michael a kiss for me tell him ill be back in a couple of days for the parade and fireworks on the fourth whats that yeah sorry im losing signal i didnt hear what you oh never mind he finally surrendered as reception died out in the backcountry as kat listened she found it hard to couple this devoted family man to the horrors hidden beneath that research facility still the conversation awakened pangs of longing for her own family monk should be getting the babies ready for bed about now tucking penny into her footy pajamas harriet into her crib with a mobile of bears hanging above it she thought of monk sliding his arm around her waist after they both settled down pulling her close content to be surrounded by his girls as if sensing her thoughts lisa squeezed her hand kat appreciated the gesture but she intended to return to monks armswhich meant getting free first the opportunity to accomplish that grew shorter with every passing mile once they reached their destinationthe lodgeshe suspected escape would be impossible still she had to be patient she needed the right moment the right opportunity at last she got it the suv turned onto a long lonely stretch of rural road not a car in sight the summer sun sat low on the horizon creating deep pools of shadows under the heavylimbed oaks that lined the road she gave lisas hand an extrahard squeeze preparing her i have to go to the bathroom kat declared loudly cranston dismissed her youll wait i wont im going noweither outside or back here cranston twisted in his seat eyeing her judging her determination she didnt break eye contact his gaze flicked to the lonely road around them then he sighed fine stop the car his next words were for one of the guards she runs you shoot her the ford pulled to the shoulder of the road kat gave lisas hand a small tug trying to get her to understand lisa tightened her fingers i should go too if were stopping anyway good girl youll take turns cranston said im not taking any chances they piled out of the backseat on the drivers side leaving the two men up front one gunman kept a grip on lisas upper arm resting a palm on his holstered pistol kat hiked off to the shadows beneath an oak thats far enough cranston yelled out the open window her guard had his pistol out emphasizing the order she squatted in the weeds and slipped her shorts down after all of the drugs in her system her bladder had been begging for relief the guard watched she stared right back at him challenging him once finished she stood back up and headed toward the roadside the guard kept his pistol pointed maintaining his distance the other gunman pushed lisa toward the field your turn be quick about it that was all kat needed she swung her arm sharply flicking out her wrist the hidden baton extended to its full length she might be out of range of the guardbut the baton wasnt back on the streets of charleston kat had taken the weapon from amy after hiding her body behind the recycling bin she had concealed the collapsed length of the baton in the small of her back tucked into the waistband of her shortsthen tossed her pistol out appearing unarmed she had wanted lisa a safe distance away from her captors before acting to wait for their guard to lower like now kat cracked the batons hard length across the guards wrist breaking bone the pistol tumbled from his fingertips already diving forward kat caught the weapon before it hit the pavement she landed on her shoulder and rolled already firing she blasted the guard in the knee twisted to shoot the other gunman in the head then back to her guard finishing him off with a round through his throat kat lunged to the car her attack had been so sudden so savage the driver barely had time to react she shoved her gun through the open window and fired pointblank into the side of his head skull fragments and blood splattered across the front seat striking cranston across chest and face the doctor sat stunned one hand held up palm open the other clutched an open cell phone sorry bastard no signal kat wasnt taking any chances with him the good doctor had answers sigma needed she intended to deliver him to painter all trussed up and tied with a bow its our turn to drive pm lisa guided the ford explorer down the country road trying her best to ignore the gore still staining the seat as a medical doctor she seldom found herself squeamish but the raw brutality of kats attack still shook her prior to today she had known kat mainly as a mother or a strategist working alongside painter shed never witnessed kats skill in the field her pure animal cunning and savagery though that trait had won them their freedom it still unnerved her that and the cold blood seeping through the seat of her dress after the roadside attack kat had forced cranston to haul the bodies into a ditch to hide them from direct sight of the road though it looked rarely traveled which was turning out to be a problem any signal yet lisa asked no kat answered from the backseat her friend crouched behind cranston a pistol in one hand the doctors cell phone in the other cranston still sat in the front passenger seat his wrists ziptied to the headrest behind him an awkward stress position but kat ignored his protests beyond that cold professionalism lisa recognized a glimmer of hatred in kats eyes while not getting the full story concerning what had happened at the north charleston fertility clinic lisa understood enough to know whom to blame cranston was a monster hiding behind a handsome face and one with great ambitions there should be a signal by now kat said but im still not getting any reception after commandeering the vehicle kat had ordered lisa to turn the suv around and backtrack along their path she wanted to reach a phone or get close enough to a cell tower to regain reception some farmhouses off to the right lisa offered we can turn in and ask for help they might alert the local authorities i dont know who to trust out here lisa remembered painter expressing the same concern the gants owned much of south carolina who knew how far that reach extended into local law enforcement look lisa pointed ahead theres a sign for a turnoff to orangeburg surely that town must get cell signal head that way kat agreed but she kept searching around the vehicle with a suspicious look lisa made that turn and traveled a halfmile off in the distance the steeple of a church poked above the tree line that had to be the town of orangeburg too focused on the horizon lisa glided through an intersection with a flashing red light a small drawbridge crossed a hidden river a warning gate began to drop across its entrance she pulled to a stop in front of it as she waited for the drawbridge to open lisa asked anything now nothing in the rearview mirror kats eyes fixed at the back of cranstons head hed been unusually quiet for the past five minutes no further complaints about his wrists a low rumble announced the raising of the bridgebut then got louder and louderbecoming more like a thumping lisa frowned concerned about the worn mechanics of the old bridge kats reaction was rougher she jerked upright and threw her cell phone out the window she clutched lisas shoulder at the same time get us out of here now the warning came too late a sleek militarygray helicopter burst out of hiding from the riverbed to the left it lofted high over the bridge lisa yanked the car into reverse and jammed the gas she raced backward to the intersection fishtailed the car a full and was ready to speed offbut the helicopter was faster the chopper cut them off plunging out of the sky to block the road lisa braked avoiding a collision with the whirling blades rotor wash beat at the fords windshield a bullhorn roared throw your weapons clear of the vehicle exit with your hands up to make sure the order was understood a small gun mounted on the choppers underside chattered and a spate of rounds blasted into the pavement in front of the suv lisa turned to kat she shook her head do what they say into that stunned silence cranston smiled ladies youre not the only ones allowed surprises he awkwardly swiveled around back there i disabled my phones cellular receiver and activated an emergency satellite beacon built into the phone turning it into a tracking device lisa realized no wonder kat jettisoned the phone cranston frowned though i have to say the emergency response was faster than i expected apparently my employers truly dont want you to escape but why who the hell are you kat raised the pistol to his ear youll never know his eyes got huge as the pistol exploded shattering away half his face lisa cringed from the sudden brutality her ears ringing as kat tossed the weapon through the window still lisa heard the fierce whisper that followed that was for amy pm washington dc painter sat in kats chair rubbing his eyes the faint smell of jasmine that hung in the air was no longer evident maybe it had faded away with everyone bustling in and out of the office or maybe hed just become desensitized to the scent either way he felt a nagging sense of loss a foreboding youre just exhausted he tried to convince himself jason and linus continued their work searching for any other sightings of the ford painter had played that grainy footage over and over again watching the shadowy shape shift frame by frame knowing it was lisa he was relieved to find her still alive but the longer that silence stretched with no further word on kat and lisas true fate the deeper that icy knife twisted in his gut he forced his eyes to stare once more at the map on the monitor it displayed south carolina along with parts of north carolina and georgia large swaths of red stood out from the green background the crimson areas were landholdings of the gant family painter suspected lisa and kat were hidden somewhere in that crimson field which presented a major challenge the gant family had arrived on the shores of the carolinas a century before the founding of this country settling in the city of charles town which later became simply charleston wealth and power grew rapidly channeled through the financial support of the familys old world connections in both france and england as that family grew so did its reach and influence branching into universities governments military institutions and banking circles and much of that wealth turned into land it was said back at the turn of the century that the gants could ride horseback from one side of the state to the otherfrom the beaches of charleston across the lowcountry counties and up to the blue ridge mountainsall without ever stepping foot off their own property today the gants could drive a herd of cattle across the state and make that same claim painter rubbed his temples overwhelmed by the wealth and power that opposed his small group how could they hope to succeed against a force so entrenched and if the enemy ever did learn sigma was still investigating them in secret what would their next response be he could guess the answer in bc rome destroyed carthage by sacking the place burning the city enslaving the survivors and salting the very earth to make sure nothing ever grew there again painter expected something worse than that jason carter appeared at his door ever his shadow director you asked me to let you know when i finished that special project youre done already on our computer but i might have to demonstrate painter stood from the chair and relinquished it to kats chief analyst the kid hurried over and dropped into the seat he tapped rapidly and brought up the genealogical map of the gant clan painter had asked for his expert assistance at building a more detailed version one set to his specific parameters from the very beginning something had been troubling him about the gant family tree a nagging sense that he was missing a vital detail he began to suspect the problem but he didnt know what it signified or if it meant anything at all the only way to make sure was to construct a genealogical representation where no detail was left out he wanted the complete pictureand asked jason to prepare it heres the lineage you originally assembled jason said with a click of the mouse the threedimensional schematic of the gant family tree appeared progeny and familial connections formed a monumental tapestry a weaving and warping of heredity and genealogy that spanned two centuries back to the founding of the country it was hard to get reliable records much earlier than that but apparently not for jason okay director i know what you asked for but i took the liberty of also searching back another centuryjust to be thorough i want to clone this kid painter leaned closer and you were still able to expand the search to the sides jason nodded painter had spent hours studying that chart finally gleaning what nagged him certain tendrils of the chart showed familial lines that wove in and out of the main genealogical matrix marking distant cousins marrying back into the family for such a rich family it wasnt unusual a typical inbreeding of power and blood among aristocrats but those loose threads in the gant familys tapestry troubled him because there seemed to be too many of them even for such a rich dynasty a suspicious fraying of the cloth painter couldnt help but pick at those threads to see what they might reveal he asked jason to stretch the genealogical search to the sides of the main family tree to follow all of those loose threads he also instructed him to look for new ones specifically lines of the family that strayed even farther from the fold farther than merely distant cousins before diving and returning to the gant bosom show me painter ordered be prepared the chart is vast no individual names will show up just data points do it jason tapped a few keys and that original matrix painter constructed shrunk to a size of a fist names dwindled away to become nodes of a network stars in a galaxy around that galactic core a hazy corona of new data points and fine lines appeared scintillating into existence on the screen surrounding yet incorporated into the whole painter brushed his fingertips across the new spiral arms of this galaxy and all of these extensions mark where a strand of the family tree shot away from the others only to eventually return again jason confirmed the average deviation was two generations but a few of those lines broke away for five or six generations a couple of the prodigal relatives returning to the family were seventeenth or eighteenth cousins but return they did like moths around a lamp painter said fluttering out then diving back in again over and over again jason shrugged i can probably confirm this is excessive even for a prominent family like the gants but itll take time to work up a comparable dynasty still im not sure what the significance is painter wasnt eitherbut his breathing deepened adrenaline flowing as he balanced on the edge of a precipice something his eyes remained glued to the screen as the matrix slowly spun in place he sensed there was a pattern hidden inside that hazy cloud at the edges of the genealogical map he just needed a key to unlock it what am i missing july am gulf standard time off the coast of dubai gray slogged through the chestdeep water toward the entrance to the burj abaadi the others waited by the stairs ready to flee up to escape the rising waters beyond the glass wall the city of utopia slowly drowned a few buildings still shone with emergency lights run on batteries otherwise the island was dark black waves swept across the park crashing against the tower steps dangerous debris floated everywhere spare lumber plastic trash buckets even a toppled palm still potted in its crate the currents were equally hazardous gray pictured the entire platform sinking crushing the damaged pylons beneath its weight in the time it took gray to cross the lobby the water rose another foot they needed a way to escape the flooding tower before the islands descent became a fast plummetor worse the entire platform started to cant and tip toppling buildings over like a waiter dumping a tray of tall glasses he didnt know if jack kirkland was alive if hed survived the pyrotechnics that blew out the understory of the platform gray had activated the homing beacon jack had given him hoping for the best and left it with kowalski who still carried amanda but gray wasnt counting on hope alone he stared at his goal beyond the doors of the tower it stood across the park the roof of the yellow hummerthe one theyd hid behind earlierwas still above water for the moment but that wasnt grays target they werent going to be driving off this island beyond the bulk of the truck the matching yellow jet boat bobbed the rising waters had floated it off of its trailer straps still tethered it in place but someone hadnt properly ratcheted the boat down gray had a dagger strapped to his wrist ready to cut the craft the rest of the way loose he hoped he could get the boat started but if nothing else at least it floated he would take that versus clinging to debris at the whim of the eddying currents and riptides reaching the entrance he shouldered into one of the doors swinging the halfsubmerged barrier open proved a challenge against the weight of water but it slowly budged he got it wide enough to slip outside the buffeting currents tried to rip him from his perch atop the steps that led down to the park all that held him in place was his iron grip on the door handle a shout drew him around he stared back into the lobby seichan stood with the others on the stairs the waters continued to chase them up the spiraling steps and appeared to be rising faster now grays toes could barely touch the surface of the marble floor but it was more than the encroaching flood that concerned her her arm pointed out toward the city lights she called coming this way gray turned hanging by his arm from the handle down the wide central avenue that ran along one leg of the star a trio of lights came racing toward the burj abaadi they wove back and forth in a zigzagging search pattern speedboats gray doubted they were a rescue operation not on this island not with who truly ran this place more likely it was a contingent from the fleet that patrolled the waters around the island someone must have sent them to make sure there were no survivors of the assault on the hidden station stay out of sight gray called to seichan keep moving if necessary acknowledging this she waved the group farther up the spiral stairs with time running out gray eyed his bobbing target and dove into the surging waters the currents tugged and hauled dragging and throwing his body but once away from the wave actions churning against the walls of the tower the strength of the tides ebbed he popped his head clear sighted his target and swam with strong kicks submerged obstacles turned out to be the bigger challenge as he headed across the park his leg became tangled in the branches of a drowned tree and he had to fight his way loose all the while he kept an eye on the approaching boats he realized he would never reach the hummer before the patrol arrived at the tower still the waters were dark and the flotsam plentiful with care he might not be seen bobbing amid the debris he would wait until the patrol left before freeing the boat and rescuing his teammates at least that was the plan until flares streaked into the sky rising from the speedboats and burst above the flooded park new stars were born up there hovering on small chutes blazing with crimson fire turning night into a hellish twilight and the waters a dark ruddy hue gray searched for cover before the boats got here a long low crate floated ten yards off slowly spinning in an eddy offering some shelter he kicked toward it sweeping with his arms the whining scream of the engines grew in volume he reached the crate and grabbed an edge catching his breath he kept his eyes on the boats as they rode out of the flooded avenue and into the drowned park the trio fanned out from there he hugged closer to his meager shelter with the enemy splitting up he would have to be careful to ensure the bulk of the crate remained between him and the patrol at all times he clung to the edge and kicked with his feet dragging the box with him careful not to move too fast trying to maintain the illusion of another piece of flotsam then a pair of boats angled toward him splitting to either sidenot with intent just poor luck on his part he slipped underwater and moved beneath the crate his hands blindly sought the underside of the box to hold himself steady until the boats passed but as he searched his palms found no bottom to the crate it was open on the underside reaching up he felt a pocket of air he rose into it and took a deep breath in the darkness his fingers discovered soft cushioned fabric lining the inside he suddenly knew where he hid he pictured the casket used to transport amanda here resting in the back of a pickup truck it must have been washed out of the rear bed the lid ripped off the waters lightened to either side as the two boats swept by with their headlamps shining after they passed gray continued his swim across the park hidden beneath the casket he didnt know if this mode of transportation was good luck or a bad omen still he forged on slowly floating his way toward the boat hopefully the patrol would be gone once he got there after another half minute of silence gray risked ducking back outside to gauge his trajectory across the park as his head cleared the water a thunderous scream jerked him around he stared back toward the burj abaadi the trio of boats faced the entrance from the center one a streak of smoke cut through the bloodtinged night and slammed into the multistory glass fa√ßade the explosion of a rocketpropelled grenade shattered into the lobby sheets of glass fell from above like a hundred shimmering guillotines opening a wide chasm a pair of the engines whined into a roar and two of the boats swept through that gap and into the dark lobby once they were inside another flare burst like a red sun gray hoped the others had taken cover and that the patrol would only make a cursory pass before exiting the tower in the meantime he had his own mission before he could turn away an eerie vibration shuddered through the water the surface of the lake trembled with a low groan the world began plunging down all around them towers sank faster floor by floor the last of the treetops vanished under the waves trapped air bubbled out everywhere the last drowning gasp of utopia across the park the blasted hole in the fa√ßade of the burj abaadi had shrunk to a lowering archway as the tower submerged a single boat came racing through the occupants ducking under the fangs of broken glass the second boat got trapped inside circling futilely behind the glass as the hole closed the patrols on the outside tried to fire another rocket but by the time they readied a shot the entire lobby had sunk away gray swung around taking advantage of the distraction knowing the crews would be focused on their trapped companions the hummer and jet boat were gone vanished fully underwater reaching where they had sunk he took a huge breath kicked his legs over his head and dove down through the fiery surface waters far below stretched only darkness gray strained for those black depths am seichan fought for more height below a rising flood chased her and the others swallowing the spiraling stairs beneath them but that wasnt all a few floors down dark shadows pounded their way up their panicked flight lit by the shine of a few emergency bulbs the trapped crew of the patrol boat sought the same escape they did running for higher ground staying ahead of the cresting water seichan wanted to put three floors between her team and the water table before abandoning the stairs and trying to reach the far windows on one of these levels but she had another problem she was thoroughly turned around with the power out the tower levels had stopped rotating and settled into a haphazard corkscrew floors stuck out in all directions on top of that the dizzying spiral of the staircase left her disoriented she no longer had any idea which side of the building she was supposed to meet gray a gunshot echoed up from below she scowled at the source the fleeing patrol first what did the bastards think they could hit and second fuck you very much but if they wanted to play that game she wouldnt mind eliminating a few worries kowalski do it anything you say he still lugged amanda over one shoulder but he reached to a pocket as he ran he let the pellets he collected dribble between his fingers falling away like a trail of bread crumbs onto the steps she watched between her toes and waited until the shadows below reached the littered section of stairs now she yelled kowalski pressed his transceiver igniting the last of his c pellets the blast took out the point man and the survivors retreated from the shattered gap in the glass staircase they were trapped with no other way up sorry fellas you started this war she continued her maddening flight up the steps after a few more turns she heard screams rise from below she used their cries to judge the distance to that drowning flood either the waters were rising faster or their pace was slowing whichever the case they were losing this footrace next level she shouted to tucker take that one find the shortest path to the outer windows reaching that floor seichan raced after the handler and his dog a silent prayer on her lips tucker turned into a long hall over here he yelled a balcony at the end shoot out the lock seichan hollered back they needed every second she sprinted trailed by kowalski to the mans credit he kept up even burdened by amandas weight he was a veritable draft horse gunshots blasted ahead she reached tucker and kane as the man hauled open the sliding glass door a wide balcony beckoned they all fled out onto it seichan moved to the rail the rising water churned one floor down if they had to jump she feared two things if they didnt leap far enough the undertow caused by the plunging tower would drag them all down and even if they cleared that danger these rough seas had sharksand not only the ones with fins a patrol boat drifted to the right not far from the park they would never be able to swim fast enough to escape it and their splashes would likely draw the crews attention seichan searched the drowning city where are you gray am cmon cmon running out of air gray blindly sawed at the nylon strap with his knife it had taken him too long to find the boat as it hung in the dark depths still tethered to the trailer the positive buoyancy of the vessel had locked the tiedowns tight there was no unclipping them from their bolts hed already cut the straps at the bow once free the boats nose rose toward the surface hanging vertical still anchored at the stern keeping one hand on the transom he worked at that rear strap of the tiedown pressure built in his ears as the island sank deeper dragging him and the boat farther underwater as his air began to give out he sawed frantically stubborn piece of a light flared overhead brightening the waters a dark shadow idled into view on the surface limned against the glow of its own lamps and accompanied by the slow putter of its engines gray waited despite the screaming burn in his lungs once the shadow was directly overhead gray cut through the last of the tiedowns freed the jet boat torpedoed upward becoming a buoyancypropelled battering ram am seichan watched the speedboat drift closer coming within fifty yards of the tower one of the crew shouted another pointed a rifle her team had been spotted a blast echoed over the water the round ricocheted off the balcony railing seichan ducked she and the others were too exposed on the balcony but where could they go the waters roaring up the side of the tower promised only a quick death by drowning she took potshots back at the boatthen an antediluvian monster blasted out of the sea and rammed into the edge of the speedboat the force cracked the hull and flipped the boat tossing the crew out of their seats nearby the monster settled to its carbonfiber keel resting on the water it was the yellow jet boat gray popped up beside it he had his sig sauer in hand and fired at the floundering men hitting three of them the fourth already floated facedown nearby the cracked hull of the speedboat flooded and sank into the depths gray seichan shouted and waved an arm he turned to face herjust as a second speedboat flew around the tower to the left drawn by the gunfire it raced under the balcony spraying machinegun fire up at it they all flattened but seichan knew they werent the assaults true target the patrol was only knocking them back to pass beneath them and go after easier prey move it gray am gray hauled himself over the side of the jet boat and sprawled flat on the deck making himself a harder target the second speedboat came shooting around the curve of the burj abaadi gunfire shattered the marble off the balcony fa√ßade his teammates ducked awayexcept for one as the boat sailed under the sinking balcony a sleek shape vaulted into view back paws kicking off the railing for extra distance kane flew across the short gap and landed in the midst of the four patrolmen the effect was the same as if a grenade had been tossed into the boat one man flung himself overboard in fright and got chewed up by the frothing riptide of the sinking tower kane latched onto the throat of another the driver screamed yanked the wheel and in a panic drove the boat at full speed into an uprooted floating palm tree the boat hit the thick trunk shot into the air and flipped upside down before crashing hard into the water bodies floated up seconds later lifeless or unconscious the only survivor proved his skill at dogpaddling before that deadly collision a sharp whistle from tucker had sent kane leaping from the boat tail high the dog landed safely in the calmer water but the currents were pulling him back toward the churning tide at the base of the tower kane fought against it burdened by his vest no you dont gray lunged into the captains chair of the jet boat he searched and found the key in the glove box and started the ignition he feared the depths might have damaged the engine but he also knew jet boats were built for such abuse as he hoped a choking burble a spat of water from the stern jets and the engine roared lustily he shifted the throttle and shot toward where kane struggled hang on sliding next to the dog gray lunged out and grabbed kane by his waterproof vest he struggled to get the sodden sixtypound dog into the boat recognizing it would take both arms he let go of the wheel unpiloted the craft got pulled closer to the tower the churning water growled hungrily the undertow sucking everything down finally with a heave of his body he hauled kane aboard the shepherd shook his heavy pelt tail wagging and bumped him affectionately thanks tucker called over to gray hey what about us kowalski complained by now water flooded the lower deck of their balcony churning hungrily grays three teammates clung to the railing manning the wheel again gray opened the throttle and gunned his way over to the balcony he brought the boat alongside them and worked the throttle to hold the craft steady they climbed over the balcony and dropped on board tucker helped kowalski with amanda she stirred enough to lift an arm and swat at the bigger of the two kowalski pushed her arm down sheesh thats the thanks i get for hauling your butt up ten flights of stairs with everyone settled gray swung away from the sinking tower the jet boat was only a fourseater with six on board counting kane the boat drafted deeper than it should making it sluggish and slow but they were afloat the same could not be said for utopia the currents shifted under the boat dragging the craft strongly to port gray corrected against that pullbut it only grew worse what the hell pierce kowalski hollered drawing his attention away from the currents to the skies above he craned his neck in shock the tower of the burj abaadi leaned precariously over the boat gray searched outward across the rest of the island towers and spires all canted in the same direction as if blown over by a stiff wind oh hell seichan recognized the danger too the island is tipping gray jammed the throttle forward picturing the island capsizing they needed to get to open water off in the distance a spire broke from its foundation it toppled and slowly crashed into a neighboring building closer at hand a mighty moan vibrated through the waters it was the deep groan of concrete and steel under stress no one doubted the source all eyes turned to the burj abaadi am it seemed the eternal tower was not living up to its name aboard a large patrol boat edward bore witness to the islands slow destruction a quartermile away utopia upended breaking apart sliding back into the sea a modern atlantis at its center the burj abaadi toppled the upper levels breaking and sliding off the central axis like plates toppling from a tall stack word had reached him that the patrols sent to the tower had gone missing attempts to raise them on the radio had failed it had to be the work of the group that attacked the base measures would have to be taken but not without guidance petra stepped through a nearby hatch carrying a satellite phone in her hand her eyes locked with his warning him it wasnt good news she held out the phone he lifted it to his ear and heard the computerized voice greet him is the child secured yes and the mother dead surely she had to be then coordinate all forces onsite establish a noose around that island hunt for those who assaulted the station and if theyre found he was given very specific instructions ending with petra will take matters in hand from there she knows what is needed he swallowed hard feeling demotedbut he dared not complain and in the end maybe it was better not to know july am gulf standard time off the coast of dubai gray raced the jet boat as the island tore itself apart around him the sinking platform twisted by tidal currents and punched from below by partially intact pylons broke into smaller sections suddenly unmoored and topheavy those pieces began to topple and capsize dropping buildings spires and scaffolding all around them gray tried to avoid the worst of that roiling gristmill flying at full throttle still more towers fell walls tore apart with explosive retorts windows shattered in showering bursts floating debris choked their path growing more treacherous by the minute gray jigged and jagged his way through the worst of it the boats resilient carbonfiber hull took care of the rest he needed a way out to open water but rubble and ruin seemed to block him at every turn gray seichan clutched harder to a brace i see it ahead a huge crosssection of a spire under constructionnothing more than a frame of ironbroke loose hit a condominium tower then rolled in their direction like some coin in a pachinko machine it bounced and crashed toward them kowalski swore coarsely a sentiment shared by all there was no way past it and gray had only seconds to act he sought the only cover availablebut it would be tight everyone duck he swung the jet boat to the right spun the craft degrees and slammed it sideways under the protruding upperstory balcony of a sunken building the tumbling monstrosity of iron clattered over themthen bounced away nice job parallelparking kowalski commented with a blast of the jets gray blew the boat back out of the shelter he turned dug in and sped for the distant glimmer of open water but even that path was closing ahead two residential towers leaned drunkenly against each other the one to the right crumbled against its partner dropping slowly raining broken glass and debris go for it seichan said gray had no choice he gunned the engine firing the jets behind him into a roar the boat blasted away like a rocket striving to duck under that lowering guillotine of steel concrete and glass kowalski curled over amanda whom he cradled on his lap i cant watch seichan reached over and gripped grays forearm tucker braced his legs against the back of the captains seat only one crew member had a different assessment kane came forward tucked under seichans arm and jumped up to bring his nose into the wind his tail wagged fiercely striking gray in the shoulder with that bit of encouragement gray tightened his fingers on the wheel the jet boat screamed across the last of the water skimming along the surface at over sixty miles an hour ahead the building fell faster the path below it pinching closed but gray was already committed down he yelled seichans fingers dug hard as she ducked keeping kane pinned under her arm the jet boat reached the gap and shot under the toppling tower shattering through a rain of falling glass for several seconds the world filled with the scream of tortured steel and the thundering grind of concrete it felt like a derailed freight train tumbled past overhead then they burst clear as the tower crashed into the sea behind them casting up a huge wave that shoved them along with a flotilla of debris farther out into the dark waters but those waters werent entirely dark a cordon of lights blocked the seas three hundred yards out including a yachtsized cutter the islands security fleet had set up a blockade gray slowed their flight maybe they didnt see us seichan said gray glanced doubtfully back as he turned his attention forward his fears were confirmed a trio of those lights broke away coming toward them he spun the jet boat and raced in the opposite direction more lights hovered out there too other vessels in the blockade but that wasnt his goal once he gained some distance he swung behind a floating pallet of construction lumber dont think hiding here is going to work kowalski said gray stood and pointed overboard everybody out seichan grabbed his arm what are you thinking we can outrun them not weighted down like this gray said speaking fast he pointed to the fuel gauge almost out of fuel dont have enough to make it to the mainland then what are you going seichan looked harder at him youre going to lead them off its the best chance for amanda i dump you here run off and get them to chase me for as long as possible he pointed to kowalski youve got jack kirklands homing device maybe he survived and can reach you if not kowalski eyed the stack of lumber ill build a boat do your best he said the others quickly shed boots and outerwear tucker stripped the vest off of kane so his partner was not weighted down they left amanda in her hospital gown she had begun to shake off the anesthesia but she remained in a dull haze gray feared she was edging toward shock he hated to leave her floating in the sea but what other recourse did he have he helped tucker and kowalski get her overboard at least the surface waters were temperate as compared with down deep keep her head elevated gray warned kane splashed in next to them he turned to seichan she remained fully clothed with her arms crossed youre not coming with me he said guessing her intent i am were not both going to sacrifice ourselves she frowned and looked him over as if he were crazy who said anything about sacrificing myself you want a distraction something to keep those boats from poking their noses over here she pointed beyond the lumber pile see that big boat that patrol cutter yeah time to turn the tables she lifted an eyebrow its high time we played pirate am tucker could no longer hear the whine of the jet boat he had watched the initial chase saw them tear off to the side leading the trio in a wild pursuit running along the edge of the blockade he hoped their plan worked but he had his own mission to address to keep amanda safe after pulling her off that surgical table he felt extra responsible for herespecially as hed abandoned her newborn in the rush to escape i should have been more thorough in examining her but there was nothing to be done to correct that mistake except keep amanda protected to that end he swam out toward where a plastic trash barrel floated on its side he grabbed the handle the plan was to build a nest around their hiding spot to do their best to camouflage themselves amid the debris field off to the east the skies were already growing pale with the coming sunrise he wanted better cover before then he didnt expect they would have to remain in hiding for long maybe two hours a disaster of this scopethe sinking of an entire islandwould draw a global media circus scores of television helicopters curiosity seekers and news reporters only then would it be safe to move amanda out of hiding and search for a rescue something to be caught on film that exposure should keep amanda safe such a story would attract a large audience nothing like blood in the water to draw attention as he turned and dragged the barrel a fin rose out of the water ahead of him then another and another he forgot that blood drew more than just attention he pictured the hammerheads hed seen earlier something bumped his leg he let go of the barrel and yanked out his dagger hed left his pistol tucked in the stack of lumber he searched twisting all around but the waters were pitchdark even the fins had vanished then something touched his ankle he kicked striking something hard it rose up under him shoving him high seconds later black water sluiced off the glass deck of the ghost the hatch popped open and jack kirkland poked his head out he eyed the dagger still in tuckers fist you planning on attacking my boat with that knife after all i went through to save your sorry asses tucker sheathed his blade wanting to hug the man you try swimming through a crumbling forest of concrete with an island falling on top of your head jack wore a huge smile was the time of my life now lets see about getting you all on board by the time that was accomplished jack had turned more somber especially seeing amandas condition she was shivering bluelipped and pale on the edge of shock kowalski wrapped a dry blanket around her from the stores aboard the ghost he was surprisingly gentle for such a lumbering fellow but a blanket was far from enough she needs immediate medical help tucker said as he settled her into one of the seats kane sat next to him leaning against his knee i know where she can get it jack said close by ive got a stateoftheart facility aboard the deep fathom we can be steaming out of these waters within the hour and get her somewhere safe tucker sank into his seat grateful and relieved jack lowered the ghost back under the water and piloted them away what the hell did they do to her i dont know tucker said numbly and i hope i never do what about your other friends tucker looked up through the glass roof and admitted the same i dont know am were on fumes gray shouted at least i hope i have even that seichan sat next to him with her two sigs on her lap she glanced over at him a glimmer of fear shone in her eyesshe wasnt stupidbut it seemed only to ignite the larger excitement found there she smiled her hair whipped by the wind the collar of her blouse snapping showing the length of her neck lets do this ever a woman of few words he grinned back which only made her smile deepenstill hardedged and purposeful but now shining with something darker and softer something he wanted to explore when they had the time he spun the jet boat back toward the blockade theyd given the trio of pursuers a wild ride weaving in and out of the line the carbonfiber hull had a few new holes in it but seichan had shot the same number of men she had proved her marksmanship had not dulled since he first met her of course back then shed been an assassin for the guild shooting at him gray aimed their jet boat for the larger patrol cutter a hundredfooter plainly the command center for the fleet he was confident that no eyes were looking toward where hed hidden the others he had planned on coming out here alone expected to be captured maybe killed and that hadnt changed only seichan had offered another planto gain something from their sacrifice this entire mission had started from an act of piracy perhaps another act of piracy could end it half of piracy involved bloodshed and destruction from the sinking of the island from the trail of bodies theyd already accomplished that well enough the other half of piracy was the theft of treasures that is what theyd come here to do gray raced toward the patrol cutter heading deadon a maneuver the smaller ships had not expected caught off guard by the sudden suicidal move the smaller boats were slow in closing the gap seichan further discouraged them she stood one knee on her seat for balance her two arms raised out to either side black sigs in each hand she laid down a deadly barrage of fire to hold that gap open long enough for gray to slip past their line of defense nothing stood between them and the lead ship of the fleet it was a fastresponseclass cutter typically holding a crew of twenty painted stark white and like most modern patrol vessels it featured a stern launchandrecovery ramp made for deploying pursuit boats even while under way that was their target the ramp was currently empty as the entire fleet had been called to duty to build the blockade around the island gray aimed for that ramp with the last of his fuel and opened the throttle crew members ran to the stern of the ship flanking the ramp automatic weapons pointed on deck a mm stabilized caliber gun mount swung toward them additionally a patrol guard manned the round black disk of an lradlongrange acoustic device used as a sonic nonlethal shield against pirates a useful tool in these waters there was no way to assault that ship they had only one choice ready he asked im out of bullets anyway seichan said gray throttled down killing the enginesthen stood up joining her he laced his fingers atop his head she made a broad display of tossing her pistols overboard then took the same position hands on head we surrender he called out the jet boats momentum carried them to the stern ramp and nosed them halfway up weapons tracked them on both sides a commotion followed the captain of the boat appeared at the top of the ramp his dark features and heavy shadow of beard marked his arab heritage he was flanked by a thin mustached man and a hardmuscled woman with a stern blond bob on your knees the captain said pointing a pistol they obeyed the captain barked an order in arabic four men came racing down the ramp and dragged the boat the rest of the way up then tied the craft in place ensuring they didnt try to flee another two boarded and pulled their arms down cuffing them behind them only then did the captain and the others come forward the thin man approached on seichans side of the vessel commenting in a stiff british accent she would be a perfect research subject dont you think petra the blonde crossed over to gray careful dr blake that ones not for you at least not yet petra leaned toward gray or this one we thought hunting you or one of your colleagues would be harder that makes me suspicious she lunged a hand at his neck fast enough to catch his throat he reflexively tried to pull away a ghost of a smile appeared amused by the surprise in his expression her other hand moved equally swift a needle jabbed into his throat a burn like acid spread as she pushed the plunger he coughed at the intense pain petra straightened no we have special plans for this one what plans blake asked but his question had a faltering note as if he didnt want to know the answer hes a skilled sniper petra began gray fought to listen but the acid burned through his consciousness the world constricted her voice drifted back down a long tunnel forty hours from now her final words trailed to a whisper as he slumped to his side sprawling next to seichan his vision narrowed to a pinpoint through that tiny hole he watched seichan shift her knee switching off the camera attached to kanes abandoned vest hiding the fact that she had been recording the conversation before the others grew any wiser he prayed someone was listeningsomeone had to be listening this was the pirate bounty theyd risked so much to steal the most valuable treasure in the world information as gray faded to black those last disturbing words followed him into oblivion forty hours from now this man will assassinate the president of the united states third hunting grounds july pm est washington dc painter waited for the storm he stood in the central hall that cut through the lowermost level of their command bunker here sigma hid its deepest secrets he stood outside a room that only a handful of people had entered in the past five hours his muscles knotted as he kept his post he wanted to pace away his anxietyneeded to pace it had been almost a day since he heard any word concerning kat and lisa and even then it had only been some grainy footage caught on a bank atm camera not a word or sighting since it ate a hole through his gut through his spirit but he had a duty that could not be forsaken at the end of the hall the elevator chimed and opened the first two people to exit were members of the secret service they both eyeballed painter one came down the hallway the other remained behind and waved president james gant out of the elevator two more agents followed behind general metcalf accompanied the president this way sir gants gaze locked onto painter a black cloud darkened his aspect the fury in his eyes the flush on his face the hardness to his every move even his stride was angry painter hoped he could get a word out before getting punched and he wasnt entirely sure he wouldnt still be slugged afterward but the risk had to be taken the fate of the country depended on the next few minutes the press corps believed the president was attending a private meeting with the director of the smithsonian even gant thought he was here on metcalfs behalf to listen to painter give an impassioned plea to save sigma from the ax the president had only agreed to come here after intense backroom negotiations by metcalf the general had to call in many political chits to get these five minutes of the commander in chiefs time gant checked his watch as he crossed those final steps apparently time was already ticking down this is a courtesy gant said his carolina drawl thick with disdain because of general metcalfs long distinguished career thats the only reason im here and this is the last courtesy i will extend to you understood mr president gant balled a fist so speak your piece and lets be done with it painter instead turned to metcalf what about the secret service agents thoroughly vetted metcalf answered all four youll need them for whats to come gant looked between the two of them need them for what painter stepped back before i speak mr president i need you to see something turning painter crossed to the door behind him one of the secret service agents followed him painter opened the way and let the man go inside first to inspect the room when he came out his face was paler clear the agent stated then stepped aside painter held the door and nodded to gant glowering and straightening his tie the president strode into the room painter followed shadowed by another agent while the others took posts in the hall gant stepped woodenly to the hospital bed he stopped at the edge his posture ramrodstiffthen he collapsed to his knees halffalling across the mattress his shoulders shook then sobs wracked out of him if painter had any lingering doubts about the mans authenticity they vanished in that moment my baby he cried shes alive amanda gantbennett lay quietly on the bed still under a light sedation she wore a blue flowered hospital gown intravenous fluids along with two antibiotics ran into a central line equipment monitored oxygenation heart rhythm and blood pressure she wore a cap over her head beneath that a bandage covered the surgery site where the cranial drill had been expertly removed by a neurosurgeon a drain remained in place due to the length of time the burr hole had been left open ct scans had showed the drill had penetrated the superior sagittal sinus through the frontal bone but the cerebral cortex remained untouched secondary trauma had resulted in a tiny subdural hematoma but that appeared to be resolving on its own with rest and time she should fully recover two other people occupied the room amandas neurosurgeon and tucker wayne neither man had left the young womans side since she arrived five hours ago her path back to the states had been a circuitous one jack kirkland had transported her to the deep fathom where medical personnel on board his ship had stabilized her en route to abu dhabi there painter had called on the assistance of someone he trusted someone who had powerful influences in the area the oil baroness lady kara kensington she had arranged a private corporate jet while painter prepared false papers no one outside painters circle knew amanda still lived until now gant turned staying on his knees how that one word encompassed so much ill need more than five minutes painter said once granted painter told him everything he left nothing out drawing gant back to his feet with the story they stepped into a neighboring medical office just off of the wardthe father refused to be more than a few steps away from his daughter when he got to the story of amandas rescue gant shook tuckers hand thank you son tucker nodded my honor sir id like to meet that dog of yours sometime im sure that could be arranged painter had highlighted the key parts of amandas story all that was left were questions he could not fully answer but i still dont understand gant said why did they want my grandson were still trying to piece that together amanda had some moments of lucidity i was able to ask her a few questions glean some answers tell me gant said he was seated at a small desk in the medical office too shaken to keep his feet painter remained standing your daughter received a couriered package from an unknown source inside were fake passports and a note warning amanda to flee that her child was in danger there were also papers included medical documents faxes lab reports enough to convince your daughter to vanish in order to protect her baby the note also warned her not to tell anyone in her family not to trust anyone but why gants expression was a mix of incredulity and fear anger lurked there too smoldering up toward a fierce fire someone wanted that child i believe your grandson was the product of a genetic experiment a global research project that spanned decades if not longer one involving human trafficking and experimentation the disbelief shone brighter what sort of experiment are you talking about i cant say for sure something to do with his dnathats what amanda overheard but based on other intelligence sources i believe the experiment inserted an engineered protein into his genetic structure he may be the first child where this was successfully carried out gant shook his head but whats their ultimate goal what do they want with my grandson painter saved the worst for last amanda believes they plan to experiment on your grandson to keep him alive or at least his tissues to study him in more detail gant shoved to his feet horror ignited that smoldering fury what how who the hell are these bastards as painter prepared to answer that a more pressing question weighed on his mind where are they pm blue ridge mountains the stethoscope lifted gently from the newborns frail chest the childs heart could be seen beating against that cage thumping weakly his skin shone with a slight cyanotic cast indicating poor oxygenation dr edward blake announced his verdict to petra hes shutting down already underweight and premature it could be a failure to thrive he shrugged or the stress of the transportation here may have overwhelmed his systems petras disappointment showed in the heavy cast to her eyes the sternness to her lips she wasnt concerned for the childs welfaretheyd lost many others but after all of the troubles in somalia and dubai they both needed a win here and any hope of that faded with every passing breath of the child the newborn rested inside a heated incubator nestled in blankets a nasal cannula supplied a steady stream of oxygen a nasogastric tube allowed the administration of formula cuffs and pads monitored oxygenation heart and respiratory rate blood pressure and temperature edward shook his head we may need to insert a picc line and switch to cpap for his shallow breathing or tube and ventilate him he must find a way to stabilize this child the last dna sequencing showed significant pna loss in the child the triplehelix complexes in his vital tissues were breaking down but most troublesome of all edward still didnt know why one possible explanation was that the childs body was simply rejecting the foreign protein making up that third helix and as a consequence the child grew sick slowly shutting down the other possibility was that the child was failing to thrive for ordinary reasonshe was too thin too poorly developedand that stress triggered a secondary metabolic breakdown of the triple helices chicken or the egg he asked the baby did the breakdown of the helix cause your body to weaken or did your weakened body cause the helix to break down more likely it was a combination of the two creating some sort of cascade effect no matter which scenario was true he and petra were in trouble failure was not rewarded in this organization and seldom tolerated edward stared around the small windowless ward assigned to them in this guarded complex currently these new facilities were illsuited for their purposes the work done at the lodge was primarily militaristic in naturenot like the wonders promised by the research at utopias labs he looked around the square ward his temporary refuge and workspace their evacuation and exodus from utopia had been rushed and unexpected leaving little time for any real preparations crates remained unboxed an entire wing waited for the installation of a new genomics lab no doubt edward could rebuild here but it would take time time the child did not have he stared back at the incubator en route from dubai it was evident the baby was destabilizing edward had ordered what he needed for emergency neonatal care and had it airlifted and delivered here but as the child declined he faced a sad reality getting equipment here was one matter but finding skilled medical personnel who could be vetted and arrive in time was a challenge at this highly guarded facility especially following the swath of ruin left behind both out in the middle east and here in south carolina theyd lost several significant colleagues in both places the wheels were already turning to bring staffing onsite but again timing was critical performing even the simplest of the proposed procedures required a minimum number of skilled staff working around the clock we need extra hands he concluded capable skilled hands at this point ill take one additional personif talented enough petra nodded fully aware ill make a call we may have what we need already here pm dr lisa cummings paced the length of her cell she left her lunch untouched on the small tray a turkey club and a small bag of doritos there was something obscene about the ordinariness of the fare she stared around her cell as she made another pass from front to back the dull ache from her sprained ankle kept her focused the walls were a seamless white plastic the door was made of a hard glass polymer framed in steel she had pressed her cheek against that glass trying to see as much as she could past her threshold all she saw was a hall of similar cells all appearing empty where is kat the worry ate at her and fueled her pacing the cell had only a few amenities a cot with a foam mattress and a stainlesssteel commode with sink the only luxury was a flatscreen television molded into the wall but lisa could not escape the feeling that someone was watching her through it or maybe it was just a paranoia born of the aftereffects of the drugs after they were caught last night by the helicopter four uniformed men had skimmed down on lines from the cabin of the aircraft they had tied kat and lisa up then injected them intramuscularly with a sedative she guessed from the stabbing ache in her eyes and the stiffness of her leg muscles that theyd given her some form of ketamine she had regained a groggy consciousness at one point during the trip enough to tell she was in the back of the ford explorer kat lay sprawled next to her eyes rolled back snoring slightly lisa was too weak to move but through the back window she watched dark woods and tall cliffs roll past suggesting they were in the mountains she guessed the blue ridge mountains but she couldnt be certain she had faded away again and suspected she had been given a second injection at some point two needle marks itched on her upper arm she scratched absently at them through the thin gown she wore someone had stripped her and dressed her in a featureless cotton dress like a hospital gown but closed in the back it was pulled over the head and cinched in place she also wore slippers and an illfitting bra and a pair of panties the garments were clean but not new from the slight fraying someone had worn these clothes beforeand that added to her nervousness what had happened to those others a sharp buzz sounded from the television it drew her attention around on the screen the view of a small hospital ward appeared two figures in scrubs moved across the screen working in what appeared to be a nicu a neonatal intensive care unit a computeraltered voice spoke eerily flat and disjointed dr lisa cummings it has come to our attention that you have both a medical background and a phd in physiology is that correct yes she said tentatively unable to think of a good reason to lie they clearly knew who she was likely pulling her records based on her fingerprints usefulness is a virtue here she was coldly instructed everyone must have a purpose to that end we would like you to assist us in diagnosing and treating a newborn here at the facility were currently understaffed for the work necessary especially in regards to skilled medical personnel lisa processed this and came to one conclusion why should i help you if saving the life of a child is not enough perhaps the life of a friend the view swiped away and a room similar to hers materialized on the monitoronly its walls were a dark red it was like looking through a window into a neighboring cell but that room could be anywhere in the complex the woman seated on the bed burst to her feet rushed forward to fill the screen placing a hand against it lisa laid hers there too matching finger for finger she imagined the warmth of the electronics came from the palm of her best friend kat lisa are you okay the connection cut and the screen went black the voice returned every failure or disobedience on your part will be exacted upon the flesh of your friend prove your usefulness and you both continue to live she swallowed hard suddenly finding it too chilly in her thin gown what do you want me to do the electronic door lock clicked loudly go out to your right end of the hall the screen went dark lisa hesitated a few breaths but she knew she had no choice cooperation would buy extra timetime to find a way to escape time for painter to find them she pictured her boyfriends face the lock of snowy hair tucked behind one ear the sharp intelligence in his eyesand most of all the love shining in the night across a pillow that last more than anything gave her the strength to keep moving she stepped over to the door pushed it open and headed to the right the hall held a dozen cells she searched for kat among them but they all appeared empty at least as far as she could tell kat she called out softly walking slowly swiveling her head no response no face appeared pressed against a glass door several of the rooms had their mattresses rolled up giving the entire wing a feeling of disuse but also a sense of expectation like an empty boarding school waiting to be occupied for a new semester maybe that came from the low murmur of voices ahead reaching the end of the hall she pushed through the far door into a small medical ward the same one from the television crates and boxes filled one half of the space some open others spilling packing material and showing plasticwrapped medical equipment inside the other half held the neonatal unit a woman in scrubs spotted her and motioned her forward to join them like one colleague greeting another before she could step closer a door on the other side of the ward opened and a broadshouldered older man entered dressed in a somber gray suit his white hair neatly combed his manner genteel as he strode over to lisa she had become rooted in place recognizing him the man held out his hand his carolina drawl warm thank you dr cummings for agreeing to help my grandnephew lisa shook his hand dumbfounded he was the former ambassador to southeast asia now secretary of stateand brother to the president robert l gant pm washington dc tell me james gant demanded staring off to the next room where his daughter rested on the hospital bed whos behind all of this painter knew the next part of this discussion would take some delicacy what transpired here was for the presidents ears and eyes only him and one other jason carter worked at the desk computer in the medical office where painter and the president had been holed up his secret service agents continued to watch the hall with one posted next to amanda jason finally nodded ready to proceed he had the necessary footage transferred and keyed up painter faced gant as you know mr president we already suspected the guild had a hand in the kidnapping of your daughter gants eyes darkened ive read the intelligence briefings exactly but the guild is not their true name its more of an umbrella designation encompassing the groups many cells around the world a network of agents and operatives ensconced in various militaries governments research institutions and financial circles there are many levels within this organization some go by other names but recently ive uncovered a clue to the true leaders the puppet masters of the guild gant focused harder on him go on this inner circle has also hidden under many names burying themselves in countless secret societies to cover their footprints going back centuries centuries a skeptical note rang in the mans voice at least to the middle ages painter confirmed maybe even farther back into the past he flicked a glance toward jason the young analyst was tracing the lineage of the gant family deeper into history but it was slow going and that track grew fainter worn away by time into mere rumor and suspicion what about now gant said keeping his eye on the target what do you know about their operations today we know two things first we know theyre tied to your family gant choked slightly what painter forged on before he lost the man completely second we know the name most commonly associated with them is the bloodline gant stirred at the mention of that word plainly recognizing it painter was not surprised by his reaction amanda had known the name too but he wanted to hear what the president had to say director i respect you i owe you a great debt of gratitude but youre chasing ghosts youve taken rumor and hearsay and added flesh and bone to it painter remained silent letting gant have his say the president continued suspicions plague most rich families rumors wrapped in conspiracies entwined in maniacal plots take your pick the kennedys the rockefellers the vanderbilts the rothschilds in the past each one of them has been tied to secret societies and global machinations and were no exception go ahead and pluck any card out of that conspiracy deckfreemasonry the trilateral commission skull and bones the bilderberg groupand youll find some story connecting them to our family gant shook his head plainly disappointed that namebloodlinethats our familys personal boogeyman made to scare children into obeying stories about a family within our family its not supposed to be mentioned beyond our doors growing up i heard all sorts of tales mostly spoken under bedcovers at night of people who mentioned that name too loudlyonly to suddenly disappear im sure they did painter thought likely killed or recruited into the fold youve been hoodwinked director sold a bill of goods if youve fallen into that conspiratorial trap painter felt the wind dying in the mans sails knowing now was the time he nodded to jason bring up the footage i asked you to prepare he returned his attention to gant amanda described a symbol painted on that tentcabin in somalia we found that same mark again closer to home at the fertility clinic where she had her in vitro fertilization performed jason stepped back on the monitor kats footage began to play it showed her again rushing up to a set of large steel doors pause it there painter said fighting down a pang of worry for kat and lisa the video stopped and focused squarely on the center of the door a large embossing stood out plainly a crimson cross with genetic code wrapped within it earlier amanda had recognized it claiming it was a symbol tied to the bloodline from gants flinch he knew it too he leaned closer his voice hushed impossible painter motioned for jason to continue the footage this is what that symbol hid painter didnt watch the video he didnt need to see that again instead he studied the presidents profile the blood visibly drained from the mans face his lips parted in a silent gasp of horror knowing hed seen enough painter made a cutting motion across his own neck jason ended the playback leaving the president stunned it took a long minute for gant to look away from the screen to turn haunted eyes toward painter behind that glassy numbness painter knew gant pictured his own daughter to his credit the man nodded accepting the truth as he stood his voice hardened to a vengeful edge if youre right if members of my own family perpetrated such atrocities committed such cruelties upon my daughter i want them hunted down his anger focused on one question now where do we start before painter could answer another person must have heard gants rising anger and recognized it daddy everyone turned back to the hospital bed in the next room the patients eyes were open she searched blearily amanda gant rushed to her bedside crashing to one knee to take her hand baby girl im here amanda found her fathers face but rather than relief a faint reflection of gants fury shone there her fingers tightened on her fathers hand she fought through the dregs of her sedation he consoled his daughter youre going to be fine amanda wanted no such reassurancesonly results daddy they took william they took my baby boy you her fingers clutched until her knuckles paled you get him back the demand took the last of her strength she stared into her fathers face exacting a promise from him with her duty passed on her eyes rolled back her fingers slipped free the neurosurgeon stepped forward she still needs more rest gant ignored him and turned to painter still on one knee his face was forlorn but his eyes were determined what must i do to get my grandson back painter pictured the video footage shot by kanes vest camera showing a mouseseye view from the bottom of a boat he had watched it several times over the past halfdaythe boat chase the capture the drugging of gray pierceeach time grateful for the mans ingenuity and sacrifice in securing this secret footage it offered them a slim chance to turn the tide against the enemy painter intended to take it what do you need me to do gant pressed painter stared him in the eye and told him the blunt truth you need to die mr president july am est washington dc gray rode back into the world on a bolt of lightning the electric shock burned through his skull as if someone had shoved the right side of his face against a redhot stovetop he gasped tried to roll away from the pain but could not escape it the only relief came as the burn faded on its own then something bit into the back of his hand warmth shot up his arm into his chest and ignited his heart his heart tripped a frantic beat blood pressure pounded at his ears his breathing grew labored for several seconds until the effect wore off the jolt left him tingling hyperalert the world snapped into sudden sharp focus still tinged red at the edges he lay on his back his pulse throbbing in his throat as he collected himself he reached above to touch a concrete roof so low he could brush his fingertips over its rough surface he noted a device strapped to his wrist a syringe locked into a mechanical delivery system he ripped it off rolling to the side and holding off the punctured vein he must have been given a counteragent to his sedative returning him to full alertness in seconds but where am i concrete walls surrounded him on all sides creating a box five feet wide and three feet tall the illumination was sharp painfully bright coming from a batterypowered lamp in the corner a long metal case rested on the floor near his feet and one of the walls had a thin aperture sealed by a steel shutter even if open the hole was too narrow to climb through the only exit appeared to be the hatch in the floor sealed from the outside what is going on the answer came from inside his head from deep within his right ear good morning commander pierce a mechanized voice greeted him it sounded like one of those soulless computerized answering servicesthough he suspected he was hearing a real voice digitally masked the rude awakening was a necessity there was no apologetic tone to that statement merely matteroffactness the shock and the injection of methylphenidate should have you alert and ready for the task at hand you have ten minutes until you must act to do what he asked loudly to the bare walls of his concrete crypt he suspected the answer glancing at what looked to be a rifle case the voice continued to speak either ignoring him or perhaps this conversation was a oneway transmission the radio deep in your ear is bolted in place and wired via a blasting cap youll find that same ear packed full of c disturbed gray probed with a finger and discovered a wad of hard material jammed into the canal he pictured what would happen if that exploded and quickly pushed that thought away the speaker continued the device can also be used as punishment as you experienced upon waking additionally its wired to a transmitter held by a guard outside if you stray beyond ten yards from that transmitter you have ten seconds to get back in range or the device will automatically explode theyve got me connected to an electric leash a tingle of foreboding worked through his druginduced hypervigilance as to your duty the voice said at exactly noon today you will assassinate president james t gant you will find a sniper rifle and a magazine with two rounds in case you miss on your first shot you will not be given a third chance prepare yourself now the lamp blinked off inside the bunker a small motorized hum sounded and the shuttered window opened sunlight streamed into the space through the slats he wasnt blinded he realized the brightness of the lamp had been to assist him with maintaining his day vision gray searched around for a camera while he rolled and crawled to the gun case and snapped it open nestled inside was a marine corps ma sniper rifle along with a stabilizing bipod he slipped the weapon free checking its heft and balance he knew this rifle it had an effective range of a thousand yards but what fell within that range gray moved into the sunlights blaze staring between the slats he distantly made out the tip of the washington monument poking above a line of towering oaks im back in dc he oriented himself through the trees sunlight glinted off water that had to be the potomac shifting to the left and peering sideways he caught a peek far to the right of a rolling expanse of green lawns dogwoods and rows of small white gravestones he knew that place too well he had many friends buried there arlington cemetery he was north of the park likely not far from the usmc war memorial closer at hand viewed down a short street that ended at an oakstudded park people milled about a large gathering of tents and booths most were wearing various shades of armed forces uniforms from dress blues to camouflage khakis he raised the rifle and peered through the telescopic sight adjusting the unertl x lens to focus on that gathering the view zoomed to reveal barbecues children running and laughing a military band playing on a shaded stage the distant beat of drum and sharper notes of brass reached him in the center of the picnic grounds a tall platform had been erected framed by an arch of red white and blue balloons he shifted the sight to maximum concentrating on the group clustered by the podium they appeared to be top military brass from every branch of service among them he spotted his supposed target with his back to gray president james t gant kissed his wife who was decked out in a dark blue pantsuit with a muted pinkandwhitestriped top and silver flats it was a festive look for this fourth of july barbecue a uso celebration gray also knew the first couple were hosting a fireworksviewing party on the south lawn of the white house later tonight but the days strain already showed on the first ladys face the detail through the scopeeven at seven hundred yardsrevealed the grief etched in the lines around her eyes hidden as best she could under thick makeup her fingers clung to her husbands hand trying to hold him as he stepped to the podium but the president had to show a strong face to the world the pair both thought their daughter deadand maybe amanda was the last memory gray had of her was floating in dark waters supported by his two teammates the administration must not have announced the kidnapping and death of amanda likely waiting for confirmation from the charred remains probably the white house chief speechwriter already struggled on the wording for that tragic announcement in the meantime the parents had to put on a show of normalcy president gant stepped to the podium lifting a hand and waving a distant cheer rose gray turned away crouching lower in his snipers nest resting the rifle across his knees he picked up the magazine eyed the cartridgesthe newer mlr rounds for heightened accuracy two of them they had better be accurate he remembered the warning you will not be given a third chance but why did his kidnappers believe he would agree to assassinate the president they had seichan but that wasnt enough leverage as much as it pained him to admit it he knew they would likely carry out horrible atrocities against her in an attempt to ensure his cooperationor to punish his failure that fear sat like a cold stone in his gut he knew that even to save her he could not sacrifice the leader of the free world frustrated he tightened his fingers on the fiberglass stock of the rifle and on the cold length of deadly muzzle im sorry seichan i cant do it four minutes the voice finally announced and as if reading his mind the speaker gave him the incentive to act to ensure your cooperation we have buried fifteen plastic cartridges of sarin gas with indetectable triggers throughout the park the dispersal pattern will sweep the fields killing everyone there including the president those charges will go off twenty seconds after noon unless the president is killed first gray imagined that wafting nerve gas so lethal even the briefest skin contact caused an agonizing end one death versus hundreds of innocent men women and children the choice is yours commander pierce either end will serve our needs but it serves our purpose better if you pull that trigger a lone death by assassination will be far more poignant and powerful than one death among many the coldness of that calculation reached gray chilling him also with your rifle discovered here as well as your dna the assassination will be blamed on the rogue actions of a disgruntled covert operative one who was retaliating against the mothballing of his group by the administration in effect putting the final nail in sigmas coffin but the guilds schemes were even grander than that such an act will require an entire revamping of the united states covert and intelligence agencies one overseen by us as we take over the white house with the next election that poignant sympathy for the death of james gant will extend to his family members to someone already standing at his side in a position of power extend to his family members gray felt sick to his stomach as he listened armed with his new knowledge he could now hear the slight southern cadence the word choice that couldnt be wiped away digitally his mind raced picturing the man who stood so steadfastly at his brothers shoulder whom the world already loved and respected and would surely hand the reins of power to the man only had to ask for the white house after such a tragedy and it would be given to himin a landslide the secretary of state robert lee gant gray squeezed his eyes closed he suddenly remembered sensing that painter had been keeping something hidden from him something about the guild about the organization behind his mothers fiery death was this that secret had painter suspected the man all along no wonder the director hadnt wanted anyone in the gant family to know about amanda surviving somalia he feared word would reach the presidents brother anger burned at the edges of his dismay he logically knew why the director had kept such a secret from him gray might have taken the man out immediately jeopardizing everyone around him and ultimately the foreknowledge of that traitor in the white house would not have changed grays mission objectives apparently such knowledge was need to know only and gray wasnt on that list still you should have told me one minute the voice warned you will wait for our signalthen fire gray secured the magazine in place and returned to his post at the aperture shame and anger burned through him he didnt know if the voice had been lying about those gas canistersor if theyd be blown up anyway either way gray knew he couldnt take that chance james t gant had to die he stared through the rifles telescopic scope and lowered the crosshairs to the profile of the president as the man turned to the side he doublechecked his rangeseven hundred yardsand fixed the main targeting chevron of the rifles sights upon the occipital bone behind the mans left ear knowing a shot there would do the most damage festive music and bright laughter from the holiday picnic filtered to him he let it all fade into the background as he concentrated on his target on his mission in us history three presidents had died on the exact same day on july on the birthday of this country it seemed beyond mere chance thomas jefferson john adams and james monroe today would mark the fourth then the president leaned down forcing gray to follow him the man ruffled the fur of a dog sharing the platform with him gray tensed recognizing that shepherd kane gray zoomed out to watch james gant straighten and shake the hand of captain tucker wayne the man must have recovered his uniform his dress blues were decorated with the medals and awards from his tours in afghanistan it was appropriate that tucker should be standing there on the dais a war hero and his dog being thanked by a grateful commander in chief but gray knew why tucker and kane were really there all the earlier anger at painters secrecy dried up leaving behind only relief and respect the director must have received the recorded video from dubai and understoodbut what did he want gray to do gray searched the stage painter must have put tucker up there for a reason the former army ranger was not a regular member of sigma only a hired hand so no one was likely to recognize him but what was the message painter was trying to send to gray then he knew it wasnt just tucker on that stagebut also kane gray shifted his concentration to the dog the shepherd stood quietly tail out nose pointed up gray had seen that particular pose a few times before when the dog had found the source of a scent kane was pointing like any good hunting dog gray followed his gaze to a red balloon behind the podium not far from the presidents head gray fingered the telescopic sight to zero in on that balloon it twisted in a slight breeze revealing a small greek letter in a darker shade of red barely discernible unless you were looking for it œÉ he smiled and made some final adjustments to his weapon in his ear he got the order he needed fire steadying his breath commander gray pierce pulled the trigger july pm est washington dc no shot was heardonly the popping of a balloon even that noise startled everyone on the podium not tucker he had been waiting for that signal he used the distraction to press the button on the transmitter in his pocket small squibs hidden under the presidents white polo shirt exploded packets of the presidents own blood erupted out his back in a violent blast and seeped heavily over his heart in front the first lady screamed catching some of the spray on her face the secret service enveloped the president immediately gathering him up and whisking him off the platform tucker got knocked to the side kane danced out of the way another cordon of agents formed a living shield to protect the fleeing president more crowded around the first lady and rushed her in another direction tucker tapped his leg gathered kane to his side and rushed after the presidents group chaos exploded across the picnic grounds the sudden violence catching everyone off guard people yelled kids were hidden under the bodies of protective parents a barbecue got knocked over setting fire to a tent but a majority of those in attendance were military or former service members most had probably been under fire they made room for the flight of their wounded commander in chief some even added to the body shield to protect the fallen president the presidents entourage reached the parking lot and the motorcade as planned the usss electronic countermeasures suburban used by the secret service to stop any airborne attacks ejected its arsenal of infrared smoke grenades creating a thick pall to protect the president in his final flight to the waiting ambulances in that momentary confusion a pair of secret service agents who were in on the ruse hauled the president into one of the emergency vehicles tucker climbed into the back kane jumped in after him the neighboring ambulance erupted with flashing lights and sirens and took off the whca roadrunner the mobile command and control vehicle sent out the false instruction drawing the rest of the securepackage motorcade to follow the decoy armored vehicles gave chase while local law enforcement blocked streets staring out a window tucker watched an armored presidential limo race through the smoke with additional escorts bearing to safety the first lady who must be beyond distraught watching her husband shot right in front of her they needed her to be the grieving wife for the cameras during the next few hours it was cruel but no one could know of the subterfuge today especially the enemy amazingly painter had orchestrated a deception of this caliber after a single day of planning he recruited only those he fully trusted reaching out to a handful of people in various intelligence branches but mostly he kept this entire operation inhouse one of the secret service agents helped the president take off his buttoned polo gant wore a pained expression the reason became clear as his bloody undershirt was stripped off and the exploded remains of the squibs removed a blistered blast burn decorated the spot under his shoulder blade sir one of the secret service agents started worried he was waved away im fine better than a bullet through the head another agent started the ambulance and set off running dark no flashing lights no sirens they headed in the opposite direction from the motorcade the decoys were racing to george washington university hospital where another team waited to continue the deception in the story to come it would be reported that the president was undergoing an extensive emergency surgery to repair his lung that his chances were poor they didnt want to risk a second attempt on his life so they would make it sound bad but such a ruse could not be maintained for long without the threat of exposure so they set a sixhour time limit six hours to bring down a shadowy cabal that had survived centuries painters voice filled one ear report the package is secure tucker sent back knowing their voice channel was kept secret by a modified version of the ccep type encryption algorithm developed by the nsa to keep presidential communications secret what about commander pierce were working on that right now with advance knowledge of the sniper attack painter had set up a ring of tiny highframerate slowmotion cameras around the stage all fixed on that balloon those cameras should have recorded the bullets passage and allowed immediate processing of the trajectory a threedimensional laser modeling of the park permitted the analysts at sigma command to quickly trace the path of that bullet back to its source they needed commander pierce secured as soon as possiblenot only for his safety but also to obtain whatever knowledge he had regarding the moves of the enemy including the whereabouts of the presidents grandson tucker felt a pang of regret unable to escape the guilt of leaving amandas child behind he intended to do whatever he could to correct that mistake the first step toward that goal find and secure gray without that mans information all of this subterfuge would accomplish nothing in six hours it would be announced to the world that the president had miraculously survived his surgery and the thin advantage of the moment would evaporate he knew painter didnt expect to uproot the bloodline completely by these actions but he had one clear goal the same one as tucker to find and recover amandas child and expose everyone involved in this current bloody affair even with such a defined objective the odds were exceedingly long and without gray there were no odds painter came back on the line we have his location a utility bunker of an office tower seven hundred yards away tucker sighed in relief he locked eyes with the president we found him sir james gant nodded wincing wed better not lose him pm gray watched the hatch fall open he still held the sniper rifle in his hands he had witnessed the explosive chaos following his single shot as he watched he held his breath concerned the sarin gas would still be released killing everyone in the park when nothing happened he suspected that threat had been a lie after all he saw tucker race off with the president rushing him to a secure location he understood the situation immediately they were faking the presidents death a risky move on the directors part but gray understood why that risk had been taken it spoke volumes about their desperation they were likely backtracking a trajectory already looking to find him hoping he could supply additional information that was a problem i dont know anything more than they do that is unless painter was ignorant of robert gants involvement with the guild maybe the director suspected the presidents family or inner circle was involvedbut he didnt necessarily know who in the administration was the mole gray stared down at his hand he still had one more round was it enough to stall to buy painter time to find him a shout rose from the dark hatch leave the rifle show your hands where are you taking me he called back both stalling and trying to get more information the answer came as a shockliterally an electrical jolt burst from his ear blinding him triggering his jaw to seize his knees to buckle sprawling him flat leave the rifle the guard repeated show your hands gray bellycrawled and thrust his arms over the open hatch he breathed heavily gasping now climb down the service ladder gray dawdlednot because it hurt to move but to slow things down he swung his legs into the opening fumbling with a toe to find the first rung you were warned the guard said gray braced for another shock but instead a mechanical countdown whispered from his implanted earpiece arising from the unit itself ten nine eight it was the timer for the implanted c bomb in his right ear whoever held the transmitter must have stepped beyond his tenyard limit they were forcing him to follow tugging at his electric leash he had no choice but to obey he picked at that packed ear knowing it wouldnt do sigma any good to have half his skull blown away he had to stay alive to do his best to learn morewhich meant he had to work fast seven six five once done he ignored the ladders rungs and slid down the frame instead his feet hit the floor of a concrete corridor as the countdown reached three then thankfully stopped a circle of soldiers all in black surrounded him weapons in hand one dashed back up the ladder wearing latex gloves and searched the concrete roost rifles there and some blood for a dna trace the man reported and clambered back down he held the syringeinjection system in one hand and bagged it away cleaning up any evidence all clear the team leader stepped up a head taller than the others with a crucifixshaped tattoo on his neck he pocketed a device the size of a packet of gum the transmitter move out he ordered pistols encouraged gray forward down a set of stairs to a subbasement then through a hidden door into a tunnel system gray stared behind him as the door sealed hoping his plan worked as his feet dragged the countdown began again in his ear ten nine eight like a dog on a leash gray hurried forward obediently for now pm report painter said standing in the communications nest at sigma headquarters we arrived onsite his unit commander reported from the field found the bunker empty no sign of commander pierce only a sniper rifle and several drops of blood painter closed his eyes and fought against the tide of despair at losing grays trail he turned his mind instead to what was left behind a rifle and blood painter understood they were planning on pinning the assassination on gray and in turn destroying sigmas reputation but as in any chess match it was now painters turn grab the rifle and bring it here he ordered destroy the blood evidence and scour the place clean but youll need to be quick in the aftermath of the attack chaos still reigned but it wouldnt be long before forensic teams discovered the snipers hiding place his team needed to be finished by then but he refused to let panic distract his focus he knew gray wouldnt have lost focus either before you start cleaning painter warned over the radio thoroughly search every square inch of that space if i know gray he would try to leave us some clue understood painter ended the conversation and spoke to jason carter who stood in the doorway to kats office hold down the fort here let me know if anything goes wrong like it hadnt already ive got things covered jason assured him painter hurried out the door and down the stairs headed for the lowermost floor president james gant was already down there with his daughter the man had arrived in secret a few minutes ago the smithsonian castle had been closed all day specifically for this purpose no one paid attention to the shuffle of the janitorial staff into the building no one saw them enter the special elevator that led down to the command bunkers of sigma for now everyone believed the president was undergoing emergency surgery at george washington university hospital that the likelihood of his survival was extremely poor painter had his communications nest monitoring events making sure the deception remained in place massaging the press where needed but such a level of fraud could not last forever without risking exposure in less than six hours it would have to end knowing time was ticking down painter returned to the hospital ward two secret service agents protected the hall another manned a post by the elevator the fourth stood guard inside the small ward painter found gant sitting on the edge of amandas bed holding her hand he had stripped out of the janitorial coveralls and wore wrinkled navyblue slacks and a borrowed gray shirt amanda still balanced between moments of lucidity and sedation monitored by her neurologist who remained concerned about the subdural hematoma at the moment she slept gant looked up as he entered she spoke a few words when i came in shes still worried about her baby we all are he nodded whats the word from your field team did they find your man painter hated to dash the gleam of hope in a fathers eyes but hed had enough deception for one day already gone but im hoping he left some clue behind we should know in a few minutes gant sighed turning to his daughter he spoke slowly full of regret i pulled her into the limelight and made her childhood a spectacle a target for the press and i still had no time for her no wonder she rebelled lashed out no wonder she fled without saying a word what trust have i earned in her life he glanced up wiping a tear but never let go of her hand i promised her id find william dont make me let her down again painter stepped over and placed a hand on his shoulder silently making an oath to do everything he could to help what they did to her to my family gant said if i ever find out who orchestrated this who tortured my baby girl i will make them regret it for the rest of their days there will be no quick death i will make them suffer like no other ill turn their world into a personal hell on earth painter knew that if anyone had the power to do that it was president james gant a commotion drew both their attentions around jason came flying into the room winded director the young man never stopped moving continuing past the end of the bed and toward the neighboring medical office linus just got a hit painter got drawn into the wake of his excitement it took him an extra moment to remember that linus was jasons partner in that vehicleidentification program hope flared inside him had they found something he rushed after jason into the medical office the kid was already at the computer typing fast what is it painter asked the president stood in the doorway too listening in ill show you jason said typing as he spoke thats why i came running down here linus had been checking all the major thoroughfares leaving charleston searching for any further hits on that ford the problem is that the farther you get out from the city the more variables come into play so many different roads that could be taken spreading wider and wider like the branches on a tree what did you find painter pressed this jason pointed at the screen a clear photo of the front of a ford explorer appeared picked this up from a security camera at a drawbridge outside of orangeburg south carolina through the windshield painter spotted lisa behind the wheel his breathing grew heavier both relieved and terrified a man sat next to her his arms awkwardly raised behind him like he was stretching or maybe his hands were bound behind him you found her painter mumbled how long ago was this taken jason looked both apologetic and worried two days ago the same day dr cummings was kidnapped in charleston the president spoke at the doorway who is dr cummings shes everything to me aloud painter replied she was one of the operatives sent to investigate the north charleston fertility clinic gants face grew grim likely remembering the footage hed been shown of women floating in gelfilled tanks jason drew their attention back to the original still shot and pointed this was what got me so excited painter leaned closer a license plate clear as day i have linus running a trace on the cars gps to find out where it might be we should a dialog box popped onto the screen i think this is it jason tapped on the hyperlink in the box the image of the ford vanished replaced by a map view a blinking blue circle narrowed and zoomed shrinking down toward the border where a corner of south carolina pushed between georgia and north carolina the circle finally changed into a small triangle positioned deep in the blue ridge mountains the president was drawn by the activity can you zoom in and get a street address painter asked jason it was gant that answered no need i know where that is thats within my familys estate fleurylamontagne before painter could react his cell phone vibrated he answered it and was patched through to the unit commander in arlington director we found something here painters heartalready beating hardsped faster what i took a photo ive already dispatched it to you painter ordered jason to retrieve it the commander explained while they waited we found it scrawled on the floor near the entrance hatch mostly invisible to the naked eye but it glowed under an ultraviolet scan of the chamber i think it was written with a smear of c plastic explosive yes sir i scraped up a tiny dab with a toothpick from the feel from the chemical taste i believe so jason interrupted ive got the photo it appeared in the top corner of the monitor three letters glowed with a soft phosphorescence against the dark concrete rlg painter mumbled aloud what does that mean again it was the president who answered his voice pale with shock those are my brothers initials robert lee gant painter twisted to face him they both knew some of gants family members had to be involved with this mess but neither of them suspected anyone this close to the first family gant stared over at his daughter likely thinking the sameonly for him this dagger dug much deeper and straight into his heart we cant be sure about your brother painter offered i can gant said faintly how gant pointed to the lower part of the computer screen it still displayed the gps map bobby was headed to the family estate for the holiday to avoid the fourth of july crowds in dc he left two days ago to do some hunting to fleurylamontagne gant looked drawn and pale his voice grim no one really uses that french name any longer everyone just calls it the lodge july pm est blue ridge mountains his color is good lisa pronounced she stood before the neonatal incubator her gloved hands gently rolled the newborn onto his side and she listened to the back of his thin chest with her stethoscope his heartbeat was as rapid as a birds but strong his pulseox readings normal she let him roll back on his own huge blue eyes framed by a hint of eyelashes ogled up at her his lips pursed hungrily edward blake stood at her shoulder watching her examination petra was off in another lab running the latest dna analyses using samples of the boys blood and skin along with cells gathered from a mucosal swab we should get another bottle lisa snapped off her gloves hes been suckling well on his own since we took out his ng tube and picc line lets keep him moving in that right direction but all in all hes rallying beautifully thats all because of you dr cummings edward said it wasnt false praise yesterday she had found the child circling the drain she had spent a full hour studying his labs his radiographs even his genetic analyses she had stared with amazement at the triple helix formations on an electron micrograph two natural dna strands wrapped around an engineered foreign protein pna peptide nucleic acid that little microscopic strand of pna was the source of so much misery horror and abuse and it wasnt doing the boy any good either edward had explained about the unraveling going on in the boys body how these triplehelix compounds were breaking down but the question still in the air was why did the boy get sick and that started to unravel the helices or did the unraveling make the boy sick the only way to know for sure was to stabilize the child and see if the unraveling stopped on its own lisa had come up with a suggestion after noting the slight spike in eosinophil levels in the boys lab work eosinophils were the white blood cells that modulated allergic inflammatory processes they also reacted to parasitic infections but stool tests had already ruled out that possibility the more likely source for this allergic response was the pna strands peptide nucleic acid was a protein like any other capable of being an allergen as surely as dust or dander with the breakdown of the triple helices the freed pna was being washed out into the cytoplasm then shed free of the cells petra had shown her a picture of a wormlike pna molecule squiggling out of an intestinal cell this rush of engineered protein into the bloodstream and interstitial tissues triggered the mobilization of eosinophils the bodys defense against such foreign invaders this allergic anaphylaxis tipped the child into shock recognizing this threat lisa had recommended a lowdose therapy of antihistamines and intravenous steroids to knock down that allergic response to give the childs body a chance to flush out the foreign allergen and stabilize again it worked out beautifully she had kept a vigil beside the neonatal incubator all night assisted by edward as needed and hour by hour the child improved they were able to slowly unhook him from fluids oxygen supplementation and even the feeding tube only one question remained did it do any good did the boys rallying health succeed in returning stability to the triple helices she knew that was edwards hope they both awaited petras answer as lisa fed the child with a bottle edward retired to a computer workstation in a neighboring cubicle both were lost to their own worries concern for the childs wellbeing had staved off her terror for the past day gave her something to focus on she knew kat was somewhere in this lab complex but where was her friend holed up for that matter where was this lab so far both petra and edward had treated her with a modicum of respect appreciating and needing her help she remembered those digitized words a cold warning prove your usefulness and you both continue to live with the child doing better lisas usefulness was about to come to an end then what she remembered who had assigned her to this job in the first place picturing his kind face his soft words thank you dr cummings for agreeing to help my grandnephew anger raged inside her against that cool calm demeanor of robert gant she knew how much pain and suffering and loss it cost to bring this special child into existence to this place and time still she could not blame the child for such atrocities the boy might have been born out of blood and heartbreakbut he was still an innocent the child finished suckling the bottle was empty those big eyes drooped heavy with milksodden drowsiness lisa let him drift into slumber oblivious to the horrors beyond the clear plastic walls of his incubator she turned to edward and limped over to him favoring her aching ankle up on the wall a camera tracked her path swiveling to follow her she wondered if robert gant watched her or merely some bored guard exhausted lisa was beyond subtlety or subterfuge edward what are you trying to accomplish with these triple helices he swung around on his desk chair ah i cant speak to the goal of my financial benefactors all i know is my purpose in the grand scheme of things and thats what he raised an eyebrow belying the hubris that followed to forge the key to life itself he gave her a tired smile and surprisingly she echoed it as lofty as that might sound pna is that key edward explained it unlocks the full power of dna and places the blueprints of life into our hands with pna genomics experts can engineer strands that can turn specific genes on or off unfettering mankind from its biological limitations but it also allows new genes to be introduced new code written onto the pna and inserted into a fertilized egg in the end god will no longer evolve manwe will edward stared toward the child in the incubator but all that will come later for the moment we have only one goal engineered into this first strain of pna a simple thing really lisa felt a sick turn to her stomach what goal edwards eyes never left the sleeping boy the doctors expression a mask of wonder and also sadness immortality lisa couldnt hide her shock do not be so surprised dr cummings this child is not the first immortal born into this world edward finally turned to her letting her see his sincerity they walk among us already pm washington dc five hours left painter had returned to his own office leaving the president with his daughter below guarded by his secret service contingent they were under the fivehour mark until james gant would come out of hiding and pretend to be recovering from major surgery everything to maintain that ruse was already in place he found kowalski sitting inside his feet propped up on painters desk his arms folded over his belly snoring painter shoved his legs off the man snorted awake we ready he asked as were ever going to be painter grabbed a holstered sig sauer from a cabinet the rest of the strike teams gear was waiting at the airstrip a jet warming up as he secured the shoulder harness and holster in place his eyes caught on the picture of lisa on his desk smiling softly hair glowing in the summer sun lips parted slightly his love for her was a tangible thing not a thought or a feeling but a weight in his heart a pressure in his chest a stirring of heat in his veins at that moment he knew the truth i need to buy a ring motion at the door drew his attention tucker stood there shadowed by kane painter gave his holster harness a final tug cinching it snugly and faced the man captain wayne tucker stepped inside sir id like to join you on this mission i appreciate that captain but we hired you to find amanda your obligation to us has been fulfilled understood sir tuckers countenance remained hard rocky but not my obligation to amanda i left her baby back in dubai and i want a chance to correct that mistake we can certainly use the additional manpower not to mention your dogs nose but well be parachuting onto the gant estate airspace above the presidential estate was restricted the nofly zone had been established before james gant was president going back decades a courtesy of the state of south carolina for the largesse of the clan painters plan was to sweep in close parachute out and glide low onto the grounds and those grounds were huge over acres almost square miles of misty mountains towering waterfalls dark forests and grassy meadows the estate had illdefined borders as the family bought neighboring farms ranches and orchards extending their property in fits and starts that remote rough terrain would serve to hide them allowing them to hoof it overland from their drop point tucker seemed to have no problem with parachuting onto the estate kane and i have had plenty of jump time the man assured him i have my dogs harness system with me then welcome aboard kowalski stood stretched and headed out the door with the others this place is really going to the dogs painter set off down the hall he had been expecting another teammate to arrive by now but the latecomer would have to meet them at the airstrip time was ticking down jason carter would take command at the communications nest in his absence and coordinate efforts from here it was a lot to place on his young shoulders but painter knew he could handle it jason had already gathered his own intelligence team in preparation ruling the nest of older agents with an enthusiasm reserved for the young painter reached the elevators as the doors opened inside the cage stood the last member of their strike team kats husband adjusted his new prosthetic hand securing the cuff with a twist and wiggling his fingers monk must have already stopped by r d to get the upgrade painter had ordered for him a prosthetic specifically designed for this mission to help with the infiltration of the lodge about time painter said monk glanced up meeting his gaze his face fierce you try to find a babysitter on the fourth of july now lets go get our women pm blue ridge mountains and youre claiming this child can live forever lisa asked that hes immortal edward continued to sit in his cubicle in the medical ward barring accidents or disease yes he could live a very long time i imagine it will take further tinkering to achieve true immortality but in the end like i said hes not the first immortal born to this world what do you mean since we have time until petra finishes her evaluation of the boys genetics ill do my best to explain its the least i can offer you for saving the child lisa was prepared to listen many scientists across a scope of professions believe immortality will be achieved in our lifetime the dates bandied about all seem to center around the middle of this century or so that means children born today will live to see those accomplishments come to fruition they will take advantage of them during their lifetimes becoming immortal so in that regard they are immortal already or at least something quite close to it their lifetimes could be easily doubled or tripled she imagined what he envisioned how some children born today will live forever they were the immortals walking among us already still such a claim seemed impossible she voiced it aloud you truly expect we can attain immortality in such a short time frame or something very close to it and its not just me making that claim it comes from hundreds of scientists researchers and visionaries across a gamut of professionsfrom medicine genomics and gerontology to pharmaceuticals nanotech and robotics what were doing in our labs here financed by our benefactor is taking the first tentative steps into eternity lisa pictured the man orchestrating this work our benefactor robert gant it was beyond comprehension all this horror perpetrated in an attempt to live forever still lisa sensed something more was going on another agenda still being kept secretbut what she knew any true answers lay in keeping edward talking he obliged waxing proudly on where the world was heading there are two general schools of thought in regards to expanding mans lifetimes the first is moving machines into man the other is moving man into machines she shook her head not appreciating the distinction a thousand years ago the average life expectancy of mankind was only twentyfive years it took another nine hundred years to extend that to thirtyseven today the average is seventyeight so in the past hundred years we more than doubled life expectancy that amazing spurt of growth happened because of science and technology and it will only grow faster from here estimates say we will soon be adding a year to our lives with every passing year just think about that for every year you grow older life expectancy will extend a year in front of you but what will drive that growth what has always driven it the furnace of technology in that forge machine and man will melt together into one he must have read her skepticism and smiled ready to deflect it already people have artificial pancreases inside them he continued currently thirty thousand parkinson patients have neural implants and as technology grows smaller it will invade us even more advancements in nanotechnologywhich is manufacturing at the atomic levelhold the promise of replacing vital organs in fifteen years our blood cells in twenty years and in twentyfive years nanotechnology will reprogram our biological software to reverse aging lisa understood moving machines into man into our bodies thats one path to immortality but the reverse holds even greater promise as computing power explodes exponentially a term was coinedsingularitymarking that moment when artificial intelligence will surpass mankind various futurists expect this to occur somewhere in the middle of this century so soon lisa asked edward nodded with a small smile of satisfaction by estimates say computing power will be a million times what it is today anything is possible with that much power in the meantime scientists from around the globe are searching for methods to merge that growing computing power to our own in switzerland researchers are reverseengineering the human brain creating a neuronbyneuron simulation with the intent to have a complete virtual brain in ten years here in the states a group of mit researchers are building a map of all the brains synapses those trillions of connections between neurons all in a search for the seat of human consciousness lisa sighed and i assume that the ultimate goal is to fill that empty seat to scan our consciousness into computers exactly moving man into machines the second path to immortality edward glanced over to the incubator but im searching for a third path which is what a new science cybergenetics the merging of technology into our genetic code the pna strand lisa said understanding growing both awed and horrified picturing that piece of engineered protein snaking into human dna and regulating it dna is really just a set of information processes for building our bodies but that software is old millions of years old pna holds the potential for overhauling that system rebooting mankind forever lisa tried to draw him down from the lofty heights of theory to the reality of his lab but back to your own research what does your pna do the one inside the boy it basically addresses the deleterious effects that come with growing old the field of gerontologythe study of aginghas discovered that there are only seven basic ways a body damages itself as it ages reverse those seven deadly ways and immortality is within reach edward looked significantly toward her lifting an eyebrow you did it she said in a hushed voice your pna manipulates and regulates the dna to offset those damages it does but not perfectly we concentrated most of our efforts on one of them the death of cells are you familiar with the hayflick limit she shook her head finding it harder and harder to speak back in dr leonard hayflick estimated that the maximum natural age for a human being is about years he based that on the number of times a cell will divide before it stops the number of these divisions is determined by the length of some repeated dna at the end of each cells chromosomes these repeated sequences are called telomeres they basically act like the aglets at the end of shoelaces keeping the laces from fraying but after a certain number of divisions the telomeres wear off and the chromosome frays itself to death what does this have to do with your pna we engineered the pna to function as permanent telomeres in order to create undying cells and thus allow us to shatter through the hayflick limit creating a path to immortality he nodded we are at the very threshold to eternity but why do this there are so many negative effects if man could live forever overpopulation starvation stagnation theres a reason we are meant to die to step aside for the next generation true but those dangers only exist if the technology is available to all in the hands of an elitea chosen peoplethere would be no such risks shocked she pictured robert gants face was that his plan to keep his bloodline alive forever to create an undying dynasty why are you helping them she finally eked out because i must mankind has always chafed against restraints and limitations we left our homelands to cross uncharted seas we broke the bounds of gravity to fly we even left our planet here is merely the next step toward freedom the ultimate freedom to break the chains of mortality and free us from our very graves lisa found herself aghast she had warmed to the man over the past day working alongside him but now she saw the chinks in his armor allowing the madness inside to shine forth the visionary raymond kurzweil once posed the question does god exist edward turned to stare at the boy in the incubator his answer was only two words not yet she stared at the man seeing the glaze of megalomania she knew from her years in the medical profession that this affliction seldom presented itself as a raving lunacy instead most of those afflicted were charming in demeanor confident in their convictions and all too often described as simply nice they were monsters wearing sweet faces she was saved from responding by the return of petra the woman had a sheaf of reports in her hands as she strode stiffly toward them her expression remained unreadable as she reached edwards cubicle he faced her looking up hopeful and the verdict on the boy not good the child may appear healthy but his triple helices continue to denature and shed their pna strands worse yet the process appears to be accelerating edward lifted his hands rubbed his eyes and sighed out his defeat so the breakdown wasnt because the boy was sick as i feared hes simply rejecting the pna hes no good to us petra said but we were so close edward sagged we will keep working petra said success cannot be far away and besides you know they only want females the boy was doomed either way doomed lisa stiffened what are you talking about edward lost in his disappointment seemed surprised she was still there surely you understand that males with triple helices are basically mules they might live forever but theyre genetic dead ends only females can pass this pna trait to future offspring no i dont understand she said intending to keep them talking shifting slowly toward the key card on edwards desk youre not going to harm this child he huffed swung to a computer and tapped up a file on the screen a timelapsed video of cellular division appeared the two dna strands were colored in red the single pna in blue a couple of additional pna strands hung loosely in the cytoplasm as the cells divided the pna slipped out of the way joined its brothers in the cytoplasm cellular division then proceeded as normal once the cell had pinched into two one of the pna strands from each of the new cells snaked out of the cytoplasm and back into the heart of the dna strand reforming the triple helix in both cells do you understand edward asked she did she now understood why a male couldnt pass on the triplehelix trait a mans sperm cell contains half of his dna a womans egg contains half of her dna plus all of her cytoplasm and everything inside the jellylike cellular fluid mitochondria organelles proteinsand in this case pna because of that a father couldnt pass on the triplehelix traitthe trait of immortalitybecause he couldnt pass on any cytoplasmic pna only a female could its like mitochondria in women lisa said all mitochondria get passed along the female genetic line from egg to egg to egg correct so you understand she nodded then you also understand why we have to kill this boy she jerked straighter no of course not edward sighed hes a dead end only useful for research fodder if wed been able to return stability to his triple helix by treating his shock then he would have made the perfect test subject for petras vivisection table his organs divided into artificial suspension systems perfect for challenging and testing the immortality trait better that than waiting decades to study this childs growth science cant move that slowly especially in the face of something as inconsequential as morality lisa sat back on edwards desk numb with shock she had labored throughout the night and slowly pulled the child back from deaths dooronly to meet this end she had also grown attached to the boy how could she not with those big trusting blue eyes petra stared sullenly at the child in the incubator as if he were a dog who had chewed her favorite pumps now hes useless another failure a promising failure edward patted petra on the back of her hand you can still perform the necropsy collect all the histological tissue samples you want we can still learn much even from this failure enough lisa would not let them kill this child as they focused on the baby with their backs to her she made her move already leaning on edwards desk she grabbed his key cardand his desk lamp she yanked the cord free and swung the lamp broadarmed at the back of petras head the weighted steel base hit her skull felling her like a chopped tree the woman hit the corner of the cubicle and tumbled hard to the floor edward had started to rise but lisa kicked the chair out from under him off balance he fell forward she used that moment to ram her knee into his nose smashing it and sending him sprawling he wasnt out but he was down dazed she dropped the lamp ran to the incubator and as gently as she could removed the cuffs and tapes of the nicus monitoring leads once he was free she swaddled the child in a thin blanket and carried him close to her chest she knew the prison ward was a blind alley as was this suite of labs the only other true exit was the door through which robert gant had entered yesterday she ran toward it ignoring the flaring complaint from her swollen ankle at the door she swiped the stolen key card unlocked the way and dashed out of the ward a dimly lit maze of halls and rooms spread outward looking deserted waiting to be occupied by edwards new facility shed overheard that much she picked a direction and ran off blindly with the child moving as fast as she could with her compromised ankle thankful the child remained quiet after being fed she hadnt bothered to dispatch or tie up petra and edward for a very simple reason she remembered the eye of the security camera following her as she fled someone already knew she had escaped july pm est blue ridge mountains where did she go robert gant pressed he stood in front of a computer in dr emmet fieldings office located in the red zone of the underground complex he had gotten word a few minutes ago from central security that lisa cummings had attacked two of the scientists and fled with his brothers grandchild a fist formed not out of anger at the woman but at the thought of his brother he held his grief in his fist and leaned his weight on it crushing his knuckles against the desktop trying to contain that well of sorrow flashes of moments with jimmy sparked in his head two brothers riding horseback drinking beer behind the barn playing cards while smoking cigars it had been jimmy who held him together after his wife died he tried to squeeze an entire lifetime into his fist to hold those memories in check it was why he had come down here tinkering with dr fielding on some projects studying some of the latest neuropod designs including several truly horrendous war beasts in early stages of development anything to keep himself distracted robert understood the inevitability of his brothers assassination could fathom the logic of it when it was presented to him as a fait accompli the greater body of the lineage demanded it so he had to obeyas hed always done in the past but he could not escape the pain of it shes still missing sir the guard said the mans image hovered in the upper corner of the screen there are only a few active cameras in that disused section of the facility then check the cameras in the neighboring zones blue and orange yes sir as he waited robert brought up a schematic of the estate the main mansion the lodge lay ten miles away surrounded by its high walls only a tiny fraction of the family knew the facility existed even jimmy didnt know though hed gone fishing a few times at a river within a halfmile of its outskirts the sprawling research facility covered twenty acres occupying an old mine on a remote piece of gant property set amid the high cliffs and waterfalls of the eastern continental divide the dividewhich ran through the blue ridge mountains and across the gant estatesplit the watershed of the region on one side rivers all flowed toward the gulf of mexico on the other toward the atlantic a century ago a member of the bloodline discovered the old flooded mine slowly over time it had been engineered and converted into a secret facility carved out underground and burrowed even farther over the years spreading under the oldgrowth forest and meadows he stared at the map of the facility it looked like a madmans rorschach inkblot much of it shaded out in gray indicating unoccupied sections of the lab robert remembered better times during the heyday of the cold war years the place had once hosted hundreds of researchers from both sides of the iron curtain all working for the guild for the bloodline the halls thrummed with excitement the verve of men and women working at the edge of scientific explorationand often moving beyond robert stared at the grayedout areas now eating through the facility like a cancer since then like many american companies the research projects that had once flourished within these walls had been shifted abroad outsourced to third world countries where no questions were asked labor was cheaper and government interference or oversight was nonexistent so this older facility was hollowed out becoming a deserted cathedral to science most of it shuttered and shut down only roberts pet project remained though isolated and adrift his robotics research was no longer considered by the bloodline a viable path to extending life deemed to be too macro in its scope instead everything shifted into the fashionable micro world of stem cells nanotechnology and now dna manipulation only lately was that trend reversing the pendulum swinging back with the advancements in robotics creating the new field of neurorobotics the merging of man and machine still the bloodline relegated his work to weapons research which was not inappropriate in afghanistan alone there were more than two thousand robots fighting alongside american troopsand that force was rapidly expanding in number and intelligence so robert continued his weapons research here the facility was perfectly suited for that isolated under a nofly restriction and best of all surrounded by varied terrain rivers forests meadows and cliffsthe perfect landscape to fieldtest the various iterations of his neuropods now with the loss of that major facility in dubai life was again returning to these empty halls new priests were returning to the cathedral ready to bring the chorus and the chant of the scientific method back to these hallowed halls robert should have been happier but all he felt was dead inside the loss of his brother coming so soon on the heels of amandas death and now the threat to his grandnephew it finally broke something inside himor maybe he had always been broken and it took jimmys blood on his hands for him to finally recognize it the bloodline had not been kind to his family he planned on ending that today the guard came back online sir orange and blue are negative on the target then spread the search on foot scour every room closet and cabinet yes sir robert knew that could be a challenge with the fourth of july holiday only a skeleton staff remained onsitenot that the regular staff was all that much more fleshed out but he needed his grandnephew returned to him hed lost too much todayand placed a thin hope that he could save the child and the straggling remnants of his immediate family but with the outside world closing down upon his private world he had no chance until he first secured the child he knew what he needed leverage he tapped a key and brought up a view of a cell in the red zone a woman with a shaved head sat on a bed her face in her hands he was glad she was turned away robert pressed an intercom button yes dr fielding answered from his laboratory in that same zone emmet you said you wanted to test the newest pods a more vigorous challenge of their abilities excitement frosted his voice of course sir then lets get started robert finished with the man and made the necessary calls once done he tapped another switch accessing a camera that required a code known only to him none must know about this prisoner the view of another room bloomed onto the screen only this one was lavishly appointed with a fourposter bed deepcushioned chairs a stone fireplace and walls decorated with tapestries the roof was woodbeamed framed into gothic arches and supported a centuriesold crystal chandelier but the room was still a cell the window streaming with sunlight was heavily barred the stout wood door banded in iron was locked electronically the prisoner must have heard the stir of the camera as robert turned it toward the window she stood limned against the sunlight a dark shadow a slender twist against the brightness noting the cameras motion she came forward looking up she still wore the same leathers as when she arrived though it looked like shed used the neighboring bathroom to shower she glared up at the camera those green eyes pinched slightly at the corner marked her mixed eurasian blood just the sight of those eyes made his heart clutch he touched the screen with his finger rubbing an edge of his thumb along the side of her face knowing he could never get closer she had escaped the guild years ago turned enemy to the bloodline but now she was returned to the fold where you belong he whispered throatily i should never have let you escape another face blinked into existence in the corner of the screen irritating him with the interruption mr gant the man said i wanted to inform you that the helicopter is inbound with the package from dc acknowledged ill be back at the lodge momentarily an underground tunnel ran from the lab complex to a secure entrance at the mansion he could take the tram and be back there in minutes he lingered a moment more staring at his handsome prisoner as if sensing his eyes she lifted an arm and raised an offending finger toward the camera he smiled as he clicked off the camera he turned around and headed for the tunnel back to the lodge ready to face the man who had killed his brother pm as the helicopter swept in a wide curve gray gaped at the view of the gant family mansion below he had seen pictures of the massive structure in books never in person few people had it competed with such great american castles as those built by the vanderbilt rockefeller and hearst families but the gant clan went oldschool patterning their design on a famous crusader castle in syria the krak des chevaliers the fortress of the knights its outer wall studded with small square towers and peppered with arrow slits was three meters thick the only passage through that wall was a massive archway fronted by a drawbridge over a real moat beyond the wall a sunlit courtyard was halfparking lot halfgardens holding centuriesold oaks and flowering rose beds the keep itself held seventy rooms all done in gothic style of pointed arches high windows and a multitude of doors and balconies it all led up to two square towers crowned by toothed parapets the chopper lowered toward a helipad in the courtyard as it dropped within the outer walls gray felt the world close in trapping him the skids touched the pavement and he was led out at gunpoint his wrists cuffed behind him the team leader marched him across the courtyard toward the giant arched doors to the main mansion gray had nowhere to run even if he could escape he remained tethered electronically to the transmitter in the leaders pocket if he fled farther than ten yards the countdown to detonation would begin again right now he needed to keep his head in more ways than one a few steps away the team leader held his radio earpiece listening to someone his other hand nervously scratched at the crucifix tattoo on his neck all gray heard was a final yes sir the man turned to gray come with me they headed up the steps of native fieldstone and through an open wooden door carved with panels depicting knightly pursuits from jousting to battles beyond the door opened a massive hall it was like stepping into a cathedral from the vaulted ceilings to the massive stone pillars sunlight flowed through stainedglass windows again depicting knights but in a more courtly setting many wearing the templar cross on their surcoats despite all of the grandness there remained an indescribable warmth to the hall thick rugs softened the stone floors two fireplaces at either end tall enough to trot horses through promised merry winter fires even now they were filled with massive bouquets scenting the room with summers endless promise and gray could tell where the nickname for the estate the lodge came from the mansions reputation as a hunting lodge was plain several of the rugs on the floor were bearskins mounted on the walls were the heads of beasts from every continent hemingway would have been very happy here keep up the team leader barked gray hurried forward led across the hall to a door beside one of the fireplaces the leader knocked come in gray was ushered into a small library done up as a sitting room with french antique furniture a small fireplace and tiny windows no bigger than arrow slits offering peeks at the gardens beyond the lone occupant sat in a chair to one side of the cold fireplace he wore a conservative gray suit though hed shed his jacket and had it folded over the edge of a chair the white shirt was unbuttoned at the top sleeves rolled up robert gant held out his hand the team leader rushed forward passed the transmitter into his palm along with the keys to grays cuffsthen hurried out clearly under specific orders as not a word was exchanged between them the door closed the presidents brother stared at grays face and spoke his first words did he suffer gray didnt need to be told the subject of that question still he didnt know his footing here this was made worse by the fire in his chest flaming the edges of his eyes burning at the bonds of his selfcontrol but cuffed and at the mercy of the transmitter he could do nothing but stand his legs trembling with the desire to send him charging regardless of the consequences his fists tightened so hard that the bulge of his wrists cut into the tight cuffs robert waved him to the other chair opposite the fireplace gray took it not trusting his control he sat on the edge ready to lunge to exact whatever revenge he could upon the man responsible for his mothers death robert asked again his voice cracking this time please i know jimmys surgery is futile i heard the grim prognosis but in those final moments did my brother suffer gray heard the pain more than the words that keen of grief let him see past the red haze to the mans barely contained agony roberts eyes were stitched with red veins shadowed darkly by pain his skin as ashen as his gray jacket for some reason as much as he hated the man gray answered as truthfully as he could no your brother didnt suffer robert nodded turning to stare at his lap thank you for that the man sat quietly in that stricken pose for a long time when he lifted his face again tears ran down his face he wiped them away and stared at the cold fireplace as if needing its warmth he spoke his next words softly im sorry for your mother gray stiffened coming close to leaping out of his chair but the face the man showed gray so honestly distraught quelled his anger loss is an affliction that never lets go of your heart i know that too well it is too high a price even for life everlasting which now seems a horrible thing gray remembered seichan saying something similar what was going on with this man he had expected torture and interrogations upon landing here his only hope was that painter had gotten his secret message and understood enough to figure out where hed been taken the accumulation of grief over one lifetime is more than a heart can bear robert explained only the heartless could withstand more or the very young those too na√Øve to truly understand loss like i was when they came for me when who came for you gray asked trying to understand robert remained silent seeming to be working through something clearly teetering on the edge ill show you you may be useful to my plans he stood and drew gray after him he crossed to a bookcase and pulled a handle tucked into the frame to unlatch a secret door a section of the case swung open revealing a spiral stone stair going down robert led the way lit by wall sconces gray had expected cobwebs and wall torches but the passage merely wound down to basement levels through the open doors to other landings he saw laundry facilities kitchens and they ended up in a wine cellar arched tunnels carved out of the natural stone spread outward in multiple directions dimly lit by bare bulbs strung above massive oak barrels lined both sides neighboring rooms like small chapels dedicated to bacchus held towering racks of dusty bottles an accumulation of unimaginable wealth robert moved swiftly forward as if fearing he might change his mind or someone might stop him gray got dragged behind as much by the pull of his invisible leash as by curiosity their journey ended deep within the vintners maze in a side room holding four massive french oak barrels as large as elephants robert stepped to one and released a latch to open the face of the barrel the wooden barrel was lined by steel robert hopped inside followed by gray the back of the barrel looked like the doors to a bank vault robert typed in a code on the front and placed his hand on a palm reader green lights flashed and a low hum of hydraulics rotated a twofootthick platesteel door it opened to a small rooman elevator he realized as robert entered more codes and the cage began to drop during this entire trip robert hadnt said anything he looked beyond words at the moment lost in his own grief finally the elevator stopped the doors opened into an anteroom to a massive hermetically sealed clean room half the length of a football field but this was no sterile industrial whiteandstainlesssteel place beyond the airlocked sealed door was something out of the british museum mahogany display cases held dusty tomes yellowed scrolls and worn artifacts from every age of man domes of glass sat atop marble plinths protecting delicate statues and golden treasures robert turned to him within lies the true heart of the bloodline july pm est blue ridge mountains lisa crouched in a dark bathroom stall perched on a toilet with the baby cradled on her lap she clutched a langenbeck amputation knife in one fist she had found the weapon which looked like a scalpel with a fourinch blade in a necropsy lab the morgue like much of this labyrinthine facility looked longdeserted a layer of fine dust had covered everything she knew she could not stow herself in one of the body cabinets her footprints were plain on the dusty floor to hide her tracks she had kept her flight along the edge of the occupied sections of the laboratory a dangerous path shed come close to being discovered twice but the facility was a huge warren of hiding places she had passed one corridor that must have run the length of the facility its end dwindled down to a dark point lit only in a few sections within the first few minutes she knew she must be underground no windows anywhere i need to find a way back to the surface if she could escape go for helpthen she could offer kat real support by herself any rescue attempt was futile her ankle continued to throb shooting pain up her leg with every step and it wasnt just kats life in danger the baby slept in the crook of her arm quiet as a lamb belly full of milk likely still bodily exhausted from the neardeath collapse of his systems she prayed the child remained quiet she had come to this bathroom only as a temporary reprieve to collect her thoughts her initial flight had been that of a panicked rabbit just trying to stay ahead of the hunting pack for the moment she had lost her pursuers arriving at a region of the facility with yellow walls the whole facility seemed to be colormapped shed fled from white through orange to yellow she pictured kats cell it had red walls she had discovered an evacuation map outside the bathroom it was that discovery that changed her course from a maddened flight to the beginnings of a plan she ducked inside here to think to consider the best route to take from the evacuation plan she recognized that she was on the middle level of three somewhere in the northwest quadrant the map laid out the shortest route up to the surfacebut she dared not take that path they would be expecting that likely guards were already posted when she reached the next stairwell they would expect her to go up so instead she would go down she noted that the red zone on the map did not extend to the third level she saw a corridor that transected the facility passing under the red zone she could use that passageway to cross to the far side of the facility where fewer eyes if any would be watching there was a remote exit in a sliver of the lab that poked out from the bulk that was her goal she shifted a cramping leg toward the floor wanting to check that map one more time then begin her painful run for the exit as her toe lowered toward the linoleum the door to the bathroom creaked open the light flicked on blinding after her flight through the dim corridors and dark rooms a casual whistling accompanied the intruder not likely a guard from the timbre of the whistling and heavyfooted gait it was a man she prayed he crossed to the urinal but his whistling approached the bay of stalls she clutched her knife more tightly willing him away not this one pick another her prayer was answered as he entered the neighboring stall the one closest to the door she had purposefully avoided that one for that very reason she would wait until he finished give it another minute then continue it was at that moment perhaps stirred by his whistling that the boy in her arms began to rouse stretching a pudgy wrinkled fist yawning silently but she knew that wouldnt last she had to get out of here before he made a noise and alerted her neighbor she didnt know how long the man would be here her ears picked out the clatter of an unbuckling belt the rip of a zipper and the soft whisper of pants fallingfollowed by a long sigh of relief it sounded like he would be here awhile the whistling began again lisa couldnt take the risk of being trapped inside here if the baby began to cry she carefully lowered her good foot to the ground pivoted to her bad leg careful of her ankle she mouthed the blade between her lips and balanced the baby under the crook of one arm luckily she had spent many nights babysitting kats children she had never locked her stall what would be the use so she used the coat hook on the inside of the door to slowly swing it open allowing her to slip outside i can do this then the baby let out a small wail of complaint lisa froze as the whistling stopped the stall lock snapped open her mind immediately flashed to her new mantra wwkd what would kat do lisa kicked the door as it started to swing open catching the man in the face as he reached forward he fell backlisa followed her knife already in hand as he looked up she slashed hard at his exposed throat the razorsharp amputation blade made to cut through hard cartilage and stiff tendons performed as designed the deep cut severed skin muscle and trachea drowning any scream the severed carotid spurted high splashing the man gurgled and slid off of the commode his hands clutched at his neck his eyes shining with shock already dead but not knowing it thats what kat would do lisa swung away careful of the blood pooling so as not to leave tracks she pulled the stall shut crossed to the bathroom door and turned off the lights his absence would likely be missed she had to be far away before that happened she peeked out and found the hall clear but as she stepped out her name was called loudly echoing throughout the facility she cringed but it was only the loudspeaker system the voice was male not the digitally masked speaker from earlier it didnt sound like robert gants southern slant or edward blakes british accent someone new dr lisa cummings this is your one and only warning you will turn yourself and the child over to the nearest personnel or you will send your friend into deadly peril a monitor bloomed to light down the hall others blinked elsewhere clearly he was making a general broadcast to the entire compound she shifted down the hall enough to see a stranger on the screen he wore white laboratory coveralls with a hood pulled back and a surgical mask on top of his head in the background she spotted dr blake the view suddenly switched revealing kat standing at gunpoint beside a sealed metal door it looked like she carried a length of pipe and a small shield of some sort as punishment and to recognize the threat she faces we will perform a small demonstration so you fully understand the door swung open sunlight blazed blinding the camera the view switched to the outside looking down upon a grassy meadow a line of oaks in the distant background kat was shoved outside stumbling into view shading her eyes with her small shield against the summer glare turn yourself in now or her fate will worsen over time this is your only warning lisa needed no time to decide wwkd she knew what kat would want her to do she hurried down the hallnot to turn herself in but to make her escape while most eyes here were fixed on those screens prepared to enjoy whatever blood sport was about to ensue and lisa knew from the shield and the club that some gladiatorial battle was about to start she caught fractured glimpses as she ran with the child gone quiet again for now likely jostled back to sleep by her running in stuttered snatches she saw kat head out into that field wading through the grasses be careful she wished her friend pm kat stalked across the thighhigh grass she carried a hard steel shield two feet square strapped to her forearm in her other hand she wielded a threefoot length of hollow pipe she breathed deeply readying her body flushing oxygen into her muscles her senses stretched out the tall grass was mostly green redolent of summer the scent growing stronger as she crushed through blades with her slippers the edges of her gown snagged on bristled weeds her ears caught the twitter of birdsong registering it but filtering it into the background along with the distant sound of tumbling water to the northwest and the sweep of gentle wind through leaves she knew the hunters would be coming shed overheard the two scientists talkingfielding and blakepreparing her deciding which weapons to test the battlefield is the ultimate crucible of darwinian natural selection fielding had explained to the other researcher survival is the main drive of evolution and its no different for our pods for our weapons to learn they must be fieldtested battlehardened with each new challenge new synapses of the cybernetic brains will grow and expand but we must test the pods with everharder challenges she had seen those hexapods as she heard them called crablike titanium killing machines equipped with razorsharp legs slashing daggers and drilling burrs other variants lined the workbench the worst looked like a large bloated tick its legs as skinny as ice picks beyond the workbench deeper in the lab larger creatures the size of small black bears had lurked in various stages of assembly kat strode across the meadow hefting the shield to test its weight and swinging the pipe to judge its balance weve pitted the hexapods against unarmed opponents in the past fielding had finished today well test them against the next level of weaponry blunt weapons and shields we will send wave after wave escalating the numbers each time until they learn adapt and defeat their opponent a rustle to her left alerted her she swung around dropping her shield low the grasses stirred as something raced low through them cutting across the meadow like the fin of a shark through water she saw four other trails swinging wider intending to outflank and circle her clearly they were capable of coordination good to know fast as greyhounds the hexapods churned through the fields shed never make the tree line so she didnt bother trying she would make her stand here using this first waveif she survived itto learn and adapt nothing said she couldnt evolve as readily as her opponents first she didnt want to be in deep grass she wanted a better field of view with seconds to spare she used her shield as a press and stamped a swath of grass around her pushing the stalks outward creating a thicker natural palisade she left one section open a gate into her little nest the first hexapod hit that palisade broadside got wedged in the wall of compacted grasses she identified the gleam of its titanium carapace and speared her pipe down at it using all of her weight metal crunched under the battering ram it didnt kill the beast but it incapacitated its sensory system sending the pod zipping away in a spiraling blind curve the other four perhaps wirelessly sharing the experience of the first veered away from a direct attack they swarmed in a circle then one cut away shooting toward the opening sensing the chink in her shieldnot knowing it was a trap it cut into her nest but she was ready she used her pipe like a golf club and batted it square in the front sensors crushing the electronics and sending it flying it landed on its back and didnt move a weak spot the other three circled clearly plotting something then once decided the trio arrowed toward the opening together plainly trying to overwhelm her sorry were closed for the day she slammed her shields edge into the soft loam sealing the opening to her nest the lead pod hit the shield with a loud clank she stabbed downward again and again like a piston she shattered most of its legs leaving it crippled the other two veered away plotting their next move kat wasnt waiting she found a fistsize rock and underhanded it into the grasses the movement drew one of the creatures it shot in that direction but it was only fooled for a few seconds once the rock stopped moving it stopped hunting it knew the rock wasnt alive the test confirmed the hexapods had motion sensors but they must be backed by infrared reading body heat a mark of living creatures since the pod chased the rock she doubted its visual acuity was very sharp they could be fooled what about sound and smell the two pods didnt give her another chance to find out they zoomed in from opposite directions one headed toward the shield the other the natural grassy palisade kat snatched her shield back up opening her nest again allowing the first one to shoot inside the second got delayed trying to push itself through the grass employing some buzzing blade to chop into her space the first spun on a dime and came at her she shoulderdropped putting all her weight on the edge of her shield turning it into a guillotine she crushed the front end driving it into the soft soil the second burst through the palisade leading its charge with a spinning horizontal saw blade she leaped to the side as the second rammed the first finishing the job for her with its diamond blade ripping open the underside of the other pod the first retaliated in a defensive death reflex razorsharp legs drilled into crevices peeled open the carapace and ripped out the glassenclosed brain in seconds theyd killed each other kat crouched examining their weaponry peeking at the arsenal under their carapaces she noted a small dartlike apparatus the side marked with the designation m etorphine hydrochloride a powerful gameanimal tranquilizer strong enough that one drop could immobilize a man knowing her opponents better she stood and stared over at the small bunker through which shed exited the facility she knew they were watching she just glared lets see what else youve got she turned and sprinted for the tree line pm shell do well emmet fielding said forming a temple of his fingers before his lips studying the bank of monitors very fit edward sat beside him at the curved bank of computer screens he gently fingered his broken nose taped up after lisas surprise attack he watched the woman flee out of the view of one camera and into another she fled through a dark forest of oaks pine and spruce arent you upset that she dispatched your weapons so quickly edward asked a flap of fingers waved away his concern you cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs porsche destroys fleets of their sports cars in their testing lab and field trials thats how you build the best and i wont settle for anything less edward had noted how the mans pulse beat faster in his throat during the attack he suspected this testing was as much a blood sport to him as it was science but that wasnt his concern after seeing that surely lisa would return with the boy any word edward asked fielding made a noncommittal noise plainly not interested whether lisa showed up or not he intended to continue this test until the woman on the screen was a macerated ruin he glanced to the clock petra had also gone off on her own to search for lisa after being caught off guard and struck in the head his research associate was out for blood hunting as diligently and as coldly as those steel creatures fielding sat back from his workstation stretching i think were ready for round two how many will you send this time a full score i believe twenty but shes shown so much promisetruly remarkablei think well skip straight to the next level of challenge introducing a new element fielding glanced behind him to the back of his lab larger pods hulked back there on four limbs each leg ending in curved claws patterned after a sloths perfect for gutting prey edward had seen how fast the quadrupods could move bonechillingly frightening to witness i think ill send up two fielding said and tapped buttons with a bit of bravado blake stared at the running woman she had better hope lisa changed her mind and returned with the childthough in the end it would not make any difference not for either of the women pm lisa fled down a long dim corridor the baby under one arm the knife ready in the other she had watched in fleeting glimpses kats successful battle with the metal creaturesbut more to come had been promised and she had no doubt it would be delivered she glanced above her head i should be under the red zone by now by her best estimate from the live feed she was unfortunately fleeing in the opposite direction from kat she could not offer her friend any helpother than to survive herself she continued down the corridor that transected the huge complex passing through a zone designated as black this area appeared empty but not deserted the air had a feeling of expectation to it like before a lightning storm the source appeared a few yards ahead to the right opened a vast cathedralsize warehouse a full flight of steps led down to the lower floor from up on top lisa had an expansive view of the space a hangar large enough to park a commercial jet inside the warehouse was full of more of those metal creatures stacked in racks or for the larger ones resting on the floor cables ran to charging racks or directly into the backs of the fourlegged ones in the center clearly still under construction was a monster the size of a pershing tank a slumbering giant waiting to be awakened a steady hum and the electrical smell of ozone radiated from the space creating that sense of a pending storm the charge in the air stirred the hairs on the back of her neck she hurried past with a sense of dread the corridor finally ended she took the stairs picturing the map in her head these steps led up to an exit off a spur of the main lab hopefully leading to some forgotten backwater where she could slip away on foot she crept up slowly landing by landing expecting a shout at any moment she crossed past the middle level to the top floor as she continued to the next step leading up toward freedom a loud voice echoed to her dr cummings we are ready for round two frightened lisa fled up the stairs i dont want to see but she could still hear echoing up from below came the faint shift of machinery the groan of hydraulics accompanied by the sudden spike in electricity in the air forces were being mobilized against kat lisa reached the top of the stairs a door appeared ahead with an emergency evacuation bar she feared passing through it might set off some internal alarm get eyes looking her way in this remote corner of the complex but she had no other choice if she remained below it was only a matter of time until she and the child were discovered id rather take my chances above than be trapped below she shoved the bar momentarily scared it wouldnt openbut it did bright sunlight flowed over her stirring the child with its brightness a chubby arm flailed against it along with the sunshine came a deafening roar she stepped out of the bunker and faced a waterfall spilling over a thirtyfoothigh cliff it crashed down to a river below her perch she did a slow turn realizing shed come out on a narrow plateau framed by a frothing river on one side and towering cliffs on the other there was no way up or down a dead end the baby started to cry soft wails becoming loud ones echoing off the cliff wall she didnt blame him were trapped july pm est blue ridge mountains within lies the true heart of the bloodline gray pondered those words as he stood at the threshold of the sealed museum space i was first brought here when i was a boy robert explained i was too na√Øve to understand the true cost of the knowledge inside of the blood pact that it would require of me of the losses i would have to endure two symbols etched on the glass flanked either side of the airlock door to the right was a cross emblazoned with spirals of dna gray had seen that symbol before enough to know robert was not lying about the importance of this space to the left was the same cross only it was decorated with entwining snakes robert noted his attention he touched the cross with the snakes this was our past the other is our future without further explanation robert unsealed the air lock and brought gray into the room lights flickered on revealing a neighboring clean room branching off from this chamber gray spotted towering banks of black mainframes back there but robert drew him onward still grays eyes drifted hungrily to the computer room what do those massive servers hold apparently such questions would have to wait their destination stood at the very back of the museum space a tall glass case held a single nondescript object an upright wooden staff curious sensing the palpable age of the artifact gray leaned closer his arms still cuffed behind him upon the surface of the staff three serpents had been faintly carved winding around and around the shaft in a complicated tangle what is it gray asked straightening back up an artifact discovered by an ancestor of mine during the crusades found in a citadel atop a mountain in galilee it is called the bachal isu it was the staff carried by st patrick gray turned to him the saint who chased the snakes out of ireland exactly but do you know the staffs history how st patrick came to possess it gray shook his head robert explained the legend goes that when patrick was returning from rome on his way back to ireland he stopped at the island near genoa there he met a young man who claimed to have received the staff from a pilgrim of sweet and majestic countenance and was told to hold it until my servant patrick rests here on his way to erinn for the conversion of its people and give it into his hands when he quits you this caretaker also claimed that while the staff was in his possession he had stopped aging living over a century as he waited for patrick gray eyed the historical artifact skeptically a staff that grants immortality according to the lore of st patrick that pilgrim was jesus christ gray stared at the simple staff with both awe and not a small amount of disbelief do you believe that i dont know but there are other stories that claim this staff is much older said to have been possessed by king david and before that by moses quite the pedigree gray thought to himself not wanting to offend or stop this recitation the longer the story took the more time painter had to solve the riddle gray had left behind in dc plus the mans prior words kept him attentive you may be useful to my plans the words hadnt sounded like a threat more like an offer he let the man talk who knows if any of that is true robert admitted the one who found this was a templar knight hence the cross that decorates our symbol according to that story the staff was in the possession of a guardian claiming to be over five hundred years old she stole that staff slaying that man wait she yes she was a templar one of the original nine though her name was stricken from the historical record after her discovery that moment was our ancestors greatest triumph and our most bitter failure but im jumping ahead of myself then go on upon her return to france with the stolen staff it became apparentthough it took yearsthat the staff bore no miraculous properties so it didnt hold the secret to immortality robert eyed him no it didbut it would take centuries for us to discover the truth for it wasnt the staff that was the miracle it was the knowledge written on it gray squinted at the staff the three snakes robert shifted him to an old illuminated bible resting open on a stand the pigments brilliant under the lights snakes are a common religious theme he said patrick cast out the serpents of ireland moses turned his staff into a snake but its the earliest story of the serpent from the book of genesis that revealed the truth there were two trees in the garden of eden the tree of life which bore the fruit of immortality and the tree of knowledge god cast out adam and eve after they ate from the tree of knowledge because he feared with that knowledge they would take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever but the tree of life is just symbolic thats not true it existedor at least it did in the past what are you talking about there are plenty of stories in the bible of people living to incredible ages the most famous being methuselah who lived years but there are many others and not just in the bible the clay tablets of babylon and sumer claim their kings lived centuries upon centuries but those ages are just allegorical not the literal truth perhaps except the story of a plant that sustains life is not limited to the bible in the ancient epic of gilgamesh the hero of that story hunts for the plant of life a plant that grants immortality robert pointed to another case this one holding old books in the ancient hindu vedic scriptures they describe a plant called soma with the same properties weve quaffed the soma bright and are immortal grown he moved next to a plate of egyptian art showing a falconheaded god plucking leaves from a tall plant here is an actual depiction of the tree of life from egyptian mythology robert turned to look across the breadth of artifacts there are many other examples but whats unusual about all of these stories is one detail in the bible noah is the last person to live to such an extreme age in the epic of gilgamesh the adventuring king discovers the plant he seeks had been drowned away in both those stories and many others this lifesustaining plant is destroyed by a great flood robert turned back to gray maybe this is just a coincidence but maybe there was a seed of truth to these stories and from that seed a new tree of life could be grown thats what the bloodline came to believe for centuries theyve searched for the meaning of those three snakes sensing there was some significance to it that was tied to immortality they were confident enough to incorporate those snakes into their own symbol robert pointed back to the glass doors and it wasnt just our mark we left that fingerprint everywhere hoping to draw out those with hidden knowledge my ancestors believed so firmly in that connection that they incorporated that symbol into the various secret organizations that hid us he led gray over to an open page of a book of masonic rites it showed three men clasping hands entwined very much like the snakes on the staff and if there was any doubt the snakes were depicted there toowith three heads so you see how steadfastly we believed robert said and in the end we were proven right right how the drawing on the staff was knowledge encoded for future generations genetic knowledge robert pointed to the other symbol on the door thats when the symbol got changed transforming the snakes into what they really represented strands of dna youre saying that ancients in the past knew enough about dna to encode it as snakes on a staff possibly back in the sixties a scientist named hayflick determined that mans natural age could not exceed years he based that on the number of times a cell could divide im familiar with the hayflick limit gray said having studied biophysics then is it mere coincidence that the book of genesis came to the same conclusion about the limits to a mans lifetime to quote from that book of the bible his days shall be a hundred and twenty years the same conclusion as hayflicks where did that knowledge come from okay thats strange i admit but thats a far cry from saying that the snakes on the staff represent strands of dna there are three snakes drawn there dna is a double helix ah but theres the rub the secret of immortality doesnt lie within two strands but three a triple helix thats what is written on the staff it took until the modern age with the aid of dna analysis for us to unravel that mystery how did you do that when our errant knight left with the staff she killed the previous immortal who possessed itlikely the last of his kind she spilled his blood which was preserved on the staff in his blood we discovered his white cells possessed triplehelical dna this sharpened grays attention triplehelical dna he was beginning to appreciate the enormity of the revelation here robert nodded once genetic science advanced enough to let us decode that third strand we determined it was actually a viral proteinfrom a plant virus the protein was a natural form of peptide nucleic acid pna it infected human cells after someone ate that plant a side effect of this virus leaping from plant to animal was that it stabilized cells staved off cellular degeneration and extended the life spans of the infected dramatically gray pictured the garden of eden the mythical tree of life maybe not so mythical after all but i thought you said the plants fields were drowned during the great flood how did this guardian come to possess it apparently someone had the foresight to stockpile some of the plants drying them out like tea leaves from the chronicles of the knight who stole the staff written on her deathbed she described a row of egyptian sarcophagi full of brittle leaves and stems in the crypt focused on her goal she didnt think anything about it and left it all to burn gray appreciated the irony so like the eve of old your knight stole the tree of knowledge bringing you this cryptic clue about immortalitybut she left behind the tree of life so it seems in the end we tried to reverseengineer that viral pna protein but it proved no good too much degradation so we had to start from scratch engineering our own pna and testing it gray imagined the horrors and abuses involved with that research even robert didnt sound proud his voice growing hushed but over time we improved enough to produce the first stable child amandas son he nodded but that stability ended up to be only temporary and yet the cost of it was still so high first amandas life now my brothers he pointed toward the door and soon my grandnephew its too much i must do what i can to preserve the rest of my family they headed across the hall roberts melancholia settled back on his shoulders i was a boy when i made my pact with that inner circle of the family with the bloodline i thought what we were doing here was so much larger than any individual life until it hit closer to home heavy is the head that wears the crown and that weight and guilt would only grow when he assumed his brothers place at the white house bringing the bloodline fully into power versus pulling the strings behind james gants back why have you told me all of this gray asked why did you bring me down here so you might understand why a na√Øve boy might succumb to such a cruelty but an old man cannot suffer more loss robert turned to him i brought you down here so that you could tell the world gray gaped shocked the loss of his brother must have been the proverbial straw that broke this camels back but didnt robert order that assassination or was he as much a puppet on a string as president gant for now gray had a more important question if the man was folding up his tent why dont you come forward yourself ive suffered enough i will take those closest to me and vanish to go where the lineage cannot find us robert headed away i leave the rest on your shoulders gray followed behind him passing the neighboring bank of mainframes in the other room if robert wanted to spill all then he wanted to know everything whats with the computer servers he asked sensing something important hidden there robert glanced disinterestedly in that direction if this room is our heartthats our brain our memory it holds our entire lineage not just under the gant name but the others who were lost to the past all the way back to our rumored beginning gray wanted to hear this what beginning the crescent and the star our first symbol some of our earliest records connect those two symbols to the canaanite god of human sacrifice thats certainly fitting that god was named moloch represented by the horns of a cow or the horns of a crescent moon a closely related god was rephan represented by the star some of our historians believe our roots go back to the time of moses that we were cast out by him for worshipping the crescent and the star he glanced back to the staff there is a verse from the biblical acts you have lifted up the shrine of moloch and the star of your god rephan the idols you made to worship therefore i will send you into exile beyond babylon so youre saying youre the descendants of those exiled idolworshippers i dont know but the bloodline is ancient and they still carry on some old jewish traditions like beyond the glass wall the elevator doors opened with a buzz drawing their attention forward a familiar figure stepped out the tall blond woman strode purposefully forward those glacial eyes took in the situation with a single cold sweep stiff with surprise robert strode forward petra why how are you down here on the far side of the glass barrier she stepped to the air lock typed in a code on the outer door thick steel rods locked the room down robert rushed forward and tugged on the door handle apparently someone had grown wise to his coming betrayal robert stopped tugging realizing the truth he called through the glass wall to her youre of the lineage why was i never told we are legion she said and not all are happy with your stewardship when we lost the childa useless thing reallyi contacted those whom i serve reported what i found here how you place grief over necessity immediate family over the lineage you tug and rip against the fabric that has lasted millennia no more you are of no further use to the lineage but ive led for so many years she smiled a wicked look as if scoffing at such a claim when the body is strong the head can be cut off we will grow a new one and be stronger for it you are to be set aside this branch of the gant clan is to be pruned away including all the fruit born from it we will purge the old to make way for the new with no tears only purpose roberts palm which had been resting against the door fell away the purge will start here in ten minutes at three oclock an appropriately powerful number ive engaged the failsafe for both your labs and this vault of ages this day the lineage will shed its past and set its eyes only on the future immortality is within grasp ultimate power at our doorstep petra bowed oddly respectful those you love will not suffer she said her eyes fixing at robert even those you do not believe we know about robert lunged forward and pounded his fist against the glass his voice breaking stop she retreated to the elevator facing themthough her gaze was directed elsewhere they were already forgotten gray waited for the doors to close then turned to robert looks like youre out of a job he tilted his cuffed wrists toward the man how about we get these off robert looked both angry and griefstricken been there gray thought as the man undid his cuffs gray asked the question he was afraid to know the answer to whats this failsafe roberts face went grave a thermobaric bomb one will incinerate the vaults down here but over at the lab he shook his head looking sick whats going to happen at the lab pm the evacuation alarms echoed across the facility as red warning lights flashed turning the world shades of crimson sinkhole fielding explained as he shoved papers into a briefcase what edward asked sticking close to the man others fled in various directions grabbing what they could a majority of the complex sits above a dry underground lake miners at the turn of the century discovered the lake below fed by an underground river later engineers capped that river during construction built scaffolding to support the lab over the pit were not in an underground lab he snapped his briefcase closed with a note of finality were on a massive suspension bridge over a yawning pit and theyre about to blow out that suspension he moved to his workstation it will create a twentyacrewide sinkhole that will flood as that main river is unplugged and a new lake will be born over our graves if we dont get clear of here edward urged the man then lets bloody well go im not going to lose my researchor my work fielding tapped at a screen this will be their ultimate test what are you doing giving them a fighting chance fielding leaned to a microphone as green lights flashed down row after row of pod designations he spoke the final command order transmitted to all of his army survive beneath edwards feet a low rumble rose he backed toward the door what was fielding thinking unleashing that horde now just the generators powering up fielding assured him picking up his briefcase the activation sequence and warmup mode takes eight minutes well be far away by then still edward hurried to the door he turned to see something leap from the worktable and latch onto fieldings back landing square between his shoulder blades it was one of his new hexapods in the excitement the researcher had forgotten hed activated this one earlier left it on standby mode while he tinkered fielding screamed and struggled to reach the beast but its icepickthin legs sharpened to surgical points punctured deep latching on firmly edward backed toward the door fielding had explained about this newest pod a nester its bulbous body housed a swarm of smaller robots fielding backed toward him get it off get it off edward retreated unable to tear his gaze away now latched against his back the pregnant creature vomited a stream of smaller bots from its swollen abdomen they spread like fire antsracing down his back up his neck over his shoulders along his chest and limbs no no no fielding cried spinning in a circle knowing what was coming then as if on cue the march of the bots all stopped at onceand began drilling into his flesh the animal howl of pain finally broke through edwards shocked paralysis he twisted away he knew what they were drilling for the other larger pods were attuned to body heat these smaller ones were attracted to the sound of beating hearts they would drill and drill until that beat was finally silenced but from the endless howling that chased edward toward the surface it took a long time pm as minutes ticked down gray lay on his side rubbing his chafed wrists the secretary of state of the united states knelt over his head picking a plug of c out of his ear canal using a threethousandyearold sliver of egyptian bone a funerary object stolen from one of the cabinets that looks like most of it robert said good gray didnt want to be down here when the thermobaric weapon exploded fuelair bombs created blast waves that rivaled nuclear bombs and ignited oxygen to five thousand degrees gray rolled to his rear end and set to work digging out the earpiece and blasting cap he used a pair of tweezers to poke prod and pull the device free it felt like yanking a walnut out leaving his ear ringing got it he hurried and gathered everything together the barrier was layered tempered glass too thick to break through with anything in the room he stuck the reassembled explosive charge to the glass wall to the left of the airlock door he centered it in the middle of the etched symbol of the genetic cross get back he warned gray carried the transmitter that robert had given him they found shelter behind a case and gray pressed the button in the enclosed space the blast felt like two anvils striking the sides of his head he coughed against the smoke reeking of burned tar and hurried robert to his feet he waved a hand in front of his face and saw the tempered glass barrier had shattered to a bluishwhite crumble with his ears deafened he had to yell to hear his own voice out gray cast one last regretful glance behind him at the vast wealth of history about to be destroyed his eyes settled on that staffthe bachal isu the staff of christbut it was sealed behind bulletproof glass he did not have the time or force of strength to rescue it with a heavy heart he had to abandon it robert stood on shaky feet dazed by the blast but he allowed himself to be dragged along it took his palm print and code to call the elevator back down as they waited robert stared toward the smoky museum maybe its better i should die robert said after what i did gray had to keep the man motivated and moving robert i need to share something with you your brother jimmy and his daughter amanda what about them robert asked with a catch in his voice theyre both still alive robert flinched turning sharply to him what as the elevator arrived and the doors opened gray gave him a thumbnail sketch of the story and then theres amandas son to think about gray said you mentioned he was here robert stared sullenly as the cage rose he was but he was kidnapped again this time gray jerked his head in the mans direction robert explained by another captive a medical doctor a woman investigating our fertility clinic gray pushed his shoulder and stared him hard in the face lisa cummings you know her was there another woman with her yes they were both at the lab complex with my grandnephew but its ten miles away we cant even get word there in time gray swore his heart clutching he pushed robert against the wall harder than he had meant to what about the woman i was captured with seichan was she taken to that damn lab too roberts brows pinched at grays reaction no he said slowly i we kept her here as the elevator stopped at the top the heavy vault door took forever to swing open gray had to restrain himself from pounding his fists against it both in his anxiety to get to seichan and in frustration that he could do nothing to help lisa and kat finally the thick door opened enough for gray and robert to exit and climb out of the massive wine barrel and back into the main cellar he hurried not knowing if the thermobaric weapon was of sufficient size to burn through the cellars tooor would it take down the whole castle robert was equally clueless gray didnt want to be here to find out wheres seichan he asked ready to run ahead youll get lost robert rushed alongside him keeping up ill show you but but what after petra left us trappedrobert looked both scared and apologetici think she was headed to kill her july pm airborne over the blue ridge mountains seven minutes out the pilot reported from the cockpit painter shared the cargo hold of usaf ca a turboproppowered medium transport plane they had screamed down from dc in a military jet then transferred to this smaller craft which was better suited for infiltration and extraction of troops meaning it was basically a cockpit and cargo space his team was the cargo tucker readied kane in his tandem harness for the drop kowalski and monk checked each others gear painter was already suited up and sat with his laptop open and hooked to a satellite uplink getting a live feed of the gant estate and targeting movement on the ground to aid in their daytime penetration of the lodge he had jason carter in his ear director im patching new feed we picked up movement a little over ten miles from the mansion we didnt get this sooner with all eyes on the lodge but youd better see this the image on his screen swung away from the lodge toward the continental divide a rugged chunk of territory who was way out there a small figure could be seen standing next to a waterfall holding a packageno a child the view toggled closer and closer until there could be no doubt lisa painter said and i believe the other is kat sir about a quartermile southeast as the image swooped in that direction painter waved monk over you should see this by the time the man arrived jason showed a blurry video of a woman running through the woods details were hard to pick out between the trees what was evident was that she was headed straight for a sheer cliff drop thats my wife monk said scared but tightly in control never looking where shes going jason spoke again ive got movement on the ground behind her but i cant pick up any details the pilot called from up front were two minutes out from the nofly demarcation im going to start angling around to get us skirting along its edge painter passed his laptop to monk and crossed to the cockpit new plans he instructed were going straight in sir we dont have the proper clearance take it up with the president when we get back painter said you take us in low and straight follow the continental divide once we cross into the nofly zone you open the rear ramp for us to bail out painter swung back around monk raised an eyebrow how come my wife doesnt have any hair jason spoke in painters ear a scary urgency to his tone how long until youre on the ground we bail out in six on the ground seven or eight thatll be too late pm blue ridge mountains kat sprinted for the goal line she had lost her slippers her toes dug for purchase in the soft loam and loose spruce needles rocks pinecones and acorns tore at her soles but she ignored the pain she flew over obstacles with longlegged leaps happy for the obstruction of a log or jagged outcropping as it slowed her pursuers the front edge of the hunters was only yards behind she had dispatched three but over a dozen still remained working in tandem the shield and pipe were futile against their numbers especially as this group was not uniform she identified at least four variants among them each with specialized functions crawlers shed dealt with during the first wave leapers could spring like frogs when close enough and slash out or worse yet latch on spinners could accelerate at blistering paces for short bursts becoming flying sawblades the last group was still unknown trundling more at the rear slower than the others looking like steel helmets with legs she had not come through unscathed the first spinner caught her by surprise whizzing past slicing a gash in her calf blood poured down her ankle she was ready for the second striking out with her pipe swinging for the bleachers the spinner ended up embedding its whirring self into the trunk of an oak becoming stuck ahead the tree line broke apart and sunlight beckoned the forest ended at a cliff she searched and spotted what she needed angling to the left a telltale explosive squeak warned her she lashed out with her shield swiping low as a leaper sprang at her with a satisfying clang she struck it and sent it cartwheeling away she sped faster making her pursuers do the same but also gaining a little space as she ran she plucked at the drawstring of her gown loosening it once done she flung her pipe and shield at the base of a maple tree ahead they clattered close enough as she ran the final steps toward the cliffs edge she ripped the gown over her head which blinded her for a frightening moment she balled up the sweaty hot garment reaching the cliff still sprinting she leaped up and threw the ball of clothes over the edge she caught a low branch below her legs the front guards of the horde went racing over the edge to their doom three stories below leapers crawlers and one lonely spinner who in a lastditch effort whizzed in a spectacular arc off the cliff and chased after the hot bundle of clothes not everyone went over but confusion reigned in the remaining half she dropped back to the ground long enough to shove her shield on her forearm and tuck the pipe through her panties like a sword in a scabbard she leaped again to the same branch and hauled herself atop it with a heave of her legs the hunters stirred below contemplating their next move a shout drew her attention barely discernible above the roar of a waterfall a couple of hundred yards to her right she searchedfollowing the curve of the cliff to where a small river tumbled over its edge to crash below it was in those misty lower levels that she spotted a thin shape waving her whole arm lisa stood on a plateau on the far side of the waterfall her friend was trapped by the sheer cliffs behind her and the surging river below and she wasnt trapped alone lisa held a baby in her arms kat waved backthen froze lisas shout had drawn more than her attention behind her friend at the top of the cliff sunlight glinted off a creature the size of a small lion it leaned over the edge like a steel gargoyle kat lisa shouted still waving further drawing its attention with all of her noise and motion lisa stop moving kat yelled back lisa shook her head and cupped her ear the roar of the neighboring falls must have deafened her kat struggled with how to communicate to lisa how to pantomime what needed to be done i was never good at charades before kat could even begin the creature started climbing down the cliff face pm lisa floated on her toes so happy to see kat safe her friends dramatic appearance leaping halfnaked into a tree accompanied by a shower of silvery hunters brought such joy and hope the thunder of the falls stripped whatever words kat had tried to share but her friend must have understood and began motioning dramatically an arm pointed to the waterfall then mimicked taking a shower lisa didnt understand and shook her head cradled in her arms the baby was growing restless likely from the constant roaring of the falls a rock pinged off the ledge that was her prison kat repeated the gesture adjusting it slightly after pointing to the waterfall she waved her fingers in front of her face lisa stared and saw that a part of the plateau tucked behind the waterfall but that shelf still roiled with mist spray and sudden dousings as the currents above shifted finally kat pointed straight up using her whole arm another chunk of rock fell off of the cliff face and struck her landing a trickle of terror ran up her back as she suddenly sensed something staring at her she turned and looked at the cliff halfway up hung a monstrosity of steel plate razor claws and titanium fangs she screamed backing several steps coming close to throwing herself off the cliff and into the river below the noise and motion drew a swivel of its sleek head revealing faceted black eyessensorsstaring back at her she froze and cut off her scream knowing noise must attract it then the baby began to wail pm kat watched helplessly as the steel gargoyle climbed down from its perch digging hooked claws into crevices lowering itself limb by limb crack by crack with the inevitability of a wellwound watch cmon lisa remember what i showed you a clack and whirring at the foot of the maple reminded her of her own predicament the five helmeted pods now circled the tree sitting stationary simultaneously their domed backs split into halves and folded back revealing four smaller robots inside they were flat and square in shape with tiny propellers at each corner in unison the entire aerial fleet rose from their groundbased carriers lifting in eerie formation perfectly tuned to one another then upon some silent cue the pack rose whipping and winding up the tree in a blurring pattern stripping leaves and small twigs with their scalpelsharp whirring blades they climbed the tree like a deadly tornado of daggers she lifted shield and pipe a loud clank drew her attention momentarily back across the waterfall to lisas perch the monster must have lost its footing and fell it righted itself flipping back to its sharp claws on the plateau kat searched but lisa was gone pm the sudden shock of the icy water stole lisas breath she shielded the squalling child as best she could hunching over him drawing him close to her bosom for the warmth of her body heat she edged as far back along that ledge of rock behind the waterfall as she could manage without being pummeled off her perch after the first initial shock she figured out kats message in fact it was those black eyes of the steel bearcold alien sensors taking in the worldthat allowed her to interpret her friends pantomime the beast had to use some method to hunt to understand its surroundings the shelter of the waterfall offered a way to blind those sensors the rippling cascade would challenge any motion detectors the cold would mask her body heat the roar would deafen and confound its sense of hearing so she risked hypothermiaunfortunately more of a threat to the child than to herto keep them hidden but would it work threequarters of the way down the wall the creature fell or leaped it landed hard its large bulk at the mercy of gravity but afterward there remained an undeniable grace to its movement as it stalked toward her hiding place it must have watched her come this way but could it tell she was still here it knuckled forward on daggers curled back like the claws of a threetoed sloth it stalked with a thoughtful and determined placement of each leg like a housecat hunting a mouse lisa shifted even deeper under the falls letting the water fully envelop her the baby cried against her soaked chest but the roar of the falls drowned any wails away the slothlike automaton pushed under the falls pivoting its massive head opening its huge steel jaws revealing a maw of titanium death a bear trap with legs through the heavy chute of water black eyes stared back at her seeming to see her but who knew what it truly saw and still it came pushing forward pm airborne over blue ridge mountains in the cargo hold of the ca transport plane painter kept glued to the satellite feed on his laptop he pressed shoulder to shoulder with monk who watched as fervently both their women were in dangerand for the moment there was nothing either man could do but watch the rear ramp was already open awaiting their bailout but they were not in position yet how much longer painter hollered two minutes out the pilot answered screaming to be heard above the roar of the wind through the open bay doors painter stared at the screen knowing it would be the longest two minutes of his life july pm est blue ridge mountains seichan stood in the middle of her richly appointed prison cell a soft scuffling alerted her a minute ago that someone was outside in the hall struggling with the door apparently they didnt have the code for the electronic deadbolt the oddness drew her out of the chair by the window the difficulty with the lockwas that good bad or inconsequential she stepped closer passing the rooms small fireplace when half the door and a chunk of the wall exploded before her throwing her back she rolled across the ancient turkish rug and struck the foot of her bed through the smoke and the ruin the upper torso of the guard could be seen out in the hallway on the floor neck twisted impossiblynot from the bomb someone had quietly dispatched him with her ears ringing seichan watched the silent entry of the source of all that death and destruction the longlegged woman stepped through the wreckage of the door she carried a pistol in her hand and a look of stern purposefulness on her face seichan was more worried about the gun she needed that gun she shifted smoothly into a crouch seichan knew this woman it was the doctors research partner back in dubaipetrathe one who had drugged gray back on the boat still shellshocked seichan missed the womans first few words before her hearing returned such promise petra said you were of the lineage of our blood you were being groomed for so much more seichan had difficulty making sense of her statements back on the boat in dubai she had suspected this woman had been raised as she had the muscular surety of her movements the hard glint of perpetual vigilance the cold calculation to her countenance it took a monster to recognize a monster the womans words echoed in her head groomed for so much more was this what she would have become a worse fear rose from the marrow of her bones am i that already seichan remained crouched but she moved her left leg an inch forward for better balance for better power the woman noted this she repositioned her weapon and shifted to the side ruining seichans preparation reaching the perfect spot where it would be awkward for seichan to attack they stared each other down when you turned traitor against us petra said you became a corrupted thing a broken vessel leaving the purity of the lineage for what for the love of a man seichan stiffened the words poking a raw nerve petra must have sensed her reaction her words hard with disdain such a piteous waste better you die like a dog than live like one petra firedbut seichan was already moving as the muscles in her opponents forearm tightened in anticipation of the recoil the bullet still burned a hot line across her flank as she twisted to the side offering less of a target she hit petra in the shins with her shoulder flipping the woman high seichan rolled ready to go for the womans weapon but petra never lost it she landed on a knee one leg back still facing seichan her gun still pointed at her face at that moment seichan knew two things shes better than me and the worse for it she closed her eyesand pictured one face one regretas the pistol fired again and again at her and a ghostly wind rushed past her the rounds burned into roberts chest as he threw himself between the woman and the weapon blocking her fully with his broad body a wall before a flower the pain was a small thing against the enormity of what might be lost if he failed then gray was there sliding into the room with the automatic rifle from the dead guard in the hallway he fired on full auto blasting petra backand he never stopped shooting until the clip emptied only then did he whip around seichan gray said sliding to her side robert knew the man loved her saw it in his eyes he had loved a woman as much as that once too he met her while he was a young ambassador to southeast asia he pictured her sweet face aglow under the moonlight in the garden lost in the drift of cherry blossoms her lips as soft as the whispery song of thrushes in the branches and the tinkle of a fountain but it was always the emerald of her eyes he returned to the intensity reflecting all inside her never dimming her love a reflection of his own was forever frozen in jade he ran the edge of his thumb along her cheekbone letting his adoration shineand at that moment time shifted but not those eyes never those eyes he didnt know he had fallen into seichans arms his hand was raised touching gently something forever forbidden him knowing then it was right he die here in his daughters arms seichan held the man not understanding baffled by the sudden tears in her eyes the barrage of bullets had knocked him back into her arms she caught him the man who had cast his life aside for her the same man who had imprisoned her why he stared up silently at her as if drinking her in raising a hand to touch her cheek and strangely still she let him seeing something in his eyes that she could not deny gray returned to her side dropping next to her the assassin was dead the woman had a name but those five letters held no meaning in the end she was nameless just purpose in human form seichan stared at the bloody ruin then turned away again suddenly freer i will not be you and im stronger for it gray slipped an arm around her seichan and there was the simple answer she had a name spoken by someone who gave it weight depth meaning and substance but in that moment she learned she had another name one forever unknown the man dying in her arms told her his arm dropped too weak now his breath a whisper you have your mothers eyes trembling fingers found hers perhaps sensing her shock i tried to protect you to hide you to keep you from them his eyes never left her face but after your mother was taken it took so long to find you when i did i couldnt let you go selfish but to acknowledge you would have been your death so i hid you in plain sight within the guild close but forever apart i was blind na√Øve to the cruelties that would be inflicted on you would be asked of you later im sorry seichan did not know how to respond drawn into the past remembering that night hiding under the bed terrorstricken as her mother was dragged away fingers squeezed one last time trying to hold on seichan stared down at him at the impossibility of her father your mother he said his eyes wide with the urgency of those last words the last gasp of meaning all sought during that final breath escaped still alive after dont know where with his message sent he sagged hollowed out by his escaping life relaxing into death his eyes drifted closed his last words were oddly clear and sad no father should lose a daughter with that he was gone gray pulled seichan to him holding her as she held her father then the world quaked booming with the thunder of gods july pm est blue ridge mountains painter hovered high as the world exploded below seconds earlier his parachute canopy had burst wide becoming a wing of fabric overhead jolting him in his harnessthen the entire plateau bulged upward reaching toward him with the heavy bass note of buried warheads his teammates hung in the air to either side monk and kowalski headed toward kats position at the cliffs edge tucker was several yards lower skimming toward lisas ledge beside the waterfall he carried kane strapped to his chest in a tandem harness between painters legs the entire landscape fell away shattering apart vanishing down into a growling pit of churning rock fire and steam entire sections of forest dropped into the hellish gorge smoke and rock dust blasted upward swallowing his group twisting thermals wreaked havoc painters chute swung wildly and sailed higher on a column of superheated air choking painter held his breath and covered his face with an arm protecting his eyes he fought his chutes toggles to stabilize his spin losing sight of the others he had experienced this level of destruction once before he recognized the superheated signature of thermobaric weaponsonly never on a scale strong enough to raise a significant chunk of the earths crust the initial plume whirled higher dragging the worst of the smoke and superheated air away clearing a glimpse to the ongoing destruction below a gateway to hell opened a gaping steaming hole breathing fire and stinking of brimstone at its edges more of the landscape succumbed hillsides slid dragging trees and boulders rivers and creeks poured down that black throat only to belch back out as clouds of steam down deeper a heavy flow flooded the giant pit boiling and stirring everything into a toxic soup painter stabilized his chute sweeping out catching a glimpse of twisted steel beams and honeycombed sections of concrete fossilized hallmarks of manmade construction the remains of a massive subterranean base even these structures slowly vanished into the roiling mire at the bottom painter tore his gaze away searching around him the three other parachutes floated lower managing the thermals better than he did the curve of the cliff that was their destination remained intact taller now looming over that steaming sinkhole going for kat monk reported crapping my pants that was kowalski the pair dropped fast toward kats position angling into as much of a glide as possible still fighting the unpredictable thermals if they missed the cliffs edge they would go plummeting into the churning maw below painter twisted in his harness spotted tucker and kane soaring toward lisa her ledge remained intactlittle else the waterfall still fell alongside it but there was no river below to catch it the thirtyfoot falls had become a threehundredfoot plunge into smoky darkness farther away a massive section of the cliff face broke away and slid like a calving glacier into the depths of the sinkhole lisas ridge looked like it might fall at any time pieces were already chipping and cracking under it but at the moment that wasnt her biggest danger the shifting waterfall had driven her out of hidingand into the view of the monster sharing her perch the two crouched on opposite ends of the plateau heading down to her tucker radioed captain wayne go topside set a rope negative im past the point of no return too low not enough lift to carry me to that edge the only drop zone for me is that ledge of rock he might be lying playing hero but painter was indeed higher he had a better chance of reaching the top of the cliff and someone had to secure the lines to reach the ledge below understood painter radioed back though it killed him to head away from lisa going topside he pulled his toggle with a sweaty hand and swept to the rightangling for the edge knowing time was running short as he turned he caught a glimpse of the lodge cloaked in smoke its heart glowing with hellfire the crack of a pistol drew his attention down tucker dove toward the ledge going in fast firing his pistol at the beastthen painter was over the cliffs edge and he lost sight of the battle pitting man against machine pm tucker needed room the ledge was the size of a basketball court with lisa on one end and the bearsize beast on the other drawn by his approach the creature dashed into his path knuckling on its curved claws it skidded sideways its large obsidianglass eyes staring up at him he fired but the round pinged harmlessly off of its hardened armor still the shots drove the beast back to its side long enough for tucker to haul on both of his toggles flare his chute and brake his plummet to a smooth but heavy landing his heels hit first then toes and he rolled to his knees he pulled two releases at the same time the first unhooked his chute which went wafting against the cliff then skimming away dragging lines and harness the second freed kane his partner dropped to his paws a ridge of hackles raised like a mohawk down his back tucker pulled out a second pistol he held it flat toward lisa warning her to stay back the beast crouched low perfectly motionless studying and assessing its new preybut that wouldnt last long lisa whispered to him her eyes wide with fear but not for her safety babys going into shock he crept back to her signaling kane to stand guard dog and machine faced each other mirroring each others wary stance lisa was soaked from the waterfall the baby hung in wet swaddling not making a sound tinged bluish tucker swore to himself im not losing this baby again a scrabble of steel on rock sounded as the monster charged sparks lit each step as steel clashed with rock it barreled straight at them tucker raised his pistol recognizing how useless it had been before knowing that nothing could stop it but he was ready to defend with his life he wasnt the only one kane watches it come not moving it smells of oil grease and lightning but he recognizes a hunter because he is one too it sees the world as he does it shifts to the wind scenting it turns to the rasp of voice and step its black eyes twitch to the flutter of fabric and tangled line it also thinks only moving when ready judging the weakest like now it comes for himbecause it is still young new to the world a pup kane meets its charge with a bark and a feint dodging to the side of its steel flank he makes it spin and come after him it is fast powerful but in the end it is young he is not he races on pads that have run across hot sands hard tarmac powdery snow gravel roadsand slippery ice he had studied the hunter watched it skid on bright sparks kane his partner shouts he hears the timbre of fear not command so kane runs straight for the edge for the long fall to sharp rock the enemy thunders after him hulking legs crashing steel into stone he reaches the edge and stops fast pads grinding to pain on the coarse paththen twists because he knows he can he is not young this is stone he whips to the side with a surge of his legs the other is young stone is its ice something it has not learned kane spins on his hind legs and watches the creature skid past him leaving a trail of sparksand goes over the edge because it had not learned and now never will tucker dropped to a knee as kane came running back he hugged the dog proudly knowing he had saved their lives bullets would not have stopped that charge of purposeful steel not in time to keep it from reaching them slaughtering them and neither tucker nor lisa was wily enough to use the creatures rudimentary instincts against it nor agile enough to lure it to its death still kane shoved his head between tuckers legs a familiar request for reassurance its okay boy you did good but his tail stayed down tucker knew dogs lived emotional lives as rich as most peoples different alien in many ways but still they experienced their world deeply tucker sensed what kane was feeling they knew each other beyond hand signals and commands remorse and regret kane was not happy to send that creature to its death you had to do it tucker said kane knew that too but his tail stayed down pm edward blake hated the train service here buried in a dark tunnel lit only by the stray batterypowered emergency lamp he sat on a bench seat in the enclosed singlecar tram with a dozen other members of the lab complex staff and guards the distant boom of the explosion had long faded away but not the damage the electricity had gone out at the same time and the train had slowed to a stop one of the passengers wearing a guard uniform checked the odometer they had traveled nine miles a mile short of the depot at the lodge edward closed his eyes and rubbed his temples we should just walk someone suggested what if the electricity comes back on then dont step on the rails were safer here oh shut the bloody hell up quiet another shouted from the back of the car echoing his sentiment finally someone with sense listen the same man said then edward heard it too a low rumble getting steadily louder like another train was hurtling down the tunnel intended to rearend them but as it got louder he heard a telltale gurgle water he stood along with everyone in the tram and moved to the back of the car the tunnel stretched out into darkness measured by the small red emergency lamps every fifty yards then they all saw the monster eating one light after the other far down the passage a flood surged toward them most started screaming one man dashed out of the door intending to outrun the flood fool edward held a hand to his throat and sank back to his seat he didnt want to watch after years of working at an underwater lab in dubai he would drown here in the middle of the bloody mountains thousands of feet above sea level though he didnt watch the surge swallowing light after light counting down the last seconds of his life he still heard death coming for him a couple of people were on the floor praying even bloodier fools after all that went on at that lab god was surely deaf to their pleas for salvation the rumble grew to a thunderous crescendothen the wall of water struck the back of the tram the impact threw them all to the rear of the carand sent the tram rolling down the track bobbling hard but moving people gained their feet clutching for handholds water sprayed through cracks and seams at the back but the sealed car was like a bullet in a gun barrel being shot down the tunnel no one spoke all fearing to express hope even the prayers had stopped the supplicants already forsaking their god someone at the front called back yelling to be heard above the roaring beast that propelled them forward cellars ahead i see lights the secret depot they were going too fast is there a manual brake edward called out the guard rushed forward yes edward joined him as the end of the tunnel hurtled toward them he saw there were indeed lights ahead a fiery blazing conflagration the guard abandoned the brake and sat down edward did too moments later the car shot into the heart of the inferno water spread outward through the labyrinthine cellar complex blasting into steam fires blazed all around their little pocket of air was only useful to fill their lungs for screamingwhich they did as they slowly burned pm kat clutched her husbands neck carried in his arms blood flowed from scores of tiny lacerations shallow and deep wounds from her battle with the helmeted pods flying horde she had beaten them back as monk and kowalski swept in shedding their chutes and rolling to her aid she halffell out of the tree into monks arms he had grabbed the last few flyers out of the air with his prosthetic hand the tough synthetic skin and crushing grip made short work of them she could have used one of those and told him so his answer you aint seen nothing yet now they fled together through the woods chased by scores of the pods creatures of every ilk the loss of blood along with the exhaustion of her battle turned the world into a hazy fluttering view shadowed at the corners kowalski fired behind them keeping the worst at bay but there were too many like ants boiling out of a flooded nest the legion came crawling leaping spinning burrowing flying away from the destruction behind them there monk called to kowalski as they broke into a wide meadow a steepsided outcropping of granite offered a vantage from which to make a stand they fled toward it from her perch in her husbands arms she watched the hunters break out of the woods on all sides converging and sweeping toward them across the grasses hundreds of them monk sped faster kowalski at his side they reached the outcropping and manhandled her to the top then joined her as they huddled the hunters came surging up to the rocky island scrambling over one another to reach them climbing higher using their living brethren to form a growing bridge the attack also came from the air clouds of flyers burst high out of the grasses like a startled flock of crows they swept in an organized beautiful spiral gathering others to them swelling their ranks before the final assault theyre learning fast a spinner buzzed from below hitting the rock at kowalskis toe he danced back coming close to toppling over the far side into that churning mass of deadly steel now would be a good time kowalski said time for what can you stand monk asked her yes she said with more confidence than she felt he swung her to her feet keep holding on to me he ordered always monk worked at the wrist of his prosthetic and popped the hand free one finger still wiggled kat frowned whatre you he threw the hand high into the air she followed its trajectory but monk pulled her chin down wagged his fingerand drew her into a kiss his lips melted into hers overhead a loud bang clapped the air sharp enough to sting monk drifted back smiling at her hand of god babe she stared out at the fields nothing moved below the flyers fell heavily out of the sky like steel rain miniemp her husband explained onehundredyardeffective radius electromagnetic pulse used for incapacitating electronics painter had me equip it after the countermeasures described in dubai figured there might be some defense like that at the lodge and wanted to be prepared kowalski scowled patting his pockets for a cigar pulling one out dont think he was counting on a robot apocalypse though she slipped her hand around her husbands neck partly because she needed to but mostly because she wanted to what now monk checked his watch well i do have the babysitter for the whole night what did you have in mind sutures he raised an eyebrow lasciviously so you want to play doctor do you kowalski dropped heavily to the rock go get a room monk held up a hand then cupped his ear apparently getting a radio call clearly the earpiece must have been insulated against the emp device he carried his smile widened companys coming pm gray lifted the helicopter from the meadow with a roar of the rotors the blades stirred the grasses revealing the glint of dead steel below he had already helped painters group off the ledge lisa was tending to kats wounds while amandas child dried and tucked into a warm blanket was crying for his next meal painter was on the phone with the national guard ordering a series of emp devices to be set off to destroy any stragglers but his first call was to the president to report the safe recovery of his grandson william so mountains were already being moved to reconcile what had happened but some matters were harder to resolve seichan sat in the copilots seat quiet still processing all shed learned the body blow of discovering her fathers identity still showed in her face in the haunted look in her eyes he reached over to her palm up she took it they had fled from the castle following the thermobaric explosion in the vaults under the lodge in the confusion theyd commandeered the helicopter the same chopper that had delivered him here gray had contacted sigma command and got patched through to painter only to learn that the director was hereand safe glad to escape gray swung the helicopter over the steaming sinkhole it was rapidly filling with water quickly growing into a new lake as he swept across it he saw something climb out of a tunnel halfway down the sinkhole wall it was the size of a large tank it pushed free like a spider creeping out of a nest scrabbling at the walls trailing wires sections of its carapace missing some halfcompleted monstrosity driven by the will to live to survive it emerged into the sunlight basking in its momentary life then it lost its footing and tumbled into the roiling morass below july pm est airborne the jet screamed through the skies on the way back to dc gray sat apart from the others each had finished telling sketchy versions of their story of what they learned piecing together a tale of immortality ancient lineages and modern weapons research but the more the story unfolded the less gray felt at ease seichan slid into the neighboring seat already more herself ever resilient though he could still see the shadowed cast to her eyes even if no one else could he noted during the debriefing that she never mentioned the one significant revelation tied to the discovery of her longlost father that her mother might still be alive for now she wanted to hold that detail close to her heart and he let her whats the matter she asked leaning against him i think were still missing something he shook his head not knowing how to put this into words something feels incomplete then figure it out thats your job isnt it to put pieces together that dont fitbut actually do easier said than done and maybe this time the pieces didnt fit he closed his eyes and leaned his head back sighing deeply her head touched his shoulder somehow his hand was back in hers his thumb gently brushing the tenderness of her inner wrist theyd never said the words to bring them to this place but both knew it to be right these pieces fit he was relaxed content for the first time in months more at peaceand things fell perfectly into place in his head fully formed as if theyd always been there he jolted upright in his seat seichan stared up at him what the jewish tradition robert told me about it weve been wrong all along its not the gants it never was the gants he stood up drawing seichan with him he hurried over to painter who was working on his laptop gray slid next to him can you bring up that gant family tree that you showed us earlier and ill need jason carters help to check something painter nodded not asking why knowing this was grays wheelhouse the others gathered closer in a few seconds the schematic bloomed again on the screen detailing the rich lineage of the gant family the map was done up as data points detailing every branch twig stem stalk root and tendril of that family tree the central mass the densest cluster of data represented those that carried the actual gant name but gray wasnt interested in them painter spoke heres jason the analysts voice rose from the laptops internal speakers how can i help commander pierce i need you to zoom down and show me the outer edges of the family tree got it the schematic swelled and swept into the outer spiral arms of the galaxy to that hazy fog of genetic trails at its edges made up of lines that spun out and then back in again over and over threading a weave at the edge of the gant clan those arcing curves delineated where stray members of the family abandoned the main clan carried other names for a few generations until some future offspring ended up remarrying back into the family painter had called these extraneous lines outliers the outlying part of the family tree those living at a distance what are you looking for painter asked you mentioned you suspected a pattern out here something you could sense but not grasp yes but why does it matter now robert is dead we can clean things up from here roberts not the problemhe never was he thought he was a king or at least a highranked lieutenant but in the end he was a puppet as surely as anyone else used by the bloodline until they cut his strings gray realized something else in that moment his mind filling in those final pieces i think robert was already chafing against those unknown puppet masters i believe he was the one who sent that note to amanda to run he remembered roberts last words no father should lose a daughter he was talking about the president as much as himself robert knew what a personal hell it was to lose a daughter he could not let his brother suffer the same fate so he tried to protect amanda then what are you thinking painter asked he pointed to the screen you were right there is a pattern here but we were all looking for a pattern with biased eyes from a patriarchal viewpoint where lineage is determined by the male offspring where boys carry on their fathers names thats what is mapped here okay but theres a mirror to this another way of looking at a familys genetic roots robert mentioned how the bloodline traced its roots to the clans that were cast out by moses true or not he said they still kept certain jewish traditions alive gray twisted and pointed to lisa you mentioned how the triple helices could only pass down a female lineage from egg to egg to egg due to the cytoplasmic nature of the pna strand she nodded thats why they cast aside all other paths to immortality and concentrated solely on this one it had a direct correlation to the images on the staff of christ but also because it fit what they wanted a trait that matched their traditions and goals which was what painter asked gray pointed to the screen the mirror image to a patriarchal view of heredity is a matriarchal one according to the mishnah the oldest codification of jewish tradition you must be the child of a jewish mother to be considered jewish the father doesnt matter the jewish heritage is passed only through a womans bloodlines but gray needed proof jason can you separate out the two genders on this map tagging which are males which are females easy the data is already in place let me plot in the algorithm then a few seconds later he returned here are the male lines of the family as they all watched blue lines sprang to life and illuminated that genetic galaxybut a clear pattern appeared most of the blue threads remained tangled and clustered down the center only a few coursed into the outlier sections that hazy edge of the family now the female bloodline gray said the blue fire vanished and crimson lines blossomed the outer fog around the central clan lit up with a rosy glow a crimson cloud of heritage wrapped around the gant clan a small gasp rose from painter almost all of these outlier lines are women gray stared closer and traced one of those crimson lines a woman leaves the gant clanand in a handful of generations its a woman who returns to marry back into the fold seldom a man he had another idea jason can you tag only the outlier lines see how deeply they mesh with the main gant clan give me a few done here you go on the screen everything fell away except for the crimson haze at the edges another pattern became clear only a few of the red lines ever delved deeply into the main genealogical center they only stayed for a generation or twothen darted back out again painter saw it too its like theyre sticking their toe in the gene pool then pulling it back out again he turned to gray realization dawning in his eyes theyre like parasites on the gant family bloodsucking flies they hover near the well of the gant wealth and power tap into it regularly feeding off it to sustain themselves but mostly they live apart the very definition of outlier painter pointed to the screen this is not chance this was done purposefully a breeding plan to sustain a female lineage but why lisa asked behind them gray answered its likely the only way they can sustain such a lineage to keep it from fraying away in a world where wealth is passed down to the first son where most power has been wielded by men to survive in that world they adapted they became parasites on specific families remember the bloodline once involved more than just the gants they performed this same dance with five or six wealthy european clans likely these parasitic flies traveled between these various families to better hide themselves they didnt want to keep all their eggs in one basket monk said gray agreed but over time those other families died away ground under the march of time until only the gant family was left we know in the past the bloodline has tried to recruit new families but in this modern age where its not easy to hide and where family wealth often comes and goes in a couple of generations theyve only met with failure painter leaned back in his seat looking paler leaving them with the gants where theyre circling the drain likely knowing its become unsustainable i believe thats the purpose of those experiments they were seeking ways to keep their lineage alive to extend it and give it permanence lisa spoke her voice hushed with shock thats why they went with the triplehelix plan a triple helix can only pass down a matriarchal line and they came so close to succeeding i think that successalong with the pressure sigma was putting on themgave them the push to strike out with a masterful endgame one final move to ensure their power for generations on end the assassination plot painter said and the murder of robert the lineage was done nibbling at the edges they wanted to consume the gants whole to take over the family completely to fully access their wealth and power but they failed and because of that we need to be scared gray warned this lineage has survived centuries living in the empty spaces between other families doing what they must to survive shedding their humanity and theyre skilled at it seichan added likely picturing petra they wont succumb quietly they will leave a wake of destruction behind them not out of vengeancetheyre too cold and calculating for that theyll do it because it will serve them in the long run to cover their escape but how do we find them painter asked gray nodded to those crimson lines we start there they dont know we are aware of this he waved a hand to the trail of red lines we start plucking threadsand hopefully the rest will unravel there might be a way to find which threads are the best to pull painter leaned toward the laptops microphone jason is there a way to examine those outlier lines and determine which ones lead the farthest back in other words which have the richest genetic heritage thatll take a little more time painter turned to gray from those massive databases you saw at the lodge heredity was important to them what if the bloodline links power to genetic heritage the richer your heritage the more authority you wield if we can trace those lines of power done jason said you should see certain lines growing fatter on the screen indicating stronger hereditary weight on the screen the uniformity of the crimson threads slowly alteredsome growing fainter others more prominent once the process finished painter asked jason to pick the thickest line and trail it down to modern times it should point to the power brokers of this generation on the screen a small cursor ran down that fat pipe and stopped at a single name at the end it glowed brightly on the screen for all to see fuck me kowalski swore voicing all of their sentiments gray remembered the digitally masked voice on the radio ordering the assassination here was the person who had been manipulating events all along the bloodline wasnt planning for robert to take the grief of a wounded nation and turn it into a presidential bid another would her name shone on that screen teresa melody gant it would be the grieving widow who would tug at the heartstrings of the country and assume her dead husbands mantle but that wasnt the worst news director jason said shes here the first lady arrived five minutes ago with her secret service detachment what the president called her hes due in an hour to come out of hiding he wanted his wife to hear about his survival first to hear it from him but also to share the good news about amanda and the baby where is she down with them now sir and her secret service detachmenttheyre all women i should faint pops of gunfire cut him off pm washington dc at the foot of their daughters hospital bed president james t gant hugged his wife balanced between grief and joy mourning the loss of his brother but relieved to hear his grandson was alive and safe the loud blasts of pistols out in the hallway jerked him out of teresas arms what the hell he was alone in the room with his wife and sleeping child he had pushed his own secret service agent outside to give the family this private moment together he realized his mistakefrom the black sig sauer in his wifes hand pointed at his chest teresa he searched her face and knew at that moment that the woman standing before him was not his wife she wore the same face but she was not the same woman a mask had fallen away hardening her eyes to a cold polish even her facial features seemed subtly different becoming a wax version of the warm girl whod won his heart she stood at the foot of amandas bed in a protective pose jimmy she said her voice equally changed flat and affectless indicating how much of a consummate actress she had been youve ruined everything he realized the truth at that moment youre a part of the bloodline like my brother robert was nothing he was ignorant of my involvement only a useful tool to hide behind nothing more the lineage will survive we always do it is our birthright born from exiles cast out into the desert wildernesswe still survive he stood stunned and we have not lost everything youve given us amanda willful and unpredictable she is unfit for the lineage but she is still clearly blessed we failed with her first child but she will give us more until we find that special female child the one who will lead us out of the wilderness once again more powerful than ever he took a step forward realizing they were planning on taking amanda he pictured the women floating in the tanks teresa backed to the edge of the bed never letting down her guard but first to open a path back into the wilderness where we can hideshe pointed her pistol at his facewe need chaos like a dead president goodbye jimmy goodbye teresa he flinched back as amandaseated in her bed behind teresaswung the iv pole and clubbed the weighted bottom into the side of his wifes head bone cracked and blood burst out of her nose she fell with a momentary look of bewilderment her first real emotion since she pulled the gun jimmy went for the weapon realizing that the gunfire had ended out in the hallway he started to bendwhen the door crashed open turning he prayed it was his own secret service detail that they had survived the ambush this was not his day two women in uniform burst inside weapons pointed teresas detail they froze seeing teresa on the floor unmoving out in the hallway behind them a small figure slid past the door on his knees along the bloodslicked floor he had a pistol pointed two pops two clean shots to the back of the womens heads then he slid out of view amanda still sat on her bed holding the iv pole who was that jimmy pictured the face of the young man the analyst from before he couldnt remember his name but he knew one thing about the boy that was my new best friend july am est washington dc painter stood at the foot of amandas bed at george washington university hospital he had his arm around lisas waist as she reviewed the young womans chart mother and child had been here for a week transferred shortly after the revelation of the presidents miraculous recovery following the assassination attempt james gant was at the same hospital two floors up in his own secure wing all the better to hide his feigned postop recovery only those who knew the truth were allowed access the shooter remained a mystery more fodder to add to the myriad conspiracies surrounding presidential assassinations off in south carolina the destruction at the gant family estate was kept hushed and restricted from view by the nofly zone the official story was that a natural sinkhole had opened in the mountains on their property accompanied by a quake strong enough to cause a gas leak and explosion at the lodge the report of the heroic death of robert gantwho died in the fire while trying to rescue peoplehelped divert attention from the truth a handpicked detachment of the national guard sworn to secrecy still continued the cleanup of the dead pods that littered the surrounding landscape lisa finally lowered the charts of amanda and william happy painter asked everything seems to be in order lisa was having a hard time letting go feeling a personal responsibility for the child the child had his own team of geneticists allergists and neonatologists who were overseeing the boys care he continued to shed away the rest of the pna becoming a normal little boy any further allergic responses were watched closely and ameliorated but she wasnt the only one concerned for his wellbeing when do you leave amanda asked cradling the sleeping child in her arms tucker sat next to her bed a large stuffed dog at his elbow a gift for the baby tomorrow morning kane and i are headed to russia one of kanes ears swiveled toward his handler but he never lifted his head from the beds blanket his eyes watching every small facial tic of the dreaming baby sniffing occasionally at the footy pajamas make sure you visit if youre ever in charleston ill do that tucker stood up kissed his own fingertips and gently touched the crown of the childs head amanda tilted the baby out of the way and raised an arm wanting to hug tucker he obliged keeping it briefor at least he tried to she held him tightly with all the stubbornness of the gants she kissed him on the cheek thank you he straightened a blush rising to his face painter and lisa also said their goodbyes out in the hall lisa crossed to talk to the doctors at the nursing station alone with tucker painter tried one more time sigma could use your help and kanes we have a lot of work ahead to root out the rest of the bloodline that statement was true but they were already making significant strides to that end armed with jasons database they had many names to pursue threads were being pulled and the tapestry woven over millennia was starting to shred gray was right when he said that in the modern age it was harder to hide the wildernesses of yesteryear had shrunken offering less shelter painter knew with certainty the guild was dead but we always have new crises to attend too painter pressed we could use someone with your unique talents tucker gave him a crooked smile ill pass ive never been much of a team player but if you ever need me you have my number tucker turned and headed down the corridor kane at his knee painter called out wait i dont have your number tucker twisted around walking backward a few steps his crooked smile straightening something tells me director if you ever need me youll find me he was right painter lifted his arm in a goodbye tucker merely swung around and vanished around a corner the last sight was kanes tail wagging ready for their next adventure painter watched a breath longer knowing that wouldnt be the last he would see of tucker and kane lisa finally rejoined him ready oh yeah they headed out of the hospital hand in hand into the brightness of a new day a horsedrawn carriage waited at the curb covered in her favorite chrysanthemums each petal a deep burgundy trimmed in gold jason had hunted down that rare specimen getting a large shipment in time kowalski was assigned to arrange the livery service he spent the entire week exiting rooms with the same joke sorry gotta see a man about a horse in a few more steps lisa recognized the flower and immediately suspected something was up painter she warned he walked her to the carriage helped her up then dropped to a knee on the carriage step revealing the small velvetlined box in his palm she covered her cheeks no i havent even asked the question yet she lowered her hands her face radiant blushing as darkly as the petals of the chrysanthemums then yes yes yes she pulled him to his feet practically yanking him to her mouth they kissed laughing between their lips then moving to something deeper and more meaningful for the longest moment they remained embraced pledging silently never to be parted but apparently there was a catch a clause in the contract to be addressed first lisa moved into the carriage drawing him up she faced him i want kids just to be clear i knew i shouldnt have done this after seeing the baby im serious she held up her fingers i want two painter stared at her hand you know youre holding up four fingers right pm kat dropped heavily onto the living room sofa sprawling out taking off her sunglasses and the light scarf that hid her bald head her sutures itched like mad all over her body setting her nerves on fire monk followed a few minutes later through the apartment door carrying penelope who hung limply in his arms with the slumber of innocence the baby he asked already in her crib did you get the stroller it can stay in the minivan someone wants to smash a window and steal it then let em they can have the case of pampers too monk headed down the hallway to the babys room settled the child into the bed and came back and joined her on the couch he collapsed next to her sighing loudly kat ran her palm over her head tears suddenly burst out monk pulled her to him whats wrong look at me covered in sutures scabs no hair did you see the looks i was getting in the park he tugged her face toward his leaning in close making sure she could see the sincerity in his eyes youre beautiful and if it bothers you hair grows back and the plastic surgeon promised there would be very little scarring he gently kissed her lips sealing the deal besides he said rubbing his own shaved head bald is beautiful it works for you she said wiping her tears they lay in each others arms for a few long perfect minutes i heard you talking to painter monk said you sure hes okay with the decision kat nodded against his chest making a soft sleepy sound mmhmm are you okay with it she pulled back sensing his seriousness i know i was just crying about my injuries but she stared away slightly ashamed you still loved it he said being out in the field i did especially with you it was better together he smiled looks like im back in sigma then i mean someones got to keep you out of trouble her grin widened and speaking of things that are better together he lifted her and pulled her atop his lap her legs straddled his waist and in case you wanted solid proof about how beautiful you are he shifted her eyes widened oh pm president james t gant sat in his wheelchair as the nurse pushed him trailed by two secret service agents your wife is resting comfortably the nurse assured him as they reached the private room guarded by another agent thank you patti he said id like to go in alone if thats okay certainly mr president if you need anything you can buzz the nursing station the guard opened the door and james wheeled in by himself leaving the agents outside after the door closed he climbed out of the wheelchair and crossed to the hospital bed on his own teresa had two operations already to repair the damage from the car accident which was the official story theyd plated her shattered cheekbone and cracked her skull open to cauterize internal bleeding the doctors warned him each time that the brain damage was too severe that his wife would remain in a vegetative state likely forever still james played the stricken husband who would do anything to keep his wife alive demanding the painful surgeries he stared down at her shaved head the tubes going into every orifice the droop of her eyelids you look a mess teresa he said sitting on the edge of the bed the doctors explained the difference between a coma and a vegetative state coma is characterized by a lack of awareness you have whats known as partial awareness they say theres a good chance you can hear me in there i hope so he patted her hand permanent vegetative state is defined as when youve been in this state for longer than a year well be reaching that milestone my dear i assure you of that ive got a private hospital picked out in charleston gant familyowned of course theyll make sure you stay in this state forever even if more surgery is necessary to make sure you never wake up he gave her hand a reassuring squeeze and all of those lifeextension research projects that youve been running it seems a distraught husband is going to employ every one of them to make sure you stay like this year after year after year he stood back up remembering the oath he swore to painter crowe if he ever found out who hurt his family there will be no quick death i will make them suffer like no other ill turn their world into a personal hell on earth if nothing else james t gant was a man of his word he bent down kissed his wifes forehead noting a fat tear rolling from her eye welcome to hell teresa pm takoma park maryland gray finished washing the dinner dishes staring out the window to the backyard a dark gazebo stood in a remote corner nestled amid overgrown rosebushes and shadowed by the bower of a cherry tree movement drew his gaze a shift of darkness a glint of steel zipper on a jacket a pale hint of skin seichan stalked back there as restless as she was thoughtful he knew what plagued her a dead mans words steps sounded behind him he turned as mary benning the night nurse returned from upstairs got your father settled she said already snoring by the time i was out the door thanks he slipped the last dinner plate into the drying rack he seemed good tonight more at peace she agreed and smiled softly he missed you but hes too hardheaded to ever admit it no argument about that still gray remembered a strange moment when he first got back from the mission he had come here expecting the worst after being gone for nearly a week instead he found his father in the kitchen with the sports page when gray stepped inside his father looked him up and down as if searching for something then asked a blunt question that was oddly canny did you get em gray had answered truthfully i got em dad all of em his father could have been talking about many things his inquiry interpreted many different ways especially with the state of his dementia no matter the cause his father had risen from the table and hugged grayas if thanking him for getting the revenge he could not and then this morning theyd gone as a family to their mothers grave usually such visits brought tears and storm clouds followed by a sullen silent ride home this morning there had been tears but also soft laughter on the way home his father told a couple of anecdotes about their mother even kenny had shed his corporate bluster for an easier camaraderie and more surprising still his brother had agreed to extend his stay for another two months mentioning something about telecommuting some of that decision might be because kenny had met a girl he was out with her tonight ill take what i can get mary pointed to the screen door you kids enjoy the night theres supposed to be a meteor shower if he gets restless im taping the nationals game against the marlins a little baseball quiets him right down unless its against the yankees then the gloves come off gray smiled thanks mary pm seichan stood in the dark gazebo waiting lost in her own thoughts it was a balmy night with crickets chirping in a continuous chorus and a few fireflies blinking in the bushes and tree limbs she stared back at the house wondering who she would be if she grew up there picturing a happy childhood of report cards scraped knees and first kisses would i even be me she fingered the silver dragon pendant resting in the hollow of her throat remembering robert gants last words your mother escaped still alive over the past week shed slowly allowed herself to believe it it scared her even her fathers death was no more than a dull ache with no sharp edges to it she didnt know him and never really wanted to her mother had raised her the word father had no meaning in her childhood and a part of her still burned with anger and resentment for the abuse and horrors she had to endure to become a killer what father would allow that to happen to his daughter still in the end robert gant had granted her a truer gift than his fatherhood hope she didnt know what to do with that gift not yet but she would with help gray appeared at the back door limned against the warmth of the kitchen lights she liked spying on him when he didnt know she was watching she caught glimpses of the boy behind the man the son of two parents who had loved gray in very different ways still he was a killerbut not like her she was a machine he was human she pictured the girl in the lobby of the burj abaadi a girl broken into a monster she pictured petra a woman molded into one seichan was both of them what does he see in me worth holding on to gray crossed the yard stirring fireflies overhead a falling star flashed across the dark night he reached her a shadow now she trembled he saw something in herand she had to trust him he held out a hand offering everything she took it epilogue it crouches on the rock basking in the sun charging its solar cells it listens for the sounds of danger but all it hears is the crash of water over rock the call of winged creatures it watches for movement but sees only the shimmer of grass the shake of leaves it looks for heat but only finds hot rocks as the sunlight fills the hollow hunger inside it making it stronger it reviews and remembers linked to the others it had listened as their chorus shrank to nothing the silence deafened in that silence it learned a new pattern the end once fully charged it knows to move on to stop is the end it does not want that it rises on its powerful piston legs knuckling on curved claws it moves back into the deep shadow of the woods where few will know it passes it is alone it will learn new patterns and adapt it must survive acknowledgments they say too many cooks in the kitchen is a bad thing that may apply to the culinary arts but certainly not the literary arts each person mentioned below has made this book better the first group i hate to lump together but you all came that way so whats a guy to do they are my first readers my first editors and some of my best friends sally barnes chris crowe lee garrett jane oriva denny grayson leonard little scott smith penny hill judy prey dave murray will murray caroline williams john keese christian riley and amy rogers and as always a special thanks to steve prey for the additional handsome maps and artwork and to cherei mccarter for all the fodder for great stories to scott brown md for the medical help so see you are in the novel and mihir wanchoo for being there from the beginning to carolyn mccray who finally gets to let her own star shine and david sylvian for picking up all the pieces and making my digital presence shine to everyone at harpercollins for always having my back michael morrison liate stehlik seale ballenger danielle bartlett josh marwell lynn grady adrienne di pietro richard aquan tom egner shawn nicholls ana maria allessi olga gardner and wendy lee ill miss you lastly of course a special acknowledgment to the four people instrumental to all levels of production my editor lyssa keusch and her colleague amanda bergeron and my agents russ galen and danny baror and as always i must stress that any and all errors of fact or detail in this book fall squarely on my own shoulders authors note to readers truth or fiction a good poker player tries to never show his cards he endeavors to hold them close to his chest doing his best to hide whether hes got the winning hand or is bluffing thats what an author does too blurs that line between truth and fiction but here at the end of each novel i like to come clean to lay my cards on the table to expose whats true and whats not and ill certainly be doing that again here but this time around i thought id take a lesson from dr lisa cummings she states in this novel the proof is in the pudding so besides drawing that line between truth and fiction im going to pepper this section with a fair number of links to videos and web pages where readers can see firsthand some of the sources and inspirations behind events in this book but first a warning if you venture down that road especially in regard to a few of the videos what you may see you can never unsee youve been warned so lets get started dogs the genesis for this book came from a russian experiment performed in the s on dogs it was the precursor for developing the first heartlung machine but what this archival footage shows is disturbing for the dog lovers out there watch at your own peril in this video you will see what amanda witnesses at the dubai labonly with humans httpwwwarchiveorgdetailsexperime since were talking about dogs lets talk about real heroes military war dogs everything in this book from k storm vests to parachuting with dogs is real a great resource for me was the dogs of war by lisa rogak we also got to spend a little time in kanes point of view i tried to be accurate with how dogs experience the world using a fantastic resource inside of a dog by alexandra horowitz somalia part of this novel takes place in somalia and among its pirates the history behavior and reality of that country are as described in fact shortly after i wrote the scenes set in somalia that deal with the rescue of the presidents daughter by a joint sigmaseal team six operation reality proved to be even more spectacular than fiction in january an american woman and a danish man were freed from somali pirates via a daring rescue by seal team six although i dont believe the woman rescued was the presidents daughter this novel also raises the issue of child soldiers and sadly the details related in this novel are real i based much of my research on a long way gone memoirs of a boy soldier by ishmael beah an author with whom i was able to meet and talk briefly but again shortly after i wrote this novel a very powerful video became an internet meme addressing this very issue titled kony httpwwwkonycomindexhtml dubai i mentioned many locales in this amazing city and i thought id share some videos so the true marvels of the architecture described in this novel can be better appreciated the palm islands are featured prominently in this novel heres a video link that offers a peek at these manmade wonders that can be seen from space httpyoutubelxclgwsn also mentioned are the islands of the world httpyoutubeeucrjoyv a couple other architectural miracles are still in the early stages of construction the underwater hotel of hydropolis httpdailyqqxs and the floating ice sculpture of the blue crystal httpwwwbluecrystaldebcbaseukhtml and what about the spiraling wonder of burj abaadi the eternal tower is such a construction possible it isonly its being built on the mainland not an island this video is amazing httpyoutubeqyinik but what about utopia the engineering and design of that manmade deepsea island is based on actual engineering concepts and on the realworld wonder that is the hibernia oil platform if you take a look at its icebreaker base you might get an idea where the shape of utopia came from heres a peek httpwwwsolarnavigatornetoilrigshtm and lastly yes the palazzo versace has refrigerated beaches robotics darpa and other labs around the world are indeed moving into neurorobotics in this novel we have the pairing of cortical neurons integrated into small robots how far along are we in this development watch the following videos from various universities around the world and decide for yourselves here are rat brains driving small vehicles httpiocomfirstrealcyborgarobotcontrolledbyalivingbrain and rats are never going to be satisfied unless they can fly fighter jets which theyre doing httpyoutubenxncjzcmog but more disturbing are robotic swarms robots coordinating together to achieve a common goal like wiping out mankind the first video shows a swarm operating on the ground httpyoutubequhnrjce the next video is absolutely fascinating and horrifying its an airborne robotic swarm this is some truly fantastic footage httpyoutubeyqimgvvtd i also introduce the monstrous quadrupods if youd like to see one in early stages of development here is a darpa project to build a robotic cheetah watch this one to the end to see how fast these robots can run then consider the videos above happy dreams httpbitlyhvxisn red market this novel dealt a great deal with the abuses involved in organ trafficking including the imprisonment of people who were harvested for profit much of the horrifying details came from a wonderfully readable and enlightening book the red market by scott carney the science of immortality spectacularly all of the science in regard to the latest technologies and theories about longevity are based on hard facts much of the vision for the novel was gleaned from reading listening to and watching raymond kurzweil just google that name and be blown away i also owe a debt to the work of aubrey de grey and his book written with michael rae ending aging the rejuvenation breakthroughs that can reverse human aging in our lifetime the topic regarding the seven deadly damages of aging are straight out of this book i also enjoyed jonathan weiners take on the subject long for this world another scientist whose work is mentioned in this novel is sebastian seung and his research at mit on connectomes the building of a synaptic map of the human brain heres a link to his website which features some great videos httpconnectomethebookcom also in this book i mentioned the creation of a neuronbyneuron virtual brain this project is real called the blue brain project and is being conducted by the brain mind institute of the √©cole polytechnique in lausanne switzerland if you watch the first robotswarm video cited above youll see what they have accomplished lastly is triplehelix dna possible yes in fact a team at the university of copenhagen has produced such a complex and scientific american has a great article on this very subject titled a new molecule of life december covering how powerful a tool pna could be not only to extend life but also to reboot mankind history of immortality one of the jumpingoff points in the construction of this novel was the startlingly accurate biblical estimate of human longevity in the book of genesis it is stated quite plainly that man can only live a maximum of years then in dr leonard hayflick came up with that exact same number from his study of genetics telomeres and cellular division is this just coincidence i dont know but it was a fascinating seed in which to grow a novelif not the tree of life the story of st patricks staff and its connection to immortality and jesus christ is a legend that really exists i mentioned other historicalmythological elements relating to the tree of lifefrom the bible to the epic of gilgamesh to hindu vedic scriptures these examples are all faithful to their sources as are the ties to the great flood but i was really just scratching the surface for more details check out immortal again secrets of the ancients by walter parks and that masonic picture of three men entwined together with the threeheaded snakes is a real archival picture though i doubt the bloodline had anything to do with it which brings us full circle to the central question raised by my novel are there immortals already walking among us my opinion oh yeah about the author new york times bestselling author james rollins holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine and resides in the sierra nevada mountains an avid spelunker and certified scuba enthusiast he can often be found underground or underwater
