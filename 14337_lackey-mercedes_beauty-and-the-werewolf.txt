of the fun comes from finding all the fairy tale injokes peppering the pages publishers weekly the door opened spilling out light and heat and laughter and a snatch of music into the darkened street it closed again and isabella beauchamps shivered with delighted anticipation come on she urged her twin stepsisters as they hung back a little it sounds like the dancing has just started i still dont think said amber its sodeclasse said pearl of course it is bella replied laughing thats why its going to be fun for once youre going to come to a dance and enjoy yourselves she seized each of them by the hand and tugged them to the door of the wool guildhall but what if someone said amber recognizes us finished pearl youre wearing your masks for one thing bella replied logically and for another those are last years gowns would anyone believe youd wear last years gowns no they replied in chorus and then giggled behind their free hands theyll probably think im jeanette said amber and pearl is marguerite very likely now come on providentially someone opened the door once more and bella pulled them through it before they could object again last years fashions had included a vogue for shepherdess gowns although these looked like no shepherdess that bella was familiar with she had successfully managed to get them to keep the gowns rather than giving them away as they usually did when the fashions changed arguing that they would make good fancydress costumes both gowns had short skirts that showed the girls feet in embroidered dancing slippers trim little ankles in silk stockings and a hint of ruffled pantaloons there were only three ruffled petticoats and no crinolines the undergowns were of silk embroidered with sprigs of flowersthough only in the front where it showed the draped overgowns were of silksatin trimmed on the hems with silk roses and three layers of ruffled lace the bodices were tightfitting but not so tight that they wouldnt be able to breatheunlike several of the girls more fashionable outfitsand were made of the same satin lace and silk roses as the skirt of the overgown pearls was pink ambers was lilac when she had first seen the gowns bella had thought privately that they looked less like shepherdesses and more like cakes with girls stuck in the middle but then the vogue for all things bucolic had brought a set of porcelain shepherd and shepherdess figurines into the house and she realized that this was how people who had never seen a living sheep thought their minders lookedand the fashion copied it once inside she dropped their hands and paused waiting for the impact of the room to fade at the far end of the hall was a raised platform and the entire platform at the moment was covered in musicians not content with hiring just a few the guild had hired every decent musician for miles around and even paid them to rehearse together there were fiddlers flute players a drummer three harpists four lutenists a trumpeter and players of instruments bella couldnt even name just now they were playing for a running set danceand both of bellas sisters made identical little os with their mouths and clasped their hands together with delight theyd never seen anything like this of course it wasnt the sort of dance that their dancing master would teach or approve of it was at times like these that bella really adored her silly little stepsisters they might be frivolous they might think far too much about fashion and far too little about virtually everything else but they had good hearts where girls who put on airs would look at this gathering and turn up their noses and sniff with disdain they looked at people having fun thought it wonderful and wanted to join the musicians were sawing and plucking and blowing for all they were worth and keeping up an exhausting pace those who werent dancing were clapping and stamping in time and as pearl and amber were about to discover anyone could join the dance at any time bella grinned as she spotted three stalwart lads separating themselves from the crowd on the sidelines and heading straight for them the wool guild had far more male members than female and even with the addition of daughters and other relatives unattached women were thin on the ground at a gathering like this one add as these three unattached women were young shapely and what showed under their masks was comely enough she was not at all surprised to see three more young fellows detach from another part of the crowd and head for them too bella never did see how they sorted themselves out she had already chosen her partner from the six as they approached and maneuvered herself so that he was the first to get to her he was quick he grinned as he saw her coyly reaching for him and he seized her hand swinging her into the set without a single word she had no fear that her sisters would get into trouble not here the matrons of the guild stood as chaperones to every young woman who entered the hall tonight fierce dragons ensuring not only the safety of the girls but that their boys were not ensnared by a young woman who was no better than she should be this allowed the young to enjoy themselves to the hilt in freedomlimited but still freedomand let them revel in the anonymity of their masks bella loved to dance especially country dances the fancy nonsense taught by their dancing master was too mannered and contrived to be fun you had to think too much about the steps and the music was as mannered as the dances the running set left her just warmed up and when another partner presented himself for a chardash she was more than ready to step out she did keep a bit of an eye on her seventeenyearold stepsisters but they were having the same innocent fun that she was they never had the same partner twice they never spent too long in the company of any one young man and when they finally got windedmuch sooner than bella did but then they didnt get nearly the exercise that she didthey repaired to a bench big enough for only two where they were surrounded by young men eager to bring them cups of punch and flirt harmlessly with them pearls careful arrangement of curls was beginning to come down but for once she was indifferent to the disintegration of her perfection in fact the next time bella came around the floor she saw that pearl had pulled out her hairpins and taken a ribbon to make a simple headband with a flower tucked into it privately bella thought the effect was much more flattering than the overdone hairstyle that she had been sporting the musicians signaled that they were taking a rest by ending the dance with a special flourish without being asked bellas partner escorted her to her stepsisters there wasnt room for her on their bench but she didnt mind she stood behind them and accepted a cup of punch from yet another young man i dont have to ask if youre having fun she said pulling a fan off her belt and vigorously cooling herself with it i dont know when i have ever had such a good time pearl whispered as amber giggled and sipped punch demurely no one has this much fun at the parties we get invited to the twins had caught their breath by this point and allowed new partners to carry them off into the dance for a moment bella found herself without anyone to chaperone and without a partner alone and defenseless just the way i like them purred a voice in her ear reflexively she stomped her neat little heel onto a set of booted toes thrust an elbow behind her and nimbly leapt over the bench the twins had been sitting on since the current dance was a very lively dargason this went entirely unnoticed there was a muffled yelp and an equally muffled curse as reactions to her assault but when she turned whoever had accosted her was gone already she knew who it was however there was no mistaking that voice duke sebastians gamekeeperwho was rather too superior to allow anyone to call him a gamekeeper to his face insisting on the loftier title of woodsman he was without a doubt taking advantage of the fact that this was a masked ball to try his luck and his charms on girls who were here without guardian mamas well too bad for him the dog hed found a bitch who would bite back serves him right she thought seething a little she didnt seethe long though a moment later the musicians struck up jenny pluck pears and a partner materialized out of the crowd and she was back to doing what she loved best much earlier than she would have liked but about the time it was prudent to take leave she and the twins met at the bench again in a similar state of happy panting overheated exhaustion i really do not think amber puffed out that another round of punch is going to restore me one little bit me either pearl panted though she looked wistful bella nodded all right then theyve just brought a fresh bowl out lets slip away while theres a mob for punch about this time of night people started slipping something a bit stronger than wine into the punch too not that given the enormous bowl that was kept filled one bottle of brandy was going to have much effectbut it was better to leave while the only unpleasant spot on the festivities was that wretched gamekeeper eric once out in the night air they were glad of their cloaks things were very frosty i think it will snow again soon bella remarked as the three of them hurried through the silent streets to henri beauchampss handsome house if you dont mind people knowing its us we can go skating on the pond by moonlight as soon as the ice is hard enough theres usually a bonfire and chestnut sellers and mulled cider and music at nearly four years older than her stepsisters bella had been sneaking off to these dances long enough to know exactly which ones were going to be great fun as this one had been and which were ones that it was prudent to stay away from bella unlocked the private door into the garden and gave each of the girls a little basket she had waiting on a shelf above where most people would look were home she called up the staircase the girls found some nice things as she expected it was genevieves maid that appeared not genevieve herself mistress would like to see you when you have all changed into something more comfortable she said with the little sniff that told she meant cleaner of course we brought her a few things as well well be there in merest moments bella said breezily ignoring the snub she didnt at all mind it meant that genevieve was not going to be asking why the girls were in their shepherdess frocks when the gowns were no longer the mode and were rather unsuitable for scrambling about in their fathers warehouse henri beauchamps was a merchant trader as his father had been before him and his father before that coming up from a mere peddler with a single donkey at the moment he had a thriving business in furs although at one time or another he had dealt in practically anything that wasnt living and couldnt be eaten bella had always had the run of the warehouse and the freedom to take anything she pleased but when she had asked the twins if they wanted to go to the dance she had hit upon the notion of saying they were going to the warehouse with her now the reason bella went combing through the old stores was because she had an uncanny knack for finding forgotten treasures there many had been the time when genevieve amber or pearl would look at some bit of lace panel of delicate embroidery or other little addition to her gowns and ask where she had got it if she answered the warehouse there would be much sighing for this meant it was not likely there was any more of it nor would be ever again genevieve was consequently quite happy to allow her girls to go rummaging through the buildingwhich was not at all dusty and dirty though you could never persuade her of that thus a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the girls would be out after supper bella had in fact made the selections in the three baskets yesterday they all hurried up to their rooms the twins maid was one of henris household and was completely loyal to bella no fear there that the twins would be tattled on and bella herself did without a maid she had elected to do so as soon as she was old enough to dress herself and saw no reason to change unless the gown she had to get into was more complicated than the simple things she usually wore when she was comfortable in nightgown dressing gown and heavy plush robe with matching blue slippers she picked up her basket and went to her stepmothers room genevieve was sitting up in bed like an expensive porcelain beddoll on display surrounded by the boxes and jars and cabinets full of the pills she took for her manymostly imaginedailments genevieve fancied herself an invalid she kept three doctors busy well she would have kept them busy if they had actually been treating her instead they were pretending to treat her honest gentlemen that they were giving her harmless concoctions made of flowers simple herbs that could do no harm and even bits of baked cookie dough they charged her father almost nothing and yet because they knew genevieve so very well they were alert to anything that might be an illness serious or otherwise he in his turn kept these old friends well supplied with the finest wines and brandies that he came across in his trading ventures so it was a good arrangement all around its genevieves hobby he had once told bella when she made some scornful remark about it its harmless enough since i am not actually paying my friends anything and she is not being dosed with things that really would make her ill privately she wished they would it might teach genevieve a lesson to find herself purging and cramping genevieves other hobby was reclining in her lounge beside the window and watching the neighbors for signs of anything scandalous which she related to her bosom friends in shocked tones when they came to call she should write a book about the neighbors bella thought with amusement she probably knows more about them than they know themselves most of it was made up out of the scraps that she actually saw of course they certainly would not recognize genevieves version of them good evening genevieve bella said cheerfully she had from the beginning refused to call her stepmother by that name or any other that would not put her on equal footing with the woman from the time she had been only thirteen shed been running her fathers household when the new stepmother arrived on the scene she had known enough to be cautious about the other womans position wait until you see what i have found for you tonight whatever irritated or insulting thing genevieve might have been prepared to say died on her lips and she leaned forward eagerly the ribbons and lace on her nightcap trembling with anticipation what do you mean for me bella dear she asked instead i mean i know your taste so i dedicated this evening to finding things just for you after all i can have a rummage whenever i want she sat on the tall stool the maid provided for her thank you elise she acknowledged and cradled the basket in her lap removing the cloth that covered it now here is the first piece did you ever see such a lace flounce it will make a splendid fall from a high collar and this little bit of narrow stuff matches it see she put the two together so perfect for a winter gown to protect the throat from drafts with the flounce guarding your delicate chest yes genevieves hands caressed what really was a magnificent fall of softly pleated lace there was only the one she asked only the one i think it was a sample and here is a motherofpearl flower to pin it with bella placed the carving among the ruffled lace and since i think it would be a dreadful shame to have such a lovely winter gown and not go somewhere in it here is a matching box for your medicines a matching carved comfitbox joined the growing pile you might get too warm seated by a fire and i found a fan with motherofpearl sticks a white silk fan with simple iridescent guards and sticks riveted with silver joined the rest and here are some samples of fabric that i thought might make a lovely gown to go with all this i checked and there are enough to make up into a single gown and last of all she pulled out lovely ermine skins and laid them on the counterpane here you arethe makings of the finest tippet in the city i dont think the queen would be able to boast of such a fine piece genevieves mouth made a pleased little o and she caressed the furs with pleasure while she and bella discussed which of the fabric samples would be best for what purpose or rather she dictated bella noted it all down on scraps of paper which she pinned to the samples and said very little but after all the gown wasnt for her was it and if she thought it was a touch overdone well she wouldnt have to wear it here you are elise genevieve said at last sweeping it all into the basket again and giving it into the hands of her maid make sure its all taken care of in the morning yes mistress the maid replied with a little curtsy and she would too snobby elise might be but she was very efficient she would also make sure that at least one length of the rejected fabric was sent for and found its way into her possession where she would skillfully create a gown of her own from it elise was the bestdressed ladies maid in the city this was not the first time such a thing had happened as elise left the room with the basket the twins swept in with their treasures these were more modest finds embroidered kerchiefs a necklace of her namesake stone for amber another carved motherofpearl brooch for pearl furs to make muffs and a lined bonnet for skating this of course led to and as we were coming home bella said there would be snow and the ponds would be frozen soon and pleas to be allowed to attend skating parties were old enough now pearl asserted with calculation bella had presented her finds now genevieve would have a reason to wear a magnificent new warm gown she could attend the skating party and retire with the other parents when she got the least bit chilled leaving the twins with their governess which led to something all the doctors had told bella and which she had not told anyone not even her fatheralthough she was sure he knew it very well and that they had been telling him this at least weekly for a long time more outdoor air will cure that headache faster than any medicine and more outdoor exercise will mean less stiffness and fewer aches so bella left the twins chattering to their mother all three of them as animated as she had ever seen them she smiled to herself as she closed the door to her room that should keep all three in good spirits for at least three weeks and that is all to the good for me as usual bella was up at dawn she and not genevieve was the one who was truly in charge of the household and had been more or less since her own mother died when she was ten roughly half her life now that she thought about it not that there was an inordinate amount of work to be done the servants were all good reliable and mostly managed things very well still someone had to be in charge or there would be all manner of jockeying for the right to have the last say in things that was just the way that people worked getting up at dawn just was not a hardship when you didnt attend parties that went long into the night didnt linger at dances until you were exhausted and didnt indulge in too much rich food and wine that kept you up all night in the winter it wasnt fun certainly it was cold and dark and until you got the fires going again you had to bustle about the house bundled up to your eyes but that was more than made up for by glorious spring and summer mornings when everything was cool and fresh and smelled delicious and the very air was as intoxicating as any wine when the household downstairs at least was up and functioning bella went back to her room and bundled into her bed not to sleep this was when she did the household accounts with a nice cup of hot sweet tea and a buttered muffin by the time she was done the fires had warmed the house and it was no longer a trial to be up and doing when she had approved the menus for the day unlocked the wine cellar mildly scolded the boy who cleaned the fireplaces for carelessness that had nearly ruined a rug and praised the scullery maid who had saved it checked the pantries approved the shopping list and paid the tradesmens bills it was time for genevieve pearl and amber to wake she liked to be out of the house by then as it allowed genevieve the illusion that she had the ordering of the household as the housekeeper presented her with menus and shopping lists she never read bills that had already been paid and a vague report on the servants sometimes bella had heard genevieve boasting or sighing about all the work she was put to in order to keep the household in order and she had just shaken her head by afternoon however bella was free the twins would be engaged with some lesson or other a foreign language dancing watercolor painting or attempts to learn a musical instrument which so far had come to nothing although their singing was superb genevieve had at least three friends in her rooms for a good gossip now was a good time to escape today was the day for another of those activities on bellas part that made bellas stepmother roll her eyes for today she had planned to visit granny everyone in the city knew granny whether they admitted it or not granny was a fixture there had been a granny at grannys cottage for generations she might or might not actually be a witch no one would say and granny was very closemouthed on the subject officially granny was the herb woman the doctor for those who could not afford doctors the confidante and giver of advice for those who had no granny of their own and the dispenser of wisdom that had passed the test of time as such of course she was exceedingly unfashionable and not the sort of person that the beauchamps should be associating with in the mind of genevieve at least no one of their status went to an herb woman they had doctors come to attend them bella stopped by the kitchen and put together a basket of the sorts of things granny liked best a bottle of sweet wine a block of good yellow cheese the end of the roast beef and the ham and a pound of butter preserved in a jar granny was quite selfsufficient she grew all her own vegetables had chickens and had good trade in her herbs and medicines for just about anything else she needed but bella liked to bring her little luxuries that was trade in a way too the goodies for grannys teaching bella was fascinated by the art of healing but of course it was completely impossible for a woman to become a doctor and even if she could get the training who would use her services perhaps in a place where there were no doctors but not here in this neighborhood the doctors wouldnt think kindly of competition and genevieve would be mortified somewhere in the back of her mind bella saw herself doing what granny did one day though probably not out of the cottage in the middle of the woods that would be for another granny someone this granny was working with even now bella suspected and anyway she knew that she was much much too young to be trusted as granny was trusted when the kitchen staff realized that she was going to visit granny she found the basket taken away from her and filled with other tasty odds and ends some uneaten tarts from last nights dinner honeycake from breakfast a parcel of bacon ends and rinds she flung a bright red cloak with a hood over herself gathered up her basket and went out into the cold the hooded cloak a riding cloak was entirely inappropriate for a young lady it had been her fathers from the days when he still had time to go foxhunting with the gentry but it was warm and cheerful and besides when she went out into the woods she had no desire to be taken for a game animal and shot as she made her way out of the city taking the route that led her down a street lined with shops that catered to this neighborhood she reflected on her own future now what she had in mind was a little shop with living quarters above perhaps in a neighborhood that had no apothecary if the twins were married and she was left a spinster she had an independent settlement in her fathers will which would more than pay for such a thing and the truth was such an outcome was very likely try as she might and she did try she just couldnt picture herself married she nodded to the poet from next door in a friendly fashion as he emerged from the butchers with what was clearly a goose done up in brown paper under his arm he saluted her with a grin and passed on and she smiled to think how horrified her stepmother would be to know he was doing his own shopping nowif she could find a young man like that alas thus far she hadnt met any young man of any station that she would have been willing to consider with warmer feelings than mere friendship she wanted intelligence and she required that a young man be willing to accept her as his partner not regard her as his possession his inferior his toy his casual companion or his convenience so she was very likely to end up a spinster certainly genevieve was not going to put forth any effort to get her married not when she had two of her own girls to get properly placed deep in thought she was startled to find herself at the city wall where guards oversaw everyone coming in and out she knew most of them on sight and waved to ragnar as she approached bella beauchamps ragnar saluted her going out to visit granny well it is certainly too cold to gather mushrooms even if one could find them under the snow she said laughing ragnar you look halfstarved isnt that wife of yours feeding you properly he looked sheepish she laughed and tossed him a honey pastry ragnars appetite was legendary and twenty wives probably couldnt have kept him fed you be back before dark bella ragnar warned as he held back a donkey cart to let her pass through the narrow gate the winters bound to bring out hungry beasts ill be careful she promised and pulled the red hood of the riding cloak up over her head before long she was very glad of her sheepskin boots no matter how unfashionable they were for the snow was well above her ankles a few tracks in the path showed that she was not the only visitor to trudge out to grannys cottage though it was a curious thing that in all the time she had been visiting the old woman she had never met anyone either coming or going strange bella had first met granny when one of genevieves former doctors laboring under the delusion that genevieve actually was ill had sent her for some of grannys nerve tonic needless to say that doctor had not lasted in genevieves employment long but bella had continued to go out to grannys cottage the woods were lovely but undeniably hard to get through with this much snow on the path anyone who came out to the cottage in weather like this was someone who definitely needed granny and no one else the path followed an easy course between two low hills or ridges which blocked the wind it was extremely quiet nothing more than the occasional call of a starling or caw of a crow somewhere above the snowfrosted bare branches of trees bella found it rather restful actually a great relief from the chattering of servants and the twins hold there woman barked an imperious voice from up the ridge startling her so much that she nearly dropped the basket down off the ridge stalked possibly the last person she would ever care to meet out here the gamekeeper eric so far she had managed to avoid the fellow except for seeing him at a distance or across a market square but granny was full of stories about him none of them flattering and nothing bella had seen was inclined to make her doubt them he was full of his own importance unremittingly cruel in enforcing the laws against poaching arrogant and clearly convinced he was the most desirable man in the city or out of it he granted her a long leisurely view of his magnificence as he made his way down the ridge and it was true that if it had not been for the faint sneer on his lips and the arrogance of his carriage he could be thought of as handsome without his mask the chiseled features the fine head of sable hair and the muscular body displayed to advantage by his closely laced leather tunic and trousers probably caused susceptible hearts to flutter but bella did not in the least like the set of his chin nor the speculation and anticipation in his cold blue eyes another girl would have been intimidated bella knew she had the protection of her rank but even if she hadnt she was not going to back down to this bully poaching eh he said as he drew within a few paces of her scarcely she snapped back not everyone out in the woods is a poacher and if i were i would not be so stupid as to trudge about openly on the path to grannys cottage she startled him obviously he was not expecting a mere woman to stand up to him his eyes narrowed and his lips compressed into a thin line well well just see about that he snarled turn out that basket and just who are you to order me about she retorted holding the basket close to her body when he made a grab for it she had begun angry now she was furious and that fury drove out any vestige of fear woodsman eric von teller he barked now turn out that basket anger did strange things to her it made her think more clearly and her thoughts moved faster than usual he was trying to intimidate and humiliate her very well she would give him a taste of his own arrogance right back oh she sniffed derisively looking down her nose at him the gamekeeper he reddened as she opened the lid of the basket and turned back the cloth so he could see that there was nothing more sinister in there than ham and beef there no snares not so much as a pheasant feather nor a tuft of rabbit fur he made to grab for it anyway and she pulled it away he smiled nastily whatever thoughts were going through that head of his he still hadnt realized that he wasnt dealing with a peasant or some little servant girl so woman playing the coy with me do you want me to come take that basket from you he made a grab for her arm but she evaded him she thought about kicking him but decided against it she didnt want to goad him into retaliating physically he swore as he stumbled over a rock in the snow and whirled to face her little vixen i think you need a touch of taming down and i am just the man to do it her cheeks flamed but with rage not with embarrassment she straightened her back i generally find that a man who bullies women is one who is a coward before men she said cuttingly by all the saints gamekeeper you should be tied to the tail of my horse and whipped for your insolence he started again suddenly realizing that she was not what she seemed she glared at him i am master trader henri beauchampss daughter and i am not to be trifled with you have seen that i have not been poaching now be on your way and be grateful that i am too busy today to bother with punishing your insolence she raised her chin and stared down her nose at him aping genevieve at her most superior your manners leave a great deal to be desired you had better mend them and learn your place before you encounter someone less forgiving than i he started again at her fathers name and his eyes darkened further with anger at her threat but he backed away and made a sketch of a bow i beg your pardon mistress beauchamps he said making a pretense of groveling i thought you were a peasant wench she thought about giving him a tonguelashing there and then thought about ordering him to take her to his master so she could report his behavior but on second thought doing either of those things would do no good and potentially much harm she knew he wouldnt dare raise his hand to her but he would take out the anger such a dressingdown would build in him on the next helpless creature that had the misfortune to cross his path so instead she continued aping genevieve the insults would get under his skin like screwthorns be off with you she said haughtily i do not care to waste more of my time with your foolishness than i already have he bowed again and slunk off into the forest she stood there for a moment longer still shaking with anger and taking long deep breaths to calm herself down only when she was certain of her own temper again did she continue her journey grannys cottage was at least as old as the oldest building in the city but rather than showing its age what it displayed was just how comfortable and cozy one could make a little building when one had several hundred years to improve it the thatch was probably as thick as bella was tall the tiny windows all had glass in them the floor was closely laid slate covered in cheerful rag rugs there were four rooms opening into one another grannys bedroom with a canopied bed big enough to sleep four a workroom and stillroom where she made her medicines the kitchen and a sort of parlor the gray stone walls had long ago been sheathed on the inside in lath and plaster pretty little bits of embroidery had been framed and hung on them the settle in the parlor where bella sat was piled with cushions and draped with crocheted and knitted blankets made up of a motley assortment of odds and ends granny herself was of a piece with her cottage tidy compact efficient a little shabby but one should never equate shabby with dirty she had snowwhite hair piled up under a spotlessly white cap a white apron over her patchwork skirt and brown linen shirt she moved lightly and surprisingly quickly oh that wretched beastly man granny said arranging honeycakes on a plate putting the plate on a tray with two mugs and pouring tea into the mugs as bella stretched out her feet to the fire why duke sebastian continues to keep him i do not know well he tried to maul me at the wool guild masked ball last night bella replied crossly he didnt know who i was of course i imagine he thought i was a servant in my mistresss castoffs i managed to give him bruised ribs and an equally bruised foot if i hadnt been at such a disadvantage in the snow today i would have given him a black eye to match hasnt anyone ever complained about him she continued still flushing a little with anger he frightens people too much granny replied handing her a cup of tea in the thick whiteglazed pottery mug and of course most of those who come out here to me are poor who would listen to them if they complained in the first place and in the second in order to lodge anything they would have to take their complaint to a royal court since the complaint is against one of duke sebastians chief servants you know what that would entail bella snorted first an endless wait which means a day or more of lost wages to see the kings sheriff then you would have to persuade the sheriff that the complaint was valid then when the complaint was accepted you would have to come back to court for days and wait in line for your case to be heard granny settled into her rocking chair and picked up her own tea mug but why not take the complaint directly to the duke she wanted to know because no one has seen the duke since he came of age granny replied with a shrewd look in fact the only one of his servants i have ever seen is the woodsman which would make it a bit difficult to complain you must remember duke sebastians father died when he was young and the woodsman has been acting as his guardian and even though the duke reached his majority a few years ago he has remained in his manor and let eric continue to oversee his lands no wonder erics got above himself bella growled ive half a mind to go through the complaint process myself i was insulted he tried to lay hands on me and he implied he intended indecencies on my person and i have time no servant or farmhand can afford to spend on the process think it through first granny advised just have a honeycake and think it through when granny took that tone of voice with her bella generally did as she advised so as the rosyfaced whitehaired old woman rocked gently and sipped her tea bella considered the implications if she went through the usual route with the kings sheriff the very first thing that would happen once the complaint was actually brought into the court would be that her word would be pitted against erics eric could and certainly would claim that it had been she who had been forward with him or that she had been mistaken or that it had never happened at all it would be a case of her word against his and it would be next to impossible to find any other women he might have molested or men he had bullied to bring their own complaints forward to bolster her case even if she was believed there would still be doubts by some she was after all considered to be an aging woman a spinster and he was a handsome man some would look at the situation and be sure that she had gone running after him then made up the story out of revenge for being rebuffed genevieve would certainly wash her hands of the situation and bellas reputation would suffer in some quarters and what would she gain if she won against him the worst that would happen to him would be that he would be publicly reprimanded and perhaps ordered to apologize just as publicly he might be watched carefully for a time but no one could dismiss him from his post except the king and his master it didnt sound likely that duke sebastian would dismiss someone he relied on so heavily and this was no matter for the king to get involved in bother she said aloud crossly knowing that granny had already come to the same conclusion granny nodded her gray eyes full of sympathy now what can you do she asked her expression turned sly and knowing now might be the time to make use of the busy mouths of those twin stepsisters of yours bella blinked taken aback i never thought of that suddenly given a new direction her mind hummed now that is an interesting thought she could actually count on their discretion not to use her name because they wouldnt want any sort of shadow to fall on their own reputations but this was too good a scandalous story not to share she could tell them what had happened to her at the wool guild ball and what had happened in the woods and let their indignation do the rest she could almost hear it now i cant tell you who it was of course because the poor thing would be mortified but did you hear what that horrible gamekeeper eric teller tried to do to a girl in the middle of the wool guild ball pearl could even add with absolute truth my sister bella saw it with her own eyes that would be even better for everyones purposes genevieve wouldnt care that bella was at an open ball it would deflect any suspicion that she had been the one so insulted and there would be no suspicion that the twins had been at the ball without genevieve knowing oh the scandal everyone loved scandal it would spread like wildfire it would certainly reach the ears of the sheriff a lot faster than her complaint would now what that would bring was not a reprimand but a great deal of scrutiny scrutiny was better for her purposes someone would probably be set to watch eric and see if the rumors were true eric was in the employ of duke sebastian and the duke would be called to answer for anything he did that someone would almost certainly be a member of the city guard and a quiet word in ragnars ear about eric again she could count on his discretion although he would probably let a few people know that she was the one who had been accosted and insulted but they would all be friends of hers and she could count on them to keep it to themselves so when the city guard was told to watch eric they would already be primed if he knew he was being watched he would have to mend his ways if he didnt realize it he would be caught granny smiled i can almost hear the thoughts buzzing in your brain she said she smiled it is exceedingly manipulative she pointed out granny laughed whats magic but manipulation she pointed out or politics or diplomacy for that matter a point bella mulled it over it will be more effective than anything else i could do now you know this can backfire if you are just looking for revenge for what really was a petty insult granny warned bella shook her head youve told me that before and while i might have lost my temper with him out in the woods ive got it under control now and i just cant bear thinking about what he must be doing to poor girls who dont have powerful papas i cant even imagine what he does to people hes actually caught poaching she clenched her jaw i cant allow someone like that to go on as he is he is going to become more abusive not less the longer he can bully people unopposed i dont matter its not as if he actually hurt me and i suspect he is still stinging from what i said to him thats revenge enough but others will not be so fortunate if he is not stopped granny nodded with satisfaction all right then shall we get to what brought you here in the first place now that your head is clearer please she said eagerly and granny put down her mug and got up from her chair she returned with an enormous leatherbound book and opened it at the place they had left off this book was an extensive compendium of the medical knowledge especially herbs of at least ten generations of grannies the binding had been cunningly made so that pages could be inserted anywhere and when something new was learned about a plant the information could easily be added each entry had a dried specimen a decent drawing of the living plant and everything that had been learned about it even if all that anyone had left was a notation saying sheep fodder i didnt remember that granny mused her finger on a line that said that the root of sheep sorrely when roasted and ground can be used to make a tasty hot beverage this is as useful for me as it is for you i dont believe i have looked this closely at the book in years but something had been nagging at the back of bellas mind ever since the discussion of the woodsman and finally it solidified into an actual thought duke sebastian she said aloud you said no one had seen him since he came of age granny closed the book not quite true she admitted but close enough no one outside the court at any rate bella waited hands folded in her lap eyes fixed on granny expectantly granny laughed i know that look your turn to brew the tea there should be just enough time to tell the tale before you must be getting back bella was more than willing to brew the tea in exchange for what promised to be more than mere court gossip when she returned with the two mugs full both sweetened with a touch of honey granny had built up the fire again the two of them put up their feet and granny took an appreciative sip of her mug well she said not much of this will be in the broadsheets sebastian may be a duke but he is not one of the truly wealthy ones bella settled into the chair and nodded wealth was as important as rank in the city and a blindingly rich commoner like the master of the goldsmiths guild was more important to the gossips and often within court circles than a duke of modest means and little or no political ambition sebastians mother died when he was very young his father the old duke was grayhaired when sebastian was born so it was no surprise when he died when sebastian was sixteen sebastian inherited these woods and lands enough to support him comfortably but not so much that it excited anyones greed granny chuckled so i was told bella wondered who had told her granny was hardly the simple herb woman she pretended to be but from the way she was talking now it seemed as if she had some contact with people within the kings court or well perhaps not her sources could simply be the kings servants who probably knew as much about what was going on as their masters at any rate failing a guardian or protector being named in his fathers will he was left to the care of the king and was brought up at court until he was eighteen granny took another drink of tea im told he was pleasant enough to look at and pleasant enough as a person but neither he nor his inheritance set any hearts on fire then when he turned eighteen he came into his own and moved onto his estate but for the first few months until he was about nineteen he continued to turn up all the time at court daily sometimes daily that surprised her redbuck manor is not that far from here granny pointed out i would see him ride by on the road down there two and three times a week then something happened he stopped going into the city every day i stopped seeing him ride by stopped hearing the horns of his hunting party in the woods he withdrew and no one knew why and that was about five years ago granny waited bellas mind raced he hadnt any sweetheart so it couldnt be that he hadnt any close relatives left to shock him by dying so it couldnt be that it wasnt some accident or other granny shook her head id have been called not accident nor illness in fact i can think of only one thing that would cause someone to shut himself up on a lonely estate like that bella waited granny paused portentously a curse bella considered that its possible of course she agreed but this is one of godmother elenas kingdoms if someone had been cursed wouldnt she do something about it should she granny countered hes not at all important and not everyone gets happy stories bella gave her a mock scowl really thats cruel of you granny and i dont know i dont know anything about the business of being a godmother but you have said that its not a good thing to have curses floating about at random they tend to be like tarred brushes everything they get near ends up with black sticky marks on them so you were paying attention that afternoon good granny put her empty mug down bella just then realized she had been clutching hers and set it down as well its possible that its a very complicated curse and she still hasnt worked out how to lift it i wasnt telling the whole truth about sebastian being shut up inside the walks of his own manor he does come out rarely and only for those social events he really cannot avoid hes still eligible and handsome and yet he stays on the outskirts of society and is quite isolated its quite the mystery but why put all your trust in a gamekeeper she blurted then blushed good heavens genevieves snobbery is contagious no that is a perfectly legitimate question and there is one tiny bit of ancient gossip that might explain it granny raised an eyebrow its said that eric von teller is the image of the old duke in his prime eh bella replied then oh its only gossip granny said warningly that would certainly explain his arrogance bella thought in fact it would explain all of erics behavior he swaggered about the place as if he thought he was entitled to it and that might have been because he did think he was entitled to it and with duke sebastian being so reclusive he might just as well be the master of the place well then i shall have to give him an apology if i see him again she said out loud i dont follow granny replied tilting her head to the side i told him he needed to be put in his place or something of the sort bella admitted i was wrong if he really is the old dukes son even on the sinister side he outranks me granny made a rude noise i wouldnt waste an apology on that one and even the bastard son of a king gets only as much rank as the king permits he should count himself lucky that he has the position that he does bella looked up at the tiny windows and realized with a start that the light had the distinct reddish tinge of sunset she realized to her chagrin that she and granny had spent at least two or three hours over the book and then far too much time talking about the gamekeeper and the duke bother ill be going back in the dark now she said with a twinge of irritation on the other hand at least i know more about the gamekeeper and i should be able to give him something to think about besides tormenting servant girls they both got up bella collected her cloak and the empty basket and granny saw her out at least there will be a full moon she pointed out and its due to rise a little after sunset you should have no problem seeing your way bella kissed the old woman on the cheek and shooed her inside before she caught a chill it was with no little regret that she turned away from the warmly glowing windows of the cottage and headed into the darkening cold woods she rather wished she could stay the night and granny would have put her up on the trundle bed if she asked but if she did it was oddson that she would return in the morning to find quarrels in the kitchen and everything behind time she pulled her cloak tightly around her and snugged her scarf around the hood at her neck there was a bit of a wind picking up the fire in her room was going to feel very welcome when the moon rose it was a lot easier to see the silver light poured down through the bare branches and reflected off the snow and if it hadnt been so cold and lonely she would have stopped more than once to admire how pretty it was however it was tremendously cold already despite the two pairs of socks over her feet and the fleece of her sheepskin boots her feet were like ice she wished she could run but the snow was deep enough that running was a bit difficult but i could run a bit then walk awhile that would warm up my feet too she thought vaguely but her thoughts were shattered by the howl of a wolf all the hair on the back of her neck tried to stand up and an instinctive chill went down her spine no use trying to tell herself it was a dog for no dog ever sounded like that she remembered what ragnar had said about hungry beasts coming down into these woods she stopped on the road and listened hard hoping to hear others respond to the first howl she knew thanks to granny that she had nothing to fear from a pack wolves in a pack were strong enough to take down their normal prey they might go after sheep or even cattle but they would avoid humans but there were no answering howls barks or yips this was a loner and loners were dangerous old diseased or the wrongheaded young males that refused to fit into a pack they could feed themselves well enough in spring summer and fall on mice and rabbits and other small game but when winter came they began to starve something had to be wrong with a wolf if a pack wouldnt allow it to at least hover at the fringe and glean scraps a lone wolf in winter was generally a wolf with an empty belly and a wolf with an empty belly forgot he wanted nothing to do with human beings she lurched into a trot just as the wolf howled again nearer she had to fight herself not to run right now running wouldnt do anything but get her exhausted and make her easier prey instead she dropped the useless basket and scanned the snow on both sides of the road for a fallen branch of manageable size what she needed was something like a weapon the wolf howled again nearer still clearly he had her scent she couldnt tell if that was a hunting howl or not but it probably was fear overcame sense for a moment and she ran a few steps before she got control of herself again she had to look strong a weakened wolf might hesitate to try to take down something that looked able to defend itself she spotted a clubsize branch sticking out of the snow and made for it pulling at the exposed end it proved to be attached to a bigger branch but a sharp tug fueled by fear made it yield a bit and a second twohanded wrench brought a satisfying crack of wood and she found herself with a decent sturdy cudgel she trotted onward but then movement out of the corner of her eye made her freeze she looked up at the top of the ridge there black against the moon was the wolf looking down at her he didnt look old or ill he looked huge and in good health that was not good a big healthy single wolf had probably been driven out of his pack for aggression maybe cubkilling granny had told her about one such beast that had eventually required a champion to come kill it since prince florians father king edmund had been too young and his father too old to hunt it themselves granny wouldnt tell her why which was curious but she claimed such beasts attracted a malignant magic toward themselves that made them bigger faster and above all much smarter than ordinary creatures she could feel its baleful stare and she had no doubt that granny was right stand and threaten she wondered more chills creeping down her spine or try to run at that moment the wolf gathered itself and leapt and her body decided for her it ran the wolf had miscalculated it landed in snow deeper than it was tall as she glanced back over her shoulder she saw it was floundering this made no difference to her terror of course she thrashed her way down the road heart pounding and mouth dry expecting at any moment to be leapt on from behind one hand still clutched the stick while the other flailed at the air as she fought to keep her balance she was running as fast as she could and getting nowhere and she could almost feel the wolfs hot breath on the back of her neck a glimmering of sense fought its way through the fog of fear there up ahead was a huge old tree something of a landmark for her on the road to grannys if she could just get her back against it she might be able to fend the beast off she put on a burst of speed she hadnt known was in her and reached the tree just as she heard panting and growling practically on her heels instinct not reason made her duck and the wolf soared over her head to crash into the trunk of the tree a shower of snow shook down on them both as the tree limbs above them rattled with the impact she paused for a moment he rolled onto his feet but slowly shaking his head and staggering she realized that he must have been stunned she had a moment of relief but the tree was no shelter now for he was between her and it she shook off her indecision and ran on trying to think of another place where she might make some kind of a stand then she remembered not that far past the tree was a cluster of boulders there was a nook there that she might be able to wedge herself into the wolf would only be able to come at her from the front if she could manage that she peered frantically up the road searching for it among the shadows as she ran and her breath burned in her throat and lungs she sobbed a little from the fear and the pain of her side then shook her head to clear it of sudden tears and when she could see again finally spotted the boulders the sight of that shelter gave her another burst of strength out of nowhere she flung herself at them floundering through deeper snow to reach them then the drift gave way to no snow at all and she felt blindly along the surface until her hands hit nothing at all and she fell into the gap the next thing she knew she was wedged into the nook staring out into the moonlit snow patterned with the shadows of branches and gasping in huge burning breaths and that was when the wolf appeared again this time he wasnt running with his head down ears back and fur bristling he stalked toward her she grasped her club in both mittened hands and waited the sweat from her run cooling and making her shiver with more than just fear he wasnt gray he was dark black maybe and bigger than any canine she had ever seen except for the mastiffs used for hunting boar and bear he gave out a low rumbling growl that she answered with a strangled whimper she saw him tense and knew he was going to leap again just as he did she hunched down and thrust her improvised club blindly forward and up she wasnt strong enough to knock him down and didnt try she felt the end of the club hit something and she shoved with all her might as he sailed over the top of her again assisted by her blow this time she wasnt lucky enough for him to have another accident he didnt go headfirst into the boulder instead he reacted to what she had done instantly she heard claws scrabbling against the stone above her head and then he was gone but a moment later he leapt down from the top of the boulders to land in front of her again in a cloud of loose snow he eyed her breath steaming in the moonlight she shrank as far back into the rock as she could all i can do is make it too hard for him to drag me out she thought through the fog of panic if i make him work too hard for his meal maybe hell give up why doesnt he just give up and go after a nice fat sheep he growled and paced nearer no leaping this time his muscles were tensing in a different pattern then he moved fast and agile he lunged at her and snapped she thrust the splintery end of the branch at his nose not his jaws if he managed to get hold of the stick she would never be able to hold on to it she had to fend him off without losing this slender defense because there was nothing between her and him but her cloak if she did he jerked away but it was hardly more than an irritated wince as he went back on the attack and continued to lunge and snap she alternated poking with frantic beating of the end back and forth between the walls of her nook not trying to hit him just trying to make it harder for him to reach her his growling rose in volume and pitch filling her ears her arms and legs burned with fatigue her feet felt like blocks of ice she tried to shout at the beast hoping to startle it but she couldnt even manage a squeak from her tight throat how long had he been trying to get at her it felt like hours clearly he was not giving up his eyes glittered blackly in the moonlight they should have been red a hellish infernal red suddenly he backed up studying her she held her breath was this it had he finally decided she was more trouble than she was worth or was he figuring out some way to get past her stick a moment later the question was answered as he lunged again his jaws closing on her stick he backed up digging all four feet into the ground hauling and tugging she held on for dear life breath caught in her throat violently jerking the stick from side to side trying to shake him off bashing his muzzle against the boulders as she felt her feet slipping felt herself being pulled out of the crevice in desperation she kicked at his face moving too fast for her to react he let go of the stick and his teeth fastened on her foot penetrating the sheepskin as if it was thinner than paper a scream burst from her throat as the teeth hit the flesh of her ankle that somehow startled him as nothing else had he let go as if her foot was redhot and backed away she scrabbled back into the safety of the crevice sobbing now at last she found her voice go away she cried out her voice breaking leave me alone stupid of course the beast couldnt understand her and even if it did why should it leave such a tasty meal when with a little more work it would have her but the wolf backed up another pace head down tail down ears flat staring at her as if it hadnt until that moment understood it was attacking a human now rather than growling it was eerily silent please she sobbed please just leave me alone it stared at her what was it thinking she scrabbled to her feet again stick at the ready still weeping her ankle hurt and she didnt dare look down at it to see how badly it had been mauled surely there was bloodscent on the air now surely that would goad the beast into a final fatal attack it backed up another pace still staring as she sobbed again it finally made a sound an odd interrogative sound deep in its throat and then inexplicably it ducked its head abruptly turned away and plunged off running into the woods it bounded through the snow a swiftly moving black streak on the white weaving among the shadows a moment later it was gone except for the burning pain of her ankle the entire incident might have been a nightmare she waited sure that this was nothing more than an incredibly clever ruse on the beasts part but nothing disturbed the serenity of the clearing and after a moment she pried herself out of the cleft in the rock testing her ankle it held under her weight even though it hurt as badly as anything she had ever suffered and only a little blood spotted the leather of the boot she broke into a limping run moving as fast as she could for the safe haven of the city walls behind her a long mournful howl drifted over the trees there was a great press of people getting into the gate so no one noticed her state as she crowded in among them the streets on the way to the beauchampses home however were quiet on the one hand as she limped homeward she wished desperately that she would encounter someone she knew someone who could help on the other she knew what would happen the moment her father discovered what had happened shed never be allowed outside the city gates again she began to try to think how she could treat her own injury after all granny had been teaching her this very sort of thing for years now but as it happened bella met doctor jonaton at the front door she had completely forgotten this was his evening to attend genevieve and of all of her stepmothers doctors he was the one she trusted the most he was putting on his cloak as she stumbled inside bella he exclaimed catching her as she overbalanced good heavens child what is the matter her teeth were chattering so hard she could scarcely get the words out but as he helped her in to sit at the fire in the empty parlor she managed to get out the story of her narrow escape let me see your foot he demanded and wouldnt be put off he pulled the boot off her foot and she suppressed a yip as he peeled the stockings off reopening the puncture wounds he examined the white foot critically shushing her as she tried to protest that it was nothing dont tell anyone what happened please she begged father is still at the warehouse and genevieve will have hysterics no one has to know but us he frowned fiercely and rang for a maid mistress isabella has hurt herself he said shortly when marguerite appeared i want hot water and clean bandages the girls eyes were as big as saucers but she ran off and returned in no time with what the doctor asked dont let father know please she begged him theyll never let me outside the walls again if you do i was stupid i should have known better than to go through the woods at night but even granny didnt think it was dangerous i know it could have been horrible but it all came out all right didnt it he didnt look up from his work sponging off the wounds which were no longer bleeding then bandaging the ankle with salve and a wrapping of clean cloth i have to report a wildanimal attack like this to the sheriff he said with an unusually stern expression thats the law bella if wild animals begin attacking humans they need to be hunted down what if someone else is caught unawares by this beast what if its a child but dont tell father please she begged i promise ill make sure that if im caught by darkness ill stay with granny and ill do my best never to be caught like that again i would be a great deal more at ease if you would promise me never to go out there afoot again he replied now looking up at her his eyes worried if you had been ahorse the creature would never have attacked you in the first place your father can afford the use of a livery horse i promise she pledged fervently and i am not happy that he is not to know about this the doctor continued well she wasnt happy about keeping it from him either ill tell him i was hurt myself she said not promising to tell him how she was hurt only that she had been hell probably insist that i hire a horse himself after i do stand on that the doctor commanded she did it hurt but no worse than a sprained ankle she said as much good he rang for the maid again mistress isabella needs to go up to her room and rest he told her help her to bed and bring her supper there but bella began i will be the judge of what you can do young woman the doctor said sternly youve had a bad experience and you need rest the household can tend to itself for one night with a sigh she gave in and let marguerite help her up the stairs out of her clothing and into bed but when she brought up a tray bella had recovered enough to write out orders for the household mostly they were orders of who was to obey whom with the housekeeper getting official precedence over the chief of the manservants who fancied himself a butler mathew breman is to follow the directions of mrs athern she wrote firmly and clearly unless and until such time as master henri appoints him to the official position of butler mrs athern is his superior in the household and if and when that day comes she is then his equal in all things except the handling of the plate and wine cellar she handed the letters over to marguerite with the strict instructions that they were to be delivered to the housekeeper and mathew there she thought wearily settling back to eat her longpostponed dinner as her ankle ached dully with luck that will keep things settled until i can deal with them myself it seemed strange that the doctor had been so insistent that he had to report the wolf attack wild animals attacked herds and flocks all the time and although attacks on humans were not common they were not rare either such things were generally the business of gamekeepers and foresters what on earth business could it be of anyone in the city in fact it was properly the business of eric von teller really it is about time he actually did something useful she thought sourly as she hobbled over to the medicine chest she had compiled with the knowledge she had gotten from granny if he is busy hunting that horrid beast he wont be making decent people miserable everything she needed was already in liquid form as tinctures it wasnt going to be in the least pleasant to drink but trying to sleep with an aching ankle was worse i just hope that there wont be any more fuss she thought as she drank down the viletasting potion fine the wolf is vicious and dangerous but i have no intention of putting myself in danger from it again she had managed to fall deeply asleep despite the pain of her bitten ankle she awoke to an incredible commotion downstairs dawn was not yet on the horizon and she blinked in the dim light of the fire listening in confusion loud rough male voices heavy boots stomping all aboutit sounded as if there was an entire troop of soldiers at the door why would there be soldiers here then came the sound of one mans voice raised above all the others barking orders what then there was the unmistakable sound of boots on the stairs and as she struggled to sit up and clear the fog of sleep from her head marguerite opened her bedroom door and was propelled inside on a veritable wave of tall strong men in the kings livery are you isabella beauchamps the one with the most decorations on his cloak barked out and before she could answer continued were you attacked by a wolf last night marguerite squeaked bella paid no attention to her how what i she began describe the attack the man ordered glowering at her so fiercely that she found herself stammering out her story without thinking twice about it nor about the fact that her bedroom was filled with armed men and she was huddled in the bedclothes in her nightgown he questioned her closely about the wolf itself color size and most especially behavior then he turned to marguerite you will get your mistress prepared for travel pack her clothing enough for a month and present her and her belongings downstairs in fifteen minutes he commanded this is by order of the king what but she didnt have any chance to ask for an explanation or even to protest marguerite was so terrified that she practically threw bellas clothing onto her no sooner had bella struggled into her gown than mathew and two more of the menservants and jessamine another maid were crowding into her room and bundling things into trunks she and her things were rushed downstairs and into the hands of the kings men so quickly that she scarcely had time to catch her breath the chief officer didnt even let her limp her way out he swept her up in his arms while more of his men dealt with the two trunks that the servants brought down and carried her out the door to be dropped unceremoniously into a carriage the doors slammed shut and when she tried them she discovered that they were locked she considered any number of actions starting with screaming and kicking at the doors but it was fairly obvious that neither would get her anywhere this was must be on the kings orders doctor jonaton either had not known what his report would mean or had known and considered the situation grave enough to withhold the information from her so screaming and protesting would get her nowhere and this carriage while comfortable was clearly built to confine whoever was in it quite securely she had no idea what was going on but she hadnt broken any laws and clearly this wolf attack meant something important and that was when the answer struck her and she sat frozen in horror for the remainder of the journey the carriage stopped the door was opened from the outside the kings officer waited as she blinked in the sudden light can you walk mistress isabella he asked with gruff courtesy i think so she said in a small voice he handed her down she winced as she put her injured foot on the pavement pavement now she looked up she was in the courtyard of what was clearly a fortified manor a high wall surrounded the building and the kings men were just closing a pair of massive metalreinforced gates the courtyard was paved and swept clean of every vestige of snow the manor itself despite being constructed to withstand a siege was surprisingly attractive part of that might have been the stonework creamcolored granite veined with faint pink part of it was that the narrow slits of the windows had rounded edges as did the edges of the roof in fact there wasnt a sharp edge anywhere to be seen and the placement of the window slits conveyed a feeling of welcome rather than of a prison the kings men were carrying her trunks into the building via the main entry the officer gestured to her indicating that she should follow them limping she did so there was a very narrow entryway clearly designed for defense just inside the door stone below stone walls stone ceiling and she thought she glimpsed murder slits in the walls and ceiling with two more men with a trunk coming behind her she limped as quickly as she could through it and found herself in a room that offered the same welcome that the exterior of the building promised she had only been in two great manors in her life both of them had what had been called a great hall just inside the door this was a hall indeed but it was not in size anything like those rooms there was a huge fireplace to the right and another to the left the room itself was wide rather than deep and the expanse of floor that could have been cold had it been made of stone was instead of warm lightcolored wood the benches at the fire were made of a similar warm wood the stone walls softened with tapestries and the whole brightened with oil lamps in the middle of the hall opposite the entry door was another door that swung open even as she stood there surrounded by four trunks when she only recalled bringing two through that door came a young man about four or five years older than herself he was not exactly handsome but with a kind and thoughtful face that inclined her to trust him that he was wearing spectacles and a sheepish expression helped thank you captain malcom he said the kings officer saluted and turned and left without saying a word his men following him you must be isabella beauchamps the young man continued turning toward her you have a reputation for being very intelligent so i suppose you have already figured out why you were taken away and brought here taken away yes she replied and shivered despite the warmth of the room i was attacked and bitten last night by what must have been a werewolf i am being isolated until it is determined whether or not i was infected though why i was brought here i dont know i dont even know where here is well thats easy to tell the young man told her looking as if it was anything but easy to say his expression was profoundly unhappy this is redbuck manor im duke sebastian and you are here because i am afraid that i am the werewolf that bit you bella stared at him at first suspecting him of a very bad joke he in his turn watched her with a wary expression in his grayishgreen eyes his dark hair was a trifle long but he carried himself well after a moment it was clear that this was not a joke that he was entirely serious and he seemed entirely sane indignation bubbled up inside her he stands in front of me and tells me that he is the one who bit me of all the nerve her ankle throbbed as she stood there and stared at him waiting for him to say something else because she was completely unable to speak right now more than anything at this moment her mind was a welter of emotions her initial impulse was to seize something and beat him senseless fury was her first emotion fury at him for attacking her in the first place fury that he was still free to run about his woods when the king obviously knew what he was and that he was a danger to others fury at the king for sending her here why fury at the situation itself i will not lose my temper she told herself clenching both hands at her sides until her nails bit into her palms it wont do any good bella had had plenty of practice in keeping her temper given that genevieve was incapable of controlling her own and she employed every bit of that willpower now erm the young man said diffidently im horribly horribly sorry this should never have happened im supposed to be locked up over the full moon and ive never gotten out before i dont know what went wrong eric has strict instructions i was in the special chamber long before sunset and i remember hearing the bars drop into place and then the moon came up and the change started as it always does and well the next thing i knew i was waking up lying in the kennels outside where i wasnt supposed to be he pushed his spectacles up on his nose nervously i dont know if you believe all this but i swear its all true and i didnt know i had bitten anyone until the kings messenger arrived an hour ago to say you were being brought here and to tell me what to expect bella took a deep deep breath my ankle hurts where you bit me she replied forcefully and resentfully i was abducted from my bedroom by the kings men i havent even had a glass of water much less breakfast i am hungry and thirsty and and i beg your pardon the young man said looking even more hangdog that last at least i can do something about please follow me ill try to explain more when you are feeling comfortable when she hesitated looking at the trunks he added the servants will take care of those please if you have gone this long without food or drink his voice trailed off as if he had no good idea of what to say next they stared at one another for a long and uncomfortable time a more charitable or perhaps impartial part of her noted that he didnt look much like her mental image of a duke his hair a sort of streaky brown was a bit shaggy and unkempt she really never thought of spectacles and noble together spectacles were something scholars wore his brown tunic shirt and trousers while certainly quite good were not anything special no gold no braid not even any trimming he was someone she would have taken for a scholar actually his features were even but not especially handsome and in this kingdom at least most of the nobles were dazzlingly goodlooking there was none of the unconscious arrogance in his expression that she was accustomed to see in the few nobles she had met all of the girls that the twins associated with for instance one and all they carried with them an air that said if i choose to order you you will obey this young mans expression said please dont stab me with a fork especially a silver one ii cant help but hope that if i ply you with the pleasures of my table you will feel a little more kindly toward me or at least if you dont hate me too much right from the start you will be more willing to listen to me i do apologize very well lots of practice she considered this the situation was not going to change no matter what happened in the next few hours and without knowing everything involved here there was no way that she could change it and her ankle hurt and she was frankly starving she raised her chin i doubt very much that the socalled pleasures of your table will sway me in any way duke sebastian but if someone doesnt tell me exactly what is going on here in the next half hour i will see to it that your scale model of a duchy becomes annexed by his majesty and given to my father as a garden just how she was supposed to accomplish this when she was being held far from everyone she hadnt a clue but he looked as if he believed her fair enough he said please follow me he led her through the doors he had just entered the room by which led to a very long passageway more fortifications this was plain heavy stone with no other entrance than the one they had used nor exit but the one at the end of it there were slits in the walls and holes in the ceiling another murderhole in which invaders could be trapped while the defenders shot at them through the slits and poured boiling liquid or molten lead on them through the ceiling it was lit by torches in handshaped sconces rather unnerving he led her through the door at the end and once again it was as if these rooms belonged to an entirely different building to the right well she didnt get a chance to look at it because it was the room to the left that caught her attention immediately the two rooms must have stretched on either side of the murderous passageway the room to the left was a sumptuous dining room hung with tapestries of hunting scenes and beautifully lit with more lamps but that was not what caught her attention it was the delicious smells wafting from the many dishes waiting on one end of a very long banquet table there were just two chairs there neither one placed at the head she limped toward the nearest he hurried his own steps so that he could pull the seat out for her before taking his own if she had been asked to name every single food she liked most at breakfast she would have found them here her stomach didnt growl but it did remind her forcefully that she hadnt eaten since last night since there didnt seem to be any servants which was odd but perhaps understandable given that the master of this place was on occasion a slavering beast that might turn them into bloody shreds she helped herself perhaps the servants scuttled in at meals left everything on the table and scuttled out again locking themselves safely in their own quarters he sat opposite her and served himself as well so he was used to it she waited with her fork poised over her plate you promised me an explanation she said a little severely he flushed i am not sure where to begin he said toying with his food well you werent always a werewolf or i assume people would have noticed she pointed out tartly then did her best not to show how heavenly the bit of ham she had just eaten had tasted no and that is the peculiar thing his brows knitted in a frown i wasnt bitten not even by so much as a mouse and godmother elena was unable to find any evidence of werewolfery being in my family line wait just a moment she exclaimed interrupting him you mean the godmother knows about this he blinked at her from behind his glasses mildly confused of course he told her why wouldnt she just as the king knows anyway even though i am a wizard youre a wizard this was getting far more complicated than she had ever thought it could be i suppose people dont know he mused its not as if i ever do anything with it publicly that is he pushed more food around his plate besides wizards arent all that powerful without a lot of practice and well never mind that now its a very small duchy and its not as if i wanted people to know i did wizardry they might assume i either needed hiring or conquering anyway i could faithfully promise elena that i hadnt tried any wolftransforming spells because i hadnt tried any transforming spell so everyone was pretty baffled the first time it happened i had just turned nineteen he sighed its a very good thing that you dont make the change and come out of it the first time in fine fettle it hurts it hurts every time actually and after the first change you are weak and confused i was really lucky that i was here rather than at the town house and eric was there the first time it happened and he had the presence of mind to throw the wolf in one of the old prison cells in the cellar and bar the door then he called the sheriff and the sheriff told the king and the king called godmother elena so i didnt just end up shot or forked very fortunate she said dryly he didnt appear to notice the faint sarcasm they all decided that since i hadnt hurt anyone that redbuck manor was about as isolated as you could ask for and that the old cells were more than strong enough to hold me there was no reason why i couldnt juststay here but of course if i ever got loose and did bite someone he coughed well lucky for you youre not some poor peasant they could just shoot when you finally got loose she snapped angrily he flushed painfully im really sorry he mumbled i cant tell you how sorry i am well as nobles wentapologetic wasnt a bad reaction especially sincere apology so now what she asked i am stuck here with you for the rest of my life oh no he finally looked up at her meeting her gaze again no just for three months until were certain i didnt you know he gulped the godmother says that because they dont know for certain why i have this trait they dont know if i even can change someone with a bite the way another can sonot forever not unless you once again his gaze dropped to the plate full of uneaten food in silence she applied herself to her breakfast now perhaps a girl of more socalled sensibility would have been so upset by all this that she would have been unable to eat she wasnt that sensitive she supposed at any rate she was hungry the food was delicious and whatever would or would not happen to her was not going to be changed by going without breakfast perhaps duke sebastian had already eaten or perhaps his appetite had been suppressed by guilt vindictively she hoped for the latter she paused for just a moment let me make this perfectly clear whether you are on two legs or four your actions have altered the direction of my life without my permission it is your responsibility to make it up to me i did not intend to be here this morning i had things to do i still have things to do which are not going to get done because i am being held here quite against my wishes then she ate finally when her hunger was satisfied she turned her attention back to him i assume that the godmother has been apprised of this situation she asked he started her voice in the silence had taken him by surprise i suppose so he replied uncertainly i mean i really dont know somehow they always seem to know these things well then find out and if she hasnt been told everything do so she sighed with some exasperation really this was like having to handle the twins ill want to speak to your housekeeper your butler too i suppose ah he fidgeted that wont exactly be possible she frowned at him and why not he fidgeted some more because i dont exactly have human servants it really was like handling the twins with every tiny bit of information being pulled out of them as if she was extracting teeth well what exactly do you have she asked trying to keep her tone even erm he replied if she hadnt been so irked at him at the moment his diffidence and politeness would quite have charmed her he was nothing like the nobles shed met so far but she was far too angry to be charmed i told you that i am a wizard theyremagic servants the godmother said it would be safer no one would be in danger from me now it was her turn to blink magic servants like what precisely brownies animated statues animals brownies and animals would be in danger animated statues are too difficult to create no these are sort of like spirits except they can affect physical objects and they arent exactly intelligent and theyre kind of invisible so i wouldnt know when they were about she considered that and was not entirely certain she liked the notion and even if i ordered them not to hang about unless i summoned them i still wouldnt know if they were about it takes less magic that way she sighed evidently men or this man anyway didnt mind the fact that invisible servants could be gawking at them at any time its not as if they have a gender he added helpfully perhaps reading her discomfort in her expression i see but surely you have some ordinary servants your gamekeeper for instance although she dearly wanted to this did not seem to be the time to bring up eric von tellers many faults eric isntexactlya servant from the way he was squirming now a person would have been forgiven for assuming there was a fire under his chair ah hes your bastard brother then she said heartlessly that accounts for a great deal he actually jumped how did you know he blurted no one knew no one but my father and oh do give over she told him pushing her plate away and staring at him until he met her eyes people arent idiots you know granny has put two and two together and she cant be the only one a gamekeeper who is put in charge of the presumptive duke until he is of age who is the only contact between you and the outside world who is the image of your father when he was young and who gives himself more airs than the king himself it isnt hard to put together he was still agitated who else guessed how many she rolled her eyes i dont know since you withdrew from court youve probably ceased to be interesting i dont exactly run out and buy broadside sheets every time a boy comes by crying one i never heard my mother or the twins chattering about you so you arent common gossip granny told me but she never leaves her cottage granny that would be the old witch in the cottage in my forest he suddenly looked interested the nice old woman with the really cozy little cottage who makes the honeyoatcakes i mean yes probably granny is the only witch i know of in your forest with or without a cozy cottage something occurred to her and she began feeling a little more charitable toward the absent eric this is why eric is such a she coughed overly vigilant gamekeeper isnt it if he makes himself disagreeable enough it will discourage people from being in the woods at all which would mean there would be less chance of an accident like yours yes he dropped his gaze again eric wasnt a gamekeeper originally there was some confusion when father died so suddenly about who should be my guardian and eric just stepped in he did well enough and this dukedom really is small enough that the king saw no need to replace him and in truth no one really wanted all the work you really cant blame them its just the town house redbuck the forest and a few mines mostly tin the income is enough to keep up the town house and redbuck but its nothing fabulous my heir is my second cousin and hes already got a larger dukedom so it isnt as if he needs this one privately bella thought it was fabulous enough and certainly genevieve would have been in ecstasy merely to be in the presence of a duke but she supposed that by the standards of the others in the court duke sebastian was small pickings indeed she had heard stories from genevieve and the twins usually when she was involuntarily caught in the middle of gossip sessions with callers about dukedoms with vast acreage hundreds and thousands of sheep and cattle incredible palaces that dazzled with their opulence a forest a few mines a town house and a fortified manor didnt seem to measure up to that i remember granny very well sebastian was saying as she shook herself out of her thoughts and decided to help herself to a slice of pie i used to ride out on my pony with the hunts and father would leave me with her because that was generally where my ponys legs got tired is it still the same granny i suppose so shes been the same granny for as long as i have known about her and granny might be very useful in this situation while you are contacting the godmother about this mess youve gotten me into you might as well contact granny as well she continued thinking that she might as well order him about while he was feeling guilty enough to listen to and go along with her who knew when he would recover and shed be the one being ordered about it is my right both as a victim of an injury at your teeth and as a woman to have a second opinion at any time she actually allowed a mere hint of a smile to pass across her lips i he said looking up uncertainly are you or are you not a wizard she demanded send something one of these invisible servants of yours a talking bird a note you turn into a butterfly if its very difficult well what else have you got to spend your time on whatever you were doing before this one way or another your primary responsibility now is to make reparations to me she had to wonder how this particular werewolf managed to bite anyone you are the one responsible for my being in this predicament instead of just sitting there and waiting to see if anything happens you should be finding things out because i have no intention of staying here a moment longer than i have to she absolutely refused to consider that she might have to stay there forever however nebulous her plans for the future had been they had not included living in isolation away from her father and music dancing plays and all the things that made life rich those plans definitely had not included turning into a hairy monster three nights out of the month while you are contacting the godmother i would like to see my quarters she continued pushing away from the table and standing up since youve warned me about these invisible servants of yours i suppose one of them can show me the way he was staring at her with a most peculiar expression on his face what she demanded i was really expecting a lot more crying and screaming he said finally would crying and screaming have made any difference she retorted of course not so why waste time on them his expression turned to bemused approval youre very different he ventured that made her pause for a moment she thought about it and compared herself to the silly little girls of the minor nobility that she had met via the twins of course that was hardly fair a relatively serious person was not likely to inhabit the same sorts of social circles that the twins did but if most of the young women that sebastian had met were like those frivolous little fluffheads well she must be surprising him every time she opened her mouth i imagine i am she said dryly and left it at that he clapped his hands once and it was her turn to stare as one of the branched candlesticks on the table lifted up and floated toward her just follow the candles he said a faint look of satisfaction on his face at her surprise i hope you like your rooms when i received word of your coming i did my best to arrange things so that you would be comfortable he paused nevertheless now that i have met you i know that all that i am and all that i have could not match what you are worth well there really was no way to respond to that entirely gallant statement without seeming skeptical ungrateful or just unpleasant so she just nodded what she hoped was a properly shaped acknowledgment and followed the floating candles the entire manor seemed to have been constructed around the model of murdercorridors connecting lovely rooms it did make her a little curious since redbuck was so far away from anything what had it been built to defend against or had the original duke simply been ultracautious she got brief glimpses of a small ballroom what might have been an audience chamber a parlor and an enormous library where the spines of most of the books seemed to be made of tin she was resolved to come back to before the floating candles led her to a corridor that had a dead end with three doors one on the left hand one at the dead end and one on the right the door to the left swung open and the candles proceeded inside she followed the candles paused for a moment then set down on a table beside the door a moment later heavy curtains she had not seen in the gloom whisked aside and sunlight streamed into a very satisfactory parlor charming and wellappointed even by genevieves exacting standards she didnt have any time to admire it however for a rose and how had he managed a rose in the middle of winter levitated out of a vase near the window and with a little wave that seemed to signal that she should follow it floated over to a door to the left and opened it she limped in through this door to another darkened room the darkness was quickly remedied as more curtains parted revealing quite the most wonderful bedroom she had ever seen she was getting used to the fact that there were tapestries on virtually every wall here and when she thought about it the fact made sense these were stone walls and would otherwise be very cold especially in winter but whoever had chosen the tapestries for this room had created an especially welcome environment for they all showed a flowering wood the sort of woodlands she wanted to run into and lose herself once again what must have been a stone floor had been overlaid with wood except at the hearth and as if that was not enough there were carpets at the side of the bed so the occupant would never find herself stepping barefoot onto a cold floor there was not a great deal of furniture in this room instead of wardrobes and chests to hold her clothing as she had at home there was a closet where through the open door she could see familiar clothing already hung up there was a dressing table and mirror and chair and the bed but such a bed you could bed down an entire family in that bed and they wouldnt crowd each other she thought marveling a massive canopy was supported by four fat carved pillars covered with vines and flowers the headboard was not just a headboard it supported two lamps on brackets suspended at exactly the right height for reading in bed there was a builtin bookcase proving that the carpenter had put them there for that purpose bed curtains of embroidered velvet had been pulled back to show the matching counterpane and when she stepped forward and tentatively patted it she could tell that the counterpane covered a down comforter and a feather bed of unmatched height and softness she was tempted to lie down on it right that moment but the rose was moving onward and she followed it into the final room a bathroom she had heard of bathrooms but she had never seen one most households could not afford to dedicate a room just for bathing all her life she had taken her baths in a tin tub brought in set before the fireplace and filled with hot water this room had a tub three or four times that size like an enormous porcelain basin on clawed lion feet with stacks of soft towels and bottles full of jewelcolored liquids and powders on shelves around it one look at it made her long for a leisurely hot soak later she went back into the bedroom and to the middle of the three long narrow windows and looked out instead of overlooking the woods she found herself looking down into a snowcovered courtyard garden surrounded on all four sides by manor walls here for the first time she saw signs of neglect the rosebushes and trees had not been trimmed back in some time obviously sebastian cared nothing for the garden so his servants had done nothing with it more importantly for her purposes there would be no escaping this way still as captivity went this was going to be very comfortable she turned away from the window and to the closet now she discovered why there had been more trunks than she could account for there was her clothing all right and a lot of unfamiliar clothing of the sort that would make the twins squeal with glee somehow she doubted that this was sebastians idea more than likely it was the kings trying to distract me with dresses hmm she was torn between amusement and irritation she decided to let amusement win i suppose that just goes to show that kings are only men well just wait until he gets the list of my real demands she was not going to go into exile quietly now she turned her attention to the floating rose i assume you are waiting for my orders she said the rose bobbed up and down very well then she said and thought for a moment do you have something like arms again the rose bobbed up and down then my first order is that every one of you that comes into these rooms is to wear something like an armband so that i know you are here and where you are of course any of these magical servants that wanted to gawk at her could just disobey and not do anything of the sort but sebastian had said they were not terribly bright so perhaps that would not occur to them the rose hung in the air for a moment then it floated toward the closet a moment later it emerged but there was a scarf neatly wrapped about something invisible and knotted off it was a bit unnerving but no worse than a floating flower good she said nodding now can one of you tend to my ankle the rose bobbed and the scarf and rose floated off into the next room only the scarf returned and it paused expectantly she went over to the chair and sat down sticking out her aching foot the laces on her boot were undone swiftly and surely she watched in utter fascination it did not look as if they were undoing themselves there was something tugging on them and the cord acted as a cord should without any floating business so two hands were involved even if she couldnt see them the same hands grasped the boot and pulled it off making her hiss a little in pain there was no hesitation on the part of her attendant however the boot needed to come off and she had not told the invisible servant to stop therefore the boot would come off off came the stocking and then the bandages that doctor jonaton had so carefully applied last night got deftly unwrapped the armband floated into the bathroom and returned with the armband was a pile of things on a towel including a steaming basin she sighed as her ankle was bathed in hot water given a new application of a soothing salve that smelled like roses and rebandaged it felt much better the invisible hands unlaced and pulled off her other boot as well though they left the stocking she considered her options at the moment there were not many and she was horribly horribly tired it had been a long and stressfilled morning i think i would like to take a little rest she told the armband which floated obediently over to the bed the coverlet comforter blankets and sheet were turned back and the armband waited she yawned and sat on the edge of the bed which was just as soft as it looked ill just lie down for a little she told the armband wake me if something important happens then she settled into the soft feather bed put her head on the downy pillow and knew nothing until she felt a hand on her shoulder shaking her awake the curtains had been pulled closed while she slept now the unseen servant whisked them aside she saw to her relief that it was still daylight good shed be able to get an account of whatever progress had been made from sebastian before he turned into a brute beast again she threw back the covers and gingerly set her feet down on the rug or started to before she could move very far the armband intercepted her and the invisible hands grasped her good foot sliding it into a warmed sheepskin slipper the hands did the same to her injured foot then let her go it was a very very strange sensation to say the least she discovered as soon as she put weight on it that the injured foot was uncomfortable to walk on but much improved encouraged she began exploring even if she was limping shed never let an injury stop her from doing something she wanted to do before there wasnt a great deal to look at in either the bedroom or the bathroom while she liked the clothing well enough to her relief it proved to be not asfluffyas the twins would have liked it wasnt the sort of thing that she would ordinarily picture herself wearing too expensive for one thing and not in practical colors for another although since while she was here she supposed that she wouldnt be in and out of places where she would get dirty but if she had any say in this she wasnt going to be around long enough to need any of it the bathroom was still amazing in itself and she was looking forward to having a long and leisurely hot soak tonight but once she finished sniffing all of the bottles and jars to discover what scents were in them she was done with that room for now although this was the room that also contained the water closet so that was a relief to find and i am going to sweep everything before me and lock the door before i use it too but the sitting room now that was another story altogether she had barely glimpsed it on the way through to the bedroom earlier now the armband circled the room and oil lamps lit up with a soft glow in its wake as it turned up the flames the bedroom was a place for sleeping or at least lying abed this was a room made for doing things in it had a good desk and comfortable writing chair a pair of exceptionally comfortable chairs on either side of the fireplace that would be perfect for reading as each one had a lamp placed on a table beside it the external wall was literally covered in bookcases with more of those tinbound books in them someone had thoughtfully supplied a sewing workbasket beside a chair at one of the windows there was another pair of chairs at a second window with a chessboard between them and an intricately carved set of ivory chess pieces on it although the carpet in this room was a little worn it was also huge it covered most of the floor making the room that much warmer the expertly built fire in the fireplace kept the entire room comfortable with no drafts well this is pleasant enough she said aloud howeveri would much rather be at home so take me to your master i wish to discover what he has or has not accomplished so far the armband hesitated she glared at it now it could not be possible for a band of cloth to signify chagrin but somehow she got that impression from it it moved toward the door and she followed closely the unseen servant led her as far as the library and then their path diverged this was a much less welcoming part of the manor she passed many closed doors plain and heavily built before they descended a stair into a chilly cellar more closed doors though one was ajar giving her a glimpse into a wine cellar until finally the servant brought her to a very forbidding part of the establishment indeed and there she found her host minutely examining a door that was at least half a foot thick reinforced with iron straps with a formidable lock what on earth are you doing duke sebastian she asked more than a little irritated that he was down here mucking about with a lock when he should have been doing something about her predicament he jumped and yelped she was immediately sorry oh i do apologize i had no idea that you didnt know i was here she said i had come looking for you to determine if you knew anything more than you did when we last spoke he pinched the bridge of his nose between two fingers well i know that whatever happened to me last night i didnt break out of this cell all i can think is that somehow the door failed to lock i dont know perhaps it jammed ill make certain it is secure tonight i have contacted godmother elena or rather i have sent her a message so if she doesnt already know by her own methods about what has happened to you she will soon know from me i have also arranged for granny to come here he smiled wanly that was fairly simple i just rode out to the cottage and asked her to come bella had to throttle down her indignation what he could come and go as he pleased but she was a virtual prisoner here but good sense completed the throttling he had no reason to trust that she wouldnt run off after all hadnt she actually been contemplating just that so of course she was a virtual prisoner at least for now wait hadnt he just said he had ridden out i thought horses couldnt abide werewolves she replied watching as he carefully oiled the lock mechanism mine are fine with me as long as im not hairy he replied absently i really dont know if that has something to do with me or is another sign that im not the usual sort of werewolf i would have asked you to come along but you were asleep and i didnt know if you could ride she bit her lip notvery well she admitted i mean i can ride a hired horse that has to be goaded into anything faster than a walk but ah he contemplated her for a long moment i dont think i actually have anything you would feel safe in riding all my horses arewellspirited and large hunters actually they erm like to jump she swallowed the one time she had been on a horse that had jumped over anything she had nearly felt her heart stop she considered herself to be brave but to be nearly the height of a man above the ground on something that was moving that then attempted to fly through the air well it had been unexpected and rather unwelcome perhapsnot she said if you end up remaining here for a while i can see about getting a mule he offered i hope i wont but that might be an option a mule now that would be better she liked mules although genevieve would have been horrified at the idea of riding something so plebeian mules were quiet and sensible and although you couldnt get one to move very quickly they were also a great deal more comfortable to ride than horses well granny said she will come in the next few days he smiled at least she will be company for you who knows she might have some good ideas he looked as if he might say more but she saw his sleeve moving vigorously as if something was tugging on it and i beg your pardon but sunset is drawing near and i would really rather be certain that i was locked up securely follow your servant that was a good idea with the armbands by the way your servant will either take you to the dining room or your own rooms and bring you dinner there if you like involuntarily the memory of that horrible beast trying to dig her out of her flimsy shelter last night swept across her and she shivered charming as duke sebastian might be she had no desire to encounter the wolf again ever she had the feeling she wouldnt be so lucky a second time good evening then she said and turned to follow the floating scarf out into the cellars just as she reached the staircase she heard the cell door slamming firmly followed by a heavy rattling as duke sebastian tested it she hesitated at the top of the stairs the dining room was impressive butit would be odd and lonely to sit by herself at that enormous table i would like dinner brought to my rooms please she told the invisible servant which turned back toward the direction from which they had come she had a very good memory for direction evidently where such a thing had come from she had no idea but she found she didnt really have to follow the floating armband she was picking out her way without its help but when they got to her rooms and she was resolved to try the other doors on that corridor just to see what was in those rooms she was quite glad that she had left duke sebastian when she had it must have been much much later than she had thought because the light coming in through the windows had a distinctly goldenorange tint i must have slept far longer than i thought sunset cannot be far she went to the window to look but the high walls around the courtyard prevented her from seeing anything other than the sky to her left it was a very deep blue and to her right getting redder by the moment the courtyard was so deeply in shadow that all she could see were the mounded hummocks of snowcovered bushes she turned toward the armband i would like to go to the kitchen please the armband went absolutely still as if with shock she tapped her good foot impatiently i am accustomed to running a household she told it i write the menus how can i know what to order for dinner unless i see what is in the pantries and i can only pray that my orders are holding at home or there will be war in the kitchen and nothing will be edible there had to be a way to get word from home and to home her poor father must be frantic genevieve of course wouldnt notice unless things started going wrong but the twins would certainly miss her if only because they would be missing out on more of the guild festivals surely she could appeal to the better sensibilities of the staff at this point to pull together and she stopped right there of course she could the servants were probably just as upset about this as anyone she had always treated them decently and as if they were human beings and not automata without feelings and lives she needed to get word back to them not to chide them but to reassure them heaven only knows what wild rumors and crazed stories they are hearing now it stood to reason that if the king had gone to all this trouble to keep the truth of duke sebastians condition secret he would not be breaking that secret by allowing her family and household the truth genevieve would have it spread all over the city before you could say gossip she realized that she had been standing there lost in thought while the armband waited do you have a name she asked it i cannot keep thinking of it as an armband or an invisible servant she thought especially since there are more of them the armband did not bob i assume that means that you dont she said to it then is it all right if i give you one it wont be terribly original i am afraid i would like you to all wear different colored scarves or ribbons on your arms and i will call you after the colors of those the armband bobbed enthusiastically very well then you are verte she told it the scarf was a very verdant green indeed with luck any other green servant would bear a different enough color that she could use verdigris emerald lime and so forth so verte would you please take me to the kitchen the scarf verte bobbed slowly she sensed reluctance oh well that didnt change the fact that she couldnt order menus without knowing what was on hand the waste that had prevailed at breakfast was not the sort of thing she wanted to see continue pleasant though it had been she took the precaution of taking a candle with her it was going to be dark soon she resolutely turned her mind away from what moonrise would bring she really didnt much want to think about it the trip followed the same path that verte had followed to get to the cellar which only made sense but turned off before they got to the staircase whoever had built this place must have decided that the kitchen area could easily be a point of penetration for they proceeded down yet another murdercorridor she wondered if these servants ever thought about that or if they knew what the corridors were at some point she was going to have to find a better way to communicate with them this was very onesided and she was beginning to doubt the dukes assertion that they were not very bright well it seemed that the servants might be invisible but they still needed light verte sped ahead to open the door at the end of the corridor and a flood of light and the scent of baking bread spilled out of it she walked into a kitchen that was just as commodious and wellordered as the rest of the manor had been it was also uncannily quiet it looked unnervingly as if the kitchen had been abandoned in midpreparations that was just an illusion of course a spoon poised in midair over a bowl proved that the servants were still here she cleared her throat first i would like to tell you that i very much enjoyed breakfast she said into the silence you are all very very good however oh dear i hate to call this a problem but still it is there was far more food prepared than either of us could eat i am told that the only other person here is the gamekeeper and i rather doubt he could have devoured the remainder by himself not unless he is actually a fire elemental in disguise the spoon slowly lowered into the bowl otherwise there was no other sign from the servants verte are you and your fellows eating what remains when a meal is done she asked the servant still at her side the armband waved from side to side so you are disposing of it bobbing to the poor of the city waving merely throwing it on the midden bobbing she tried not to show how appalled she was she took on a firmer tone of voice that sort of waste must stop dont worry i am going to help you i shall do what i have done at home i shall write out menus for you and you will follow them do not concern yourself with the duke he is a man and in my experience since ive fed my fathers workers when hes given them a dinner as a thankyou and when i have ordered dinners for my fathers guests as long as the food is as good as i know you can make it and there is enough of it he really will not care what it is nowcould the lot of you please put on some sort of armband as verte has and stick a sprig of herb into it so i can tell you apart there was a generalflurry and scuttle was the best way she could describe it when everything settled out it appeared that there were a dozen servants here rosemary basil thyme mint parsley sage bay mustard lavender fennel lovage and rue which of you is the chief cook she asked thyme stepped forward well drifted i should like you to come to my room every morning for the menus she told it it bobbed and now i should like to see your stores she emerged from the storerooms the pantries and cupboards with her head reeling there was enough food here to supply an army under siege for a month she supposed there was some sort of magic preserving it otherwise she could not imagine how it all kept from rotting away why would they keep so much on hand was it that they were still holding stores for the horde of human servants such a manor would require or was it only that they were so isolated i suppose that they dont often get supplies she mused a little dazed so they have to keep things stocked up still it appeared that virtually anything she wanted to order for menus she could what are you making now she asked thyme who displayed the lovely little dinner loaves she had smelled being taken out of the oven and a finished meat pie of some sort i shall have a hot loaf butter a piece of that pie so big asparagus a watercress sallat and cheese and fruit for dessert she told it i shall have wine with the meal and a cordial with dessert i assume that when the dukeis himself again he is ravenous thyme bobbed very well then split the remainder of the pie between him and the gamekeeper squash with butter the bread mashed turnips a cheese course with the bread a soup to start and cakes to finish plenty of wine or ale whatever they usually drink sebastian would probably not notice she hadnt seen him drinking very much but eric was the sort of man who would think himself illdoneby if he didnt have his drink the very last thing she wanted to do was make him think she was being heavyhanded with him on that score i should like you to always keep a soup of some sort ready two if possible a thin brothbased soup and a thicker soup pea or a soup with thick gravy if either of them seems to be discontented with the amount of food served add a second soup course and if that does not serve fry some fish and add a nice sauce thyme bobbed with enthusiasm and there were little stirrings about the kitchen as if her reforms were being greeted with pleasure rather than unhappiness she tilted her head to the side you are all discontented because so much food returns from the dining room uneaten yes now the entire room was full of bobbing armbands so much for them being not very bright that is simply because you were giving them more than they could ever possibly eat we will change that platters will return mostly empty and you will know that you have done a very good job she smiled around the kitchen now if either the duke or the gamekeeper expresses a demand for something other than what i have ordered on the menu make it for him it will probably be beef or venison a steak will be easy and fast to cook always obey the men about food even if it contradicts my menu there was no point in making life difficult for the servants and there was so much food here that such simple additions would not make much difference again the armbands bobbed this was the most satisfying thing that had happened to her all day i am going to have a hot bath and i would like my dinner waiting when i am done thank you all very much she turned toward the door which verte took as the signal that they were to go back to her rooms but before she had quite reached the door there was a tugging at her skirt and she turned to find an enormous bunch of lavender being held out for her when she took it she saw that it was thyme that had presented it well it seems i have struck a chord she held it to her nose and inhaled smiling thank you she repeated this is lovely and one of my favorite flowers where on earth are they getting fresh lavender at this season she wondered as she made her way back to her rooms ah well the same place the rose and the other flowers came from i suppose if this was sebastians doing he was a much more powerful magician than he claimed to be and if it was the godmothers doing it argued a level of interest in sebastian and his welfare that was unusual to say the least the bath was heavenly her dinner was waiting perfectly hot and ready when she came out clothed in a flannel nightdress and a warm dressing gown verte bandaged her foot again when she had finished eating and she made a random selection of the books to take with her to bed that was when it all hit her as she settled into the comfortable soft bed with books she had selected why had she proceeded to take over the ordering of the household as if she was in charge of it as something more to distract her from a situation that was as horrible as a velvetlined prison in which she was to await her sentence because that was long and short of it what this was the bed might have been warmed but there was a hard cold lump inside her a frozen ball of fear that nothing was going to thaw and she could try to distract herself all she liked with taking over and ordering this household as she did her own with trying to make sense and allies out of the strange creatures that passed for servants but that did not change the fact that in a months time she might well find herself locked in a cell beside duke sebastian as if to drive that thought home a long heartbroken howl throbbed through the corridors of redbuck manor isabella beauchamps burst into uncontrollable tears in the end she stopped crying not because she had run out of fear and grief not because she was too tired and weptout to continue but because there was an insistent tugging at the coverlet she huddled beneath she turned over and started to dry her eyes on her sleeve when a lavenderscented handkerchief was thrust into her hand she took it too tired to be angry that one of the invisibles had violated her privacy and seen her crying verte she croaked the floating fabric was a ribbon not a scarf and blue not green oh you will be sapphire then she said and blinked her sore eyes in surprise when a childs slate and a bit of chalk floated into view we r veri sori the chalk scratched onto the slate its not your fault she sniffed dabbing at her eyes and blowing her nose if anything its my own stupid fault i was the one who tried to go home through the woods after dark the previous words were erased erk shud have warned u well yes he should instead of trying to bully me into indecencies she said a rekindling of her anger burning away a little of the grief especially since it was the full moon erk sposed to guard wuds at ful moon as you can see he didnt do a very good job of it she sighed and her throat closed again i dont belong here i dont want to be here i want to go home the last came out in a little wail an invisible hand patted her knee through the coverlet we like u not b sad godmuther fix privately she could not imagine how if the godmother had not been able to fix sebastians werewolfery after all these years how could she expect the godmother to help her but instead of saying so and descending into inconsolable crying again she made an effort to put a good face on things no amount of crying was going to change what had already happened all she could do was fight to fix it or find ways to cope if the worst came i hope so she replied godmuther fix evrthing if only that were true she felt her eyes starting to burn again no matter how hard she tried to make herself brave and practical it didnt stop the fear or the loneliness there was no one to help her face this i like you all too sapphire she said instead you wont be wuf the words were written with such force that the chalk squeaked and shed powder she stared that wasvehement so emphatic that it came as something of a shock i hope youre right she said tentatively we wont let you be wuf the chalk actually broke in half she felt not frozen but suddenly stilled there was something going on here something that she couldnt quite grasp the invisibles must know something something important about this situation something that sebastian clearly did not know how do you know that she whispered there was a very very long pause then finally the words were erased and a few shaky letters appeared cant tell now her mind unstuck as it had in the carriage when she had realized what must have happened to her the invisibles did know something and were being prevented from revealing it the shakiness of the letters told her that as if the hand that wrote them was fighting against a terrible compulsion merely to say that the writer could not say what was going on but you can protect me help me again frantic erasing and forceful strokes yes it was as if a terrible weight had been partly taken from her she was not facing this entirely alone for some reasonheaven only knew whythese creatures were befriending her even if she couldnt see them they wanted to help her and this one was assuring her that godmother elena even more powerful than the king was going to help her too she sighed then i trust you sapphire all of you thank you dont cry she managed a very shaky smile ill try not to but i am homesick and i miss my father terribly godmuther fix another comforting pat of her knee through the coverlet and the slate and chalk and blue ribbon floated away leaving her alone with far more questions than answers and far more puzzles than her mind would hold right now well there was no point in trying to sleep now she opened one of the books at random and began to read it at first she found herself reading and rereading the same page but eventually she got the sense of it it wasnt the sort of thing she usually read she liked history not stories but this seemed to be a more serious version of the silly romantic novels that the twins occasionally picked up and she found herself following the story with some interest it began as these things tended to do with a little orphaned girl begging in the streets but rather than touching the heart of a crusty old miser or being taken in by a poor but kindhearted couple with no children of their own this little girl was taken up by a gang of young thieves finally she closed her eyes for just a little because they were still sore and tired from crying and when she opened them again it was morning she woke to a wonderful aroma of flatcakes and honey when she opened her eyes she found that the bed curtains and window curtains had been pulled back letting light stream in and a tray was evidently floating in midair beside her bed accompanied by the green scarf good morning verte she said rubbing her eyes then sitting up i didnt mean to sleep this long the tray ended up on her lap without a mishap the slate and chalk levitated up from the floor not late the chalk wrote she smirked she felt so much better this morning it was amazing and maybe it was false hope but while she had it she was going to enjoy it not late by the standards of a duke perhaps late for those of us who intend to get work done then she sobered he didnt escape last night did he she thought she remembered howling dimly in her dreams she couldnt tell where it had been coming from though the howling she had heard before she slept had certainly come from inside the manor was it even possible that the wolf had learned to manipulate the door mechanism that was a startling and unsettling thought no sleeps it must have been a real accident then his escaping sebastian had certainly been terribly careful about the door last night before she had left him now she was curious how did it work it was probably not very pleasant in her minds eye she imagined the wolf clawing at the door pacing all night long wearing itself out against its prison poor sebastianno wonder he was asleep she shouldnt have been so quick to judge i suppose turning into a wolf and then raging to get out all night does take it out of one she said aloud and turned her attention to her breakfast before it got cold when she had finished and verte had taken the tray away and bandaged her ankle she shooed the servant away so she could dress herself it was very nice really very nice to have servants bringing breakfast in bed and fixing hot baths and all but she was going to draw the line at being dressed like a giant doll when she limped into the sitting room verte sapphire and thyme were all waiting there green scarf blue ribbon and strip of white cloth with a sprig of thyme tucked in the knot she noticed then that thymes armband was a little higher than vertes and vertes was a little higher than sapphires if they were all knotted in about the same place that meant that sapphire was shorter than she was and thyme was about the height of the duke interesting were there gender differences as well as height or were these creatures androgynous they didnt eat or at least they didnt eat the same thing that the humans here did did they sleep sebastian had said that they were a sort of spirit and spirits didnt sleep were they even all the same kind of spirit would they mind if she asked them personal questions like that or would they get angry if they got angry what would they do they could just take off the armbands and she would never know if they were there or not they could retaliate at any time in any way they chose i cant believe that a creature that was as kind as sapphire was last night would be that angry if i asked it a few things but they were magic and magic creatures were known to do things that you wouldnt expect this is getting more complicated with every moment but sebastian had summoned them and he seemed to be a careful sort of magician he would have made sure they were restricted from harming anyone just go slowly and carefully good morning thyme sapphire she said and sat down at the desk pulling out paper and readying a pen just a moment and i will have the menus for you as she did so she thought about the supplies she had seen last night had been the pie pigeon pie as it turned out and very tasty so today for dinner she should placate the men with a nice big chunk of venison or beef venison she decided and wrote out the rest of the courses and as for supper she had definitely seen duck cleaned and waiting is the duke likely to be on two feet after sundown she asked looking up the slate was in vertes hands no verte wrote then make sure he gets supper before he changes she said she thought about asking when eric ate and decided that she didnt care in fact she didnt care if she never saw him for the entire time she was here i will have one quarter of the duck thigh and leg and the men can split the rest she told the servants and handed the menus to thyme i assume that the duke will want me to have dinner with him yes verte wrote and is there any reason why i cant explore the manor she continued no verte was a being of few words it seemed thank you very much then you may go to whatever your duties are somewhere was a place where the duke was getting fresh flowers and fresh vegetables the only vegetables you could find at this time of year in the markets were dried or things that kept sound in a cool cellar beets and turnips squashes and carrots onions and garlic if you could find a place where the water didnt freeze you might find cress you certainly didnt find asparagus it might be that he had a hothouse she had heard of such things the king had one but she had never seen one and she dearly wanted to thyme and verte drifted out the door sapphire stayed bella raised her eyebrow at the blue ribbon dont you have other duties she asked she couldnt imagine that the duke had conjured or summoned a servant or assigned one just to be available to her day and nightcould he sapphire had got her hands on the slate again serv u she wrote evidently he had and that was incredibly thoughtful so his words last night were not just aristocratic fluff he had meant them and with that she had a much better idea of what to do with her time than wander around the manor although she still wanted to see that hothouse if one existed i hope hes not creating vegetables out of thin air im not sure i am very comfortable with eating magic food what if it does something once its eaten she went back to one of the fireside chairs and sat down in that case you can serve me by telling me some more of what you know she said at least tell me things that you can tell me i would like to start with the duke himself yes and no questions were easiest but didnt give her much detail more detailed questions required a lot of time for sapphire to scratch out the answers while this examination had seemed like a good idea when shed had it it soon proved to be frustrating all too often the answer was dont no she did manage to get a rough idea of how the household functioned but that was the limit of it and it wasnt very enlightening the duke studied attempted to break the werewolf change performed other magic sapphire really had no idea what it was he did with his magic except when it involved her or the other servants eric was generally seen only at supper and sometimes not then he took a cart and horse to the city once every few weeks for supplies he had his own entrance to the manor a suite of rooms in a kind of gatehouse a suite that was larger than the dukes and free access to everything presumably his duties as gamekeeper kept him busy sapphire had no idea who kept the accounts how the monies from the mines were paid and who was responsible for them certainly sebastian seemed to have no head for such things and eric didnt seem the type to want to handle details of that sort perhaps they had a factor in the city after spending most of the morning attempting to get useful information from sapphire bellas head hurt it was time for a change something else to do which brought her back to her original plan is there a hothouse she asked finally a place where the flowers and vegetables are grown yes sapphire wrote take me to it please she ordered id like to have some notion of what is in there there was no evidence of confusion the blue ribbon obediently led the way out the door more corridors ordinary ones as well as murdercorridors more rooms most of them with the curtains closed and the hint of dust in the air then finally sapphire flung open the door on what seemed at first as if it was outdoors so bright was the light streaming inside yet there was no burst of freezing air in fact the air that puffed out toward bella was warm and moist as a spring day she stepped across the threshold and into summer at least it smelled like summer green and moist and warm it was really warm here and she had never seen so much glass in her life the walls the roof were all made of it the place was perhaps half the size of the great hall of the wool merchants guild and it must have cost a fortune to create all the glass panes bring them out here and put them together there were plants in raised beds everywhere with narrow walkways between them and in the middle trellises covered with vines that reached to the roof somewhere in the back of her mind she had been expecting something that looked like a garden well it did look like a garden a kitchen garden there were a few beds of flowers but most of the space was taken up with raised beds growing vegetables and herbs even the vines were peas and beans once she got over her initial disappointment however she began to appreciate it the beds of fresh herbs alone were a marvel and the vegetables like asparagus and lettuces the peas and beans in several stages of ripening trailing upward over trellises that one only saw in summer here with a background of snow outside the glass well it really did seem as much like magic as sapphire and it was so warm here as warm as a hot summer day how is it kept so warm she asked sapphire surely it wasnt just the sun hot spring said a laconic voice from behind them electrifying her with a jolt of panic she jumped and squeaked turning at the same time not sure whether she should look for a weapon or utter a greeting eric von teller lounged in the door frame arms crossed over his chest he was dressed in his gamekeeper leathers without the cloak now that she knew what to look for she could see a definite family resemblance he and sebastian had the same cheekbones the same brow the same nose their hair was very different though and their eyes sebastians were a gray erics were dark some color close to the slate of a storm cloud he raised one black eyebrow as she relaxed marginally dont bother asking anything complicated of the menials he continued with a little smirk its rather like trying to teach a cow to fly you get nowhere and annoy the cow theyre obedient they will do what you ask of them provided you phrase it the way you would phrase an order to a dog but they are of no help whatsoever when it comes to anything even a child would understand i see she replied in as neutral a tone of voice as she could manage and gestured behind her back hoping sapphire would understand that she should hide the slate and chalk well since you can talk and obviously know a bit about this place what do you mean by hot spring there is a spring of hot water underneath this place its why it was built here in the first place eric replied not moving at all from his spot in the door frame meaning that when she wanted to leave the hothouse she would have to somehow get by him originally when this was just a hunting lodge it was used for heat later when the place was rebuilt it was repurposed its not a very big one and once the manor expanded to its current size it couldnt be used to heat the place as it once had now it supplies the hot water for bathing and keeps this glasshouse warm he shrugged the glasshouse was a conceit of the late dukes father i think this is a waste of effort really but he liked to impress his guests with spring and summer vegetables in midwinter was that so important to him she asked curiously he grimaced a little the duchy is a farm a forest and a few mines the small size never troubled anyone up until that point but i suppose sebastians grandfather felt differently i will say that getting hot baths whenever you like is very welcome and since sebastians slaves are the ones doing all the work here its not as if it was costing us anything to keep it up it would be different if we needed to keep a staff of human servants to tend the plants he nodded at the ribbon around sapphires arm clever idea ill order mine to wear armbands so i know when theyre in my rooms i dont like the feeling there might be something looking over my shoulder all the time he seemed to be making an effort to be pleasant she regarded him with as neutral an expression as she could manage it is unnerving she agreed more so for a woman i think i dont believe that men have our natural modesty he raised an eyebrow looking skeptical but said nothing for a moment finally he shrugged im not going to apologize for our meeting in the woods he said abruptly its my job to be as unpleasant as possible especially around the full moon to keep people out of there after dark now you know why she frowned a little if that is your job you are doing it very well its been duke sebastians orders he pointed out i have to do so in such a way as to prevent people from getting too curious about why im running them off im the woodsman so people expect me to act as if everyone i meet is a potential poacher so thats what i do it saves on explanations bella tilted her head to the side that actually makes sense she agreed with great reluctance of course it does its the clever way to handle this situation he shifted his weight a little and the leather of his outfit creaked if i was solicitous and warned people nicely that there might be a savage monster out there ready to rip their limbs off theyd assume i was hiding something besides where the deer lay up and do their best to find out what it was so im a bastard about it too bad if i frighten people i want them frightened just because weve managed to keep sebastian locked up so far it never followed that we could always count on doing so he unfolded his arms and made a little gesture of impatience sebastian assumes the best i assume the worst that has been my job since he changed i dont want potential victims in our woods and ive done a damned good job of keeping them out of danger since youre the first accident weve had since sebastian started changing it was a very reasonable explanation and she might have believed him entirely if it hadnt been for that other little encounter shed had with him at the guild festival he was in disguise then and presumably thought he would not be recognized and he wasnt in the woods trying to frighten people out of them so while she would accept his explanation about chasing people out of the woods so far as the caddishness went i think not we got off to a bad start he continued and finally smiled like it or not for the next three months we are going to be in the same household and are bound to encounter one another id like to be able to exchange civil words with you and believe me it will be a lot more pleasant for both of us if we can truce he was right about that even if she had no intention of remaining here for that long truce she said still keeping her voice and expression neutral for now she added internally rather glad that she was not pledging a time period good enough he studied her a moment and she did not flinch from his stare sebastian says there is no place in the manor that you cant go so its just as well that my house is outside the manor ill ask you to stay out of it as i like my privacy and pledge you that ill stay out of your rooms unless you invite me there ill go further than that i wont set foot in the corridor that leads to the guest apartments where you are that should set your mind at ease about my intentions thats reasonable she replied even though her hand itched to slap him because there was an undertone in his voice when he had said unless you invite me there that suggested that he fully expected that she would he really did think his charms could not be resisted ill also warn you about wandering down to the dungeon on nights of the full moon he gave her an opaque look if you are curious about sebastian on those nights stifle it though i realize that asking a woman to stifle her curiosity is a little like asking a mule not to be stubborn he smirked and she quietly counted to ten because she was getting close to losing her temper with him again it seemed that was going to happen on a regular basis with this man it was as if he was going out of his way to say the most provoking things seriously now he continued i dont know how he got out two nights ago but you should have the image of when he savaged your foot branded in your mind you have seen the wolf you really do not need to see him any closer or clearer he nearly killed you think of that if youre tempted hes all right alone down there he just paces and growls and digs at the door but put prey in front of him i wouldnt make a bet on the door holding ive never gone down there once he changes and ive been in charge of him since it started so dont be foolish his expression said the opposite that he fully expected her to take this as a challenge or that telling her not to do something was a guarantee that she would do it he really did not have a high opinion of females at all i heard him howling last night she said instead of answering him directly it was fairly bloodcurdling its not the sort of sound that would tempt me into coming down for a visit he doesnt howl like that usually eric told her but this is the first time hes gotten out to hunt and that might have changed something must have been because he scented you here in the manor and you were the prey that escaped him buti didnt she thought startled i didnt escape he stopped attacking why did he stop she started to tell eric that and something made her pause instead she nodded is it just for the three nights of the full moon she asked him is that the only time he changes thats what its been before i dont know why things should be different now now at last he moved pushing himself away from the door frame and taking a step away from her tonight should be the last night for a month that youll need to worry about it if he howls and you cant get to sleep stuff wax in your ears i might see you at supper tomorrow night it depends on if i have anything i need to discuss with sebastian and with that he just walked away down the corridor into the manor without so much as a polite goodbye leaving her exasperated a little intrigued and to tell the truth a little afraid the other three suites of rooms in her corridor were a great deal like the one she already was in the only difference was that two of them looked out on the wall the gates and the front courtyard the one she had found herself in when she first arrived that at least oriented her and it looked as if no one had used these rooms in years of course there was a slight musty smell and a hint of damp exactly as you would expect from rooms that had been closed up unaired for all that time since she saw nothing to recommend them over the ones she was currently using she just shut the door on them again and went down to dinner she saw to her pleasure that her orders for the meal had been filled exactly sebastian was not there and neither was eric but a few moments after she sat down and the invisible servant filled her plate the duke arrived i hope you slept well he said as he sat down the door seems to have held last night the servant tended to him and he began eating hungrily without appearing to notice that there was not the superabundance of food that there had been at the past two meals they had shared all i can guess is that for some reason the latch didnt set i wish the servants could talk they might be able to tell me something but they can she thought then again they probably dont come down there when i change and i wouldnt blame them he sighed and reapplied himself to his food at any rate im still waiting for word from the godmother personally although i have been sent a message from her people that she does know about the situation and you are still to be held here for three months until we know for certain that you arent going to turn she opened her mouth in indignation then closed it again the godmother was the highest authority on magic in this and several other kingdoms there really was no reasonable objection that she could make ive also gotten word that she is going to send something along so you can at least keep an eye on your family he continued we should have it in a day or two that way youll know that your father is all right although the king has promised me to make sure that your family is watched over properly watched over properly and how is the king going to make sure that the household runs smoothly that genevieve doesnt turn to some quack who will actually harm her that father doesnt fret himself to pieces over me and what has my father been told she asked subdued a lump in her throat threatening to choke her the thought of him being afraid for her or worse grieving over her it was just too hard to bear i dont know he stopped eating and looked up at her he had that expression again the one that looked like a puppy that knows it has done something wrong but doesnt quite know what it could be that would have been the kings business and i dont know what he decided to do in cases like this i mean obviously he has to say something and it cant be oh i am very sorry but ive had to send your daughter off and shes never coming back because its even odds that you are coming back and he wouldnt want to have to explain how that happened and strangely enough the running stream of words broke the weight of despair that had begun to form sebastian was just trying so hard to reassure her yet tell her the truth at the same time and failing at both he stopped im babbling arent i he asked sheepishly yes you are she said dryly it comes of not having anyone to talk to i suppose eric isnt exactly a good conversationalist and theres no one else really now he looked down at his plate its rather nice actually having someone across the table from me i mean i know its horrible for you but its nice for me her tone became so dry it practically sucked all the moisture out of the air im glad to hear that im being useful he looked up quickly blushed and looked down again i really am bungling this she took pity on him he couldnt possibly be feeling as awful about all this as she was but on the other hand he was doing his best to make the horrible situation as comfortable as it could be oh i dont know i suppose if i were in your place id be babbling too the face he presented to her was full of such gratitude that she was touched you are being incredibly decent about this he said warmly i mean really truly decent better than i deserve i would have to agree with that statement but she was smiling as she said that on the other hand you actually are attempting to make things up to me i know very well that the king could have just ordered me thrown in one of his dungeons for three months or you could have sealed me up in one of the cells downstairs for a similar length of time i am going to have to do that for the three nights of the full moon next month he pointed out or the first one at least because you might turn and we cant have you loose but theres no reason to throw you into a cell now i mean you know whats at risk here and the very last thing someone like you is going to do would be to try to run off and put people in danger right numbly she nodded it was something that she had avoided thinking about but he was right she couldnt leave not until they knew for certain that she was safe shed heard enough stories the first thing that a werewolf would seek to kill was the person it loved best he crumpled his napkin look i dont know how to entertain young ladies very well is there anything anything at all that i can do to make things better for you i hadnt thought about it she replied feeling a little more mollified i dont know i think besides my family i am going to miss music a lot i dont have the usual sort of education i cant play or sing worth listening to but i love listening to it my stepsisters sing very well and i go to as many musical gatherings as i can and there are street musicians very good onesi miss that already oh i was going to point out that we have a music room but i suppose he looked thoughtful i dont see any reason why the servants couldnt play for you she blinked they can play i can arrange it so they can or rather i can summon ones that are musicians if the ones i have cant thats how it works you see i summon servants with the skills i need he brightened up considerably how many do you need one three a dozen a dozen musicians all at her beck and call she felt suddenly dazzled by the mere thought only the king had that many musicians in his regular retinue its not easy he continued but as you pointed out i really owe it to you ill do what i need to do in order to make you a little happier here first find out if any of the ones you have are musicians she told him hastily then well see but i he paused well i could assemble them in the music room and tell them all that if any of them can play they should go to an instrument and do so im not sure how else i could tell it might just be simpler to summon some dont you think oh bother not telling him i can communicate with them not telling him that they are intelligent makes no sense at all they can write you know she told him at least two of them can they can what he demanded looking at her as if she had grown a second head they can write you know you just arent asking the right questions when it comes to your servants not all of them are stupid and not all of them just obey blindly she shook her finger at him and here you are supposed to be the allpowerful wizard and you dont even know that about your own creatures she almost asked him if he had ever considered actually trying to talk to these servants of his but the answer was obvious he hadnt they arent supposed to be intelligent he was saying looking bewildered the books all say so every single one of the books says that they are completely stupid and that without exact orders they just stand there until you tell them exactly what to do she had to laugh at that and did well i suppose that this comes under that heading of out of the mouths of fools and babes i didnt know so i didnt assume anything i was talking to them and two of them found a way to talk back to me he laughed with her though it sounded rueful i hate to ask you this but would you find out what they can do obviously they arent as simple as i thought they were of course what else have i to do she replied how many are there only about a hundred and twenty he said a hundred and twenty that was that was a truly insane number why would he need so many she could only gape at him more or less im not exactly sure really you see when things needed doing and werent getting done i just rested up for a few days and summoned some more he pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger then pushed his glasses back up again with one finger it wasnt all at once i started doing it just after my father died because the servants kept leaving didnt like eric being in charge you see oh hold back my surprise that was uncharitable and she knew it but she couldnt help it he shrugged clearly unable to understand why he had been deserted and there was some hurt there she got the feeling he felt betrayed i suppose all they knew was that he had been a servant and now hed got above himself they couldnt imagine why a fellow servant suddenly got put in charge of everything i rather doubt that you cant hide anything from the servants even if no one outside the manor knew he was your kin it was certainly old news to them still what he said could have some truth to it it was entirely possible that the rest of the servants had resented eric all along elevating him to steward in fact if not in name could have just brought all that to a head unexpectedly she found herself pitying the man no wonder he had an attitudeif hed been hidden by the old duke rather than acknowledged and was snubbed by those who thought he was only a servant but resented by those who were below him well i cant say my temper would be sweet anyway id learned and mastered the spell to summon these creatures the godmother approved of my doing so and supervised me the first six months so i just started replacing the servants who left then the servants that remained got unsettled by the invisible ones and started leaving too he looked as if his head was paining him and she could certainly sympathize there i cant really blame them for being unsettled but i would have thought they would at least give it a trial its not that hard to get used to them and they cant hurt you well look at you youve not gotten all upset about being around them not even two days here and youre already talking with them she choked down what she was thinking that he had to be particularly dense when it came to human nature to think that she was going to have a typical reaction to being surrounded by floating objects borne by things unseen if such a thing had happened in her household the servants would have left without collecting their possessions and they were loyal to her anyway i just kept summoning until there seemed to be enough of them to get everything done so will you talk to them for me he repeated looking at her with big pleading eyes over the rim of his spectacles please she sighed how could she possibly say no besides what else have i to do all right she agreed within an hour she realized that she had taken on something far more timeconsuming than she had thought as she settled down with verte and sapphire to figure out what exactly she could do this is going to be a great deal more complicated than i thought possible in facti am beginning to wish eric was right just to begin with sebastian had underestimated the number of creatures he had summoned either that or they are breeding or bringing friends and relations there were well over two hundred just associated with the house and grounds she was ready to pull out every hair on her head in frustration how many exactly she asked verte aghast came the prompt reply a headache immediately started just behind her eyes how would she ever come up with names for all of them not to mention organizing but no she was making work for herself that she didnt need to wait they are already organized sebastian said he just conjured up one when things needed doing and since the household is running smoothly with minor problems like making too much food then they must have organized themselves that meant that there might only be a fraction that were more than sebastian thought them to be how many of them are as clever as you and sapphire and thyme verte she asked most very stupid the headache started to fade as she heard that number that was more manageable so most of you are just what sebastian thought very simple creatures that just do a single job like oh the animated broom in the tale of the sorcerers lazy apprentice verte was smart enough to realize that was a question framed as a statement yes or rather y for verte had also mastered abbreviations their own communication was getting easier with every passing hour so the smart ones supervise the stupid ones she asked that made sense presumably they could see each other and communicate too yes the headache faded to almost nothing this was looking more promising i would imagine that all of the kitchen staff are smart ones she said thinking out loud but was pleased with vertes confirmation of that and most of the household staff all of sebastians of course what about erics staff all stupid but one smart one hides aha you mean hides as in keeps eric from knowing it is smart she asked thinking that if she were a smart invisible that was what she would do if he knew that they were intelligent hed begin ordering them to do a lot more yes so you need one smart one to keep eric from interfering or complaining to sebastian she nodded how many of you can write five sapphire thyme verte two more probably just as well that was already a higher rate of literacy than among the beauchampses household of whom only housekeeper and cook were able to read and write with any fluency another reason why mathew wasnt going to become butler anytime soon which one of you is the steward she asked which was the next logical question in a household the size of her own generally the housekeeper was in charge unless there was a butler but in the enormous households of the nobility it was a loftier fellow the steward who is in charge of all of you she said rephrasing her question eric and in charge of taking money and bringing things back eric and eric was the only physical contact between sebastian and the outside world and now she began to think through the question she had raised with herself this morning who is managing all of this there had to be someone who was making sure the estate was properly cared for and at need the kings own chancellor of the exchequer would see to it if for no other reason than to make sure the kingdom got the taxes you didnt get taxes out of a poorly managed estate under normal cases where there had been a steward the steward would have dealt with the mines and the income from them unless there was a separate factotum in the city that handled the commerce and merely kept the ducal coffers filled small as they were but eric did not strike her as having that sort of education nor temperament so it made sense that there was someone perhaps appointed by the king that was in charge of those portions of the ducal estate that would be logical actually since income from the mines would be subject to a tax and this way the king could be sure he got all of it the only thing that the steward would need to tend to then would be the household and the home farm so eric was functionally the steward which after all had more or less been what he was ever since the old duke died she sucked on her lower lip for a bit no real point in changing that he couldnt hurt these invisible creatures the stupid ones wouldnt respond to bullying and the smart ones knew to avoid him is there a home farm she asked realizing she had not asked that before yes that explained where most of the food was from eric would oversee that too of course and are there more of you there no aha so probably no one on the home farm knows or cares that the duke is a werewolf probably just as well does eric spend much time there no if farming wasnt erics expertise and from everything she knew about him she was pretty sure that she knew more about farming than he did then the job was probably in the hands of the farmer who lived there hmm eric spends a great deal of time in the city at least in the evenings does eric spend his nights away from here she asked often well she couldnt blame him being out here so isolated would be very difficult on someone who wasnt as introspective as sebastian the city was so close that he could ride out and back again in the morning with no harm done except on the nights of the full moon he wasnt needed here it wasnt as if sebastian needed a minder the more she thought about it the more she began to feel some sympathy for eric it was bad enough to be a noble bastard the most you could hope for was the sort of gamekeeper position that hed gotten well unless you were in the household of someone who had his own private army or the like then you could manage to become something like a seneschal or warlord i suspect warlord would have suited eric a great deal better but then to have ended up with what was essentially the job of legal guardian and steward without actually having the title and full authority it would grate on me i dont know about eric but it would have turned me sour probably the one thing that had kept eric relatively civil was that sebastian was so likable not that she was going to approve of how eric had been bullying people and trying to take advantage of any girl that looked vulnerable but he had probably been brought up by some pretty rough people here maybe the dukes huntsmen or his head groom or a bodyguard if hed had one men like that were not generally known for their manners a child learns what he lives with she resolved to try to be a little nicer to the man and see what happened i can certainly use an ally with access to the city about then her supper arrived in the invisible hands of sapphire she looked at the ribbon when the tray was set down id like you to hunt through the nursery and schoolroom and find some more slates and chalk she said id like the five of you who can write to each have your own since sapphire didnt have the slate at the moment the ribbon merely bobbed in place before heading out the door all right then she said thinking aloud as she took her first bite i dont actually need to change anything in the way you are organized obviously good came the unprompted answer which made her smile so verte had some spirit and a mind of his her its own i really dont need to know anything about any of you except for the intelligent ones she took another bite and tried not to be distracted really thyme could do simply amazing things with food so aside from the kitchen staff you and sapphire and the one in charge of erics quarters what do the rest of the smart ones do stable chickens rabbits pigeons gardens sebastian and the rest fix things aha that made sense they wouldnt be doing the same job all the time things that needed mending could be anything from roof slates to a pipe what sebastian asked me to find out was whether any of you can play musical instruments she told verte finally but when you told me how many of you there were i got rather distracted so let me try the direct approach how many of you are musicians she really expected an answer like sapphires frequent dont no but to her delight she got an answer nine seven good three very good well that was more than enough and with that slight problem solved she could tackle the larger one when can i talk to the rest of you there was a fundamental problem here why was sebastian even a werewolf in the first place she didnt want to approach eric about this so that left only one other source of information sebastians servants one way or another she was going to get some answers sebastian howled all night the moment that the moon came up she knew that it was above the horizon even though she couldnt see it for the first howl echoed through the halls she nearly jumped out of her skin at the sound and it woke a deep and primitive fear in her it was all she could do not to run to the door and not only make sure it was locked but to pile furniture in front of it she shook so with fear that her teeth rattled and it was nearly an hour before she could calm herself down and it kept going on and on not like the previous night where he had only howled once or twice was this how he usually was now she knew why eric preferred the gatehouse it was horrible actually not because he sounded as if he was ravening to get at her but because once she calmed down a little he sounded as if his heart was breaking if a wolf could be said to have such a thing as a broken heart it was so mournful that she found herself sinking into despair again sapphires assertions to the contrary she couldnt think how the invisible servant could possibly be so sure that she wasnt going to be changed and join sebastian in this prison forever so as the sobbing howls echoed up from below she found herself crying with fear and loneliness and this time actually wept herself into exhaustion and from there into sleep the poor invisible tried to comfort her but bella was beyond comfort it wasnt that sebastian was bad company it was that she simply could not bear the thought of spending the rest of her life out here never seeing anyone but him eric and perhaps granny living a life of fear fear that one day she might break loose and kill some innocent person perhaps someone she loved fear that someone besides the godmother and the king would find out about the little colony of werewolves and decide to take matters into his own hands she could see that happening all too easily after all it was possible to overlook sebastian he was protected by the king he was of noble blood he had not harmed anyone until he bit her and he was carefully watched and guarded but she was not protected by the king she was not protected by noble birth and although she was incarcerated in the same manor and under the same circumstances well eventually someone would find out it could not be kept secret forever a male werewolf and a female werewolf together that all but shouted that there would likely be a family of the creatures before too long no matter what their intentions were when human when they changed all that would change too and what sane person would want a breeding pair of monsters living within hunting distance of where he lived they would both be hunted down and killed she knew it she dropped from weeping into nightmare predictably an endless series of nightmares in which she was being pursued by a hunting party led by eric crying out for her blood nightmares in which she knew she had killed someone she just didnt know who and nightmares in which she awoke out of a red haze of madness to find her fathers dead eyes staring up at her his throat torn out that was the worst of them those were the ones from which she woke up weeping until she could scarcely breathe when the morning finally came she felt exhausted limp and disinterested in anything even food although she wrote out the menus for thyme the breakfast she forced herself to eat tasted like straw and with an aching head eventually she went back to bed simply unable to face the day sapphire brought her snow packs to cool the ache in her head and soothe her sore eyes and put hot bricks into the bed to keep the rest of her comfortable she finally drifted into a dreamless sleep for a little sapphire woke her again at noon and although she was still filled with melancholy the invisible managed to coax her out of bed into clothing and down to dinner it was a dress she would not have chosen for herself a silvery lavender loaded with lace it was entirely impractical for working in it actually did take sapphire to get her into it for it had several petticoats a whispersoft undergown embroidered with little lavender sprigs and the lavender overgown that was gathered in complicated fashion to show the undergown this was the sort of thing that the twins would have killed to own and she normally could not be bothered about but sapphire picked it for her and laid it out and she couldnt manage the effort to go to the closet and find something else sebastian was already there at the table although he had not yet begun eating so to her surprise was eric they both looked up as she entered and sebastian frowned you look terrible he said bluntly are you all right she wanted to snap at him to point out that she was still a prisoner still didnt know if she was going to turn into a raging beast and on top of that he had howled the entire night keeping her up giving her endless nightmares and making her cry but she didnt partly because she was too tired partly because it really would not do any good he couldnt control what he did as the wolf and pointing out what he had done would only make him feel needlessly bad one person at this table was already in such despair she wasnt fit company she didnt need to make it two you need to get outside the duke continued when she didnt respond i always feel better when i can get outside for a while im sure you have clothing fit for being in the snow and a good walk in the garden will perk you right up he didnt look particularly well this morning either the wolf clearly hadnt slept at all and the man was the worse for it i just didnt sleep well is all she replied and she knew that she sounded sullen even when she was saying the words neither of the men commented on her tone which was just as well they just waited for the invisible attendant to serve them it wore a yellow armband which meant according to her division of labor that it was a household spirit rather than a kitchen spirit colors for household staff herbs for kitchen the leaves of trees for stable and other tenders of animals food plants for gardeners not that the latter mattered at the moment since she wasnt likely to encounter either she just hoped that everything would be all right and she would never have to become familiar with them eric ate rapidly but not noisily and had better table manners than she had expected well now that the moons turned and i dont need to patrol the forest im off to get that riding mule eric said abruptly between enormous bites ill be back in a day three at the most depending on how fast i can find a decent one then ill take you for some good challenging rides youll be so tired you wont have a choice but to sleep since you dont like my way of frightening people out of the woods maybe you can come up with something better and give me a hand with that thats a brilliant idea eric sebastian beamed i know isabella will feel better for getting out perhaps i can even join you his face took on a good bit more animation you know maybe we can convince people that were evil sorcerers or ghosts or something that would frighten them i might be able to make just our heads disappear we could be headless horsemen whatever so long as they stay out eric just shrugged finished his dinner and pushed away from the table im off he announced ill be back when im back and left with what bella was beginning to wonder was characteristic abruptness well there was some improvement in that he didnt seem compelled to make her feel as if she was going to owe him some sexual favor for the acquisition of the mule here this might cheer you up sebastian said when he was gone shoving a silkwrapped square across the table to her she opened it and frowned at the contents her own face was reflected up at her and she did look horrible pale with dark patches under her eyes and a crease of pain between her eyebrows even her hair looked lank the lavender of her gown hid some of that but not all even her blond hair looked colorless this morning a mirror she said i have plenty of mirrors this one is from godmother elena sebastian said quickly interrupting her as if he feared she would toss the object into a dustbin otherwise this is what i promised you she wants you to be able to be sure that the people you love are all right it will show you your family all you have to do is think of them she stifled a gasp when she realized what he had just given her a magic mirror the godmothers simply did not allow those out of their possession very often this was very powerful magic indeed even if it was only oneway quickly she rewrapped it in the silk and held on to it possessively thank you she said and meant it thank the godmother not me he replied and flushed a little ah what have you found out about the summoned servants i see they are all wearing armbands now which is an improvement over not knowing where they were or even how many were in the room with you eric was actually pretty pleased i can tell you i think it really made him angry sometimes that there was no way for him to know where they were he doesnt like it when he thinks hes being watched hes been that way for as long as ive known him who was watching him she asked curiously i have no idea sebastian told her shrugging helplessly i just remember him shouting at the regular servants when we had human ones and even me when i was a boy well that was curious she explained to him what she had found out he nodded thoughtfully several times but didnt interrupt her i honestly have no explanation for why there are more of them than i thought he said i thought i was being very specificand i cant imagine where the sheer power to bring that many came from ive been very careful to use only the power that i can raise in my spells and not steal it from anything else i shouldnt have been able to do that perhaps they brought themselves she suggested or do they breed or could they bring more of their own kind i dont think so nothing like that is in any of my books he looked extremely puzzled though in a way that suggested to her that he was eager to find out the truth of the matter your books said they were all quite mindless too she pointed out true he glanced at the yellow band floating nearby you arent one of the smart ones are you he asked it there was no response well at least i didnt insult it he chuckled ill have to borrow your verte and start asking it questions the thing is isabella you just cant bring those creatures across from the spirit realms without a lot of power and that sort of thing leaves signs about im rather good at seeing those signs and i havent seen any indication that there is a magician around here but me so what you are saying is they couldnt bring themselves and they couldnt just invite others more or less he nodded and adjusted his spectacles although in magic intent is very powerful i got so annoyed that i had to keep summoning more and more of them to replace the human servants that kept leaving that it might have been that intent that gave my spells the power to call up more of the spirits than i would ordinarily have been able to bring i do know that at one point i was so angry i could hardly speak i distinctly remember thinking for heavens sake let this finally be enough to get the job done that was right after the stable hands gave me notice and there i was with a stable full of animals and no one but eric who knew how to tend a horse her hands caressed the silk around the mirror she was dying to take it to her room and see if it worked but it would scarcely be polite to run off like a little child with a new toy im afraid i wouldnt know she replied apologetically the only magic person i know is granny and she never did any in front of me i mean i know there is a lot of magic in the city every shop i go to has charms to bring customers and curses against thieves on it butive never really seen anything at work much less seen anyone doing it he nodded and you wont generally really powerful magicians are rare which means that most magicians have to be very clever and careful learn how to do the most that they can with the least power for that matter the only magicians who are profligate with power are the bad ones because they just steal it from people why doesnt everyone she asked curiously i mean if no one is using the power because it generally kills the people you take it from or makes them sick he told her bluntly besides that the best magic is unobtrusive it just makes life go a little smoother there still are thieves and they still will take things and they have cursecounters to keep from getting hit by the curses that the shops have but mostly they get caught or the shop gets a reputation for paying for such good curses that it would be foolish to steal from it and life goes on he sighed with a glance at the floating armband if i had my way there would not be a single spirit here it would all be ordinary servants getting ordinary wages but things didnt work out that way and ive created something well lets not mince words here unnatural your servants arent unhappy she ventured they seem to enjoy serving you in fact he smiled wryly and a shadow crossed over his face as he pushed his spectacles up on his nose yes but did they have a choice in that he countered she shook her head i dont know what that means did they ever have a choice in whether or not they enjoy serving me he repeated i tried to make my spell noncoercive so that it wouldnt force any of them here but did it force them to enjoy their servitude once they were summoned he shrugged i dont know i cant tell and they cant tell me if they even know that is the problem with magic it often merely pretends to be doing what you want it to when in fact it is doing what it wants to she blinked at him youre talking as if magic is something like a person with a persons thoughts and feelings and sometimes it acts as if it is he said solemnly i cant explain it i just know that it does and maybe that is why and how the intelligent ones ended up here they certainly are not what i asked for when i cast the spell it has me baffled all i can tell you is that the intelligent ones are as good as any servant that i have ever had she assured him and good servants are loyal i must saywhile i cannot swear that the best of my servants at home would have stayed no matter what had happened to me or what strange things came to inhabit my house i would like to think they would have at least tried to accommodate everything before giving notice he hesitated a moment it wasnt only that i changed or that i started to have the invisibles about i think there was friction with eric you know hes neither fish nor fowl nor good red meat as the saying goes if this had been a bigger household or my father had taken more thought about erics situation and done something to give him a defined place in the householdwell he didnt whats done cant be undone her hands unconsciously cradled the mirror and he smiled a little i know you want to run off with that to be private he told her kindly his eyes behind the glasses a little sad so go and do that butyou are likely to find time hanging heavily on your hands if you do i wouldnt mind you coming to my workshop while i try to figure out a cursebreaker for our condition actually i would like your company wouldnt i be disturbing you she asked she couldnt imagine why he would want her there she didnt know a thing about magic and would probably only be in the way not at all it would be useful to have someone to talk to and you ask very intelligent questions in fact sometimes you could help when all i need is an extra pair of hands i would very much welcome you then he made a face i know that i have the servants to help me but they are magic themselves and sometimes it is not good to have magic creatures hovering about where magic is being done its a bit like having a pot of oil boiling on top of a fire wellperhaps she told him tentatively im still not sure i can be of any real help and i might make things worse for you than if i wasnt there what if i did something wrong or what if something went wrong even if i didnt do anything he scratched his head and looked rueful welli cant absolutely promise you nothing would go wrong and i cant absolutely promise you that you would be safe magic has a lot of uncertaintyand as i said before sometimes it does what it wants to and not what you want it to do it is true that the invisibles have their own sort of protections i would try to keep you shielded from harm but well i know better than to sit here and pretend that you would be as safe as if you were in your own room at least he was honest i will have to think about this she told him he gave her a lopsided rueful smile i understand and i understand that you want very badly to take that mirror away and see your family he waved his hand at her a little go on you deserve more than that much more i just wish i could give it to you perhaps it was rude but she just couldnt wait anymore thank you she managed to get out as she snatched up her prize and ran as fast as the gown would allow for her rooms once there she made sure she was alone she didnt even want sapphire around for this then she laid the mirror down on the desk still wrapped and carefully unwrapped it breathing raggedly she settled into her chair and stared down at her reflection father she thought fiercely show me father there was a ripple across her reflection as if the mirror was water instead of glass and had been disturbed then the surface fogged over or was it the image in the depths that was fog shrouded the whole mirror darkened then slowly lightened the fog cleared and she was looking straight at her father as if she was sitting in the chair across from his desk at his warehouse office he looked haggard as if he had not slept much more than she had and he was working with the same dogged persistence she remembered from when her mother was dying as if by burying himself in his work he could drive everything else out of his mind that was always his response to trouble to work three times as hard she knew what had him looking so drawn and sick and generally horrible worry over her of course what had they told him was it even remotely possible that they had told him the truth what was he thinking she was dying to comfort him aching to tell him that she was all right even to lie to him if she had to and all she could do was watch him scratching away at things that his clerks could do in an effort to not think about what was eating him up inside she choked on a sob and tears dripped down her cheeks as she watched him she watched until she couldnt bear it any longer then turned away from the scene it faded into black blankness the moment she did she dried her eyes and concentrated on taking deep deep breaths this was supposed to be making her feel better not worse she wasnt going to do herself him or anyone else any good if all she did was sit in a corner and cry finally she got herself back under control she thought about looking in on genevieve or the twins but what possible purpose would that serve none of them had seen her taken away father would have been at his office when the kings men arrived while genevieve and the twins would not yet have been awake so none of them knew the exact circumstances except what the servants would have told them if the servants told them anything certainly her stepmother and stepsisters wouldnt even have thought to ask for it would never have occurred to any of them that the servants could be a source of information she couldnt imagine that anyone with a particle of sense had told genevieve anything that she could turn into gossip whatever they had told her would have been something utterly boring and ordinary so the worst that would happen would be that she would be mildly irritated that bella wasnt at home making sure everything ran smoothly no if she looked in on the rest of the family all she would see would be that they were carrying on as usual and that would probably make her cry as well as a harsh reminder of where she should be and what she should be doing now she was not entirely certain that this had been a good idea she couldnt speak to anyone through this mirror all she could do was watch them long to be there and make herself more desperate the more she watched was this how the newly dead felt watching their loved ones but unable to touch them comfort them tell them anything at all no wonder they fled this world so quickly this was sheer torment unable to stop herself she turned back to the mirror but as she fought with the desire to look in on her father again a new idea occurred to her it could show her her own family could it show her anything else she concentrated on edgar karsten the old bookseller in the square who always seemed to know exactly what she or her father wanted and always seemed to have it in the shop a moment later the mirror fogged over and cleared again and there he was up on a ladder dusting his bookshelves pausing now and again to pat the spines lovingly what would he make of the tinbound books in sebastians library she wondered she let the image fade other than providing a moment of distraction this was getting her nowhere unless she stared into the darkened depths of the mirror there was one person who might have answers maybe if bella could get a glimpse of her she could learn something show me she told the mirror fiercely show me the godmother in the back of her mind a little voice was saying sardonically that this couldnt possibly work after all the godmother had every sort of magic there was at her disposal and she had presumably created this mirror surely she would not make something that could be used to spy on her you really are a foolish wench you know that voice in her head told her and even if it works what can you possibly learn by watching the godmother do whatever it is that godmothers do its not as if this is the largest problem in her kingdoms that godmother elena has to cope with you and sebastian are probably somewhere near the bottom on her list of things to do so bella didnt really expect anything other than fog or darkened glass or her own reflection as she willed the mirror to show her the woman that had created it she certainly didnt expect what she got a glowing green face abruptly appeared in the mirror staring at her with a quizzical expression as if she had startled it just a face nothing more it materialized so quickly and it looked so strange that she jumped and uttered a stifled yip the face peered at her ah said a voice that sounded as if it was coming from the bottom of a well isabella beauchamps this is not unexpected but you are a little beforehand here we werent ready for you to make an effort to talk to us so soon the godmother is a little busy at the moment can you wait she stared at the face it talked when she had looked at her father and at the bookseller there had been no voices at all no sound but unless she was having a particularly vivid hallucination you are not having a particularly vivid hallucination the face said i am very real the godmother had high hopes of your intelligence and she sent you the mirror with the presumption that she would be speaking to you through it eventually i suppose your level of curiosity is high enough to make you wait good please enjoy this pleasant scene while the godmother finishes her other business the face gave way to a view of a field of flowers with butterflies floating over it there was the sound of running water in the distance it was a cloudless day with no sign of anything like a human being and after a while she began to notice that she didnt recognize any of the flowers she stared at the mirror and the scene it held too dumbfounded to know what to think at this point what was that face it had acted like someones private secretary how had it been able to talk to her how had it known her it had addressed her by name well the answer was obviously by magic but it wasnt an answer that made her feel any less queasy the invisible servants were only invisible she had quickly come to think of them as just people that you couldnt see it wasnt as if they were disembodied arms or trays on legs she hadnt really had a chance to think about the mirror but freefloating faces in unnatural colors that spoke directly to her well that was something else entirely it said magic in a way that she just couldnt ignore and she wasnt sure she liked it it made all the rules of the world seem as malleable as a handful of warm wax anything could happen when you had a world with green talking faces in mirrors in it the scene of butterflies and flowers was not giving her any answers only more questions just when she was about to give up and wrap the silk around the glass again the face came back the effect of the floating green face in a sea of black was doubly unnerving the second time there was no hint of anything like a body nothing to indicate that there was anything but the face it could just as easily have been a floating talking mask hollow soulless it was worse when it smiled oh good youre still there the godmother likes patience and perseverance and shell be pleased that you waited shell see you now she what was all that bella had time for before the green face faded into white fog and the white fog resolved into another image this was a lovely blondhaired woman seated incongruously on a wall around a raised flower bed in what looked like a kitchen garden she looked to be older than bella perhaps her middle twenties but her unconscious air of assurance and authority made her seem older rather than the opulent gown that bella was expecting a godmother to wear the woman was wearing a very plain linen chemise and brown moleskin skirt with a voluminous apron tied neatly over both her hair was tied back with a simple lavender bow hello isabella the woman said staring right at her as she gaped in surprise i rather expected you would be clever enough to think that the mirror could work both ways in some cases i hope you wont mind me continuing to work while we talk you caught me at a disadvantage i thought you would be so busy looking in on your family that you wouldnt get around to trying to see me until later today she chuckled and i had it all planned out too ah well thats overconfidence for you instead of my impressing you by looking more regal than your queen herself you catch me up to my elbows in planting perhaps that is just as well i never much like trying to intimidate people anyway the woman turned back to the bed in which she was planting tiny seedlings a moment later bella realized that she must be working in another hothouse just like the one here at redbuck onlymuch bigger since bella couldnt see any glass walls from where the woman was sitting that surely was the only possible explanation for someone planting seedlings in the dead of winter well godmother elena said when bella didnt immediately answer what is it you want to hear from me i assume you must have plenty of questions so you might as well start asking them i cant keep the mirror spell open between us forever you know even a godmother has her limits she was expecting me to try this i am supposed to ask questions i am talking to the godmother of at least four kingdoms that i know of still not quite over her surprise she blurted out the first thing she could think of what have you told my father that is a good and a dutiful question i know he is quite distressed over your problem please know that he does not blame you although for a while before i convinced him that sebastians escape was nothing more than a terrible accident i feared he was going to take one of those antique crossbows down off the wall of his study and come hunting even if he didnt know what for she felt a rush of both relief and grief her father didnt blame her and her father knew the truth you may not be aware of this but not only is your father a reliable man a trusted merchant who turned down the position of guildmaster of the merchants guild several times because he wished to devote as much time as he can to his family he has from time to time served as an advisor to the king she nodded at bellas surprise we knew we could trust him implicitly so we told him the truth he deserves nothing less he is concerned for you of course but he agreed that this is the only possible course of action we could have taken elena told her in brisk and nononsense tones privately he is probably deeply conflicted but he knows what his duty to his king and kingdom demand what on earth does that mean i dont know what he told your stepmother and stepsisters the godmother continued likely something less sensational than my daughter was bitten by a werewolf i wouldnt trust your stepmother with any information that i didnt want spread across half the city in two days and we have been working very diligently these past few years to keep sebastians condition a secret once again bella felt her throat close at the memory of her fathers haggard face i dont understand i dont understand any of this what do you mean by my fathers duty why are you keeping this so secret its not as if sebastian and i are important you could just she waved her hands vaguely put us on an island or a deserted tower in inaccessible mountains or something if youd done that in the first place with sebastian none of this ever would have happened to me and i would be back at home right this moment she couldnt help herself there was accusation in her voice and she wasnt going to apologize for it either if sebastian had been put somewhere where it wouldnt matter if he escaped confinement she would be at home safe right this minute such places are harder to come by than you might think the godmother said dryly adventurers have this habit of stumbling on them but that is not why we are trying to keep this from being generally known the truth is we do not dare do anything that will attract attention to duke sebastian or his condition and relocating him most certainly would have we face a dreadful unknown here one with potentially devastating implications sebastian was not changed by any means that i nor any other godmother have ever heard of wait what bella replied sebastian had already told her this of course but she hadnt altogether believed him he might be a sorcerer but he wasnt all that old and he seemed to be pretty much selftaught he could scarcely be expected to know as much as say a godmother but for the godmother to admit that there was some sort of magic at work that she didnt recognize well that meant that there was something operating here that she couldnt predict and when the godmother couldnt predict something it meant everyone was potentially in danger it is difficult if not impossible to separate his magic from the signs of someone or something else working magic on him elena continued i will simply describe it as holding a lit candle between yourself and the sun and trying to separate the light of the candle from the sunlight so without knowing who or what the other worker of magic is we cannot work out what was done to him all we can do is eliminate things such as bella asked uncertainly he was never bitten by another were which is the commonest form of the change and contrary to popular belief it is the easiest to cure provided one has the sympathy of a godmother the bite of a were leaves a permanent scar and one that is easy to recognize sebastian has no such scar but bella began i assure you we did not simply leave it at that the godmother continued it was possible he could have been infected by a very minor wound and one that would leave so small a scar we wouldnt recognize it one of us even suggested a number of other implausible means of infection so we assumed nothing but despite vigorous searching we never found another were nor signs of one anywhere in the redbuck forest nor within even the most pessimistic distance of the redbuck forest oh she said and bit her lip i really should know better than to question a godmother that left us with two other common options the first is that he was a terribly wicked person who died as a result of a specific curse on the part of one of his victims was buried and returned as a were mind you while i call this common its not and has never been heard of in any of my kingdoms but it is known in others and had to be considered however since he is not wicked did not encounter the sort of shaman who would make that kind of curse and obviously did not die that could not be the case the godmother turned her head slightly and looked at bella again seeing her reaction probably she seemed satisfied by it the second possibility was more likely than the first since we already knew that he is a sorcerer there is a specific spell which requires a belt of wolf skin that allows someone of sufficiently depraved character to physically become a wolf i say depraved because part of the spell requires that the person first eat human flesh as it happens since we found no such belt and he has transformed without any such belt this also is obviously not the case elena finished transplanting the seedlings and dusted off her hands before looking back at bella havent i heard i mean i thought are there other ways she said flailing a little mentally elena nodded but all of them are less common than those three and all of them were easily disproved he didnt drink water from a wolf footprint he wasnt born on the last moment of the winter solstice he never ate the flesh or brain of a wild wolf there is no magic pool that causes transformation closer than a thousand leagues he didnt even know how to make the transformation potions or salves and he certainly never swore a pact with infernal forces in exchange for revenge and none of those causes of transformation has ever been known to occur within my kingdoms there is no explanation for what happened to sebastian he was a perfectly normal young man until one full moon he suddenly became a werewolf im not sure what all this means bella replied feeling bewildered elena was getting at something but what was it she felt as if she must be missing something fortunately elena didnt take this amiss and seemed to be perfectly happy to explain this means either he was cursed by someone untrained but extremely powerful someone we have not been able to find or there is another way to make someone into a werebeast one that none of us have been able to determine it is also a means that can be worked without detection on someone who was relatively closely watched because he was the heir to a noble household now can you see where that places us bellas mind went blank for a moment then began racing she had always had a particularly good imagination that was one way in which she ensured against problems cropping up or rather was prepared for them when they did and once the godmother had pointed out the circumstances surrounding this if it can be done to sebastian it could be done to anyone she said slowly a feeling of slow horror dawning on her anyone at all the king the prince any king any prince any general commanding an army in war any influential priest or other man regarded as holy it might have taken a magician to create the means but we are fairly certain it did not take a magician to place whatever brought the change about which tells us that any ordinary agent could be used and just imagine how devastating that could be the godmother said gravely from your reputation and what your father has said of you isabella you know history and you are very good at making deductions the potential for disaster is immense right now we honestly dont know if this is the result of a single disgruntled magician with a grudge against sebastians family a magical accident that can never be repeated again a magical accident that will strike again some sort of magical plague or someone trying out his new weapon until we know well we are trying to keep all the variables to a minimum and we have to assume this was the work of someone or several someones whose motives we do not know and if this was the work of an outsider we would rather that he didnt know he was successful thus we are keeping it secret bella digested all of this it was hard to keep her own thoughts coherent when they were running off in all directions with all sorts of possible scenarios but one emerged above all the others this is a lot bigger than just one kingdom elena nodded gravely every godmother in the five hundred kingdoms knows about this and has been keeping in touch with me about it since sebastian changed so far there have been no other instances of werewolf change that could not be ascribed to the three common causes or to circumstances peculiar to that particular kingdom but i have to add that we know of it is possible that there is another like sebastian running wild in some remote area who is smart enough to hide his condition and remote enough that he hasnt drawn attention to himself with killing sprees since it has been five years since sebastian was infected the situation has become less urgent but is still no less dangerous what does that mean for me she asked in a small voice it means that the odds of you being infected are lower than they might otherwise be the godmother told her yes you were bitten but so far as any of us can tell the only weres that can create other weres with a bite are the ones that were made that way themselves but again we dont know not for certain and with so much at stake we cant take the chance that we are wrong that is why you must stay at redbuck for three months and be locked up safely for three full moons bella brooded about this for a very long moment and if i am infected she asked finally what then elena looked at her levelly then we can try cures we did not try on sebastian because i am relatively certain that you unlike sebastian will agree to them he did not feel enough urgency to take the chance with things that were so dangerous he is by nature a shy and solitary young man and as long as he is sure that he wont hurt others he doesnt find being confined to redbuck all that onerous you on the other hand are of a different nature if you discover you are infected i think that you will take risks for a cure that he will not bella simultaneously hated and admired the godmother at that moment hated her for being so blunt and apparently unmoved by bellas plight and the desperation she was feeling admired her for telling the absolute truth without any attempts to make it sound like anything other than it was a lifeordeath risk and if these cures dont work bella continued if im still changing at the full moon when you run out of things to try provided you survive all the failed attempts i believe we will be looking into the remoteisland and desertedcastle possibilities the godmother said though her expression and tone of voice gave no indication that she actually expected bella to live through too many attempts at a cure well there it was the very worst possible scenario all laid out and oddly that actually made bella feel a little tiny bit better she knew that the godmother was actually actively working at solving this she knew that she would be protected if for no other reason than to serve as someone that dangerous cures could be tested on at least there would be no mobs with torches and pitchforks in her future now to be fair again i personally do not think you are infected elena continued by logical deduction your odds are very good bella considered that and then suddenly remembered what sapphire had said to her which now seemed even more important did anyone tell you that sebastians servants some of them anyway are talking with me at the godmothers incredulously raised eyebrow she hastily amended that not talking actually writing to me on a slate very interesting they had not and what did they say the eyebrow was down but the godmother leaned forward intrigued theyve mostly been telling me about the situation here but one of them told me that i shouldnt be unhappy because i wouldnt change then it said that they would keep me from changing or protect me from whatever had changed sebastian she leaned back waiting to see how that particular dropped hornets nest would affect the godmother oh really the godmother was clearly struck forcibly by these revelations now isnt that interesting i would wager that when you pressed it for further information it told you that it could not give you any yes exactly she nodded vigorously which makes me think they know something and are being prevented from telling anyone the godmother nodded agreement and that argues for it being the work of a particular magician and the fact that the invisibles know what happened yet are being kept from telling hmm she fell silent for a very long time then said this may be the most valuable thing that i have learned since sebastian was changed it certainly gives me a new line of investigation to pursue especially since they told you that they can keep you from being changed she pursed her lips dont tell anyone else please not even sebastian especially not sebastian i do not for a moment suspect him of lying to us but this suggests that whoever did this to him may still be about and sebastian might inadvertently let fall that the invisibles know about him i would not like to see them harmed bella shook her head nor would i they have been very good to me again the godmother raised her eyebrow have they now another interesting development she again pursed her lips in thought well this changes things i will need to consult with well quite a number of sources before i dismiss this spell is there anything more you would like from me bella hesitated a moment i was going to ask if i could talk to my father the godmother gave her a long and penetrating stare do you really think that would be a good idea she asked bella sighed not really she admitted all we would do is try to pretend we are being brave and fail terribly and make each other miserable id like to write to him but how would i get the letters to him now the godmother smiled oh well if that is your only concern i can easily arrange that give me a day or two you can for the first time since all this began she actually felt like smiling you really can elena laughed of course i can i am a godmother and this sort of communication is very trad is not that difficult for a godmother to arrange i think it will make a world of difference to both of us bella told her gratefully and please i do understand now why you have done what you have done i cant see that i would have made any different choices or that i could have it must be awful for you she wasnt sure why she had added that last but she knew when she said it that it was both true and the right thing to say thank you for being so understanding elena sighed and for a moment looked very sad you are correct it is often very difficult to be a godmother most of us are only human and far too often our only choices are between bad and worse and no matter what we do someone is going to suffer is there anything i can do bella asked hesitantly you can keep talking to your invisibles the godmother said immediately they might be able to drop you some hints and if you get anything no matter how insignificant it seems tell me or my mirror servant immediately i can do that she promised although she really hoped she would not have to speak too often to that uncanny face very well then my dear alex and i do have other issues to deal with but i hope you will keep in mind that we have not forgotten you even if we might not have answers for you quickly the faint smile when elena said dear alex gave isabella the tiniest twinge of jealousy she knew who alex was the godmothers champion and also her husband to be a godmother with all that power and to have a truly beloved partner seemed a little unfair dont be ridiculous she probably earns it twenty times over take care isabella and be ready for my next gift very soon the mirror fogged over and the godmother was gone bella successfully resisted the temptation to sit and look into the mirror for the rest of the afternoon instead she decided to follow the godmothers orders they couldnt be called advice given how they were delivered and find out as much as she could about the invisibles one thing was certain the godmother knew something about these creatures and what bella had told her had taken her completely by surprise for a godmother to be surprised something quite unusual was going on i suppose they could be dangerous she mused but then anything can be dangerous they must like me since they said they would protect me or they could be lying of course but it didnt seem as if the godmother had any suspicion of that and all of bellas instincts told her that the invisibles were to be trusted so since the most forthcoming seemed to be sapphire that was who she focused on she wasnt going to be foolish however she would try and make her inquiries casual and put no pressure at all on the creature if sapphire answered a question all well and good if she didnt bella would let it drop for now after she unlocked her door and put the mirror away she was pretty certain that rummaging through her closet would make sapphire appear especially when she began taking things out and laying them on the bed the servant seemed very proprietary about bellas wardrobe and bella had gotten the impression that sapphire would have been better pleased if her charge liked to change her clothing two and three times a day as genevieve did sure enough she hadnt gotten more than a gown and two skirts out when her door opened and the blue ribbon appeared bobbing toward her in what looked like an agitated manner one of the skirts lifted off the bed as sapphire attempted to return it to the closet bella held out a hand preventing her i really do not like these things at all sapphire she said frowning at them they dont suit me i dont really like this gown much either id rather be rid of them the ribbon fled toward the little dressing table and returned with the slate and chalk y not was scribbled on the surface v prity v v prity the words were erased and others took their place u r v prity shud wer prity things aha sapphire did disapprove of her wardrobe choices poor sapphire if only shed had amber and pearl to dress i must be a terrible disappointment for her this put paid to any fears she still had about the nature of this one of the servants at least here was a creature who understood and adored female fashions whose heart invisible though it might be fluttered at the sight of ruffles and lace whatever else she was sapphire was no different than marguerite the twins maid whose heart broke every time bella put on one of the severely plain gowns she preferred and who nearly went wild with happiness when bella brought her back a frivolous little bit of frippery from the warehouse for her very own these things might suit my stepsisters maybe but they are not for me i cant really do anything in this gown except sit and read or sit and embroider i like gowns that let me well do things nice plain ones and i dont like fussy colors like pink or pale blue or white they dont suit me and im not suited to a gown like this im sure i look like a donkey in a bonnet in it she took out another gown and laid it on the bed sapphire immediately tried to put it back sapphire look at this dress she exclaimed tight sleeves you cant reach for things or lift things without popping the seam open and look here lace and ruffles that get caught on everything and tear she shook her head that just isnt me i want clothing that lets me feel like myself not like a stranger even if i dont actually look ridiculous i feel ridiculous sapphire stopped we r sposed to mak u hapi well these gowns dont make me happy they make me feel as if i was being smothered in whipped cream she said decisively and added as if the question was of no real consequence who told you to make me happy duk sapphire replied immediately wellthat was kind of him sebastian might have told you to make me happy but i know he didnt order these gowns so that must have been the kings doing sebastian would probably have figured i could use whatever clothing there might still be in storage here assuming he thought about it at all and she had brought with her a perfectly good wardrobe hmph the king had in turn probably just ordered that clothing be sent with her whatever underling he had that he trusted with this had found out her approximate size and made a raid on seamstresses that made sense the gown she had on now was only an approximate fit she hadnt thought about it at the time but when sapphire had been putting her into it she had been adjusting it via tapes and ties and lacings readymade gowns were often put together that way and if the buyer had the extra money they would be tailored to fit the kings steward would have taken care of this and he probably doesnt have any better sense about gowns than sebastian but he sees a lot of them at court he must think that every female has to look like a wedding cake exploded all over her or she will not be content the slate and chalk began jiggling the ribbon was shaking for a moment bella thought that the poor invisible was frightened but then she realized that sapphire was laughing she smiled it felt very good to smile have we got anyone here that can do something about these bonbons she asked if youll have them altered ill wear them but not as they are now i can sew a little but not enough to make these things sensible ill put up with the colors but if i see one more ruffle i might turn into a pillar of sugar yes sapphire replied sho me wut u want first get me out of this thing she demanded and sapphire hastened to do so once the offending gown had been discarded onto the bed with the others and bella was back to wearing something she could actually don and remove without help she showed sapphire exactly what she didnt like about the new wardrobe and how her old clothing was better did sebastian summon an entire ducal household when he started bringing you here because that would include several seamstresses just called servants well that matched what sebastian himself had told her that he had just summoned the creatures without being specific about their talents i rather like lace but not in places where it is bound to trail on the floor and get filthy or get caught on things why are there more of you than sebastian remembers summoning she asked at the same time pointing out the long lace ruffles on a petticoat and a sleeve cuff she had the feeling that she was not succeeding in being subtle but sapphire didnt seem to notice he neded us we came was the reply i dont see any reason why this cant be made to fasten up the front with buttons instead of lacing up the back she said laying one of her own bodices beside the one with the backlacing you see what i mean here this is how i like my bodices to fasten how did you know sebastian needed you we wached him the new bodice levitated into the air and was turned around and around in sapphires invisible hands and this overskirt two ruffles are fine elegant even but no one my age looks anything but ridiculous in a gown with a dozen ruffles to it why were you watching sebastian sapphire didnt answer that one so bella acted as if the answer didnt matter and continued on and thisthis is just horrid i dont know if it can be picked to bits and the pieces reused but the only thing that anyone could do in this overdone monstrosity is to sit and look ornamental how did you all get here if you werent summoned wer alredy here abruptly sapphire left the room before bella could wonder if she had pushed the invisible too far sapphire returned with several more ribbons trailing behind her white pink pale blue mintgreen and lilac within moments the discarded gowns and petticoats were sailing out the door presumably to be altered but since sapphire went with them that was an end to bellas questioning for now it certainly gave her something to think about so the extra invisibles were somehow already here and had been watching sebastian she had the distinct feeling that the intelligent ones were all in that set and they had insinuated themselves into the household because sebastian needed them all of these conclusions only opened up more questions where had they come from before they were here could they actually be ghosts the spirits of former inhabitants of redbuck was that even possible the only ghosts that she had ever heard of were hardly the helpful creatures that these were nor were they even a fraction so physical if they werent ghosts then what were they some sort of nature spirit something else entirely the familiars of other magicians who had failed to release them when the magician died how could she possibly tell she went to her desk made notes wrote down all of her questions and drummed her fingers on the desk as she thought godmother should have noticed if these were familiars she wrote unless godmother hasnt been here herself since sebastian changed something else to ask about but i would think that even sebastian would have noticed if they were someone elses familiars wouldnt he i still dont know enough about magic she decided but of course there was someone here who did and he wasnt at all reluctant to discuss anything about magic sebastian would probably welcome questions she thought with a little amusement i probably wont be able to get him to stop once he starts talking the problem was just at the moment she wasnt sure she wanted him to know these things i need to think very carefully how i am going to phrase these questions she decided as she gathered up the items of clothing that hadnt been carried off and put them back in the closet it looked very bare in there now not only because about half the clothing that had been hanging in there was gone but because the items removed had taken up so much room she stretched feeling ever so much more comfortable now that she was in one of her old practical gowns genevieve is right she thought with ironic resignation i am never going to be a proper lady i will never choose style over comfort but the thought of her stepmother gave her pause not because she was in the least afraid of what genevieve was saying or doing right now but because these past few days were the first in a very long time when she hadnt been responsible for anyone but herself when she wasnt trying to fight down the fear of what she might becomeit had been rather nice if the godmother was right and she wasnt infected in three months time she would be back at home again and and after this how can i ever settle into a life like hers i already loathed gossip and gowns and nowi am not sure i could ever just go back to supervising a household not when ive seen all this which means that genevieve is right again no one is going to propose marriage to someone like me men want a wife who fits into society and i am always going to be a little outside of it or perhaps a great deal outside it and if anyone ever finds out what really happened to me would i become some sort of freakish thing someone that people whisper about and wonder about so what was she going to do with herself when she got back she sat on the edge of the bed abruptly given what she had just gone through so far simply remaining the odd spinster who stayed unwedded and made sure that her fathers household ran smoothly did not seem so bad there was a great deal to be said for not being afraid you were going to become a vicious killer or be hunted down by your former friends and acquaintances and if people talked about her so what it wasnt as if she craved all those invitations that came to the household granny would still treat her the same who knows if i am eccentric enough that might actually be a good thing eccentric people are often looked to for advice if they are wise enough it might be good for business if i were to ask father to set me up as an herbseller and it would give genevieve plenty to talk about too and she might leave the twins to grow into their own selves instead of little copies of her she wasnt entirely sure she would still be able to suffer genevieves more ridiculous excesses in silence anymore however and that could cause more than a few household tremors ohbut will peace and quiet make up for all the things i know about now all operating madly beneath the surface things that people dont even suspect there was another thing now she had seen magic at first hand she knew and not just abstractly that there was so much more outside of the little circumscribed life she had led skating expeditions and guild dances didnt seem very exciting anymore could she ever go back to her old life after this nor was that all things are more complicated than even that now she had seen what was behind the faces that the king and the godmother presented to the rest of the world she knew now and could never forget that both of them were utterly ruthless when they needed to be she had no doubt whatsoever that while godmother elena was going to try to save both her and sebastian if it came down to a choice it would be sebastian who was saved and if it came down to sebastian and bella or great danger to the kingdom and beyond both of them would be sacrificed without a moment of hesitation and for the king it probably wasnt even a question hed wield the blade himself in abstract she knew that this was how it had to be part of her knew that this was the only decision they could make but part of her felt not only afraid but betrayed the king and the godmother were supposed to take care of you they werent supposed to be the ones who watched impassively as you went to your doom or worse took you to the edge of the doom cliff and shoved you over it and if the king and the godmother both of whom were extraordinarily good people she and everyone else in this kingdom had evidence of just how good could hide this ruthlessness then how much darker were the things that notsogood people hid what villainy lurked behind the smiling faces she saw every day so her safe little world would never be safe again she knew that the nurturing hand also held the knife and that was very unsettling and now if she got the least hint that there was something beneath the surface of an action or a comment she would be suspicious of anyone she didnt know well she felt the urge to go and unwrap that mirror so that she could watch someone she knew and loved and trusted and again resisted she already knew what she would see and it would only make her unhappy and lonely what she needed was something to keep her mind busy it would be easy enough to keep her hands busy but she needed something to occupy her thoughts well she was in a manor filled with books there might be a clue about sapphire and the other unsummoned invisibles in them she might as well start looking for books about magic creatures although the likelihood of finding anything here in her suite was pretty remote she had to start somewhere and besides so far as she had been able to tell the books here werent organized at all for all she knew something had gotten borrowed and left here by a previous guest she might just as well remedy that before she turned to the larger library when verte turned up to summon her to supper she had rearranged about half of the books on the shelves and had already determined that there wasnt anything about magic or the history of redbuck here but really when she considered who had probably used these rooms it wasnt all that likely that the guests had been interested in magic at all this had probably been a suite for important guests so the books here were designed to amuse or serve as resources on questions of the kingdom they were divided unequally between various sorts of stories for the purposes of amusement only and books on history there were even a few about other kingdoms such people had their own wizards or sorceresses to advise them about magic they didnt need to learn about it themselves she was about to leave the room when she realized that she had never asked verte the question that had led her to discover the invisibles were not all the sorts of creatures that sebastian had thought they were verte are any of your musicians willing to play for me she asked yes he wrote on his slate could ghosts be musicians i dont know why not they can obviously be seamstresses why not musicians she hesitated a moment then made her request i should really like to have some music she said wistfully the reply was immediate you shall sebastian was already eating when she came down with a book propped up in front of him he was shoveling the food into his mouth automatically completely absorbed in what he was reading as she entered the dining room and the invisible servant pulled out her chair for her he actually jumped as if she had startled him and scrambled to his feet i am so sorry i beg your pardon he blurted blushing i got involved in researching things and completely forgot that i wasnt alone here im just not used to having any people here but eric anymore and most of the time hes off doing whatever it is he needs to do do you often read while you are eating she asked taking her seat and nodding when the invisible steward offered her some of the first course generally yes he admitted eric rarely eats supper with me and even when he does hes not much of a conversationalist i think he prefers it when i read actually it keeps him from having to try to make conversation why am i not in the least surprised she thought eric does not strike me as a fellow who considers conversation necessary at a meal then again she couldnt really blame him sebastian probably wouldnt want to talk about anything eric was interested in what would eric be interested in women she supposed she couldnt picture sebastian in a convivial hearty semidrunk discussion of women the way many young men seemed to occupy their time the sorts of things she had seen going on in taverns but also in the private parlors of the wealthy when they werent out being polite to the young women they were supposed to be assessing for marriage there were any number of parties she had gone to because genevieve insisted where she had taken to wandering off to see what she could find it was amazing what young men would say when they thought there were no parents or young women about but sebastian didnt seem at all the sort who sat about and boasted about what hed been doing with the first chambermaid which sent her mind off briefly on a tangent could you get up to mischief with one of the invisibles they had hands but she wasnt sure from sapphires and vertes ministrations if they were human hands or not and if you wanted to how would you know which one was in your bed she supposed an invisible lover might be very titillating for a while but they were silent as well as invisible so would that be offputting ruthlessly she dragged her mind out of the gutter and back to the dinner table blushing a little at herself considering the number of meals she had taken in her life where mindless chatter had virtually dominated every bite she wouldnt have minded a few meals in silence herself i can see that eric does seem to be the sort who wont use three words when one will do so what had you so enthralled she asked if this was a book about magic it would probably give her the opening she needed to start asking questions of her own i dont know if enthralled is the word i would use he said making a sour face unlike eric who seemed to have two expressions arrogant and sullen sebastian practically radiated everything he was feeling its not very pleasant reading its about accidental transformations times when something went wrong and a person or object got transformed that wasnt supposed to be i thought i would see if there were any werecreatures that had ever been created that way and if there were if they were infectious afterward its just not fair for you to be locked up here for three months if theres no need but before i can say theres no need i have to have evidence so since no one knows how i got this way it seems reasonable that the same rules would apply good heavens he is taking his responsibility to me seriously this was somewhat unexpected shed thought she would have to keep at him about it evidently not why is it unpleasant reading its a set of very detailed accounts and since these are accidents the results are as my father would have said not appropriate for dinnertime discussion young man he smiled at her over his spectacles inviting her to share the joke that used to strike me as grossly unfair since he and his men saw nothing wrong with discussing tournament wounds bloody battlefields and detailed ways theyd dispatched whatever it was they had been hunting that day over their food she laughed at that then felt both surprised and gratified that she could still laugh but after talking with the godmother after seeing her father she felt a great deal better not that she wanted to stay here but she did feel better less frantic and here was sebastian looking up yet another reason to think that she wasnt going to change because of his bite i can sympathize with your feelings but i would prefer not to hear the details of that book she told him i am enjoying this fine cooking and i would prefer not to have it spoiled its good to hear you laugh i take it that the mirror worked for you he closed the book and set it aside changing the subject it did it did quite surpassing my expectations she paused i confess that now that i have had something that magical in my own hands i see the attraction of magic she replied slowly i never really did before partly it just didnt seem real in the way that something i could measure and shape was real partly because magic things always happen in stories to other extraordinary people and i am as my stepmother says so ordinary i positively repel magic and partly well it just doesnt seemthe sort of thing that a rational person would want to be involved with it always seemed to me that either magic was too large and uncertain to be controlled or that you could get the same results with less effort and means that were not magical it is uncertain but the trad ah its more predictable than you might think he responded flushing as he corrected whatever it was he had almost let slip since she couldnt begin to imagine what the trad both he and elena had mentioned might be she simply set it down as some sort of magicians secret it does take an awful lot of effort though you are correct about that and more often than not it is more efficient to do things without it ive been studying magic since the godmother identified me as having the sorcerous talents and i still find it a lot easier to just go fetch what i need from the storerooms and light candles with a waxdip since i was about four when i started ive had a lot of experience in figuring out when not to do things four and here i thought he was just a sort of dilettante who took up magic when he was confined to his estate what is wisdom then but knowing when it is best not to speak and when it is best to hold ones hand she quoted and winked at him so wise for one so young he turned serious and she saw the weight of responsibility he suffered under i wish i were wiser i could probably come up with answers faster most of what i do when its not repeating spells that i know work is trial and error mostly i make things for other people im quite good at protective amulets for instance and the godmother relies on me for them since i dont go out and ride the boundaries of my property i have my servants place more of those amulets at key places to keep my people safe from supernatural and magical hazards i have eric to ensure that they are safe from ordinary perils ive been working on my own problem ever since it happened when im not making sure my people are safe from me and from things outside at least i am fairly certain i didnt transform myself the things i was doing before i changed were all triedandtrue spells and i definitely took all the right precautions do you think your servants might be humans that had been transformed she asked the invisible ones that is transformed from humans into whatever it is that they are oh a magician could do that but why would he sebastian returned a logical question for hers youve seen for yourself that having invisible servants is deuced inconvenient i frankly cannot think of any creature so hideous that making it invisible would make up for not knowing where it was and i cant think of any other magicians even the nasty ones who wouldnt feel the same especially the nasty ones the nasty ones are always having to look over their shoulders for enemies can you imagine how having invisible things lurking about would make them feel besides i already know what they are theyre spirit elementals pardon she had heard of elementals before this butnot that sort spirit elementals arent all elementals spirits there arent four elements he explained there are five earth air fire water and spirit only magicians ever bother about the spirit element look if you are finished with dinner come up to my workroom its easier if i show you she considered this for a moment it wasnt as if she had anything important to do she could go stare at the mirror for a while and then go cry herself to sleep or she could take him up on the invitation and learn something about the invisibles or more accurately learn what he thought they were all right i would like that she responded he beamed at her it was rather charming actually to see him so enthusiastic they left the yellowscarved servant to clear away and bella followed him down or rather up an entirely new path in the maze that was redbuck manor in the rare moments when she had pictured a magicians lair it had been a place dark mysterious wreathed in smokes of various odors most of them probably nasty and definitely underground so going up quite a long staircase was certainly a bit of a surprise instead of a dungeon he brought her to what must have been a room in the highest part of the manor it had windows on all four sides all of them glassed the sun was down but there was just enough light left in the sky for her to go to the windows and see that the manor was built in the form of a square with a cross in it so that there was not one but four little enclosed courtyards by going from window to window she quickly determined which one was hers she couldnt see the conservatory from here but she already knew it was somewhere on the exterior of the building the sole exception to the fortified nature of the place this part of the manor was a squat square tower that formed the center of the cross the rest of the building looked to be about three stories tall and the tower rose another story above that this used to be the ladies solar sebastian said from behind her father gave it to me when i started learning magic if there are going to be explosions i would rather they were above us than below us he said and if you get the solar at least you can open the windows and air out the stench without freezing the rest of the building in winter a very practical man my father i wish i had known my mother i think she was a bit more like me she turned to see sebastian grinning as he lit lanterns quite prosaically with a long waxdipped wick identical to the ones she used at home as it happens he was wrong about the explosions thats more in the lines of chymists and alchemists but right about the stench at least at first with the lanterns lit this room was anything but shadowed and mysterious between the windows the walls were floortoceiling bookcases and yes again all the books were in tin bindings or at least they were in metal bindings that she assumed were tin there were several tables but only three chairs among the shelves of books were shelves of neatly ordered jars and bottles and boxes there appeared to be several projects in progress on the tables and in the very center of the floor was a design that well she wasnt sure what it was other than that the design was inlaid into the floor itself she had heard of magic circles perhaps that was what this was there were four concentric circles the two bands formed by the outermost three of these circles enclosed circular processions of letters and signs but they formed no words that she could understand here this is what i wanted to show you sebastian said and laid his hand down on the table palm up and whistled as if he was calling a dog the fire that had been burning beneath an empty stand suddenly jumped up and ran across the table to him and into his outstretched palm she gave a little scream and looked wildly for something to put it out a moment later of course she realized her mistake and flushed with embarrassment sorry i forgot you arent used to magic sebastian said with an apologetic expression look right now hes tuning his fire so its perfectly harmless to people this is a basic fire elemental a salamander he held out his hand and the fire ran up to the tips of his fingers squinting she could see the fire actually enveloped the shape of a little lizard with big glowingyellow eyes hes cute she exclaimed in surprise the ones this size are the ones the size of a cart horse not so much sebastian put his hand back down on the table and the salamander ran back to the firepan where it had been curled i have him a nixie a sprite and a hob learning to summon them was part of my education and they are my special familiar spirits other magicians will know that they are associated with me just by looking at them the nixie is a water elemental mostly she lives in her bowl over there on the shelf and purifies water for me the sprite is an air elemental i think shes he peered around at the ceiling there she is asleep on that beam bella followed where he was pointing and could just make out the shimmering form of a little androgynous creature with dragonfly wings the whole of it was more transparent than glass shes often my messenger to and from the godmother among a few other people the kings magician for one granny upon rare occasion she has less to do with the folks i am personally responsible for and more to do with the ones who dont have a magician to watch over them so we dont talk too much once every three or four months at most and over there on the hearth the little fellow that looks like a sleeping garden statue thats the hob the hob did look like a roughfinished statue of a little man his eyes were tightly shut and he didnt move at all not even to breathe what does he do she asked when i need bits of specific metals or minerals or gems for a spell he gets them for me he can only bring me what he can hold in his fist which isnt much but that is almost always enough for a spell he gestured to a chair beside the hearth and she took it a spell is a process not a thing you see just as when you take flour and water and yeast and put them together the right way you always get bread but when you take flour and water and butter and put them together a different way you always get piecrust when you put the components together one way you always summon an elemental of the right sort you dont get a demon or a horseshoe or a rose you get an elemental if you make a mistake you might get nothing or a much more powerful elemental than you can handle safely or a much weaker one than you wanted but you still get an elemental if you get anything she considered this for a moment all right she agreed and so this means that when i summoned spirit elementals for my servants thats all i could get and dont be overly impressed with spirit elemental they arent inherently superior or more intelligent or purer than the others theyre just creatures from a different elemental plane thats like a world he added before she could ask what he meant and if i start in talking about the elemental planes and how they intersect and interact with what we call the real world i will not stop till dawn and it will make your eyes cross she had to laugh at that all right ill take your word for it but how do you know that the ones who are talking to me arent someone elses familiars she persisted remember that i told you that other magicians know when they look at my familiars that they belong to me he reminded her thats how we can see magic which is a form of energy like sunlight that energy looks different for every magician that uses it when i summon an elemental i more or less paint it with my colors all magicians do that ive checked and they arent wearing anyone elses colors he leaned back against the bench and crossed his arms so clear as mud well privately she was not as confident that he had seen all of them but there was no point in arguing with him actually you describe things very well she said instead you would make a very good teacher he beamed with pleasure well thank you now that youre up here is there anything you want to know all my books are here so if theres something i dont know it will be easy enough to look up wellyes she replied and then proceeded to bombard him with questions at first he answered her in a manner that was just eversoslightly superior but she was relentless forcing him to go into more and more detail until he began to struggle for the right explanations and begged for mercy please he said falling to his knees and holding out both hands in entreaty no more i crave respite my poor addled mind is melting she regarded him haughtily for a long moment then laughed at him ill let you off this time only because i am getting very tired she warned him next time you will not be so lucky ill count my blessings then he said and got to his feet waving at a redribboned invisible that was waiting patiently in a corner and handing it a lighted candle i trust you wont mind if i send a servant with you to light your way not at all she said mockingly i have probably so scrambled your thoughts that you would not be able to find the right corridors anyway it wasnt until she got to her suite that she realized how late it really was and how much she had quite unexpectedly enjoyed herself so much so that she hadnt the least desire to look into the mirror before she went to bed bella managed to keep herself from going to look in the mirror until after she had eaten breakfast the morning did not start out particularly well however she went down to the dining chamber only to discover to her disappointment that she would be eating the meal alone sebastian was nowhere in sight and she couldnt ask the invisible in attendance where he was either as this was not one of the ones who could write she resorted to the mirror feeling as if she was eating a rich and indulgent sweet to make up for not getting something she wanted as genevieve often did but the sight of her father drove any lingering sense of guilt right out of her mind he didnt look any more haggard than he had yesterday but he certainly did not look well as he worked feverishly over the accounts and invoices she tried to tell if he was paler or thinner was he eating right was he even eating at all she couldnt be sure cook will make sure he eats she reminded herself shell coax him and bring him little tidbits she vividly remembered cook doing just that for both of them in the last days of her mothers illness mrs hennister the cook was a very caring woman so was mrs athern the housekeeper actually all the servants from the old household were loyal and actually cared about their master the thought was evidently enough for the mirror it fogged over and cleared again showing the kitchen and cook laboring over a tray of little puffy pastries with bits of sweetened squash baked into them she sighed father loves those cook was watching out for her master there was at least one person who was going to make sure he was as all right as he could be under the circumstances the mirror widened its view the rest of the kitchen staff was also working on things she recognized as her fathers special indulgences there was a kettle of thick chicken soup on the hearth made with cream instead of broth and with dumplings floating in it someone else had just taken out a pan of venison cutlets wrapped in bacon and she could see preparations for a jugged hare well under way the mirror view shifted slightly then began moving through the house exactly as if she herself was making her morning rounds and everything was going so smoothly she had to blink to be sure she was looking at the right house mrs athern and mathew breman were working hand in hand like old partners ensuring that there simply were no incidents that would require the intervention of the master of the house when they had swept through all the rooms they parted with a friendly nod mrs athern then supervised the maids bringing up breakfast for the twins and genevieve while mathew himself brought her father a tray and literally stood there waiting to make sure he ate what was on it she wished that she could hear what they were saying but it seemed that the only time she could get sound was when she was talking to the godmother once her father had eaten the mirror fogged over again almost as if it had decided that she had seen enough to make any reasonable person certain that the family was all right and there was no point in fretting anymore well yes and a reasonable person would i suppose she got up and went to the window to look down at the snowcovered garden it would be a nice place to walk in if only it was spring if i dont find something constructive to do i think i am going to go mad she said aloud she hadnt quite realized how much of her time was taken up with things supervising the servants overseeing the shopping going out with the twins on their rounds of visits learning things from granny and putting them into practice at home ha now that was one thing she could do this was a proper manor house there would be a stillroom what was more sebastian probably needed things for his spells things that she could concoct she would find that out later for right now though sapphires ribbon appeared in the door as if her thought had summoned the spirit sapphire she exclaimed is the stillroom properly stocked sapphire made for the slate and chalk dun no she wrote v full sho u very full i wonder what that means please she responded and followed the ribbon as it led her down what she now knew was the south side of the manor then around the corner to the east side then around another corner into what was the arm of the cross that connected the east side of the manor with the central tower as was common in older buildings most rooms led directly into one another and the only corridors were those designed for defense but this part of the arm actually deadended onto the side of the central tower at least on this level the room that butted up against the wall of the tower was the stillroom or rooms actually because there were two the stillroom and the storeroom and now she saw what sapphire meant by very full nearly every cupboard strained to hold the bundles of dried herbs stored there more literally covered the ceiling and virtually every flat surface she knew immediately what must have happened here sebastian had given the orders to the spirit elementals to keep the stillroom supplied they only knew to keep cutting and drying the herbs so they had for at least two years maybe more she literally rubbed her hands with glee she had wanted a challenge well she had one the first thing to do was to sort this place out much of what was here was now too old to be worth anything and she would need to sort the stuff that was still good from what needed to be thrown out sapphire will you get me two of the stupid servants she asked we have work to do she had never been gladder of grannys training she could identify each and every bundle eventually either on sight or by crushing a bit of leaf and taking a sniff there were those bundles of herbs that started to crumble away at a touch those were obviously much too old to be at all useful as were those that she could identify but which had such faint aromas when crushed that it was obvious all the virtue was out of them now there was danger here and quite a lot of it some of these herbs and barks were quite poisonous and burning them in a fireplace would be a very bad idea so would disposing of them in any other careless way they had to be handled carefully even when their potency had lessened considerably she sent the spirit elementals out with four enormous baskets full of the dangerous herbs and very careful instructions on how to safely disperse them first treating them with lye then with vinegar then burning them then treating the ashes with lye and vinegar then spreading the ashes over an acre of land the rest were safe to throw onto the fire in the fireplace although this made for some obnoxious odors it was only when her stomach began to growl that she realized what she was smelling wasnt burning herbs but something a great deal more savory she turned to find sapphire and mustard from the kitchen staff behind her seeming to float in midair was a covered plate oh dear she said contritely as her stomach rumbled i seem to have entirely missed dinner havent i the plate moved abruptly toward her by way of answer it seemed that she had better take and eat what was on it before mustard got further offended so she cleared a spot on one of the tables in the stillroom and sat down to do so it was quite good but the flavor wasnt exactly improved by the addition of the warring aromas of herbdust mustard carried away the empty plate snatching it as soon as she had finished evidently by not coming to dinner she had offended the kitchen staff or at least she had offended mustard how angry at me are they she asked sapphire only mustard sapphire wrote how long is mustard going to stay angry she asked apprehensively not long gets mad at duk to well that wasnt so bad then and the spirit elemental probably was angered by sebastian for the same reason missing a meal which the kitchen staff clearly took great care in preparing well apologize to him for me will you she asked and sighed or better yet i will bring a peace offering i take it that mustard is quite important in the kitchen staff tym first then mustard oh dear i had better make that peace offering a good one she turned her attention to the herbs that were still sound herbinfused vinegar was probably a good idea at this point whoever had once used this stillroom had kept it well supplied once she cleared out all the unusable bundles of herbs she found the cupboards well supplied with bottles and jars labeled and full unlabeled and empty supplied with strong wooden stoppers and wax seals and among the other needful articles she found a keg of good vinegar heating that and pouring it over the sprigs of culinary herbs she packed into the bottles would give a good start to the flavored vinegar although ideally they should rest for at least a month to steep she thought about sending sapphire with the bottlesbut even though mustard was technically a servant and could be considered less than a servant since he was a summoned creature who presumably was something like a slave she didnt want to offend him further so she gathered up her bottles in a basket and went straight to the kitchen it was a hive of work startling to the eyes and ears of anyone who was expecting a normal kitchen since there were no voices and all the implements and food were suspended in or moving through empty air but all the work stopped when she entered she looked around and spotted mustards little bag of seeds tied to a white armband she went straight to him and held out her basket im very sorry i didnt come to dinner on time and left it all to get cold though still delicious id like to apologize for not giving respect to good food that should not have gone to waste and for making you find me id like you to have these the rolling pin that mustard had been using slowly lowered to the table and she felt a faint tug on the basket she let go and the basket moved toward mustards side of the table where it was lowered theyre fresh so they probably wont be good for another month she explained and i am here to say that this probably wont be the last time i get so involved in something i forget the time if that happens please send one of the ordinary ones to fetch me if you dont send one of the ordinary ones with a plate for me now she tilted her head to one side wishing she could see a face any kind of face and dont pretend that the duke doesnt do the same thing because we all know he does my father does anyone who has something that they are going to get completely engrossed in does and i imagine that you make him up plates all the time so lets not get out of sorts over it it wont change me or sebastian and as granny says getting angry over something that wont change is like seeing what happens if you hit your hand with a hammer over and over again and being surprised each time when it hurts so you might as well stop doing it the silence in the kitchen was utterly unnerving until it was broken by the scratching of chalk on slate she turned to see a slate held in midair turned so she could read it mustard is laughing she smiled with relief and turned back to the place where mustard stood just so you all know i respect you for the artists that you are it is very frustrating to prepare what you know is a fine meal only to have it spoiled because people werent where they should have been when it was ready but she hesitated a moment genevieve would never talk to servants like this but i am not genevieve id like you to remember what sebastian is and what i might change into sometimes we escape into things that involve us completely so we dont have to think about that when were absorbed we arent thinking about the terrible things we might do or how we havent found a cure or what will happen if the king stops protecting us or how very alone we are her voice caught a little on that last and she paused to steady herself before she went on escape into concentration is the only escape we have she wondered how they would take that after all they had been summoned here they might be just as trapped as she and sebastian were but sebastian had sworn he hadnt summoned any who were unwilling to come she had to take his word for that not knowing how the magic worked she heard the chalk on the slate again and turned you are right she sighed and then brightened if i can lure him away from his workroom and you dont mind ill bring him down here so he can see how much work it takes to turn raw materials into a fine meal once he realizes that he will not take such a meal for granted again after all he does much the same sort of work with his spells a fine plan thyme wrote she did not need to add that she never forgot how much work it was to make a meal i hope my vinegars prove useful was all she said thank you for hearing me out the stillroom beckoned and she headed back to it once it was properly organized she could make a great deal more than just flavored vinegar as she had pointed out there was a great deal of escape to be found in work and no matter what the godmother had said she still found herself flailing in moments of uncertainty and fear after all she knew now that the godmother was quite ruthless ruthless enough to lie in order to keep her from doing something desperate so no matter how much she wanted to believe both what the godmother said and sebastians research the fear never left her for very long it was growing darkness not weariness nor hunger that finally sent her back out of the stillroom and into her suite so she could change out of clothing stiff with herbdust into something presentable for supper sapphire must have been horrified to see her as she entered the spirit elemental came up behind her and all but pushed her into the bath chamber she didnt resist she knew how dirty she was and although back home she would have resorted to a bath in a basin and the vigorous application of a brush to her hair to get all the dust out well home was not equipped with that huge lovely tub nor what was an unlimited supply of hot water so she let sapphire have her way and as her clothing vanished out the door held in a way that suggested the elemental had it at arms length to avoid the dirt she sank into a hot tub scented with tuberose and luxuriated for a little before scrubbing every inch hair included she was just glad her hair only came down to just below her shoulder blades not long enough that she could sit on it like the twins could sapphire returned brushed out the clean wet hair and bound it up in a knot at the nape of her neck then with a flourish that looked like triumph she presented bella with one of the remade gowns which was still much more elegant than anything she had brought with her but at least it was not nearly as restrictive as it had been she allowed herself to be helped into it without a murmur of protest it was a lovely color between rose and tan made of soft silk twill with three rows of very tiny ruffles at the hems and the throat the ruffles kept it from looking too severe but they were restrained enough that she didnt look as if she was dressing in imitation of the twins even genevieve knows better than to run about in three rows of deep ruffles when she entered the dining hall as she expected sebastian was deep in another book but he must have been devoting at least a bit of his attention to watching for her since he rose as soon as she passed the doorway and pulled out her seat himself you look very nice he said sounding a little surprised he didnt think i could look nice im told i clean up passably well she replied dryly and he gave a quick smile i have been doing some further investigation into your spirit elementals she continued well that is making it sound as if i was actually doing research which i havent been ive just been seeing what they will do if i ask them to the stupid ones are as you said about as bright as an obedient dog you have to tell them exactly what you want and sometimes show them how to do it but the smart ones are my equal they do things they know i will want without being told to and do it very well they tend to me as if i was a beloved master she paused a moment have you ever given thought to what a good partnership is between a master and a servant he looked at her as if he was not entirely certain of her sanity ermno he ventured a servant is not merely someone you give an order to and expect it to be obeyed because you give him wages and board she replied fixing him with a slightly stern gaze a bad servant can ruin the household and rob you a good servant can save you endless time and money too but it has to be a proper partnership the servant must trust that you will not just pay him a fair wage but be fair to him in other ways not order him to do more than a reasonable person can not ask him to do something he finds repugnant nor something illegal he trusts you to defend him against outside accusation and take care of him when he is sick or old he trusts that you will trust him and not watch over his shoulder at his tasks or send someone to spy on him in your turn you must trust him to be competent honest and capable he will learn to anticipate your needs and you will give him praise and respect for doing a fine job you see a partnership sebastian looked startled i never thought of it that way she sniffed a little most people never think of their servants at all they treat them like invisible automata and walk past them without an acknowledgment it is the housekeeper and the butler who generally become the real mistress and master in households like that they are the ones who incur the loyalty or inspire the disloyalty and sloth and the one who thinks he is the master is merely a figurehead she shrugged but then that is what you want i expect everything to go smoothly without the need for intervention or even thought on your part he coughed embarrassed all over again its perfectly all right she hastened to add in a household the size of yours you would put your trust primarily in your steward or seneschal he would be the person in charge of everything and then beneath him your trust would be in your housekeeper your butler your land steward for your farms lands and mines your factor for business matters your secretary for correspondence and i suppose your coachman and head gardener for anything that had to do with the grounds and stables and so forth your partnership would be with them and they would in turn have that partnership with the rest of the servants that were responsible to them it is really a contract of trust everyone knows his job knows he will be supported and helped if he is asked to do things outside of his job and knows he will be cared for if things go wrong for him and your job is to provide the means for all this to happen she smiled in a way you are the one working for them he pushed his glasses up on his nose his forehead creased i never thought of any of thisexcept i vaguely remember my father starting to make a similar speech then cutting himself off and saying but well talk about this in a few years except rather than being about the servants as such it was about the duty of the lord to his liegemen i do spend one day a week dealing with the common business of the duchy not the magical protections mostly approving what the factor and eric recommend but since my father or king edmund chose most of the people who work with me i never had to think much of it how did you work all this out anyway i didnt when mother died once father had recovered a bit and realized i was trying to take over the household though i was only ten he sat me down and gave me almost this same speech she smiled a little sadly because both of them had been so griefstricken still but the memory was a good one almost because obviously we dont have nearly this many servants so later when i was older i found out about how great houses like yours are run this is why and how when we both fell apart the entire household pulled together to take care of us quietly and invisibly until we could go back to our duties and its why the mirror showed me this morning that things are going much more smoothly than i had ever dreamed they would and suddenly as she said that aloud she understood that yes that was exactly what was happening everyone in the beauchampses household well barring genevieve and the twins knew what needed to be done and they were doing it as they had when her mother had died and maybe genevieve will decide that she needs to manage the household in reality rather than pretending to do so she couldnt be as incompetent as bella had always supposed her father loved her and had married her and he really would not fall in love with a stupid woman and she had once had her own household and had presumably managed it bella felt an unaccustomed guilt what had she been doing all this time treating her stepmother like an idiot refusing to hand over the household not overtly but by manipulation getting up so early that by the time genevieve awoke everything was done now genevieve was more than a bit lazy and no doubt on one level she enjoyed the fact that she didnt have to lift a finger and the house ran smoothly but on the other hand who was in charge the wife or the daughter the daughter obviously and that had to rankle she was so lost in her own thoughts for a moment that she didnt notice that sebastian was lost in his own as well it was only when he spoke that she realized that the silence had gone on for quite some time and what about someone who doesnt really fit into this whole arrangement he said but it was clear that he was speaking his own thoughts aloud and not talking directly to her it was also clear whom he meant eric it is the duty of whoever is at the top to find the right place where he fits or make one she said firmly that is what my father would say he looked at her as if he was surprised to hear her talking then slowly nodded your father is a very wise man was his only reply there was more silence then he looked up at her again so what has all this to do with the spirit elementals the stupid ones really dont need that sort of organization the clever onesi think they have put it together on their own you might not have been aware of directing them but you must have been at least enough for them to count you as their master in their own minds and arrange themselves accordingly that was the only thing that made any sense huh and how many of the smart ones are my personal servants he asked ive noticed that the colors of the armbands in my workshop and room dont change all of them she replied he fingered the bridge of his nose huh then he smiled wryly well i hope they dont resent me for treating them like trained dogs she could only shrug ive only spoken to verte sapphire and thyme the rest cant write now i am going to feel awfully selfconscious you know i liked it better when i thought they were all stupid but they admire you and regard you with esteem she pointed out to him so you must be doing something right still he sighed well what kept you too busy for dinner and made you late for supper something that almost resembled the labors of hercules she replied and began to describe the mess in the stillroom he listened with every evidence of interest does this mean that when youre done you can supply me with botanic components he asked excitedly if i have the materials on hand yes she said with pardonable pride there is nothing from salve to tincture to compound that i do not know how to make tell me what you need and i will make it she smiled at him and he beamed back at her thats going to make things ever so much easier he exclaimed although to her brief disappointment he did not go into what the things were until now ive had to make my own and that makes everything take twice as long well as soon as things are set to rights i am going to restock everything so you will have very basic supplies very soon thats brilliant he grinned from ear to ear i am going to be ever so grateful if you do that turned the remainder of the conversation to the things he needed most commonly as she made mental notes strangely he seemed to require perfumes and essences quite a bit he didnt say why though and she didnt ask they sat up long after the spirit elemental grew tired of waiting for them and cleared everything away as they sat there and when she finally did go up to bed she suddenly discovered it was so late that she was yawning and she was so tired she let sapphire help her out of that pretty gown and take down her hair without a protest and that night at least there were no nightmares the stillroom was clean organized and all the dried herbs either disposed of or properly stored and labeled she had a list of things sebastian wanted that she was slowly working through she had her own list of things that were definitely needed even if there were only three human beings living here and another list of medications for horses chickens pigeons and rabbits the stable cats were totally wild and absolutely uncatchable she wasnt even going to try to dose any of them for anything even halfdead they would probably lacerate her she had thought it odd at first when she inventoried the living creatures here that there were no dogs after all eric was the gamekeeper and sebastians stories indicated that he liked to hunt but then she had realized her mistake of course there were no dogs dogs would not abide a werewolf it was amazing that the horses would still carry sebastian in his human state now that she actually had something to do she was able to keep up a relatively cheerful front it was hard to look in on her father easier to see that the servants continued to take assiduous care of him she still had not dared to try to speak with the godmother again after all the godmother had several kingdoms and a lot more pressing business to attend to other than whether or not one unimportant girl was feeling content or depressed finding out just what had caused sebastians change in the first place for instance eric did not appear at all she was not sure if this meant he was simply avoiding company or he was somewhere else sebastians researches were no further along but she didnt really expect them to be now that she knew the complexity of the problem often enough he didnt appear for dinner or supper often when he did he was absently polite charming even but it was clear that his mind was elsewhere but she had her herbs and her medicines and she had grannys visit to look forward to granny had sent a scrawled message by means of sebastians air elemental that she would come toward the full moon that actually made bella feel a bit better it meant that granny was probably working on her own answers to the problem and was going to bring them in time for the first moment of truth as it were she had just finished decanting a rather nice horse liniment into the waiting jars to cool when a tugging at her sleeve alerted her to the presence of one of the spirit elementals when she glanced behind her the blue ribbon told her that it was sapphire and the bit of slate thrust at her told her that sapphire had something urgent to say erk com the elemental had written then the blue ribbon whisked out of the little room just as the sound of boots on stone warned that eric was indeed coming his footstep was very much like his personality he made no effort to be quiet and every step was taken as if he was conquering the hallway a pace at a time she wondered what on earth was bringing him up here in search of her he stopped at the doorway and looked around his face blank with astonishment well he said after a moment you have been busy the shock on his face made her laugh im not the sort to sit idle she retorted but how what when i saw that the idiot servants were stuffing these rooms full of weeds i was beginning to worry about a fire starting and i tried to get them to stop but i couldnt he was actually stammering a little so great was his surprise and when i tried to get them to clear it out they ignored me i did it myself i wouldnt trust them with anything like this she told him hands on her hips all i can guess is that when sebastian ordered these creatures to continue to serve the manor as the human servants had it somehow told the ones that were supposed to tend to this part of the place that they should keep the stillroom stocked but since they didnt have the instructions to make anything all they could do was to continue to dry and store the raw materials the herbs and barks and roots and so forth some of those are dangerous and i wouldnt trust them with disposing of it he scratched his head i guess im lucky they didnt for all i know they would have put it on the fire in the kitchen and poisoned the food or left it with the fodder in the stable and poisoned the horses yes she agreed but once they saw that i knew what i was doing they left me alone now i can trust them to take what ive finished and put it in the proper place in the storeroom he ventured into the stillroom and picked up a jar liniment he said reading her label have you been reading my mind then unexpectedly he grinned at her and dont say no theres not much there to read ive heard that one before oh i would like very much to read your mind master gamekeeper she thought but what she said aloud was it is winter horses fall people fall the cold makes you ache no one has made anything in this stillroom in years its logical to think that one of the first things you would run out of would be liniment he nodded and sniffed the jar wintergreen peppermint juniper lavender balsam you have a keen nose can you make a batch without the lavender he asked in answer she handed him a jar from a previous batch already labeled and waiting thanks he put the jar in a bag he had slung on his shoulder what i really came for was to ask if you were ready for a ride this afternoon i found you that riding mule and the sooner you get used to each other the better she stared at him in surprise she had completely forgotten that he had said he was going to find her a riding mule i well there is nothing pressing she began good he said cutting her off right after dinner which is now are you done here in somewhat of a daze she stoppered up the liniment jars and followed him out to the dining hall where for a change sebastian was there without a book oh good eric found you he said cheerfully as they came in did you want me along on this ride eric didnt give her a chance to answer not now wait till the mule gets a chance to get used to you you can go feed it apples in the stable until it stops trying to run from you eric also didnt wait for the spirit elemental to serve him food he took a dish heaped it with stew and bread and sat down to stoke himself methodically i want to see how well she rides and how well the mule behaves and we dont have a lot of sunlight bella thought sebastian looked more than a little crestfallen but he agreed readily enough early supper he suggested definitely its cold enough to freeze a bears balls out there and well need it when we get in eric seemed blithely unaware that his language was exceptionally inappropriate in front of a lady but sebastian flushed then again eric probably hasnt spent any time being taught whats appropriate around a lady im hoping this beast is going to be as good as promised eric continued i couldnt ride it im too heavy for it you know mules load them heavier than they are prepared to carry and they wont stir a step went sweetly enough for the wench i hired to try it out but that was in a city sowell see seeing how fast eric was eating bella made haste with her own food she was afraid when he finished his plateful he was going to get up and demand she leave her halffinished meal but instead he got a second helping that gave her just enough time sebastian was barely a third done when eric got up and finally looked at her to see if she was finished good you dont dawdle he eyed her gown dubiously i dont suppose give me the time it takes to saddle both beasts and i will meet you at the stable in something more practical she said firmly sidesaddle or astride you can ride astride he raised an eyebrow not that it matters sidesaddle thats what the beast was sold with and i dont think we have another saddle in the stable that will fit it with that he stalked out the door she cast a glance at sebastian who shrugged a little and gave her a wry smile as if to say at least now he is treating you normally she ran to her room and to sapphires dismay pulled out a pair of flannel trews a heavy woolen skirt that was short enough to show her ankles stout wellworn boots with chunky wooden heels a flannel chemise with a high neck and a knitted woolen tunic of undyed raw sheeps wool this was her coldest weather clothing which she wore when she had to trek out to grannys in weather that no lady would venture into poor sapphire this was all gear she could get into unassisted which meant it was so unfashionable the spirit elemental was probably near fainting but at least while she was dressing sapphire recovered enough presence of mind to get out deerskin gloves her old woolen scarf and sheepskin hat and her heavy cloak murmuring thanks bella seized all of these things and hurried out the door and down to the stables the less she irritated eric the better this day was going to go in fact when she arrived a little out of breath from running eric was checking the girths and rumpbands on both beasts erics mount was a powerful dark bay gelding with a wicked eye that promised no end of mischief if you didnt keep him firmly under control which she knew she couldnt she had seen this horse and the other three like him in the stable when she had gone exploring they were mannerly enough when they were in their stalls when turned loose in their paddock the amount of energy they had was daunting and she could tell by their behavior that they needed expert riders because given a beginner it was they who would be in control not the rider but bellas new mount was at least four hands smaller and was such a pretty little thing that it was all she could do not to clap her hands with glee someone must have bred a very fine palfrey to the jackdonkey to produce this little beast she was a creamy gray as dainty as a china statue with neat little hooves alert ears and a mild eye good god you are here eric exclaimed ungallantly he eyed her costume with approval have the idiots sew you up a coat for next time but otherwise thats perfect for riding in and the cloak wont matter much today well be trying out the beasts paces and temper slowly he took the mules reins and led her to the mounting block bella scrambled into the saddle as best she could and while eric was busy mounting his horse got her legs and skirt arranged in the peculiar configuration demanded by the sidesaddle the mule stood with perfect patience while she did so as soon as she got herself arranged eric put heel to his horse and rode out of the stable without looking back to see if she was going to follow well she wasnt a good rider as were people who lived out in the middle of nowhere or nobles who could afford to keep horses in stables in the city were but she wasnt a novice she lifted the reins a little gave her mule an encouraging chirrup and touched her with the heel of the leg that wasnt wrapped around the high pommel the mule stepped out neatly and obediently her head bobbing a little with each step as she stretched her legs to keep up with the taller horse her gait was easy and comfortable and rather than moving into a trot to keep up she merely sped into a faster walk how is she eric called back looking over his shoulder as they moved out of the forecourt and through the gates in the wall the forecourt paved with bricks had been swept completely clean of snow though it wasnt very big just large enough for a carriage or two nothing like the grand forecourt of the royal palace i like her she called forward excited now they passed beneath the walls and came out into the snow and sunshine and for the first time she saw what the manor looked like from the outside the wall only enclosed the forecourt and it looked like a later addition still later was a stout gatehouse of two stories built up against the wall this must be where eric lived from the outside at least it looked to be about twice the size of her suite of rooms the gatehouse looked like a little fortress itself although she suspected that was more to make it blend in with the manor than to be defensible the wall too looked as if it had been built more to keep the worst of the weather off the forecourt than to provide any real defense once they were outside the wall eric reined in his impatient horse to ride along beside her he eyed her with some disapproval and she wondered what she was doing wrong when he spoke i really cannot imagine how you women keep your balance riding aside like that he said your weight is all on one side of the beast and you are in danger of falling off at any moment well i told you i am not a very good rider she reminded him as the mules ears swiveled to catch what both of them were saying my father isnt the sort to waste money keeping horses in the city the twins are better but that is because genevieve paid for lessons so they can ride with the people she thinks they should see erics brows furrowed a moment but one corner of his mouth quirked up not their friends he asked i thought your father was wealthy why didnt you get lessons too because im not genevieves daughter i suppose i could have had lessons if i wanted them but riding didnt really interest me when i was little and after my mother died i was too busy sounds complicated eric dismissed her entire family situation with a shrug that said he really wasnt interested in hearing more have you any objections to riding astride none she said firmly she was truly enjoying riding much to her surprise the mules gait was quite smooth enough for conversation and she wasnt jouncing in the saddle as if the beast was trying to ram her spine up through the top of her head ill see about getting a real saddle for you then i got this beast from an old bird in the beauville market who swore she had been owned by some sort of pious old woman who only rode her out to do good deeds twice a week he chuckled at bellas snort of disbelief that was my reaction too but i checked to make sure there were no records of any such mule being stolen and otherwise she seemed to measure up so i bought her maybe for once the story was true stranger things have happened she agreed the mules ears swiveled back to catch her voice again i think she likes me thats not important what is important is that you like her erics horse shook its head restively and he reined it in with a hard hand settle you were not going for a gallop today what are we doing she asked seeing how this beast goes for you and checking where poachers usually set traps for another he replied i havent made my rounds for a few days theyve probably gotten bold he sent his horse a little ahead of her mule and turned down what looked like a game trail worn into the snow the mule followed the gelding without a qualm they rode in silence for some time erics horse was slowed to a walk by the snow and the mule was perfectly content to follow in its wake eric glanced back at her now and again to be sure she was keeping up but otherwise ignored her he was definitely looking for something though she couldnt tell what not that i would be likely to see anything even if i knew what to look for finally he must have seen it whatever it was he reined in his horse and jumped down out of the saddle he started to hand her the reins then must have thought better of the idea and tied them to the trunk of a tree then he was off forcing his way through the snow into the trees he came back a few moments later with a handful of what looked like thin wires which he coiled up and tucked into a small saddlebag snares he said by way of explanation and climbed into the saddle again ive never understood how a bit of wire was supposed to catch anything she said to break the silence as he started down the trail which now only he could see rabbits and hares make trails they follow otherwise its too much work for them to get through the snow when its deep enough they tunnel through it find the narrowest part of the trail just wide enough for the beast to get through make a noose of wire then tie it to a bit of twine or gut position it in the middle of that narrow part tie the gut to brush overhead or a stick you cut and ram into the snow or the ground use a couple of twigs to keep the noose in place and open then wait the beast comes along has to stick his head through the noose to get down the trail but the noose feels just like grass or twigs at first then it tightens on him he gets frightened tries to bolt thats all sometimes you can catch pheasants the same way they often use the same runs sometimes weasels sometimes foxes though foxes will generally break free and claw the noose off the rabbit strangles she asked a little taken aback by the matteroffact way he described it all or breaks its neck either way you have a rabbit and you dont have to hunt for it most poachers work that way its easy enough for even a woman to do thats why i thought you were a poacher there was amusement in his voice most of the women i catch poaching generally try to buy me off with favors and you let them she tried her best to keep any accusation out of her voice but she couldnt help the resentment that crept in depends on how hungry they look now he turned to look at her this is my duty you know i am supposed to keep poachers from hunting the woods bare to preserve the game for the landowner as it happened you are a skinny enough wench i thought you might need the meat i dont take anything they arent perfectly willing to part with the law allows me to whip them toss them in sebastians dungeon for a few weeks turn them in to the sheriff of the nearest city or use my own discretion depending on the sheriff they might get put in the stocks thrown in gaol get a branding on the face for rabbits or lose a hand for a deer he turned his attention back to the horse and the trail generally i dont actually catch the poacher i only find the snares she was shocked into silence by the litany of punishments shed had no idea how often do you turn poachers in to the sheriff she asked finally never came the laconic reply its almost half a days ride to the city and longer than that to walk since i sure as hell would not be putting a poacher on a horse its too much trouble sebastians dungeon is not an option easier to just to give them a couple stripes and scare them off or use my discretion i see she was torn if the law was that harsh shouldnt it be changed and how was he excused for taking advantage of women who were desperate and hungry enough to take the risk of poaching but if the law presented a worse punishment was he doing them a favor by allowing them to negotiate with the only thing they had to trade take this fellow i know him by his knots hes been setting snares here for six years and all i ever see are the snares he chuckled i have to admire him for his cleverness and stealth even while i despise him for stealing from the landowner put that way her thoughts were a tangle things had seemed so blackandwhite before its really no different from someone stealing a sheep or robbing apples from an orchard eric went on this forest belongs to someone so do the things in it if it were wilderness and unclaimed that would be different but its not we even allow people to collect windfall wood nuts berries and mushrooms and there are damn few landowners who will do that there are places where the penalty for picking up a few sticks for your fire is the same as taking a hare oh was all she managed to say heh not so cutanddried anymore is it he asked turning to look at her again a sardonic eyebrow raised im not a good man mademoiselle beauchamps i dont pretend to be but i dont take a hot iron and press it into a mans forehead because i find him with a dead rabbit they continued on in silence for a while eric stopped several more times bringing back handfuls of wire and twice a dead rabbit which he stowed in a larger saddlebag the mule behaved beautifully by now bella was completely lost if she hadnt had their trail to follow back she was sure she would never have been able to get out of the woods on her own finally eric looked up at the sun again and grunted time to turn around he said weve covered a lot of ground as much as i could have alone you and that beast are both steady if you promise not to try to go haring back to the city you can ride out alone any day you like as long as you keep to the road i dont suppose youd want to come out with me again looking for snares she asked it wasinteresting i learned a great deal that i didnt expect to which is a polite way of saying no there was something underneath the irony she couldnt tell what it was which is a polite way of saying when i get an astride saddle she found herself saying i felt as if i was going to fall off more than once and if you are going to cover rougher ground than this was or at a faster pace i dont want to try and keep up on this thing he turned to look at her with a face full of astonishment and laughed well mademoiselle beauchamps you do surprise me i can see why sebastian finds you interesting sebastian finds me interesting isabella she corrected we are going to be thrown together for the next three months so i do not see a point in being formal isabella then he looked up at the sky if we press on at a good pace we should be well in time for supper sapphire fussed over her until she changed into one of the new gowns and allowed the spirit elemental to put her hair up eric had given the rabbits to one of the other elementals with instructions to put them in the pantry and she was already planning what to do with them when she went down to supper both eric and sebastian were already there and already eating im sorry im late she said eric shrugged sebastian looked apologetic i skipped dinner and eric was as ravenous as a winterstarved bear sebastian said i didnt think you would mind you are the master here she reminded him you are the one who sets the rules eric snorted but said nothing it sounds as if that mule eric found is perfect for you sebastian continued as the servant set down the first course in front of her i think its safe enough for you to go harass the beast and see if shell bear your presence eric put in then you can go riding with the girl do you good to get your nose out of a book sebastian made a face but did not look displeased you sound like father and this is a surprise why eric countered sebastian looked away eric quickly finished eating and shoved away from the table i have a lot of territory to cover tomorrow he said the earlier i start the better i was glad to see you arent some sort of hothouse flower isabella my stepmother would say i am more like a weed she responded in the same spirit good night eric sebastian listened to this exchange with astonishment you two are getting along then he asked tentatively when eric was gone lets just say there seems to be a truce she replied he smiled well then its good news all around today the godmother has made arrangements so that you can write to your father and get letters in return he reached under the table and brought up a little carved wooden box just about the right size to hold a folded and sealed letter it was on condition that he wouldnt reveal anything about this of course but it seemed heartless to keep both of you so unhappy when something so small would help she took the box in both hands and found that those hands were shaking i dont know what to say i know this still doesnt change the fact that well we dont know what is going to happen to you and wont be sure for more than two months youve only been here a fortnight but he shrugged helplessly i think this will make you a little happier or him less worried which will make you a little happier i hope i think you are absolutely right she replied she opened the box it was empty and would hold no more than a few sheets of paper how does it work he has the same sort of box if either of you puts a letter in yours it will turn up in the other one you can only use it once a day thats how it works i dont know why it works it might use spirit or air elementals or something else entirely i didnt go poking around at it he grimaced its not a good idea to pry too deeply into godmotherly magic it tends to bite it doesnt like being meddled with i can imagine has father got his box yet she asked excitement filling her finally she had so much to ask him to tell him ive no idea but i am sure that the mirror will show you sebastian pointed out and when she hesitated he waved a hand at her go on you might as well go you are just going to sit there quivering wanting to see if you dont she scarcely waited for him to finish speaking before she ran off with the box literally ran the need to finally talk to her father was a terrible ache in her a literal physical ache she reached her suite and ran to the table uncovering the mirror with trembling hands the mirror seemed to respond to her urgency clearing immediately and showing her father at his desk a box identical to hers sitting in front of him he was staring at it with a strained look as if he was torn between hoping it was what he had been told and afraid that it was some terrible hoax she tore open the drawer of the desk in a frenzy getting out paper she practically spilled the ink in her haste to dip her pen and start the letter and she didnt even think about what she was going to say she just poured it all out onto the page page after page how sorry she was that she was causing him all this trouble and grief how much she apologized for putting herself in this situation how she missed him how she was watching him in her mirror what the godmother had told her what sebastian had told her that she was all right so far it wasnt terribly coherent and it was spotted with ink blotches and a few tears when she had finished everything that would fit into the box she folded the pages written on both sides and put them inside closing the lid and holding her breath in the mirror her fathers box suddenly glowed a soft yellow light he started and wrenched it open he pulled out the pages which so far as she could tell were hers and began reading them racing through them the first time then reading them more slowly a second time and then going over them practically word by word the third time his face was streaked with tears before he was through as was hers but he was smiling as well he looked up and the mirror view moved so that he was looking straight at her and blew a kiss into the air as he used to do when she was very small and he was going off to the warehouse for the day only then did he take pen to paper himself and slowly carefully as was so very typical of him begin his reply she watched and waited hands clenching a handkerchief that she had somehow gotten hold of as he wrote like her page after page like her on both sides finally he finished folded his missive carefully kissed it and put it in the box her box glowed she snatched it open she went through three more handkerchiefs crying as she read it certain things stood out more than others how were you to know that the woods you had crossed a hundred times held that kind of danger i certainly didnt know and supposedly i have the ear of the king it is not your fault if it is anyones fault it is the fault of those who thought that secrecy meant security and whatever happens i will stand by you and i will not permit my daughter to vanish as duke sebastian has vanished and nevertheless i still have faith that all will be well there was of course more much more there was a great deal of reassurance that she had not done anything wrong a wry reminder that things would be entirely different if she had disobeyed him but she had had his express permission to visit granny whenever she wished and that she had made her way home after darkness had fallen several times that he knew of that she did not need forgiveness since she had done nothing wrong it was everything she had hoped to hear and had feared she never would it was everything she needed to hear and finally the admonition that he wanted to hear what her day was like every day no matter how trivial it seemed and that he would tell her the same and then a final postscript after the salutation your loving father it is just as well that the godmother limits us to a single missive a day we would be able to keep up our chess games otherwise and without being distracted by your clever ploys i would finally have the chance to trounce you as completely as you deserve she didnt know whether to laugh or to cry so she did both sapphire had insisted that she have a long hot bath before she went to sleep the elemental even snatched away her nightgown and pushed her toward the bathing room when she woke in the morning she realized why her legs hurt of course they hurt she scolded herself youve never spent that long in a saddle before an hour or two at most nothing like that entire afternoon and in the cold as well she really didnt want to move but she knew that the only way to get her legs to stop hurting as much was to get up and start stretching in fact it hurt so much that she suddenly realized that her wounded foot had healed much much faster than she had expected it would and had not been bothering her for days was that a good sign or a bad one she forced herself out of bed now full of the urgent need to get to her mirror and try to speak with the godmother sapphire was right there with some of the liniment that she had made yesterday and it helped tremendously enough so that she could lean down and despite sapphire trying to prevent her from doing so she undid the bandages on the bitten foot and examined it critically to her intense relief the bite marks were still there healing but not unnaturally fast so why didnt it hurt except the moment she took the bandages off it started to what on earth she examined the bandages closely swatting away sapphires invisible hands as she tried to reclaim them were there marks on them she narrowed her eyes and let them unfocus a little because the marks were so faint otherwise that if she stared too hard they all but disappeared there were marks on them and they looked like letters and figures the same sort of things that were written within the circles on the floor of sebastians workroom are these bandages magic she demanded of sapphire allowing her to reclaim them at last sapphire didnt answer until she had gotten the foot rewrapped and the pain vanished again only then did she pick up the slate to reply yes she wrote duk and they were supposed to keep my foot from hurting well at least now she wouldnt have to bother the godmother yes she sighed and wished she could ask him for more to wrap her legs inbut no he had already told her that magic was difficult and expensive in that way she wondered just what the bandages had cost him in effort well all i can say is that i am grateful to him and i am glad i made this liniment smell as pleasant as i did with a suppressed groan she got out of bed and this time allowed sapphire to help her dress she was feeling more herself at the end of a productive morning in the stillroom with several things on sebastians list completed and more of the remedies most households needed restocked she was still moving a little stiffly though as she went down to dinner and found the duke and eric both there eric was as she was coming to expect almost finished with his meal he didnt seem to eat so much as inhale and she didnt think she had ever seen one man put away as much food into so lean a frame in her life sebastian looked alarmed at her stiffness but eric took it in and chuckled riding astride would have been easier he said you put twice the strain on yourself with that unnatural position oh i know she replied with a grimace every muscle told me about it this morning and i actually did have a hot soak before i went to bed sebastian looked blankly at the two of them for a moment then blinked and looked relieved oh youre saddle sore im sorry it will work out but eric i would really rather not accompany you on an allafternoon trek again until ive worked my way up to it she gave him a glare and you knew very well i was going to be hurting didnt you i didnt even know you were going to make it past the gates he replied when you did i didnt know if you would make it as far as the game trail then when you did well i had work to do a little soreness wont kill you i am greatly tempted to throw something at you she said crossly but sat down instead and applied herself to her dinner in that case ill get back to work in case you change your mind and hurl a plate at me he smirked at her then got up and left the table and the room i should have hurled a plate at him she grumbled after a moment sebastian chuckled eric has his moments he offered well i havent seen any she retorted how on earth did he ever get away with behaving like that when there were people here he didnt sebastian replied or rather he didnt behave like that at least i never saw him do so did your box work that put her back in her good mood oh yes she replied and beamed at him its hard to describe it makes such a difference just being able to let father know well everything and hearing back from him again sebastian looked wistful and a little melancholy i wish i had someone who would he began then broke off whatever he was going to say well never mind the important thing is that now both of you are easier in your minds did you have anything planned for this afternoon the question took her completely by surprise well i was going to continue to work in the stillroom but it is nothing i couldnt put off why i could use your help with some magic he said hesitantly something i am going to do to try and figure out about our mutual problem if you dont mind that is if i dont mind the chance to see some magic firsthand more than that something that might actually help them both try to stop me she replied firmly this isnt going to be very exciting sebastian warned as they climbed the stairs to his workroom most magic isnt really i hope you arent expecting all sorts of lights and colors and sparkly things id like it better if you would stop telling me what it isnt and tell me what it is she said but softened the rebuke with a smile unfortunately he was ahead of her on the stairs and didnt see it bother well what im going to do is find out if my bite set up an affinity between us he said sounding uncomfortable if it did then we need to be more worried about you changing if it didnt we can be less worried and whats an affinity she asked as they entered the room its its being related in some way like blood relatives here sit down would you he gestured to a chair and she obediently took a seat he went to a workbench and came back with a needle and a little swatch of linen she eyed both dubiously are you going to stick me with that she asked pointedly well erm yes he said i need blood if youve gotten infected the thing that makes the change will be in your blood you are not going to stick me with that she said firmly his face was a welter of confusion but you said i am going to stick me with that she plucked the needle out of his nerveless fingers youd be trying so hard not to hurt me that you would never get any blood at all steeling herself she jabbed the end of her pinky finger good and hard then squeezed up a little bead of blood and sopped it up with the square of linen he took both needle and linen from her with visible relief i still need your help he said sounding much more at ease now that the part that clearly made him feel acutely uncomfortable was over i need an extra pair of hands for the next hour or so she followed his directions as they simultaneously sprinkled various liquids and powders over the two bits of bloodstained cloth while he chanted under his breath finally he decreed the preliminary work done just what was that all about she asked well we already have some affinity and i just wanted to narrow it all down to whether or not we both have been contaminated by what makes the change we live in the same place right now we share meals we breathe the same air with something like this you have to be careful to exclude anything that might be a kind of contaminant you have to be very specific he picked up the squares of cloth in two sets of tongs obviously to avoid undoing all the work they had just done and placed them in the middle of the inscribed circle on the floor then he took four little pieces of brass from a drawer and set them into the circles only then did she realize that they had not been complete until he did that well he said now we see he said something aloud that she almost understood and when he did the two pieces of linen fluttered and moved closer together their edges just touched and then they stopped moving she waited but nothing more happened is that all she asked finally he let out his breath in a sigh wellcurses she felt a chill does that mean that i am infected her heart seemed to stop then it definitely began racing while her mind just froze no it means that either the spell didnt work or i forgot to eliminate something or or there is something here that i dont know about he replied visibly put out it means its inconclusive if you definitely had been infected and your blood was now the same as mine in that regard the two pieces of linen would have become one theyd have fused they moved together which means that we have something in common but i dont know what it is maybe you are infected but you arent so far gone that the spell actually worked the way it was supposed to maybe its something else maybe we are both passionate about the same something it could be anything from being so fond of macaroons that you crave them even at the mention of them to both of us having the identical ideals i dont know and there is no way to tell or it just could be that im not as good at this as i thought i was which is pretty likely the fear drained away mostly but was replaced by irritation i thought that magic obeyed rules well it does but i cant always tell whats going to interfere he snarled back losing his temper obviously something is but i dont know what and i corrected for everything i could think of but its not as if i know everything there is to know about you for all i know we could be related somehow id get the same sort of result if i did this test with eric that was when something inside her snapped she had been attacked kidnapped forced to live with the creature who had attacked her in the first place kept from communicating with her family and her family had been kept from knowing what had actually become of her and this was all at the orders of people who seemed to think that because they had rank and titles they knew what was best for everyone she had been patient she had been hideously lonely she was still afraid all the time she was just very good at keeping it under control she was never told what if anything anyone was actually doing about her problem she was supposed to take their word for it that they actually were doing something and not just giving her empty promises she was basically being treated as if she was a child in the nursery and the only reason so far as she could tell was because she was a commoner and a female so she turned on sebastian and let loose with all the anger and hurt and frustration and emotions shed been repressing for weeks it was almost worse now that people were actually telling her things because she had just enough information to be really terrified and when she finally ran out of things to say and he still hadnt responded she turned on her heel and stormed out she had not exhausted her anger she had only vented it how could she feel relief nothing had changed nothing would change she was still a prisoner here and she still had no idea if she was infected or not shed had her hopes raised then dashed she could even have distracted herself with her work in the stillroom and not gotten herself all worked up like this wasted the entire afternoon wasted because he couldnt do his job right she wasnt paying any attention to where she was going she just stormed through the murdercorridors and a succession of rooms without even looking at them until she finally ran out of anger and manor at about the same time she found herself in a large room mostly unfurnished with one wall of windows and one of mirrors it had a wooden floor with a satin finish not so highly polished that it was slippery but with a warm glow to it there were a few chairs ranged along the wall on the mirror side reflexively she went to the windows and looked out there was another of the courtyards not hers but that was all that she could say for sure what on earth was this room it wasnt in use the chairs were all shrouded in sheets what did anyone use a room this size for dancing that was as reasonable a thought as any only the very wealthy could afford to build a room just for dancing and other gatherings the proportions were a little odd however shed only seen two ballrooms before and they had been square this one was longer than it was wide well perhaps it wasnt used just for dancing not that it mattered now since even if sebastian was inclined to dance he wasnt going to be holding any parties though i really dont know why he couldnt she thought with renewed irritation he only has to be careful three days out of every month how difficult is that an idiot could make sure all the guests are gone in plenty of time of course there was the small matter of the invisible servants good heavens the man is a sorcerer hes expected to have bizarre servants people would be disappointed if he didnt theyd probably come to his affairs just to gawk to the attraction of a title add the exotic appeal of being a magician her stepmother and the twins would be over the moon and so would most of the people they knew the few who would not be well how would that matter to sebastian his position in society was assured by virtue of birth being a sorcerer alone would be excuse enough to keep people away on the full moon all he would have to do would be to mumble some nonsense about dangerous spells and end with and anytime i dont explode something or turn a bystander into a toad i take it as a good sign and no one would come within miles of redbuck manor on the full moon he could probably even arrange for something to explode rather messily during daylight hours if there happened to be a potential witness about just to lend verisimilitude why couldnt he think of these things for himself there was no earthly reason why he had to live out here like a hermit well unless he really wanted to there was that possibility he might just be using his condition as an excuse well fine then let him let him stay out here with no one but eric for company and the moment she knew she was not going to break out in hair and claws she was going home and she was not going to feel sorry for him and she was not going to look back she didnt even realize she was pacing up and down the room until sapphire stood right in front of her and she would have had to run the spirit elemental over to continue she stopped where she was reined in her temper and reminded herself that sapphire and the other spirit elementals had been nothing but kind to her hello sapphire was there something you needed me to know sapphire had her slate with her and she scratched something on it now that she had bellas attention musik what bella blurted in confusion are you asking me if i want to hear music why now u r in musik rum came the prompt reply this is was a music room now the shape of it made sense if you thought of it as a sort of theater with no seats and no stage and dancing and praktus fighting at bellas blank look sapphire added swords hmm maybe wealthy people didnt actually have whole rooms just for dancing it did make sense that if you needed a place to practice sword fighting indoors particularly with the lighter rapiers that were coming into use you would want something very like a room made for dancing to do it in and that wall of mirrors would of course reflect light coming in from the windows so there were no confusing shadows but sapphire was waiting very patiently for her reply and verte had said that some of the invisibles were musicians yes she said after a moment i would very much like to listen to some she didnt get a chance to finish the sentence one of the chairs was divested of its cover and was practically thrust underneath her so she had to sit down or fall down several more chairs were arranged in a little group in front of her and before she could take that in a harp a flute a bodhran drum and two fiddles came sailing into the room and perched above each of the chairs it was perhaps one of the strangest things she had seen since she arrived here then the invisible musicians began to play she hadnt been sure what to expect when verte had said the spirits were musicians she wasnt sure what kind of music that they would play and to be honest she wasnt sure whether or not they would actually be any good she had a good ear for music and she knew it and she was afraid that they might be terrible after all just because you were a magical being it didnt follow that you were any good at the sorts of things that humans did for that matter just because you were a human being it didnt follow that you were any good at being a musician but they were good not brilliant but quite good just as good as any of the musicians at the wool guild ball they played a mix of the sorts of pieces that she would have expected to listen to at a concert and dance music and eventually as her toes began tapping her evil mood got charmed right out of her its too bad we cant dance she said to sapphire wistfully the musicians paused she got the feeling that they were talking among each other even if she couldnt hear it sapphire began writing again wait she said just as she was beginning to get impatient a parade oflaundrycame wafting in that was her initial confused impression anyway eight shirts and sleeved tunics seven skirts or petticoats and bodices as they lined up she suddenly realized what this was these were her dance partners enough for two sets of four dancers she picked a floating tunic as her partner at random and the musicians struck up a running set as if they somehow knew this was her very favorite sort of dance she quickly got used to grasping invisible hands at the ends of sleeves she wished she could see the faces if they had any of her fellow dancers in order to know whether or not they were enjoying themselves but they did seem to be they were certainly enthusiastic and tireless as the light coming in the windows began to darken she finally called a halt to the fun she was actually starting to get a stitch in her side and was a little winded but the sore muscles shed had when shed awakened were quite worked out now thank you she said and applauded them all making a little curtsy toward her partners and a larger one to the musicians thank you so very much this was glorious can we do this again sapphire scratched on her slate evry day she laughed with glee then about this time for about two hours before supper yes and did all of you enjoy yourselves she persisted because she wasnt going to make this a daily exercise no matter how much pleasure she got out of it if they hadnt had fun too after her tirade at sebastian she was suddenly aware that if her lot was onerous how much more was theirs hard enough to be a servant but to be a servant who was treated as blockheadedly stupid and requiring no consideration at all poor thingsand she was not going to inflict something on them that they really didnt want to do but sapphires enthusiastic yes set her fears to rest wonderful she beamed at them thank you so very much again if something comes up and i am going to be involved in something else i will be sure to have sapphire let you know the clothing and instruments gave her a little bow and sailed out the farther door again she and sapphire took the nearer one back to her rooms where sapphire did her best with hair that had turned into a tumble of waves with a mind of its own when she came in to supper she was a bit surprised to find that she was there first this time while she wondered if she should wait for sebastian the duke came in and looked at her hopefully its all right i wont bite you she said with just a touch of sarcasm im back in temper again i heard the music and followed it to the mirror hall but you were so engrossed that i didnt want to disturb you he said a bit wistfully i didnt know they could do any of that the music and the dancing youve found out more of what they can do in a few days than i have in years you never asked them she reminded him applying herself to her soup even though her temper had settled she couldnt help stinging him a little vindictive bella she asked herself probably certainly a bit shrewish but she didnt want to get too comfortable in this role of prisoner because mule and freedom to ride it outside the manor notwithstanding she was still a prisoner here there was absolutely no doubt of that if she ever did try to ride away not only would eric an excellent tracker be on her tail in no time at all but godmother elena and probably the king would be told at once and she would be caught and probably locked into that pretty suite of rooms a gilded and comfortable cage is still a cage he regarded her with a faint frown i thought over what you said this afternoon some of it was very unkind it was meant to be she countered and youre right about how weve been keeping you in the dark and not telling you anything or at least i have he continued i expect if you ask the godmother shell tell you whatever you want to know i dont like to disturb someone that important she murmured he laughed ruefully oh dont worry if shes busy you wont get past that greenfaced mirror servant that acts as her gatekeeper he assured her if you think godmother elena is withholding anything from you you can just abandon that idea if she hasnt told you something its either because she hasnt had a chance yet or because she just doesnt have anything to tell and you i must say its embarrassing to meet you over supper every day and say well i got no results again today ive had a lot of failures my father always says that a failure is just the success of proving one way doesnt work she said tartly then your father is easier on himself than i am on myself but then if he slips up he isnt taking the chance of turning into a beast that will rip the throats out of innocent people sebastian retorted grimly and if you really want to know what i am doing all day i will be happy to tell you but it will likely be boring and involve a lot of not finding anything id like to know some she said after a moment of consideration you dont have to go into a lot of detail but i would like to know some then i promise ill tell you all that i know and dont know about our situation and ill help you however i can so you wont be dependent on me for all the answers maybe two of us can fail so much well be sure to find success it lacked three days to the full moon and bella was as tightly strung as a harp so when granny appeared at the front gate as she had promised bella ran down herself and practically collapsed on her with relief there was no sign of how granny had gotten there just the little old woman in her black cloak with a bright red knitted hat pulled down over her hair and ears and a matching scarf around her neck as bella fell into her embrace she noticed how soft the wool was which was a good thing as shed begun crying privately out of nerves again and her cheeks were sore now now the old woman said patting her on the back dont panic yet ive been looking into all this and i have come into some interesting theories she looked around as if to see whether there was anyone eavesdropping although the forecourt was completely empty even of the spirit elementals lets go somewhere we can be private the best place that bella could think of was the stillroom and she wanted to show granny the fruits of her labor anyway as soon as they entered the building one of the spirit elementals came to relieve granny of her black wool cloak granny peered at the creature narrowly as if she could actually see it interesting she murmured very interesting but she didnt elaborate and bella didnt expect her to granny would disclose things in her own time that was the prerequisite of a granny after all not just this granny but all grannies for that matter it seemed to be the prerequisite of just about any old person ive been here before but it was a long time ago she said quietly as they traversed all the murdercorridors and passed through chains of rooms ill show you something later if you like i assume you havent done much exploration only by accident bella admitted ive to be honest ive been busy the duke is teaching me magic i have been working in the stillroom i go riding in the mornings youre managing to distract yourself good no point in worrying until the full moon is over but once again bella caught granny glancing about when she said that now here is where i spend a great deal of time she said flinging open the door to the stillroom which was at the moment performing the function of its name as she was distilling some essences she had two small stills working with sapphire watching them both the air was fragrant with the faint scent of thyme and rosemary bella would have been annoyed if the scent had been any stronger the stuff was supposed to go into the bottle not the air granny this is sapphire she is my personal attendant bella said immediately sapphire this is the granny the slate rose quickly from where it was resting on the counter as sapphire snatched it up helo wize wun sapphire wrote and hello to you child granny said quite as if she was as used to conversing with invisible beings as she was with bella possibly she was would you be so kind as to leave us two in private and make sure we remain in private i feel sure i can entrust you with this i am certain that you are trustworthy but i have things to say to bella that are for her ears alone she smiled i suspect bella will tell you later at any rate thank yew wize wun sapphire wrote and the slate and ribbon whisked out the door then the door closed behind her granny looked about and her face showed her satisfaction youve done a fine job here child i dont think barring my own that i have ever seen a betterregulated stillroom bella rolled her eyes and took a seat on a stool leaving the real chair for granny you have no idea she described the state of the stillroom and storeroom as she had found them all i can assume is that sebastian set one of the elementals to collecting all the usual items and setting them to dry but never followed up on what to do with them once they were dried perhaps he didnt know himself most sorcerers are not supplied with a title and servants to make all these things for them but certainly sebastian was granny didnt immediately take a seat she poked through the cupboards looking at the supplies i can see some things are missing that id like to send you i can think of many things i would like to have she replied there are more complicated potions that i cant make because there are ingredients missing things i dont have the seeds for and that arent in the hothouse i can see that but this goes beyond what i have taught you granny moved to the next cupboard and waved a hand at bellas work this is well enough for simple household potions but not for what i and possibly sebastian and you are going to want to have here oh really bella raised an eyebrow it became apparent that granny was doing more than merely poking through the supplies she was looking for something she didnt find it but that seemed to give her some satisfaction all right i think we are safe and very private but i want to tell you this quickly because we may not be private for long despite the efforts of your little friend grannys lips thinned into a hard line i wont put up a protection against eavesdropping because that practically screams to any magician about that there is something being talked about that requires privacy right now we are just two insignificant females chatting in a stillroom bella nodded what is it then grannys eyes narrowed i have the advantage over elena of knowing sebastian his family and this part of the kingdom there is only one way that sebastian could have become a lycanthrope he was cursed bella started you are quite certain of that she asked it was one thing to have been told that a curse was possible it was quite another to be told that a curse was the only reason such a thing could have happened to sebastian curses were nothing to be trifled with oh people would joke about having been cursed but a real curse now that was the blackest of black magic even the deathbedcurse of an otherwise virtuous person because such a thing actually bound the spirit of the curser to the earth to make certain that the curse came to pass granny nodded elena and i are absolutely certain the magic is so insidious and so subtle that a curse is all that it could possibly be she could not be sure it was a curse when sebastian first changed but now with so much time having passed and a number of other interferences cleared out we have been able to make that much headway it is a very very subtle curse and a powerful one what we have not been able to determine is what sort of curse it is granny shook her head as bella nibbled on her fingernail uneasily the nature of curses is that they are so bound to the individual who is casting them that it is very hard to unravel them unless you know who the caster is and even then if the caster is dead it may be impossible to undo we are still left with a myriad of possibilities when it comes even to the nature of the caster the only thing we have absolutely eliminated are the true fae there is at least nothing about this curse that resonates with pure fae magic at the moment elena is consulting with some gods to find out if somehow sebastian fell afoul of one of their kind bell blinked did you just say gods she asked incredulously you are quite serious gods there really were such things outside of tales and myths granny waved her hand dismissively ill explain another time never mind that now suffice it to say that there are such creatures that mortals refer to as gods and they can lay terrible curses and great blessings with little more effort than you or i would take to light a candle if that was how sebastian was cursed that would be both good and bad good because it means that what a god put in place another god can lift bad because they dont like to do that undoing a curse that another god has placed can cause wars among gods and that is generally terrible for all the mortals anywhere about bella shuddered she had read enough of myths where the lives of gods were talked about but up until now she had thought they were just stories with no real basis in reality now she wondered how many of these socalled myths were actually as factual as any good history it was unnerving in fact it made her a little sick inside merely to contemplate it but granny smiled reassuringly now i dont think its a god we dont generally have gods hereabouts gods are generally not shy about making their presence known and even when they are in disguise they create omens and portents all about them there werent any omens and portents and i would think that if sebastian had done something to get himself cursed by a god he would remember it i know i would bella murmured dazedly considering that in tales at the least the uttering of a curse by a god comes with great bolts of lightning and enough thunder to deafen you now to get to the point so far as you are concerned granny continued her old eyes regarding bella keenly the good news for you is that since we are sure this is a curse it is as i think elena explained to you extremely unlikely that you will be infected and become a wolf yourself you are sure bella asked very only bloodcurses can turn someone into the infective type of werewolf and again if someone had leveled a bloodcurse on sebastian trust me he would remember granny nodded its rather difficult to miss someone heaving a cup of wolf blood at you or painting signs on your door with wolf blood bella felt her heart racing does that mean i can go home as soon as the full moon is over she asked breathlessly but to her vast disappointment granny shook her head no the king is insisting on the full three months we tried to talk him into being reasonable but he wouldnt hear of it granny made a face stubborn wretch mind you i can sympathize i understand in this instance why he wants to be absolutely certain but i am still annoyed so what does this mean really then bella asked her heart sinking again if the king wont let me go and im a prisoner here for the three full months mostly that you arent going to have to invest in silver chained bracelets you silly girl so get that heartbroken look off your face granny snapped huzzah you are not going to break out in teeth and fur i should think that would be excellent news for you but she tried not to wail but her voice crept upward anyway i want to go home and i want a palace and a handsome young prince who has an unnatural lust for old women and neither of us are going to get what we crave so lets concentrate on what we can do something about granny said sharply bella hung her head feeling suitably rebuked really she had just been told that she wasnt going to become a monster after all and she should be hugging granny in gratitude granny seemed to see what she was looking for in bellas chastised expression how are your magic studies coming with sebastian bella bit her lip its not unlike what you were teaching me there are a lot of formulas and well i think of them as recipes there is one thing though i think i can see magic power he said i might start to be able to and i think i can its like dust motes in sunlight only it flows in little trickles and streams really that is a good sign granny nodded approvingly i thought you might have the talent buried in you but it looked to me that you were going to be a late bloomer and i was afraid it was going to wait to wake up until you were old enough to be a granny yourself waitthat can happen she asked somehow shed had the impression that magicians were magicians almost from birth its complicated granny demurred there are things i cant talk to you about that you will have to hear from elena after i am gone use the mirror to talk to her tell her what we talked about ask her questions now about this curse as i said it is subtle it is powerful and it seems to be almost the only thing that the caster has ever done she drummed her fingers on the arm of her chair while she thought think of magic as being like water its always about but you have to work very hard to gather enough of it in one place to do anything with under most circumstances now you can spend your water in little dribbles at a time and if you are clever about it you can do quite impressive things with just a drop or two or if you are patient and sufficiently motivated you can save up your water for a very very long time and do something really big with it if you are clever and crafty part of that can be using the water to erase the signs of what you have done and who did it and that we think is exactly what happened sosomeone planned this for a very long time she hazarded if it is not a godcurse yes granny nodded we think it took several years to plan and at least one entire year to execute now what does that say to you her mind leapt through a myriad of possibilities before immediately settling on two that either it was someone who was plotting a long and complicated revenge or someone who stood to gain a very great deal by putting sebastian out of the way without killing him good now the revenge could not possibly be on sebastian himself because he would have been a boy when it was first planned granny waited so it would have had to have been revenge on sebastians father if the man hadnt already been dead it would have killed him to see his heir become a werewolf and it would have been worse if it had been the father that had to kill the son even as bella voiced that she could see in her imagination what a perfect and horrible revenge it would be if sebastian had killed someone the old duke would have had no choice he would have had to exact justice on his own son doesnt that suggest a motive she asked someone maybe who blamed the old duke for the death or loss of his own son or hers granny reminded her its a perfectly reasonable motive for a woman too and women are exceptionally good at hiding it when they come into power right now that is the line of pursuit that elena and i are taking it means a lot of tedious work but we are pursuing that line first not only because it seems the most likely but because it is the one sort of curse that would have an infection component to it revengecurses are always bloodcurses so if you do make the change in three days well be that much further along in finding the way to undo it all and if you dont become a wolf it will mean it is less likely that it is a revengecurse she grasped at that so you can undo it probably we just have to know who set it and get an idea of how it was set granny reached out and patted her hand its only the true werewolf infection that we can control but not cure and only a godcurse or one set by a person now dead that we cant undo so long as the mortal is still alive anything a mortal has cast a godmother can undo eventually what if its someone who stood to gain she asked the godmother spoke to me about that she speculated it was someone who was trying to work out how to do this on more prominent people and sebastian was the first experiment does that count i should think it would but the fact that no one else has turned up with this cast on him argues against personal gain as in discovering a way to make someone a lycanthrope and profiting by it granny shook her head to be honest personal gain out of sebastian or his property does not seem in the least likely to us theres no one with a strong claim to the dukedom and nobody has suggested sebastian is incompetent as they surely would have if they wanted this land this is an insignificant dukedom and so far no one actually has gained anything from incapacitating sebastian still it doesnt pay to rule it out and that is where you come in me bella wasnt sure how to react to that but what can i do the gain might not be the obvious thing considering the title and the lands the next in line seems uninterested it might be something as subtle as the curse itself perhaps sebastian was a rival for some choice heiress perhaps someone considered him a magical threat perhaps his influence was rising at court granny shrugged you are here with him and in the best position to draw him out get him to talk about the past before he changed what he can tell you might hold clues to both the revenge motive and the personal gain motive she sighed the lad is charming but although he is very observant when it comes to figuring out that someone might have a hidden agenda he is as dense as a stone you on the other hand have been negotiating the dangerous waters your stepmother tries to swim in and keeping her and the twins off the sharp rocks for some time now i have great confidence that if there is anything there to be spotted you will do so privately bella was far from certain of that but that was when granny gave her a little sign of warning and switched to the discussion of the things she would be sending bella and the various tinctures and potions and essences that she expected bella to make and there was no chance to discuss it all further at grannys suggestion they moved the discussion out of the stillroom i promised to show you something granny reminded her i dont know how much relevance this is going to have but well who knows you might learn something with those enigmatic words it was granny who led the way into part of the manor that bella hadnt been to before eventually she stopped at one of those deadend antechambers that had two doors opening into it granny opened the righthand one first the room was dark curtains drawn and it smelled as if it hadnt been opened in a long time granny went to the window and pulled the curtains aside this was clearly the room or suite of a woman it looked as if it was still lived in there was not even any dust this was the duchesss suite granny announced sebastians mother she was only twentythree when she died and neither she nor the old duke were much interested in court the other suite was the dukes sebastian didnt take over his fathers rooms that was interesting well now that you know theyre here you might find something that has a bearing on the curse id look here before i looked in the dukes room the old fellow wasnt much for introspectionor for that matter observation granny shook her head lucky for sebastian he admired in his son what he didnt have himself intelligence cleverness thoughtfulness all too often thats not the case do you think sebastian would mind if i went looking in here oh grannys wry expression told her what she should have thought of i shouldnt tell him for all we know whoever set the curse has some way of spying on him and what you tell him the spy could learn granny gave her ear a mock cuff you need to start thinking like a sly old woman girl time for you to start exercising your guile assume the enemy is either here or has a way of knowing what is going on here yes granny bella promised well it wasnt as if she wasnt used to practicing guile how much had she kept from genevieve all right then time for me to be off keep your chin up girl no matter what your old granny is looking out for you the simple words gave bella a measure of comfort the godmother might think of her plight as trivial compared to the fate of kingdoms and it was but granny would put bella first and in a fight against almost anything bella would bet on granny bella and sapphire saw her to the gate how are you going to get back bella worried its a long way from here to your cottage but granny just chuckled youll see she said enigmatically and when they reached the gate to bellas astonishment there was a sled nicely appointed with plenty of fur robes and blankets with the ugliest little horse she had ever seen in her life harnessed to it there were no reins and that alone would have told her that this whole rig was somehow magical even without the horse turning his head to give her an obvious wink sapphire helped the old woman into it and tucked the furs around her granny chuckled its blessed useful to be a godmothers friend sometimes so it seemed for as bella watched the sled move off without any guidance from granny at all it seemed to disappear unnaturally fast down the road as if the sled was going at a much faster pace and for a much longer distance than bella knew was possible it was such an unnerving sight that it made her insides feel a bit uneasy mirror she thought as she went inside this all definitely calls for the mirror the greenfaced person in the mirror regarded her benignly i regret to say that the godmother is busy at the moment and lest you garner the impression that i am putting you off let me assure you that her physical presence is required at a royal christening in order to avert what will certainly be a hideous curse she has taken her hand mirror with her and as soon as she speaks with me i shall tell her of your request i will ascertain if you are in the presence of this mirror when she can reply to you and if you are you will hear this a silvery bell tone broke the silence otherwise please try when you next can the face smiled at her she smiled tentatively back once you got used to the fact that it was green she did instruct me to give you some advice she suggests that you cultivate the gamekeeper eric i believe cultivate the gamekeeper why that seemed odd eric is older than sebastian he has also been in a unique position to observe matters within and without the old dukes household neither a servant nor an acknowledged family member he may well have seen things that escaped the old dukes attention he managed the affairs of the estate very well as sebastians guardian and has continued to do so as sebastians proxy so he is scarcely the crude and unlettered woodsman that he would like people to think that he is the green face raised an eloquent eyebrow the godmother believes he can be an important ally for you but it will take some skill to manage this she bit her lip managing her stepmother and the twins was one thing their interests were limited and as long as those interests were satisfied it was relatively easy to get them to do what she wanted or rather to refrain from doing what she didnt want them to do but no she was fairly certain he would see through any attempt to manipulate him you know the face continued giving her a very penetrating look he might just respond to the offer of friendship she almost laughed out loud eric thatrake he would probably take any such offer as an invitation to her bed still if the godmother thought it would be a good idea ill try she said the face seemed satisfied as soon as your mutual circumstances allow the godmother will be happy to consult with you mademoiselle i pledge you that since that seemed to be all that could be said at the moment she nodded and thanked him the mirror clouded then reflected only her face there was still time she might actually catch eric at the stable before he came looking for supper she filled a basket with the sorts of things she thought he might want syrup for sore throats and coughs willow syrup for fever and headache a different sort of liniment one that warmed instead of cooling salve for wounds ointment for wintercracked skin she threw on her cloak and hurried down to the stable and did indeed catch him just coming out i wasnt sure youd be at supper so i wanted to be sure you got these things she said handing the basket toward him he took it looking very much surprised then pulled out a bottle and read the carefully printed label very useful he said without any of his usual sarcasm thank you she shrugged i havent labeled anything yet and i know where everything is but no one else does i hate making out the labels its tedious as bad as making out invitations he laughed well thank you because i was not planning on coming in to supper tonight too much to do three days to the full moon and ill be going right back out as soon as i get a bite to eat is there any way i can help she asked obeying an impulse she didnt quite understand he stared at her thoughtfully can you shoot a crossbow he asked i can look as though i can shoot a crossbow she replied that might be enough yes you can help mind this will be hard riding not fast but over difficult terrain that mule of yours will actually be ideal for such a rough patch im going after someone who has been aggressively persistent in setting traps ive destroyed them three times in a row and he hasnt given up i expect an actual confrontation he eyed her speculatively i found and refurbished an astride saddle and i would imagine that some of sebastians old clothing would fit you bundled up youll look enough like a man to be of some use if only as a distraction me alone they might attack two men probably not and even then their attention will be divided he tilted his head to one side think you have the stomach for it i can try she said as forthrightly as she could this isnt exactly anything ive done before honest answer good well try it in the afternoon tell your invisibles to round you up some riding boots and sebastians old hunting clothes from when he was about seventeen nobody ever throws anything away in this place he snorted she grimaced as well i know the stillroom looked like a mouse nest right then be ready at dinner that will be early enough and thanks for this he raised the basket to her and strode off she watched him go then returned slowly to the shelter and warmth of the manor did i just manage to make an overture of friendship maybe not friendship cooperation though certainly and there had been nothing in his attitude to suggest he was going to try to take advantage of her now at least anyway she thought with just a touch of cynicism after well well see wont we the hunting clothes that sapphire had brought to her and somehow though invisible the spirit elemental had managed to convey absolute disapproval even as she helped bella into them were astonishingly comfortable so comfortable in fact that bella found herself trying to think of ways that she could slip the outfit into her baggage when she returned home again and into her wardrobe without her own servants knowing she had them scandalous of course a woman wearing mens clothing no wonder sapphire was appalled this was worse than those dismayingly practical gowns she had brought with her the hunting clothes were fundamentally identical to the outfits that eric wore definitely clothing made for rough weather and hard terrain she loved them completely loved them perhaps best was the freedom of movement the outfit granted her it was a simple set of clothing brown leather breeches that were somehow both strong and as soft as velvet a shirt of some lightweight material that could not possibly be wool but was just as warm over which she wore a sleeved tunic of the same leather as the breeches no three or four petticoats corset corset cover bloomers stockings garters underdress overdressthis was something that sapphire really had not needed to help her into but she hadnt liked to swat the servants hands away matching gloves lined with mink fur kept her hands warm and if the riding boots were rather too big three pairs of soft thick stockings solved that little problem and she wore a hooded coat lined in beaver rather than a cloak which was infinitely more practical both on horseback and in the woods her hair had been tightly braided and coiled on the top of her head then hidden under a peculiar sort of closefitting cap almost like a hood that fastened under her chin like the sort of closefitting cap or bonnet that one tied over a babys head only made of leather and lined with more mink fur she had pulled the hood of her coat over that and fastened it tightly at the throat with a strap and a toggle eric of course wore his peaked hunting hat but she would never have been able to hide her hair under such a thing besides she couldnt imagine how he kept his ears from freezing off under such inadequate protection then came the matter of riding she was not so used to riding that riding astride rather than aside felt all that peculiar to be absolutely honest the farther they went the better it felt the mule didnt seem affronted by the different shape of the saddle either nor the fact that her legs were on either side of it she could actually grip the sides of the beast rather than squeezing her legs desperately into the pommel and hoping she could stay on eric kept his horse moving briskly and the mule kept up without any concern on her part it had been a gray and overcast morning but the clouds were breaking up as they left by the time they turned off the welltraveled track the sky was cloudless though the air seemed a good deal colder and she was glad of that furlined coat there was a crossbow in a sheath at the front of the saddle and a quiver of arrows beside it she hoped she wouldnt have to bluff with it but eric had showed her how to pull and load it and it was a great deal easier to handle than she had thought it would be provided of course she didnt fumble the arrow she was trying to load the change in her garb had wrought an odd sort of change in eric there was nothing at all in his manner now toward her that suggested anything sexual there was nothing condescending either it was as if in his mind she actually had become the boy she was dressed as and that was curiously liberating he was calling her abel a deliberate transformation of bella which she thought was rather clever this was certainly a side of eric she had not seen before and to tell the truth she liked it abel come up here he said turning his head to look back down the trail at her obediently she urged the mule up beside his horse this was brutal country the part of sebastians lands where the tin mines were he had explained rough hills thickly covered with trees and underbrush not much use for grazing even for goats the few farmers here scratched out such a precarious living in the valleys that according to eric their rents were a mere token once a year a quart of the truffles that were the only things that thrived here or a month of labor on the roads there were a few jobs for humans in the mines but not many the mines were owned and excavated by dwarves who were so much better than humans at such things that there really was no point in competing with them there was some logging but the dukes had been very careful about these forests some overambitious logging had led to the loss of entire hillsides she saw as she reached his side that they had come to the top of a ridge that rose even higher to their left although the trees were so thick here she could not actually see the hilltop itself through the haze of leafless branches but from where they perched the land fell away quickly so the valley was visible below them there were very few evergreens here mostly it was oak beech and chestnut and their branches looked like a gray smoke covering the valley it was difficult to believe there were any humans living out here it was deeply shadowed already the sky had darkened to a deep blue except to their left where the last rays of the sun streaked the west and it suddenly occurred to her that she knew exactly where she was they were in the midst of the hills she had seen on the horizon rising above the forest in the distance every time she had been somewhere she could look over the city walls why had she never wondered whose lands they were or what they hid because it never occurred to me that i could climb them myself one day what a peculiar feelingto realize how narrow her world had been the city and not even most of it just the parts that held the guildhalls the homes of the people she visited the shops she needed her fathers warehouse and a little little bit of sebastians forest and she had never lifted her eyes past that how much had she missed down there our poacher traps that entire valley eric was saying now as i told you the land hereabouts is pretty poor its mostly no good for the sort of hunting that the gentry do except if they want the challenge of a boarhunt and its been on the orders of the last several dukes that if the people hereabouts want to take a few fish from the stream wild goats from the hills and rabbits and boar from the forest they may do so the dwarves mine the tin so aside from a penscratcher or two and a few mechanical fellows theres no wages for a man in the mines and all the folk here have is what they can scratch out of the dirt cut down and haul away and catch sebastian said nothing was to change and sent out word of that when he came of age as keeper of these forests i abide by what he says and this makes sense i dont hold with making a man desperate purely because it isnt practical the most dangerous man there is is the one whos got nothing to lose i can tell when games getting thin i give out a few warnings people move to another valley for a while for their hunting and until now everyones abided by the rules she nodded silently that was just good common sense the sort that the king exercised all the time and encouraged his judges to use but this fellow eric spat in disgust hes a disgrace hes not a poacher hes a butcher he traps anything and whatever he traps he skins and takes only the hide leaves the carcass to rot hes trapped out three valleys so far and if i dont stop him he wont stop till hes trapped out the forest and then what will the folks here do for a bit of extra meat theyll say its the dukes men who took all the game and never mind sebastian hasnt any men she nodded again so thats why were here i know he runs these traps just before sunset counting on me wanting to be back behind the manor walls by then i can see three of those traps from here and when he turns up well have him can he see us from down below she whispered he grinned without looking at her if he could we wouldnt be here well hes the gamekeeper and there he is she looked where he was looking peering down into the shadows down through the mist of barren twigs it was only by the furtive movement that she saw him if indeed it was a man slipping through the underbrush and then pausing the only reason she could see him at all was that he was dark against the white snow if it had been summer and all those trees and bushes thick with leaves he would have been as invisible as her servants hell be busy for a while that trap has a mink in it and he wont want to spoil a hide that valuable eric breathed now follow me but stay a good fifteen lengths or so behind me if he has friends i want you to be a complete surprise eric eased his horse down the hill when he was far enough ahead that the only thing she could see in the deepening shadows was the darker shadow of the moving horse she followed the mule wasnt happy about going downhill in such uncertain light but she picked her way down the slope anyway bella had no real idea of how far down the hill their quarry was until suddenly erics voice rang out in the cold air hold in the name of duke sebastian his voice crackled with authority which their quarry did not seem impressed by duke sebastian aint here the poacher replied sounding as calm as if he and not the duke was the rightful owner of these lands and you can kiss my butt eric the gamekeeper brave words for a man with an arrow pointed at his heart eric retorted man doesnt have to be brave when his partner has a knife to your partners throat what she thought and that was when something dropped out of the tree above her landed behind her on the mule with a jolt that shook them both and grabbed her from behind before she could catch her breath be very quiet laddie said a voice in her ear as she felt the cold edge of a blade press into her throat a mules reaction to something unexpected was to freeze with all four legs planted which this time was not in the least useful her captor had plenty of time to wrap the arm that did not have a knife at the end of it around her pinning her upper arms to her chest terror hit her like lightning and just as in the forest when the wolf had begun chasing her she acted without thinking her captors arm didnt quite reach all the way around her she wrenched her right arm free but instead of going for the unfamiliar knife at her belt she grabbed for the quiver somehow she got a crossbow quarrel in her hand and she jabbed behind her with it the man screamed a curse as she hit something some part of him with the arrowhead he flinched away she felt him start to lose his balance and she shoved harder with another screech he fell off the mule and she jabbed the point of the arrow into the mules haunches not hard but enough to hurt and that combined with the mans shrieks was too much for the mule she half reared but couldnt get too far up on her heels just enough so she could pivot and bolt back the way they had come she dropped the arrow and the reins and hung on to the front of the saddle with both hands for dear life branches lashed her face cutting her like whips until she crouched down and hid her face against the mules neck she cried with pain and fear but when the mule faltered she grabbed another quarrel from the quiver and lashed her with it goading her into running again only when she came to a shuddering halt sides heaving head hanging did she let her be that was when she raised her face from her neck and saw that the forest around them was nothing but a confusing blur of dark blue shadow and the black trunks of trees she had no idea where she was she slid down off the mules back into the snow scooped up some of it in her glove to apply to the burning welts across her face and listened as hard as she could she thought she heard the echo of mens angry voices in the distance but she couldnt tell the echo from the original they could be behind her or in front of her the mules sides slowly stopped heaving she patted her neck and clambered awkwardly back into place it would be an hour maybe more until the moon rose but even then that would be no help what had her father said when she first started to visit granny if you get lost dont wander stay right where you are the more you wander the more lost you will become and the more tangled your trail wander too far and your trail will be lost and by the time trackers find you it might be too late but was that wise advice to follow when there was someone back there who had put a knife to her throat what if he found her she shook with terror and cold as the sweat of fear chilled on her body and when she heard branches cracking behind her just as the moon came over the top of the hill she had only enough presence of mind to look back even as her hand reached for another crossbow quarrel to beat the poor mule with but the mule stretched her head and neck around and gave a pathetic bray which was answered by an equally pathetic nicker and the dark shape that came toward them was far too big to be a man afoot eric she called her voice strained i dont know how you got that mule to run like a racehorse but im glad you did came the grimly humorous reply clearing off as you did gave me a free hand she didnt ask him what he meant by that the mule shied a little as it scented what she did on him fresh blood two untrained curs against me was no odds for them he continued though you did half my work for me with the second i ssstabbed him with an aaarrow she stammered teeth chattering good thinking or good reacting if you didnt think he was bleeding like a lanced stag when he came at me hed have done better to run the horse came up alongside the mule and the two beasts nuzzled each other in relief at finding their stablemates are you hurt nnno she gulped back tears a llittle by now the moon shone down through the branches and he reached over to tilt her chin so it shone down on her face ah didnt tuck your head down he said with gruff sympathy thatll hurt all right wait a moment he rummaged into his saddlebag and came up with a jar pulling out the cork he handed it to her and she caught the familiar scent of one of her ointments she took it from him with shaking hands pulled off one glove with her teeth and dug two fingers into the jar as she smeared on the ointment the burning of the lash marks began to cool you need to have a good cry eric asked in a conversational tone i i dddont know then swallow it down for a bit he advised or just let it leak as we ride ive got a few scratches to tend to and youll be feeling like you want to faint before long once all of this catches up with you he uttered something like a chuckle hellfire so will i or at least sit down on something that isnt moving he urged his horse ahead of her mule and took the lead she didnt have to nudge the mule she followed without any signal from her she shivered inside her furlined coat gulping down tears mind going numb and yet spinning with horrid images the strange feeling as the arrow in her hand hit something solid how badly had she stabbed the man badly enough to have killed him if eric hadnt the dreadful feeling of the knife at her throat and the grim certainty that she was going to die that was twice now once when the wolf had attacked her and now this the sick feeling knowing that eric had killed both those men yes the men would have killed them without a moment of hesitation but still they were dead now and she and eric were alive she could still smell the blood on him oh god what if that meant she was getting the senses of the wolf had she escaped the knife only to fall to a worse fate she shivered and cried silently and clung to the mule as it shoved its way along the trail she had never felt so cold before and lightheaded her fingers dug into the leather of the front of the saddle erics voice penetrated her fog you did very well back there no fainting no hysterics she had to gulp three or four times before she could make her voice work and still it shook it wwas by accidddent again that grim chuckle either youre lucky or you have good instincts for now dont faint on me came the voice from ahead its not that far it isnt hope finally made her raise her eyes and she realized she must have been in more of a fog than she had thought they were out of the hills and there was light off ahead through the trees the mule seemed to realize this at the same time she did she felt her startle a little beneath her legs and her weary shuffle turned into a fast walk she blanked out a bit then for the next thing she knew invisible hands were helping her out of the saddle and the mule was being led away erics arm around her shoulder steadied her for a moment as she wavered you were fine back there he said in her ear his arm feeling like nothing but that of a friend i was the one who was an idiot i didnt check to see if there were any of the bastards lurking in the trees an amateurs mistake if you hadnt kept your head wed have both been in trouble he gave her shoulders a squeeze and chastely kissed her forehead between two of the lines of lashing faugh that ointment tastes like pine sap and i stink of blood we both need baths food and sleep blood you can smell the blood she asked he snorted of course i can im soaked in it what did you think you suddenly had a wolfs nose he squeezed her shoulders again then let go of her you lot get her to her rooms get her in a hot bath and bring her a good meal and a good stoop of brandy with it with that the spirit elementals took over all but carrying her off to her rooms where sapphire stripped her out of her clothing and popped her into that hot bath before she could even say a word bella just leaned back and soaked feeling the heat penetrate all the way to the chill core she had thought she would never get warm a touch on her arm made her jump and she flailed for a moment her eyes snapping open to see a tray of food being set down on the rim of the bathtub it was full of little bitesize things bits of baked squash chunks of sausage pickles slices of beef cubes of cheese for a moment her stomach churned with nausea but then the nausea turned to hunger and she reached out and took a bit of cheese and then a pickle then some rare beefand before long the tray was empty and sapphire was pressing a small glass filled with an amber liquid into her hand she tasted it it was like sweet fire shed had brandy before but this was different it went down as smooth as honey and ended up like a comforting coal in the middle of her thawing the last of the cold in her center warmth spread and with it a light and fuzzy feeling sapphire helped her out of the tub her legs felt a little wavery as if the bones werent quite solid and she realized that she was just a little drunk the spirit elemental wrapped her in a soft robe sat her down beside the fire and brushed out her hair then loosely braided it again as she stared at the flames she wondered if she ought to be crying again after all two men had died today and she had been partly responsible but she couldnt make her mind wrap around that and she felt at once too tired and too drained to care when sapphire was done with her hair she tugged at bellas arm and bella rose and let the servant lead her to the bed she climbed in and lay down closing her eyes she felt the featherlight touch of something on her face and dimly realized that sapphire was putting some sort of ointment on her wounds but at that point the only thing that mattered was sleep and she let it take her she was very glad that the mirror was oneway her father would have been horrified if he had seen her face it looked as if someone had been whipping her although sapphire assured her that everything would heal without leaving a mark she had only told him in this mornings letter that she had been out on a long ride into the mining country with erics escort and that it had been interesting to see the hills she had only glimpsed from the city she knew that since her father was widely traveled he would have a lot to say on the subject and that seemed safer than giving him an opening to ask too many questions she hadnt gone down to breakfast she had written a note for the servants to take to sebastian explaining what had happened a note had come back from him assuring her that eric had already told him in detail about the ambush and her part in it and that she should rest if she thought she needed to but he added in his note that if she didnt think she required rest he would welcome her company in his workroom this afternoon for another lesson she had expected the former but not the latter and she felt a rush of unanticipated affection for him he wasnt coddling her or treating her like a fragile little child he also wasnt taking her for granted assuming that she would simply turn up as expected for her lesson in magic simply because he was duke sebastian and she should be grateful for his tutelage not that she wasnt gratefulshe was he was a very good teacher she had to wonder now who had taught him because in her experience it took a good teacher to make a good teacher she watched her father mime his farewell kiss as he did when it came time that he had to get back to work and the image of his study faded from the mirror she was about to get up and see about a better ointment for her stripes when the mirror suddenly chimed the godmother appeared immediately in the depths as soon as she picked it up elena stared at her for a moment dumbfounded as she took in the state of bellas poor face by all that is holy your face if either of those men the godmother began her face twisting into a mask of outrage no i mean yes but not in the way you think bella said hastily and explained what had happened elena listened without interrupting her anger calming as quickly as it had arisen then pursed her lips thoughtfully well she said this is unexpected i hope it doesnt hurt too much bella grimaced which of course made her face hurt oh it does but not as much as being bitten on the foot elena gave an unladylike snort well on the one hand you were not nearly in as much danger as eric would have liked you to think the godmother said cautiously even if the poachers took you for a young man you were extremely well dressed and they probably thought you were a noble at the least and sebastian at the best one doesnt kill a rich prize like that in either case they were not going to spoil what would have been a very lucrative kidnapping by slitting your throat bella was taken a little aback oh she said feeling deflated and now guilty because if she had not been in danger of her life then those two men had been killed over nothing eric however was completely expendable and theyd have gutted him without a moment of hesitation then sent his body back on his horse as a token that they were in earnest the godmother continued as calmly as if she was discussing whether fish or soup would be a better first course at dinner so i must say you did well in keeping your wits about you she leaned over and said something to someone who was out of sight of the mirror as soon as my assistant returns with it ill push a pot of one of my salves through the mirror to your side by tomorrow you wont have so much as a pink mark youll what push something through the mirror you can do that bella tried not to gape with surprise and travel through mirrors as well yes when i need to the godmother made a dismissive motion godmothers can thats another subject you can see magic of course granny must have told her granny probably had one of these mirrors too it was no wonder the greenfaced thing answered instead of elena the godmother would likely spend every waking moment talking to mirrors if she didnt have someone to act as a secretary for her bella nodded it looks likelike glowing dust motes or maybe like streams of smoke in bright sunlight because there are streams and trickles and threads of it she groped after words to describe what she could see but elena just nodded well this is an unexpected development i must say the godmother told her with a sigh not entirely unwelcome butit does complicate things the granny of your woods and i had thought you were going to be a very late bloomer and come into your power with your gray hair but it seems your story just took a different turn you expected this she felt her mouth falling open and snapped it shut of course magic generally runs in families your mother had a touch and she would have been a witch sebastians mother had it thats why you feel so at home in her stillroom his father did too but the old fool kept trying to repress it thats why sebastian is as good as he is he got a double dose she looked a little annoyed for a moment and tapped one finger on the table in front of her well there is no help for it i am going to have to tell you about the tradition the tradition of what bella asked when the godmother didnt continue not the tradition of not that kind of tradition the tradition the force that makes puppets out of us all the godmother smiled grimly or it tries at least and so as bella sat there feeling more and more stunned by the moment godmother elena explained that everything she had thought she had known about how the world wagged was wrong as elena related calmly and clearly that she and everyone else in the five hundred kingdoms was being manipulated by a force that had will but no intelligence bella could not believe that the godmother could relate all this so calmly this tradition it was a horror a mindless pressure on every living thing to fulfill particular roles roles that were dictated by stories she repeated feeling a mix of shock outrage disbelief and a growing anger elena nodded her own expression one of acute sympathy its hideous she agreed completely unfair just because people start telling each other tales over a fire why should that mean that ten years later some poor lad or wench finds him or herself playing that tale out again but that is exactly what happens but what happens if the people arent what the story says for instance what if a stepmother is kind or at least not unkind does she get forced into being a viper bella wanted to know because if that was trueit would explain quite a bit about genevieve or for instance what if the poor abused stepdaughter lives in a kingdom with no free prince elena countered and then she proceeded to tell bella exactly what happened to a girl in that position and so basically with all that traditional power building around her trying to force her into a path it either has to get drained off harmlessly so she can live a normal life or something drastic will happen to her and it generally isnt pleasant more often than i care to think about that something drastic comes in the form of an evil magician and at that point the best she can hope for is to be kidnapped and locked up to serve as a sort of well magical wellspring but were getting off the subject and i will be happy to go on about this in detail later the point here is this keeping these nasty things from happening and arranging matters so that people can go back to having ordinary lives is what godmothers do oh bella thought about this for a long time elena waited patiently you wouldnt be telling me this now unless you saw a potential for a bad outcome wellwhat story am i being forced into she wanted to know after a very long moment while she sorted through the hundreds of questions she wanted to ask no wait let me guess the monster in the labyrinth no although that is a good guess sebastian would be both the magician that created the maze and the monster but nowe think and by we i mean a number of godmothers and i that you are being forced into one you might never have heard of its a tale of a nobleman transformed into a hideous beast until a girl agrees to marry him of her own free will very popular in some kingdoms bella snorted i very much doubt that you havent already tried having a young woman agree to marry sebastian you may be many things godmother elena but stupid is not one of them thank you for the vote of confidence elena replied dryly youre welcome bella said just as dryly elena scowled at her you want to watch that sense of humor young woman or you might find yourself apprenticed to a godmother yes of course that was one of the first things we tried so whatever it was that turned him into a werewolf it was not the tradition the tradition might be making use of him to put you through hoops and over hurdles but does not seem to have a lot of interest in sebastian isnt that comforting bella replied sourly elenas scowl deepened it should be there is no place in the maidandmonster story for the maid to turn into the monster herself none oh bella replied then oh as the import of what the godmother had just told her struck her exactly the tradition will turn itself inside out to keep you from changing even if sebastian had been infected by the common sort of werewolf you are not in danger of being infected in turn the news struck her like a blow but one that brought joy instead of pain in fact i am going to advise that they not even bother to lock you up tonight or at least not in one of the cells elena frowned i would rather you werent anywhere near him in fact i am very much afraid that if they do lock you up near him sebastian will be goaded into more activity than usual you may not be in any danger of turning into a monster but you are in danger of being eaten or at least having your throat ripped out oh bella gulped is that the story about how the werewolf always kills the ones sebastian knows that one too which is why i am sure he is trying very hard not to like you too much elena sighed where are you in that mausoleum they call a manor im down at the end of a murdercorridor with two other suites both empty she told the godmother pick up the mirror and take it out the door and point it where i ask you to would you bella realized at once that the godmother wanted to look for something and obeyed without question to both their satisfaction elena located the trigger for lowering and raising a very stout grate of iron bars at the end of the corridor drop that before moonrise tonight the godmother ordered just in case i doubt hell get free but theres no harm in making sure you have an extra defense besides the door in place back to your room now i have the salve and there are a few other things i want to caution you about watching the godmother push the jar of ointment through the mirror wasnt as unnerving as bella had thought it would be she wondered if a similar sort of magic connected the boxes that sent her letters to her father and his to her tell sebastian that you know about the tradition now and that i told you he knows of course most magicians who are allies of godmothers do so granny she began then blinked wait you mean im your ally very much so the godmother nodded your value to me just rose by quite a bit now just because you know about the tradition that doesnt mean youre immune from it far from it you may not have the sort of power coming to bear on you that oh say a seventh son or a princess does but now that youve gotten tangled up with sebastian youve definitely gotten its attention the fact that you can see magic and you are coming into your power decades early tells me that the one good thing about this situation is that there are so many different paths this could take the tradition is probably very confused right now so i want you to be extremely careful and use these new abilities of yours and practice the seeing of magic as much as you can i suspect youll be able to feel a buildup of traditional pressure or see the magic when youre in a situation thats going to give it a path to put you on and if more likely when that happens before you do anything remember to think try to remember if what is happening to you at that moment or what could happen to you if you do something resembles a story and then if it does remember just how that story ended then decide if thats the way you want things to turn out because they probably will bella rubbed her temple this is not at all comforting would you rather i hadnt told you the godmother demanded bella shook her head i thought not all right use that ointment go tell sebastian about our discussion tell your servants you are taking supper in your room and lock that miniature portcullis down before sunset turns to dusk the godmother nodded and tell your servants that the godmother says you neednt be locked up with him the best thing you can do right now is keep the tradition as confused as possible not at all comforting godmother bella thought as the image faded out not at all comforting it had been an interesting lesson the more so as sebastian with visible relief had been able to relate much of what he had been teaching her to how the magic was used to steer matters with or around the tradition she realized as she listened to him how this subject the tradition had been what her father used to call the dead cat in the parlor something that you knew was there something you were going to have to make all manner of devices to avoid but something of which you dared not speak now they could speak of it and if they couldnt exactly dispose of said dead cat they could at least deal with it more efficiently she wished desperately as he kindly but firmly sent her back to her rooms that this had not been a fullmoon night she wanted to keep the conversation going she had at least three dozen questions observations things she just wanted to say before she forgot any of them and there was no time before sunset she explained what the godmother wanted her to do and offered to do without sapphires help so that the elemental spirit would not be locked in with her spirit or no she had noticed that the servants couldnt pass through closed doors nor walls and once that grate came down there would be no going in or out until she raised it again but sapphire wrote a very firm no on her slate and bella lowered the grate as soon as one of the others came with her supper tray and there was no doubt when the moon rose because once again the halls echoed with the distant howls that sounded uncannily as if sebastian was also sobbing as he howled the three days that sebastian spent in seclusion were not going to be as quiet as she would have expected since she had comported herself to erics satisfaction he had ordered her servants to find all of sebastians outgrown clothing and deliver it to her this she discovered when she woke after a notveryrestful night of listening to sebastian howl to find sapphire putting it in her closet with the air of someone who would really rather have been doing anything else and that the clothing itself was offensive to her sensibilities how sapphire managed to convey this although she herself was invisible was really remarkable the clothing rose slowly in the air dangling by the smallest possible pinch of fabric it was then wafted hastily to the closet and tucked up as far into the back as possible all except for one outfit of gray wool and moleskin which was laid out for her to put on sapphire touched as little of it as possible it made bella want to giggle when she came down to breakfast sebastian was not there which she had expected but eric was which she had not huh whatever you put on your face id like to get some he said regarding her thoughtfully the marks are barely pink you look knackered though sebastian spent the night singing she said dryly eric chuckled hes been known to do that which is why i live in the gatehouse the gamekeeper said a little heartlessly well youd better stay awake for a few hours because im teaching you how to actually use that crossbow and a knife not that you did badly grabbing the arrow but if youre going to come out to help me i want you better trained because clearly my reputation isnt enough to keep the riffraff out of the forest ill drop some hints in the city that im training an assistant we wont need to worry about you being seen i can promise you there are plenty of eyes out there if they think there are two of us patrolling they wont be as bold as theyve been bella was so astonished by this that she didnt even object to his highhanded assumption that she wanted to go riding out with him not that she didnt after all there was only so much potionmaking that she could do at least until the new supplies that the godmother had promised her arrived and only so much dancing without feeling guilty she was pulling the servants away from their duties she ate her breakfast as quickly as he ate his and she noted the faint approval in his expression when she pushed away from the table at the same time as he did like anything else using the crossbow properly was a matter of practice and a great deal of it it seemed even at short range she was woeful with it but at least over time she did get better when eric finally called a halt for now he said she was finally hitting the target most of the time as opposed to bouncing the arrow off the ground sending it over the target or whizzing by to either side her efforts with the knife were a bit more successful perhaps because in the wake of being a victim of an attack herself she was not particularly eager to be a target again and if she went at this with more enthusiasm and energy than skill well that was only to be expected he taught her how to hold the knife so as to prevent it from being turned back on her how to get at it when her arms were pinned when to slash and when to stab he promised to set up a dummy for her to practice on i am not teaching you how to throw a knife he said so dont ask there is no point in it learning to throw knives properly can take a lifetime and all you would ever accomplish except for the odd lucky hit would be to give your attacker another weapon by throwing it at him nor was eric done with her for the day after dinner he took her back outside and put her on one of the horses the real horses and not her mule youre going to learn to ride a proper horse he told her properly astride when you come out with me i want you to be able to keep up she nodded remembering how her shorter mule had struggled to keep pace with his longerlimbed horse she waited bundled up in that warm coat hat and gloves while he went into the stable he must have told the spirit elementals which horses to get ready for they were out in a very short length of time she tried not to be alarmed but it was difficult when it all came down to it she was after all a woman of the city who walked nearly everywhere the beast eric led out to her in the courtyard towered over her she watched him lead it up to her with growing apprehension it was a dark brown with a black mane and tail and she thought it was looking at her with utter contempt as if it knew exactly how bad a rider she was he tied it up to a stone pillar with a ring in it evidently there for just that purpose and laced his hands together put your left foot there he ordered ill boost you up into the saddle nervously she got a good grip on the pommel with both hands and did as she was told and in the next moment found herself flying upward somehow she managed to get her leg over the saddle before she fell off on the other side it took a few more moments of fumbling with her feet for the stirrups before she could find them the horse was not only tall it was very very wide much wider than her little mule or the few ladys horses she had ever ridden already her legs were starting to hurt a little and she knew that she was going to need a hot soak very badly when this was over eric puttered about both sides of the horse actually grabbing her feet and moving them to where he wanted them shortening the stirrups a little which helped her legs and pulling the belt that went around the middle of the horse a little tighter finally he seemed satisfied and took a long line that had been tied to his belt and fastened it to the horses bridle take up the reins he said backing up you remember this from when you first learned to ride yes he eyed her critically all right here we go he clucked to the horse and it moved out in a walk and then just as she grew accustomed to the pace into a trot she was terrified she was going to get bounced off and the horse seemed to be having a wicked good time at her expense but she tried to do everything eric said and slowly it all started to come together the jouncing wasnt as badin fact it slowly stopped being jouncing as she and the saddle stopped meeting painfully in the middle she heard him cluck to the horse again and the beast stretched out his legs and went into a canter which was both a relief and terrifying a relief because it was an infinitely easier gait but terrifying because the horse was going so fast three times around with eric turning elegantly on his heel as he kept the horse moving on the end of the line and it started to be less terrifying and more exciting she hadnt fallen and the speed so amazing all right thats enough for now he called and the horse slowed slowed quite quickly in fact no more than a couple of paces at the trot before he was walking again and then stopped eric coiled up the line walking toward her then held the horse at the bit he looked up at her with a faint smile on his face he didnt look nearly as intimidating with that expression on his face and with her looking down on him not bad at least whoever instructed you the first time didnt give you any bad habits she didnt answer she just swung her leg over the pommel of the saddle and slid a bit painfully down to the ground here he had pulled the reins over the horses head now he thrust them into her hands again walk him cool it wont take long a good rider never lets his horse stand after hes broken a sweat until hes cooled down naturally itll help you work out some of those cramps too so she limped around the courtyard under his critical eye until he judged the horse ready to go back to the stable then he whistled and one of the spirit elementals came to take reins and horse from her she started to head back into the manor and noticed he wasnt following arent you coming she asked its a fullmoon night so ill be out for most of it sebastian and his servants are seeing to it that hes locked up but if he breaks free again we cant afford to take the risk of someone else being attacked the next person might not be as lucky as you were he shrugged youd better get inside though and tell the servants to give you supper in your room preferably in a hot bath oh and congratulations on not growing hair and fangs last night looks like youll only be our guest for three moons after all ermthank you she said awkwardly and turned to go inside when she paused at the door to look back he was already gone from the courtyard it would definitely be an early supper but she was ready for it and was thinking quite strongly of trying to sleep early as well if she could with the howling she wrote her letter to her father and tucked it in the box before she let sapphire lead her to the bathroom by that time she had begun to stiffen up supper in the bath had been a very very good idea even better was the rather tall flagon of mulled wine that sapphire brought her the servant seemed to have resigned herself to bellas male attire she had taken it away with none of the theatrics she had evidenced when she had laid it out one of her own jars of liniment came floating into the bathroom as she got out of the bath wryly she thought how glad she was now she had made so manythough she certainly had been thinking of the horses and not herself when she had with the liniment rubbed into her sore sore legs and the godmothers ointment applied to her face she climbed into her warmed bed feeling just slightly muzzy from the mulled wine the last light of sunset was fading from the sky and sapphire came to pull the curtains shut over the windows and light the candles in the headboard of her bed she had settled in with a book that sebastian had given her to read yesterday when she noticed that sapphire was still there holding a ball of what looked like beeswax wax she said puzzled taking it the slate rose ears sapphire wrote for a moment she stared at the word puzzled then it dawned on her what sapphire meant all right ill try it she agreed and rolled the lump of wax in her hand until it was soft then divided it in two and stuffed it in her ears when the howling began she could still hear itbut it was muffled and she could even pretend to herself that it was far far distant the howl of something out in the woods on the other side of the walls some wild thing and not a man she knew trapped in the mind and form of a beast the intense relief she felt that she was not going to be suffering the same fate was tempered with pity for him now that she could afford it two more months and she could go home but he would still be trapped here a prisoner three days of the month and right now a prisoner every other day as well by his own decision hmm well see about that the book caught her attention immediately however and soon she was too engrossed in it to think much about poor sebastian because it was about the tradition it went into much more detail than sebastian had though that detail was more along the lines of how traditional power worked in the world with examples and possible solutions to common problems she noted that it must have been written for magicians not godmothers because more than once the solution to a problem stated simply call on a godmother she had to work very hard not to get too angry at this faceless thing that they called the tradition because of all things she detested being manipulated and this was manipulation on the grand scale though if she was going to be honest she would have to admit that she hated being manipulated in part because she did so much manipulation herself pot calling the kettle black she noted wryly stillshed never manipulated anyone but genevieve and the twins and that had been to keep peace in the household someone had to or genevieve all by herself would wreak the havoc of confusion not to mention shatter the monthly budget andwell she more or less manipulated the rest of the household she called it managing but there was some manipulation too but wasnt that what a good household head was supposed to do you couldnt just order people to get along and expect that they would do it you had to make them want to oh yes there is another excuse its all for their own good sapphire brought her another flagon of mulled wine and she took a sip to take the nasty taste of truth out of her mouth and another because she knew very well when she got home she wasnt going to stop manipulating them ugh truth was not fun and often not pretty but this tradition is already manipulating them im just trying to counter it and that was true it was right here in black and white when stepmothers werent wicked or downright murderous they were generally vain petty and vindictive and stepsisters were perpetually jealous just as petty and vain and greedy all by herself without even knowing what she was doing she had mitigated all of that so the worst that could be said of genevieve was that she was lazy and vain not even vain with the capital v and the twins were entirely sweetnatured and wellintentioned well all right she hadnt known she was doing all that before now but now that she knew about the blasted tradition she could be more careful about what she did and how she did it only for real good not for my good and certainly not telling myself that its for their good it was going to be a very hard vow to keep but she knew she was going to have to do just that she sipped and read the wine did a fairly good job of keeping her from getting too angry making mental notes as she went along finally the last of the wine was gone and she put the flagon up on one of the shelves in the headboard and blinked feeling it hit her with more force than she had expected well then time to sleep she blew out the candles and set the book asideand the next thing she knew it was morning for a moment she was confused by how muffled sound was until she remembered the wax and pulled it out of her ears it was a brilliantly sunny day and she groaned as she started to get out of bed feeling her legs aching and sore despite the hot bath and the liniment i hurt in muscles i didnt even know i had she thought and moaned a little again sapphire whisked into the bedroom at that bringing the liniment with her and bella was very glad to see it too it seemed that eric had planned more of the same for her today for another of sebastians old suits had been laid out but there had been some additions to it some lovely embroidery at the square neck and a little lace at the cuffs and neck of the shirt nothing that sebastian would have worn she was sure since she had a good idea of his taste now she smiled to see it though this had to be sapphires work and sapphire was determined to make sure no one forgot she was a girl but the first thing she did was go straight to her mirror and her message box she read her letter with one eye on the mirror she wanted to see her fathers reaction to his she had written to her father about her adventures in weaponry and horseback riding and to her relief he seemed more amused than anything else his letter had been full of news about the way that the servants were taking care of him cosseting me in his words and how genevieve seemed to be working with the housekeeper which was nothing short of astonishing so far as bella was concerned the vague uneasy thought flitted across her mind what if they dont need me after all would she still be welcome wanted it vanished a moment later but the taste of it lingered meanwhile she waited watching for him to get to the part where she told him that she had not changed on the first night of the full moon and when he did the sheer joy in his face practically took her breath away and it quelled the unease there was no doubt he wanted her back home she went down to breakfast to find eric there he didnt seem to notice the little additions to her attire well how sore are you he asked without preamble very she replied as the servant put buttered flatcakes on her plate and drizzled honey over them and please do not tell me that the only cure for the soreness is to get on the wretched horse again my first instructor told me that why are your horses sowide she added because they all have destrier blood in them knights horses heavier bones better for jumping and going over rough country since theyre bred to carry a rider and all that armor he was consuming ham singlemindedly as he spoke but at least he didnt talk with his mouth full this morning well be working inside now that i know youll at least not break mirrors and windows when you shoot he continued theres a big room here they used to use for balls but its made for practice with weapons swords generally but we can use some light handcrossbows in there and you can practice your knife work oh ive been there she said sebastian gave me leave to explore as much as i wanted well good as soon as youre finished well go straight there i told the servants to build up the fires so it wont be hideously cold he began mopping the last of the ham juice from his plate with a roll so she hastened to finish her flatcakes are we riding this afternoon she asked as they walked toward what she could only think of as the music room and at his chuckle she groaned of course we are she said answering her own question or at least i am take heart youre going to be less sore tomorrow in a week youll be fit for the trail on a proper horse instead of that puny little mule he handed her a much smaller crossbow than before several things occurred to me outside you have to deal with windage you dont in here and i thought the regular crossbow might be too heavy considering how many arrows you drove into the dirt so i reckoned that this might work out better for you it will still kill a man or make him hurt quite a lot it just wont do so instantly unless you get an insanely lucky shot he shrugged unless were in a situation where someone wants to kill us id as soon a good healer could save him hell serve as an example to anyone else who gets ideas now try that out and see how you like it it was certainly easier to cock she fitted a bolt into the guide and took aim at the target which had been placed against a generous number of straw mattresses leaning up against the wall either eric the servants or both were taking no chances on her ruining the wood paneling her very first bolt hit the target so did her second and her third none of them got near the bulls eye of course but at least now she was hitting what she was supposed to hit he nodded suggested corrections until finally her trigger finger was actually starting to ache and she was placing the bolts inside the first ring consistently now for your knife work he said collecting all the bolts and setting them and the crossbow aside he handed her a wooden knife with blunted edge and point first thing its not a duel someone who attacks you with a knife means to kill you knife work is dirty work not gentlemans work and anyone whos attacking with a knife is a ruffian at the very best and hes probably murdered before you have to be dirtier than he is he picked up a wooden knife himself now assuming you actually see me coming with the knife what do you do that seemed perfectly obvious to her run i run very well and i am lighter than you even if i cant run faster than you as long as i can keep out of reach i can probably run longer than you and if i can keep running long enough to get to some place where other people are hell give up he actually grinned well done ninetynine men out of a hundred wouldnt give that answer women are more practical and we have no problem with being called cowards she pointed out wryly right so against someone with a knife your first priority is going to be to escape your second if you cant outrun him is going to be to evade him or hurt him so you can escape you are unlikely to ever find yourself facing someone your size or smaller so this is how its done he couldnt show her everything in one afternoon obviously but what he began with was very interesting indeed using a cloak wrapped around one arm as a shield for instance and the pattern of move out of the way block the next blow strike back while hes off balance run mostly though he showed her how to evade how to tell the way that someone was coming at her and how to squirm out of the way like a ferret how to cut or stab if she could and if not how to punch her attacker with the hand not holding the knife hell be concentrating on that hand eric pointed out not on the hand he thinks isnt dangerous and this is a good time to have a nice heavy rock a piece of wood or half a brick in that hand if you can he chuckled a little i once put a man down with a horseshoe that way id picked it up and put it in my pocket no point in wasting a good horseshoe she hardly noticed that as she warmed up with the exercise she hurt less and less until when he called a halt for dinner she realized she hardly hurt at all you are being rather nicer to me than you were when i first got here she said lightly as they left the music room to clean up before dinner i expected someone more arrogant based on our first meeting he said bluntly just another of the same sort of women who used to look down their noses at me she snorted you bullied me tried to intimidate me and did your level best to terrify me what kind of response did you expect not what i got obviously he reached out and caught her elbow making her stop lookill admit it i wanted to bed you if i can bully a woman into that position i will most of the women i run into out in the forest respond to that theyre happy to trade a rogering for getting off with whatever theyve poached i get what i want they get what they want no harm done and ill freely admit im a good customer at the brothels and when we still had human servants around here i was known to tumble a chambermaid or three thats the kind of women i know best the only other women ive ever met are the nobles whod look through me as if i wasnt there she was not surprised to hear the venom in his voice at that last ive never met anyone like you he continued im not sure how to treat you what to say around you all the others i know right off what my place is what her place is and thats that but you he let go of her arm you baffle me i dont know how to treat you i just know i like being around you and its not the same as it is with any of those other women she felt herself warming to his tone his expression he was in dead earnest so far as she could tell and she couldnt help but feel sympathy for him the bastard snubbed by the noble resented by the servants how lonely he must have been how it wasnt a good life being the unacknowledged bastard he continued bitterly my fathers people sneered at me when he wasnt looking half the time i had to thrash the servants to get them to obey me and the only reason they did so after that was because i got away with the thrashing finally i got a position once i was old enough to be useful they stopped sneering at me openly but you could still see the contempt in their eyes i had to fight for everything i got prove i was better than the other man that might have gotten what i was granted sebastian didnt sneer at me but he doesnt sneer at anyone he had to fight for what he wanted too the wizardry business the old duke wasnt all that pleased about his son flinging magic around until the day the boy dared one of the squires that had been taunting him to fight him and the brat ended upside down in a tree hanging by one foot eric smiled grimly at that thats why he and i get along thats why truth to tell we were both just as glad to see the backs of most of the old dukes people she could almost see it and no wonder he bullied people if he had been bullied himself that was why she was treating the twins as she did treating them as a friend and a real sister and an ally instead of bullying them it would have been easy to bully them especially when they had been younger the servants her father would have believed her and not them if they had complained but that not only wasnt fair to them since they had done nothing to her it would only turn them into little tyrants when they grew up children became what they lived with but eric had only seen force used against him all his younger life and fighting back was all he knew there had been no one to teach him a better way and well even if there had been would that really have helped him and just as she started to respond to him something that had been nagging at the back of her mind leapt forward the rakes reward oh no she had just read this very same scenario last night in that book about the tradition the poor misunderstood rakehell the man who was a rogue because deep inside he was still a lonely neglected little boy the good girl who would redeem him with her love and help him become the gentle man he was meant to be even the fact that he was the bastard son played into that except the book had noted that was seldom how the scenario played out once the rake got what he wanted the habits of a lifetime are very hard to break and the tradition was perfectly happy to perpetuate those habits so that the rakes reward generally turned into the sadder but wiser girl or well any number of other songs and stories about girls who trusted a mans sad story and wound up with a big belly and no wedding ring and wouldnt that be a fine way to go home knowing that in a few months time you wouldnt be able to hide what youd been up to oh no you dont she thought at the tradition angrily and as she did so she could actually feel the pressure that the godmother had spoken about the force of the magic trying to steer her into the path it wanted and then what given the situation here there were all sorts of ways this could go wrong she was all alone here with only the spirit elementals who probably wouldnt be of much help if she said no but eric decided she only needed to be persuaded into yes or if he decided he was just going to take what he wanted as he usually did she rather doubted that someone with his appetites was going to be willing to settle for decorous kisses she also didnt think hed be inclined to propose marriage once hed gotten her where he wanted her with her mind working logically instead of emotionally other things occurred to her it might not just be the tradition at work this could all be a clever act on his part the wiles of the practiced seducer who knew how many other women hed cajoled underneath him with that same story of the poor sad lonely boy still looking at his serious thoughtful expression she was tempted he could be in earnest it went without saying that he didnt often meet a woman who stood up to him nor one who was willing to don mens clothing and work as he did and he was very handsome when he wasnt frowning that saturnine face had a melancholy to it that was extremely attractive when he laughed a genuine laugh he was completely transformed he was a great deal more intelligent than she had thought he was treating her rather as an equal which was incredibly rare and sometimes there actually was a happy ending but then she remembered the wool guild dance yes this was the same man who had been perfectly willing to prey on any girl he thought would not be able to defend herself and who had no obvious guardians or protectors well then treat me as abel your young squire that you are teaching all these useful things to she said lightly im starting to like being a boy theres a lot of freedom in breeches a succession of emotions chased across his face all in an instant surprise disbelief a great deal of disbelief in fact this was not the response he had expected which argued that he had some experience in what he could expect from that sad sad story well so this was a ploy and you were counting on me to respond to it you sir are a bastard in more than just birth a very brief moment of anger consumed her anger that she forced herself not to respond to he mustnt guess that she knew what he was up to she needed to keep him friendly she also needed him not to be angry at her because angry men did unpleasant things who knows maybe ill take to swaggering about taverns in breeches when this is over and scandalize the entire city or at least my stepmother she chuckled inviting him in on the joke can you imagine what genevieve beauchamps would have to say about that and can you imagine the reaction of the king since hes the reason im here in the first place another moment of surprise and then an answering chuckle i just might help you with that then abel he said that could be a hell of a jest the chuckle deepened nothing wrong with tweaking the kings britches old bastards got a stick rammed up his arse hes so stiff she laughed and slapped his shoulder as a man would its worth thinking about but later theres a roast of venison waiting for us and im perishing for food but as they parted where the corridor divided her laughter faded and she shivered that had been a very narrow escape and how many more lay ahead of her no one not even a dedicated hoyden could possibly have thrown herself more earnestly into the role of abel than bella did from the moment they sat down to dinner to the moment when she left him after the second riding lesson she acted as much the boy as she could deliberately aping every wouldbe young swaggerer she had ever seen and since there were generally a lot of them swarming around her sisters and they tended to ignore her in favor of the twins she had been able to observe quite a few in action it seemed to work by the time they parted to get their respective suppers he was treating her as he had out in the tin country like a boy which was all very well except as she settled down to her book on the tradition with the beeswax stuffed in her ears and another flagon of hot mulled wine beside her and picked up where she had left off she came across another traditional path she was going to have to steer wary of gone for a soldier the girl who really was disguised as a boy and who subsequently fell in love with the man in whose company she found herself most usually this was a girl who fed up with a stifling life at home or overwhelmed with patriotism or just having no other options but to go whoring struck out for adventure in breeches there were variations as always sometimes it was a girl following her lover to war well at least she wouldnt have to worry about that one sometimes it was a girl escaping marriage to someone awful and very rarely it was a girl taking the place of her father or brother to save them from conscription now so long as she steered clear of the trap of falling for eric that could play out for her she realized since the tradition had very firm ideas about the conduct of the man in question according to the book he seldom realized that the boy in whose company he spent so much time was really a girl it generally resulted in a surprise revelation after the girl had heroically saved his life and gotten dangerously wounded sometimes the boy would tell him of a beautiful sister until he fell in love with the girl she actually was and eventually she would come forward as the sister her ruse abandoned well i wont be doing anything like that thank you very much just as long as she kept a firm grip on what she was doing and he became oblivious to her femininity she just might manage to steer clear of any complications with eric for the next two months complications with ericsurely the very last thing she needed right now at least i am not going to become a shewolf that waswell it made this look like a trivial hurdle to jump truth to tell if she closed her eyes she could feel that pressure now like a storm waiting to break the tradition really wanted to find a place for her she rubbed her temple and sighed all this was hideously complicated people had no idea how much they did was being dictated by this force and this was just ordinary life without any magic involved it was a wonder that godmothers didnt go mad then she turned the page and read some more oh wait they do as the full moon passed into the waning moon bella took advantage of sebastians absence to continue searching his parents rooms for clues as to the curse she found clothing carefully preserved and a few very rudimentary books on magic in his mothers rooms she found a chest of baby clothing and in it a box of tokens of sebastians infancy a lock of hair a silver rattle an ivory teething ring buried deep behind the closet were halfembroidered garments and bed linens sad evidence of the things she has left behind at her death but there were no letters no journals a check of the old dukes belongings was even less fruitful she couldnt even find any evidence that the old duke had done any of his own correspondence much less kept any sort of journal in neither room did she find any token or suspicious object that might have carried a curse a bit discouraged by her lack of success she reported to elena who encouraged her to keep investigating after the three days sebastian was at breakfast again and tilted his head like a curious bird to see her in her new guise are those my old clothes he asked she nodded her mouth full deliberately copying how eric ate rather than abiding by the appropriate and ladylike table manners she used at home erics teaching me his business cant do that sort of thing in skirts have to say i like it i may never go back to skirts again im putting it about that im training an assistant eric explained if people think theres going to be a man regularly patrolling at night as well as by day theyll be less inclined to prowl the woods by dark it wont matter when she leaves shell have been seen with me for two months and people will assume shes still here sebastian looked worried his brows creased and his eyes clouded with concern but will you have time for magic lessons now i mean if eric is taking you out on his rounds if that is what you want to do i dont want to interfere but i promised the godmother i would see to it you got all the magic lessons i could give you eric guffawed dont fret abels mine in the morning you get her in the afternoon sebastian tilted his head the other direction abel abel bella its what were calling me so they think im a boy bella said with a guffaw poachers are getting bolder thats why erics putting it about hes training an underkeeper she jabbed her thumb at her chest i think i can do a convincing job of it sebastian blinked then she saw something dawn on him though what she couldnt tell he nodded cautiously right then abel eric ill see you at dinner or after if were a bit late she finished an instant before eric did and shoved away from the table all right im ready lets go put the fear of the devil into those bastards since god doesnt scare them they were in luck though it wasnt very lucky for the poor fellow they caught for one of them must have noticed erics absence in the woods over the past three mornings and changed his own routine she was the one that noticed the telltale furtive movement into cover and pointed it out to eric she hated to she knew this was going to get ugly when the man was caught but she also knew the fact shed seen the man before eric had was just pure luck the tradition would see to it that she became a good gamekeeper she was beginning to think that it was due to the tradition that she had mastered riding the hunter using the crossbow and defending herself so quickly which made her wonder had it been luck or had it been the tradition that let her spot the man it doesnt matter what matters is what i do not how it gets done as long as i keep making eric treat me and think of me like a boy but eric was giving her directions his horse pressed up against hers his voice pitched low and soft so it wouldnt carry you ride down that way and keep your eyes on that trapline see it theres a fat hare in the noose right there she nodded dont look away from the traps hell be watching you anxious about his traps and forget about me ill circle around behind him and run him down if i have to she felt sick inside knowing that he would do exactly that but nodded clucked to her horse and carefully steered him through the snowcovered bushes in the direction of that dead hare she couldnt help it this wasnt just a lawbreaker to her this was a person just how desperate was this poacher did he have halfstarved children at home or was he purely poaching for profit wait eric had said trapline and now as she stood up in her stirrups for a better view she could see four more snares from the vantage of the saddle two of them with something in them a poor man couldnt afford that much wire got you eric shouted in triumph she snatched up her crossbow as the horse responded to erics shout by pivoting on his heel and lurching toward the sound of erics voice there was only the sound of erics voice this time raised in altercation the horse plunged through the snow snorting with excitement evidently he was used to this sort of thing she stuck to him like the proverbial burr as firm in the saddle now as she had been uneasy a few days ago as she cleared the trees that were between her and the men she saw that eric was still in the saddle holding a man by the collar and mercilessly beating him with a short stout club as he covered his head with his arms and tried to escape crying out with pain but a savage blow brought him down into the snow and eric leapt from the saddle to finish the job ending with a vicious kick to the ribs while the man lay there only semiconscious eric lifted a heavy string of rabbits and hares from behind the bushes the man had been hiding in and fastened it to the back of his saddle her horse whickered and eric turned to grin at her abel go collect those snares as i showed you im going to have a little discussion with our friend here about why it isnt wise to steal someone elses game when youve finished come back i want you to see how its done proper it was quite a long trapline she found more than twenty snares and a total of six more rabbits and hares it was obvious this was a man looking to turn a profit no one could eat this much meat no matter how big his family was she felt a little better about her part in all this but when she returned and saw eric bending over the man with a knife for one horrified moment she thought then she saw the hank of dark matted hair being tossed aside and another and another she rode up to see that eric was shaving the unconscious man bald what she began mercy abel and more than he deserves another hank of hair was tossed aside eric was literally shaving the man bald with his hunting knife that knife must be incredibly sharp she thought watching eric continue to work with the same fascination with which she watched spiders catching flies the constables and i have an agreement if they see someone whos been shaved bare and has my sign inked on his pate it means hes a poacher and they can throw the weight of the law on him now i could brand him and i used to do that but thats a nuisance you have to build a fire and get the iron hot and then theres all the screaming and worst of all the stink of burned hair he laughed so sebastian made me a thing like a wax seal for sealing letters only it makes an imprint on skin and carries its own ink so he might not get the constables on him she hazarded im a hunter at heart i like to give the game a fair chance to escape everyone knows the game now all our poacher here needs to do to stay out of gaol or avoid a real branding is to lie low until his hair grows again but he wont be going into the city or the villages to sell his catch for all that time and he wont be running his trap line because why bother when he cant sell the catch so he gets off with a beating and losing his livelihood unless hes got another besides this if hes smart hed better find one because if i catch him a second time itll be the worse for him depending on how i feel ill either brand his face myself or cut off his first finger hes a butcher she said instantly i know him to her surprise when eric had turned the mans head a bit she had recognized him as one of the butchers she occasionally bought meat from alain charpentier he has a butcher shop near the bell gate really well his prentice is going to be tending the front of the shop for a while or else hed better make himself a wig eric dropped the mans head reached into a beltpouch and pulled out a wooden square about half the size of his fist he pressed it into the skin of the mans head and took it away now stamped into the skin in black ink was an e with an arrow for the upright eric stood up and gave the man a final kick the man didnt even whimper hell i didnt hit him that hard soft bastard he bent down and shook the man roughly until he groaned and opened his eyes terror crossed his pulped features please master the butcher said mushily please master dont kill me oh as soon as you start to feel those bruises youll wish you were dead eric said cheerfully youve been branded coneycatcher you know what that means right the butcher nodded his head water streaming from his swollen eyes eric stood back arms folded over his chest now run along home and stay out of sight of the constables and be glad i decided to not outrage my new partners sensibilities by knocking a few of your teeth out as an added lesson babbling as best he could with swollen and bleeding lips the butcher scrabbled to his feet and staggered off swearing to never touch a snare again would you really have knocked out his teeth bella asked depends on my mood eric replied carelessly swinging himself back up into the saddle he didnt fight back so my mood is generous now comes the question which i will ask you to decide abel there are more coneys here than we need by far sowhat to do with em sebastian wont care if i sell em but thats tedious though profitable and it would be amusing to sell them right back to the bastard he wouldnt dare refuse to pay anything i asked either eric tilted his head to the side watching her closely take them to father gentian at four saints she said instantly oh so and why should we be giving them away i want to keep people terrified of me not thinking im some sort of benefactor eric looked at her curiously but not angrily so she continued ive got good reasons that i think youll understand even if you dont want to do this first four saints feeds the poorest folk of the city if theyre being fed they wont be out here poaching she ticked off a finger second you can go in there growling that the duke made you bring them to the good father instead of selling them which keeps your reputation intact and third word will get around that you brought a huge number of hares to four saints the butcher will hear about it know those were his hares and be in agony all over again at losing them youll have punished him twice over eric burst into surprised laughter and here i thought you were going to give me some sort of cant about caring for the needy and all that rot i like the way you think practical with just a touch of harshness to keep things interesting maybe a bit of cruelty for spice its too bad youre leaving after two months abel maybe i could use a partner after all he laughed again well that certainly clinched it the tradition was working in her favor for now he would never ever have said that to a woman he was trying to make sorry for him as they parted company eric to go on to the city with the hares and she to return to the manor she allowed herself to feel a very tiny shred of relief she changed out of her horsesmelling riding clothing and into a hybrid sort of outfit she had to admit that she really liked the freedom of breeches that was no kind of a lie but having her breasts squashed flat beneath the leather tunics was not very comfortable even if it was necessary sapphire had been helping her bind them flat before getting into the tunics but that had just generalized the discomfort so over the breeches she wore one of her own bodices and beneath that one of sebastians old linen shirts the way that eric had beaten that poacher still disturbed her and yet what he had done was in its way far more merciful than what the law allowed and this had not been someone who was poaching to feed his family eric had admitted that sebastian ordered him to look the other way on quite a bit of that sort of poaching this had been someone who was profiting stealing from the duke taking rabbits to sell in his own butcher shop the law would probably be even harsher on someone like that on the one hand erics casual brutality had made her feel a little sick on the other handwhat other choice did he have erics duty required that very brutality of him personally and often maybe cultivating indifference was the only way he could go about his business without feeling sick all the time himself she went down to dinner feeling very little appetite for it but hoping that sebastian would be there right now she very much wanted to have simple conversation with someone who didnt turn a mans face into pulp without thinking twice about it sebastian was there and he looked up with an expression on his face that told her he had been hoping she would arrive youre back he exclaimed eric went on to the city she told him before he could ask she explained what had happened without going into the gruesome details and her solution for the disposition of the poachers catch he nodded as he listened thank you for the rabbit solution then he sighed eric almost beat the man to death didnt he he asked never mind i can tell from your expression he did theres no point in telling him not to ive tried he retorts that he doesnt tell me how to cast a spell so i shouldnt tell him how to be a gamekeeper then he gives me very wellargued points about why this has to be done and i have no refutation for him she nodded slowly i thought of most of that myself i can see it i know that the constables are even worse and i have no idea what his own guild would do to him but they are not refined men the butchers and they already have to work very hard to keep their reputation clean i mean thats why they have a guild and guild rules and laws in the first place so people will know they can trust what they buy but i dont like it and it seems wrong we think too much sebastian told her ruefully thats what eric would say we keep trying to appeal to reason and finding a way to make sure punishments fit the crime we keeping thinking that there must be a better way while people like eric say breaking heads has always worked before so theres no reason to change she made a rude noise id be more inclined to say that everyone else thinks too little and on that note ive been reading that book about the tradition you gave me and it is not a comfort he grimaced and pushed his glasses up he was always doing that but then they seemed to be perched on his nose with no real way to keep them in place other than the wires that wrapped around his ears it isnt meant to be here have some pie pie always makes me feel better instead of waiting for the servant to do so he reached across the table and put a generous wedge of pigeon pie on her plate since she hadnt been served anything yet she took a forkful it really was awfully good i was wondering is that why youre in breeches he continued hesitantly and being all hearty and and acting like a boy yes she said im working at it very hard in fact since eric took it into his head that i need to be outside more ive been in his company a lot i admit i like being outdoors and the rest of the work in the stillroom will be making a few specialized things mostly for you i dont embroider i dont need to sew here the servants take care of the household very nicely and being out makes me feel less like a prisoner buti eric is very fond of womenand i dont mean in the sense of friendship sebastians face suddenly darkened if hes offered insult to you ill no she exclaimed since i came here hes been quitereasonable we wont mention what he did before i came here no but i could see the tradition setting us both up for a starcrossed piece of nonsense you know the lady and the rogue sort of thing and this was the easiest way i could see to prevent any such thing im not even sure that i like eric and i certainly dont need the tradition forcing me to fall in love with him ah im glad to i mean its a good thing i gave you that book then so you can make up your own mind about things and not be forced into them by the tradition especially that sort of thing the tradition really seems to favor putting people intoahromantic situations that are just not very wise sebastians expression lightened then darkened again maybe i had better ask you to do the same with me he added sadly push me into treating you like a little brother or the wizards apprentice isnt there a girlinbreeches model for the wizards apprentice i mean there are some rather awful traditions regarding werewolves and i oh stop that she snapped he did stop looking at her owlishly from behind those thick lenses really the next thing you are going to do is start dressing in black and writing terrible poetry about your tormented soul and if you do that i will run off from here without the kings leave i scarcely think you are going to leap up from the table and tear my throat out before the cheese is served there are only three nights in the month that you are a danger to anyone and besides ive found at least a couple traditional tales in that book of yours where the werewolf protected the people he cared for he looked up at that startled you did i never finished that part of the book the other stories just made me feel so sick inside that i came close to throwing myself out of my window yes i did she said firmly and you know just as well as i do that since we know about the tradition we can make it work for us instead of against us as for throwing yourself out a window you are not allowed to the only way you go out a window is if you start writing bad poetry then i will pitch it out the window and you to follow she managed to startle a chuckle out of him obviously there is a tradition however small of helpful werebeasts so since i know absolutely nothing about transformative magic and am going to be no help there i propose that i ask the godmother to find us all the traditional tales of protective or guardian werebeasts and ill figure out what they all have in common and as for you she eyed him critically you need to stop moping alone out here and go back to the society of other people if you had other people around here there wouldnt be any talk of windows and going out them in a terminal fashion his head came up like an alarmed horse but i cant he exclaimed im a danger three nights a month yes i know she retorted there are twentyseven nights a month when you are not not to mention all the days so why dont you make use of them you could use some sun and dont tell me that you get all the sun you need up there in your workroom you need to get out you need to see people you need intelligent conversation you need to remind people at court that you still exist and you need to do that so that the king cant one day decide you are an inconvenience and make you vanish and you know he would if he thought he had to before he could answer she went on now if you are just using this as an excuse because you really would rather be a hermit thats one thing but otherwise you are depriving yourself of a great deal of pleasure for no reason at all and if all i had to depend on for conversation and company was eric i think id throw myself out of a window he isnt stupid but his interests are so narrow i doubt i could slip a sheet of paper in between them he stared at her in astonishment for a moment then broke into laughter all right he said finally wiping his eyes with his napkin you win ill consult with the godmother and the king and see what can be done bella i am horribly sorry that i did this to you but i cant tell you how happy i have been since you arrived you just keep looking at things and seeing answers where i couldnt i havent heard music in so long oh now that i can remedy she exclaimed some of the spirit elementals actually are musicians as you suggested you can listen to them anytime you like just ask them i well he shook his head do you have any idea of the amount of change youve made here for me in just the last month she raised her chin of course i do ive stopped the waste in the kitchen ive organized your stillroom ive replenished many of your herbal supplies i found out that some of the servants are quite intelligent and can talk and that some of them are musicians all of that and more he replied raising his hand to stop the flood of words that wasnt what i meant i meant to me she blinked at him well how can i she replied i dont know what things were like before i came here so i have nothing to compare now to he laughed bring logic into it will you she rolled her eyes why not no one else seems to oh bah there you go again all right lets go continue your lessons and as you probably guessed yes i have a mirror i can speak to the godmother with so well go call her greenfaced majordomo and tell him what we have discovered and deduced he stood up and the servants swooped on the table eager to take everything away she moved quickly to avoid being in a collision with a platter or bowl for all we know he does all her research and can tell us right away what traditional paths there are for protective werebeasts she said as she followed him out into the hall true enough he paused i would like to think i was being your protector instead of your predator she got the oddest feeling when he said that a sort of quivery feeling in her stomach and a shiver on the back of her neck but it wasnt a bad feeling as if her instincts were trying to warn her against something and it wasnt the feeling of pressure that the tradition had given her over eric but she shook her head a little and brushed the feelings aside there were more important things to deal with right now and for all she knew it was just a draft i told you that when you came here no quarters i could give you were going to be worthy of you he continued it wasnt just being gallant i already knew you were brave i didnt know that you were kind and clever i didnt know how considerate you were of others even those who are literally invisible now i know all that and if i had the kings suite it wouldnt be worthy of you nono it wasnt a draft now it wasnt a shivery feeling it was a feeling of warmth she found herself smiling at him he smiled back behind his spectacles his eyes twinkled i think youre giving me more credit than i deserve she said awkwardly and i think youre giving yourself too little he winked at her but lets not argue lets see what the godmother has to say the green face had no information for them but as sebastian had suggested he was one of the sources for the godmothers information he promised that he himself would contact them when he had gathered as much as he could in the next day or two eric did not appear at supper which did not surprise sebastian hell have stayed in the city he generally does when he has a reason to go there sebastian explained he gets money from our factor in the city and uses the ducal town house dont get excited about that ill bet its much smaller than your fathers house i only keep on a housekeeper there but he wont care he eats at the taverns anyway and he visits the sebastian stopped flushing a bright crimson there are women he said after a long pause he might be gone a couple of days maybe longer its been a while since he went to the city hes been working really hard since my littleescape he could stay a week and i think he deserves it if he needs it ah she replied without comment well would you like to listen to some music tonight im going to i asked sapphire to tell the others really yes i would he brightened considerably very much so i havent well i havent had any music that wasnt my own bad singing in years have you taken any thought to what i suggested about going back to court at least in the middle of the month she asked pointedly id rather wait and see what the king and the godmother say he demurred looking uneasily down into his soup now is that because you dont want to go or he interrupted her i want to go i miss people i miss music and libraries and talking and dancing i even miss the ridiculous maneuvering at court since i was never a part of it it was all pretty funny to watch butat the same time it terrifies me everyone knows or will know that im a wizard now im afraid people will be as afraid of a wizard as they would be of the beast she pursed her lips wellwhat did they think of you before he shrugged not much i suppose i was sort of an amusing nonentity nobody bothered to trouble me because i wasnt important enough to be a threat i suppose at some point a desperate mother or someone like your stepmother anxious for any sort of title for her girl would have started throwing a daughter at me but it hadnt happened yet people liked me well enough i know how to tell an amusing story and even better i know when a story isnt amusing and i dont tell it i dance passably i hunt well and ride well i dont get into quarrels or god forbid duels i play cards but not for high stakes and im not very lucky or very unlucky i do or did have good discussions with the few folks who have scholarly inclinations and some of the older people at court im a good listener he spread his hands wide there you have me such as i am quite forgettable eat your soup and stop feeling sorry for yourself she said a little sharply because it did look as if he was about to mope you might not have made any fast friends but it doesnt sound as if you were trying and unless someone at court is responsible for your current condition you didnt make any enemies either he gave her one of his odd sideways looks you really are a most unnatural female strangely that didnt sound as if he meant it as an insult or even a criticism i like that im glad someone does since that is genevieves chief complaint about me she replied look i just dont see any point in obfuscation when theres no need for it and there isnt here you are afraid that people will be afraid of your wizardly power but that doesnt necessarily have to happen now werent you just telling me that people found you amusing more or less he admitted then keep being amusing but add a few tricks she told him you know silly little things nothing enormous and when people ask you just say modestly oh i can do a few things for parties not every wizard can call down lightning after all and yes i know you can she said stopping him before he could interject that but they dont have to know he blinked at her she had come to the conclusion that he blinked while he was thinking hard not because she had baffled him or said something that made no sense i was an amusing fellow to have about because i had no real power and was not a threat i will still be an amusing fellow to have about perhaps even more amusing with a few petty tricks in my pocket because they will think that i still have no power he smiled a little that all i am you might say is anecdotes and fireworks can you do fireworks she asked curiously he looked offended of course i can every wizard can the kind with charcoal and saltpeter and the kind with illusions its rather expected of us the tradition demands it she had to laugh at that so are you going to be the bumbling wizard he blinked some more noid rather not the absentminded one would suit me better the one that forgets he has a frog in his pocket perhaps not a frog she suggested not the best guest at a party singing bird then he pondered that i had better make friends with some birds cake crumbs she told him out of a wealth of experience of being bored at outdoor galas and feeding a myriad of hungry songbirds with an endless stream of crumbled cakes ill take that under advisement he finished his soup and looked at the next course curiously what in heavens name is that it looks like one of those meat pies you get at taverns onlyelongated an experiment we seem to have a superfluity of rabbits so the cook suggested this might be nice the cook had suggested this variation on a beef dish as something suitable for just two or three people she trusted his her its judgment quite simply it was mushroomandshallot paste spread over pastry the whole then rolled around some boned pieces of rabbit forgive me if im a little worried about a dish that a creature who doesnt eat has produced as an experiment sebastian poked at it with his fork dubiously then cut off an end and tried it his expression went from dubious to delighted its good he exclaimed she grinned but said nothing it was dark by the time they were done and one of the servants carried a candle ahead of them to light their way which was just one of those things that reminded her that she wasnt in an ordinary household anymore she was usually in her own rooms by dark and had gotten used to seeing or not seeing sapphire puttering invisibly about seeing a floating candlestick now how can i possibly invite people here when theyre going to see something like that he exclaimed gesturing at the candle well well now hes actually thinking about it by making it into something people will want to see she pointed out look who were the folk you invited here in the first place ermmostly a few folk who came for the hunting he said i mean the forest has been practically unhunted for years now i probably have more game out here than any other noble within an easy ride of the city and i assume most of those few people are unlikely to be put off by invisible servants and floating candles she hazarded he thought about that as they passed through empty rooms and murdercorridors probably not he said finally they werent unnerved by the manor itself after all so while theyre here tell them you only have a few of these servants have everyone but a handful take off their armbands and then act as if everything is perfectly normal she made a face that he couldnt see in the dark remembering what eric had said about being ignored as if he wasnt there i very much suspect that theyll be pleased rather than otherwise oh it will be unnerving at first so perhaps what you should do is have a very few people here at first young ones that will enjoy the novelty or be impressed by the magic i suspect once they get over floating objects the situation will suit them down to the ground huh you could be right then once word gets around that you have this wizardly manor with invisible servants people will want to see it for the thrill youll have more people angling for invitations than you know what to do with they arrived at the music roomand she turned to face him and before you ask me what to do then its very simple you tell people that you can only conjure up so many servants for a few days out of the month and youre very sorry but until youve rested and gotten your power back it probably wouldnt be good to visit unless they are prepared to tend themselves and cook their own meals oho he had to chuckle at that but then he spotted the congregation of instruments at the other end of the music room right by the fireplace unlike the times when the musicians played for dancing they all had wooden stands with candles affixed to them in front of their chairs and sheets of music paper on the stands since she wasnt encumbered by skirts she was pleased to see that some of the straw mattresses from target practice had been arranged into a very comfortablelooking loungingthing on the floor near the fire and covered with a beautiful velvet coverlet she happily curled up on it and after a moment of hesitation sebastian followed suit sitting down with a stiffly decorous distance between them he seemed acutely aware of her legs pointedly not looking at them fortunately for his composure he had plenty to look at with the five instrumentalists right in front of them when she and sebastian were settled and the only sound was the crackling of the fire rather than the muffled rustling of the straw they began sebastians features relaxed and his mouth began to curve into a smile his head nodded slightly in time to the music and it was obvious that he was not just pleased but quite impressed seeing that he was happy she relaxed and gave herself over to the music as well the time theyd had to practice together was obvious to her she could tell they were much better and played more as a unit than they had when she had first started listening to them sebastian closed his eyes and settled back after the third piece no longer trying to maintain that stiff distance between them she wasnt the sort who closed her eyes to listen to music but she did make herself marginally more comfortable and let her mind drift not thinking of anything in particular she didnt recognize any of the pieces they werent dance numbers and it was clear to her at least that they were meant to be listened to as opposed to danced to most of them were far too slow to dance to anyway and contained tempo changes and pauses that a dancer would find very annoying she had not been to very many concerts in the homes of the extremely wealthy genevieve was bored out of her mind by such things and unfortunately most of those had been marred by people incessantly gossiping and drowning out the softer passages she would very much have liked to be able to sit up near the front with the folk who were actually there to listen to the music but she had been stuck with genevieve and the twins and they were inevitably seated in the back of the room with others like themselves who only saw the concert as another excuse to continue whatever conversation theyd been having the last time they saw each other thiswas lovely oh there were moments even she recognized as fumbling and missed notes even though she didnt know the music there always were when the spirit elementals played but those were few and far between and she was listening alongside someone whose pleasure in the melodies was so acute he practically radiated it sebastian hasnt had many moments of pleasure since the curse came on him she didnt know how she knew that except of course that she knew him she could guess what his anguish had been the first time hed awakened in the imprisoning cell and been told what had happened to him she could imagine the number of times he really had contemplated throwing himself out of a window and the restraint it had taken not to she had a very good idea of the terribly lonely nights he had spent certain that no cure for his condition would ever be found how terrible had it been to see his fathers liegemen and their allies desert him even before he changed as eric acted as his guardian and how betrayed had he felt when the very servants slipped away afterward he must have wondered what it was he had done to make them all despise him so much that they wouldnt remain even to take advantage of him my father loved this piece he said very quietly so as not to disrupt the music she turned from watching the harp strings vibrating to look at him he smiled wryly i know from what youve heard about him you probably wouldnt think of him as a music lover but he was it was one of the rare things we shared he went to many concerts when we were in the city though that was rarely he hated court he had musicians come out here and had several of the servants who expressed an interest trained to play as well it was a welcome duty for them since it meant lighter duties elsewhere he had very oldfashioned tastes and this was one of his favorite pieces i i honestly never thought id hear it again greatly moved by this she impulsively put her hand atop his shivering a little at her own daring and at the odd thrill the touch of his hand gave her he went very still for just a moment and she wondered if she had transgressed but then he turned his hand upward and clasped hers nothing more than that but she thought nothing had ever felt so right so comfortable and comforting as his hand holding hers he closed his eyes again and she went back to watching the musical instruments seem to play themselves but something had changed between them there was a bond perhaps it had been there for some time but now they had acknowledged it she frowned a little then and attuned her mind to search for the pressure of the tradition because if that was what was responsible well there was pressure all right but it was not trying to shove her at sebastian it definitely stirred and took interest when she thought tentatively about how handsome eric was when he smiled but when she thought tenderly about sebastians funny little habit of pushing his glasses up on his nose and tilting his head to the side when she puzzled him it withdrew as if offended ha thus reassured she went back to enjoying the music and the warmth of sebastians hand clasping hers finally there came a pause which made him open his eyes again and then the harp tentatively played a few notes of what she recognized as a familiar old lullaby sebastian laughed all right my friends let this be your last piece he let go of her hand and clasped both of his on his knee its become a custom among musicians playing a concert that when they are tired and want to stop they play a lullaby as a gentle hint of course not every host is willing to take that hint and rather too often he ignores the first lullaby and the second and only yields at the third i however am not that meanspirited she smiled and nodded and the rest of the players took up the melody that the harp had begun playing it three times slower each time until the last tender notes fell softly into the air and ended in stillness and so after a long moment the instruments rose into the air and were carried out leaving the two of them alone sebastian rose to his feet and held out his hand to help her up that was the best gift that anyone has given me in a very very long time and the crowning gift of a day full of them he said still holding her hand and looking down into her eyes i really do not have the words to thank you youve done all these wonderful things for me and all i have done for you was to lacerate your foot the last surprised a laugh out of her he grinned back but he still didnt let go of her hand it wasnt the laceration i minded so much she said lightly it was the thought of genevieve in charge of the household but strangely enough that seems to be working itself out perhaps because without the stepdaughter there the tradition is allowing her to be herself and not what it wants her to be he replied startling her with the same insight that she had had i wonder what would happen if the stepdaughter never went back or at least not as the rival in the household she caught her breath you cannot possibly be saying that you want me to stay is that so revolting to you he still didnt let go of her hand but he looked stricken i know i might never be rid of this curse oh thats nothing she exclaimed well then would you consider it would you allow me to speak to your father once the king allows me to his gaze begged her i know you are my friend and i have not had a real friend but eric in a very very long time but would you ever consider wedding me i know this is very sudden perhaps this offends you but i hope not and i am afraid that once you can leave here your father may decide the only way to make sure you are safe is to arrange a marriage for you with someone you dont even know at least you know me and you like me many good marriages are made in friendship i dont ask you to love me but i dont think i can do without you now that i know you she found herself stammering ii suppose soif the king allows itif my father thats all i ask he kissed her hand before releasing it you deserve to be more than anyone has allowed you to be until now that may be the only gift i can give you that will equal a part of what you can give me if you stay with your father you wont really have that if another marriage is arranged i think you would have less than you have with your father in my house you will have freedom she hardly knew how she got back to her rooms after they parted she felt very much in a daze not exactly sure how she felt about him that she liked him immensely oh yes absolutely but love not so sure of that not sure at all he was right though in that the longer she stayed in her fathers house the more she would become the unregarded old maid the glorified and unpaid housekeeper and the more genevieve would fester pushed by the tradition into an equally unhappy role her only escape would be that one she had wistfully contemplated the little herbalist shop perhaps to grow into a granny no definitely to grow into a granny granny and the godmother just about said as much but now she was going to be a sorceress she wasnt going to be a witch the equivalent to the wizard she was sure of that her talents definitely did not lie in that direction she had been brought into the circle of those who knew about the tradition and had spoken to a godmother sebastian had just offered her her own household and if the servants were on the unconventional side well so was she but was that enough without loving him and did he love her i dont think i can do without you was not quite the same genevieve is perfectly prepared to make a match for the twins without any love involved she reminded herself and the twins will jump through a fire for a title or enough wealth why should i be worried about love when my husband and i would be friends not just partners in anexchange she put both hands to her temples there were still two months to go before either of them could do anything about this the king was not going to lift his edict which was that three moons must pass since the one when she had been bitten a great deal could happen in two months time look how much had happened to her in one sebastian might decide he loathed her she might decide she loathed him they both might decide this was the best idea of the century the godmother might oppose it the king might oppose it her father might oppose it a mob of torchbearing peasants might discover that sebastian was a werewolf and come storming the manor they might actually fall in love they might she made her way into her bed hardly noticing sapphires ministrations but the spirit elemental didnt seem to take any offense she had been certain that she would never be able to sleep and took up the book on the tradition with the certainty that she would still be reading by morning with the predictable result that she fell asleep with the book still in her hands and woke in the morning rather earlier than usual with a slightly stiff neck and no more idea of what she was going to do than shed had when she went to bed last night she wrote out her usual letter to her father telling him about everything except sebastians proposal and the way that eric had beaten the poacher she got it into the box before her father would be at his desk with a sigh of relief the last thing she wanted him to do was not find his usual letter since he already knew she was going out with eric and would assume that something terrible had happened to her his letter was not in there yet so all was well sapphire hovered at the closet the movement back and forth of her ribbon telling bella that the servant didnt know what clothing to bring out is eric back yet she asked the slate rose the chalk scratched no came the reply mesa this morning not back mor daze message how how on earth does he get a message back here she asked pijin ohwell that made sense she knew there were several households in the city that kept pigeons for carrying messages for that matter her father had some at the warehouse for sending urgent messages back and forth from the port and given that eric wasnt a magician a pigeon or a human messenger would be the only way for him to let sebastian know if he was going to be delayed or detained a human messenger was not a good choice all things considered well in that case the same thing i wore last night she declared a pair of sebastians breeches one of my bodices and a shirt of some sort if sebastian was offering her freedom well she would see how he took to her walking about in breeches sapphire whisked out of the closet with a pair of rather lovely buttery fawncolored suede breeches a bodice of a darker brown and a creamcolored blouse with huge sleeves caught up by ribbons at the wrist that she didnt even know she had and just as sapphire finished lacing up the bodice there was a faint tap at the door it opened and a pair of beautiful soft brown leather boots came gliding in now she could see immediately that these boots werent new but the spirit elementals had cleaned them buffed them and refreshed them until they were actually better than new for they had none of the stiffness of new boots or shoes sapphire steadied her as she tried them on they were only a little too big not enough to matter not even enough for an extra pair of socks she had a good idea where they had come from theyd probably belonged to sebastians mother she doubted very much that he would recognize a pair of her boots a gown perhaps or perhaps not but not a pair of boots footwear was not exactly memorable not this sort of footwear anyway she felt a twinge of amusement at some of the incredible shoes and dancing slippers genevieve had ordered both for herself and the twins and she supposed it was possible one of the twins wouldbe swains would remember a pair of that fanciful footgear but probably not well since eric wasnt going to be here and they werent going out on a patrol that left her morning free for other things although this might be a test of sorts while she watched her father in the mirror and read his letter she thought about that she was supposed to be counterfeiting erics new undergamekeeper he might be testing her with this to see if she was up to the challenge of at least a limited patrol alone all right then she would do it in her coat no one would be able to tell she was a woman and she could get back with plenty of time to put in some work in the stillroom before she met sebastian for dinner and her magic lesson a fine plan i need my horse saddled and ready she told sapphire who whisked away she explained her plan to sebastian who readily agreed it was a good idea ate her breakfast as quickly as she could manage and went out on her ride she returned with a tangle of snares in her saddlebag in good time to get some work done in the stillroom she had a suspicion about those snares because they had been just a little too easy to find and it would not have been difficult for eric to set them up before he rode off to the city if that was true she would definitely have passed the test and if it was not she could report with some satisfaction to eric that abel had made his solo presence known to the poachers there was a basket of things waiting for her on the stillroom workbench when she opened the door the various items that granny and godmother elena had promised her and the recipes she would be using them in there were two she was able to complete before lunch and three more which required much more steeping and combining and distilling that she got started all in all a good morning she brought the two completed items with her a powder and a decoction when she came down to dinner sebastian greeted her with a happy grin and her concoctions with a whistle of appreciation i dont know what it is but i have no luck at making these things he said ruefully over rabbit stewed in wine they still had an overabundance of rabbits in the larder thanks to all the ground she and eric had been covering i either measure it wrongly or i steep it too long or not enough or i boil it over when i try to distill she paused a moment and sucked on her spoon maybe i am a witch after all she hazarded witches are supposed to be very good with herbs and potions and all that sort of thing but so are sorceresses he reminded her its not just what you are good with its what you are good at well that was true she wasnt any good at transformations which was a witch specialty nor the little cousin of transformations illusions the stable cats were absolutely indifferent to her and generally you could not manage to walk through a witchs house without having to shove aside half a dozen cats witches were quite good at sending their spirits out piggybacking on animals and birds her spirit stayed quite stubbornly in her body refusing to budge on the other hand when it came to the manipulation of sheer raw magical energy her control was getting better and more precise every day and that was certainly the hallmark of a sorceress but if you havent any luck making the components she began ah you see a wizard doesnt have to thats why he has an apprentice sebastian laughed ill tell you the truth the absentminded wizard is more true of me than i would like to admit making components bores me and thats half the reason why im no good at it aha now the truth comes out she said with amusement thank godmother elena for sending me the ingredients then he snorted godmother elena was getting tired of sending me the components every time i begged her and so was granny when i actually dared to approach her which i didnt unless i couldnt help it he retorted its hardly difficult for magicians like them and in the godmothers case its not as if she was making them herself no it was her brownies who were doing it and if she sends components to every whining wizard bella responded thats scarcely a good use of her time but other wizards have apprentices he mockpouted ive never had one until now apprentices are supposed to do all the boring work for you this was a great improvement over the melancholy sebastian she liked this version of him much better she mimed a cuff at him across the table he ducked and grinned all right lets go get to work she told him youve stuffed your face quite enough i want to see if you actually know how to do anything with my hard work and if i dont he asked archly she growled at him then i will stand over you and make you concoct the rest of the list yourself he was not in the least cowed good thing i do know exactly what to make with your welcome bounty then come on apprentice lets see if you can master the next lesson i have for you the horse she still didnt know its name since eric evidently didnt think that the name of a horse was important eeled his way along a game trail that bella could scarcely make out eric was right the horses he used did know all the trails all she had to do was start the beast down one and it did the rest she was a little farther afield than usual but this was an easier part of the forest easier to spot the rabbit runs and easier to see the snares as she rode bella had that backoftheneckprickling feeling that always came when she was being watched not that this disturbed her in fact if it was the poachers she wanted to be watched she was proving that even while eric was disporting himself among the ladies of purchasable virtue in the city abel his new undergamekeeper was more than adequate to taking up his patrols this would please eric and it would cement her identity in his mind as abel in the two days he had been gone so far she had collected a proper number of snares not so many that she could have said for certain that eric had left them for her to find but quite enough to prove that she was not slacking off in his absence as for sebastian since the night he had made his proposal he had not made any more overtly romantic overtures but his entire manner had changed for the better he laughed more he no longer had that haunted look about him he was even tentatively talking about what he might do if he was given leave to come back to court so he had stopped thinking about it as an impossibility and had begun contemplating it as something he wanted to do if anything she was fonder of this new sebastian than of the old she finished her patrol a good handful of snares but no rabbits which was something of a relief because she was looking forward to something other than rabbit for supper tonight and headed back toward the manor the feeling of being watched did not ebb thatsodd was someone following her she didnt look back to see the horse didnt act as if it thought there was someone else out here but that didnt mean much i wish dogs could stand being around sebastian at least if i went out with a dog hed alert me to a follower she wanted to get back to the manor fairly quickly today there were two more of sebastians components that needed some tending and more important the godmothers greenfaced mirror servant had promised the results of his researches into the traditional tales of protective werecreatures if they couldnt manage to break or counter the curse this might be their only chance of turning it from a liability into something useful something that even the king could approve of in fact it would be one thing for the king to grudgingly grant sebastian the freedom to spend a few days a month at court it would be quite another for the king to decide that sebastian wolf or man was an asset if someone wanted to trail her all the way back to the manor well that was his time wasted instead she played the part of abel to the hilt whistling once she reached the actual road shed have preferred to sing but her voice would definitely have given the game away she remembered how angry it used to make her when the housekeeper would waggle her head when she whistled as a child and quote the old adage a whistling girl and a crowing hen always come to some bad end she used to counter it with the other adage a whistling girl and a wise old sheep are two of the best things a farmer can keep then housekeeper would frown and say well but your fathers not a farmer now is he it was as it turned out a good thing she had learned to whistle especially as she was whistling little ball of yarn a bawdy tune no proper young lady would ever admit to knowing she still felt that being watched look as she entered the gate into the courtyard and one of the spirit elementals closed it behind her then came to take the horse well its probably nothing but my imagination at this point reveling in the freedom that the breeches gave her she ran into the manor and straight for the stillroom after ensuring that the next stage of her concoction was well under way coldpressing a long and tedious process but one which fortunately only needed to be dealt with once every half day or so she ran back up to her rooms and impatiently sat before the mirror just when she was getting ready to prod the recalcitrant servant into appearing her control of magic had progressed to the point where she was fairly certain she could do just that his face appeared greetings isabella he said i have mixed results i shall be as brief as one such as i can in my researches i have indeed come upon creatures who will act as protectors and who switch from animal to human form the difficultly lies in the fact that those creatures are invariably one of two types they are either wholly magical in nature such as the foxspirit the rus firebird or zharptica or they are in fact animals who have somehow gained the ability to become a human even though he had no shoulders she got the sense of a shrug it is as if i fear that while transforming from animal to human brings out the best in these creatures transforming from human to animal brings out the worst in a man unless it is the purely voluntary and magical transformation spell which most godmothers and a few magicians have mastered the one that does not require the shedding of blood nor the belt of the skin of the creature you wish to become she felt her heart sink but the mirror servant was not done quite yet now having said that it is a fact that sebastian has not killed anyone he hasnt exactly had the opportunity she demurred pish he could easily have killed you the servant chided her if you please i am trying to research a path out of this dilemma failing being able to break the magic on him now may i continue she apologized he peered at her as if to determine whether or not the apology was sincere when he decided that it was he picked up where he had left off you will recall that we had determined that this was done to sebastian by means of magic though whether it is a cursespell or an actual curse which does not require a magician to set it correct since the face waited patiently after this she assumed she was supposed to respond yes i have been told that this was a curse and that you hadnt wait what is the difference between a curse and a simple spell the face beamed now there you are that is the real question isnt it the difference my dear sorceress is passion she gave this careful thought the servant allowed her to take her time evidently there was no one else clamoring for it or perhaps it too had apprentices who could take over the more mundane task of telling callers i am sorry but the godmother is unavailable would you care to leave a message sebastian has been quite adamant that i am supposed to keep emotion at bay when i work magic she said slowly because emotion interferes with control yes the face said smiling genially hes right when i get upset or worried i cant concentrate or when i happen to notice how sebastians eyes take on a stormygray color when hes unhappy and a green glint when hes bother not now think this through indeed the servant encouraged but was there ever a time when emotion had made it easier to concentra when eric tried to bully me just before i was bitten i was truly angry and it made me sharper i knew exactly what to say and how to say it i was able to figure out from how he stood and the expression on his face what he was likely to do next and when i was frightened when those poachers attacked us that made me very sharp too i knew instantly that i couldnt get to my knife and it wasnt as if i even thought about it my hand went right to the quiver i got a crossbow bolt and i used it like a knife she paused i think i would have to say in both cases i was very passionate the face bobbed and there you have it fear anger hate pain all these things can create a singlemindedness that surpasses everything a trained will can do not everyone has this sort of mental quirk many i would say most people become more confused when they are consumed by passion but those who possess this same talent as you are able to cast curses this is why incredibly powerful curses can be cast by the dying and the desperate the tradition of course has a lot to do with this as well it responds to an exceedingly wellworn traditional path and puts all the force of its power behind the curse but before the tradition can feel this the passion itself must be singleminded if its not if the passion does not have a single object and a single goal in its focus then the tradition cant sense it she shivered despite being cozily close to the fire its like this giant slug isnt it incredibly powerful but so stupid that it will always follow the path of least resistance and always be attracted to she paused feeling a moment of startled epiphany what it feeds on very good the face beamed at her you are going to make a quite outstanding magician i do believe yes we think that the tradition feeds on derives its power from emotion at least in part so this may explain why it does what it does it knows as a slug knows that if it forces matters into this shape there will be a richer reward so it does all right so what does this have to do with sebastian she asked it means that he didnt have to actually do something that he remembers to cause someone to hate him enough to cast a curse it means that for all we know it could have been something completely out of his control but that in turn means that we or more precisely he may be able to alter the curse casting a curse on the curse so to speak but why cant the godmother oh exactly she has a hundred concerns as pressing as sebastian there is no way she can muster enough passion only sebastian himself can or the person who cast it i suppose she said thoughtfully sapphire moved over to the fire and threw a few pinecones on it for the pleasant scent if we could find that person and persuade him of the wrong he had done sebastian and make him sufficiently remorseful the face bobbed in agreement but grimaced that is why the original caster can remove a curse when no one else can and that is why it is so rare for him to do so or her since females are extremely good at casting curses you are very passionate creatures males are told from childhood to restrain their passions females are not now it is true that for most magic control is what is important but that is not true in curses in a curse it is the passion that creates the powerful curse females therefore are better at casting curses it was her turn to grimace at a memory of one of those moments when she had realized just how unfair life was it had been another childs tenth birthday fete when she was very young and her mother had still been alive the event had been enormous for the father of the birthday child was fabulously wealthy and his father wished both to demonstrate that wealth and indulge his child with the most insanely elaborate party anyone in the city had ever seen not even the princes birthday fete the next week rivaled it people were still talking about it to this day in fact the princes celebration had been quite modest by comparison just the usual distribution of food and blankets to the poor and free wine to drink the princes health in all the taverns presumably there had been a party for the boy but only a choice few had been invited i wonder if that was allowed on purpose she suddenly thought the prince and darian errolf were the same age and if i were king and wanted to deflect the ire of evil magicians and the attention of the tradition from my child i think id welcome some idiot throwing a fete that was fit for a prince come to think of it darian never was the same after that he was always doing dangerous things and sneaking off to learn sword work no matter what his father did he never would settle down to learn the business and two years ago he stole a warhorse and vanished good thing he had a younger brother who would have turned himself inside out to please their father or there would have been no one to become the next errolf of house of errolf i wonder what the ending of that tale is going to be well the point was there had been races on ponies for wonderful prizes but not just any ponies these had been colored up in every shade imaginable by magic illusion or transformation really didnt matter for the effect and of course every child wanted a ride and of course many fell off because not all the children were good riders or even riders at all and she remembered two children who must have been the same age sitting on the grass of the racecourse also softened by magic because it wouldnt do for anyones child to get more than a bruise or two crying after being thrown almost identically one was a boy and one a girl the girl had been picked up by her nanny petted cooed at and taken off for cake but the boy had been pulled up to his feet by his caretaker his shoulder had been given a shake and he had been told in no uncertain terms that he was shaming his father and he was to stop crying and be a man and he had and she had known at that moment with complete astonishment that the world was unfair sometimes it was worse to be a boy on the other hand the face went on when a man can muster up the passion to cast a curse all that repression generally makes him twice as effective as a woman lovely she said dryly so what do you think sebastian and i should do you wont be able to break the curse but if he can do this if he can either find the leverage or the emotional energy he can alter the curse and the best alteration would be the one you wanted to find the tradition for the protective werebeast the werewolf curse takes his mind away if he could keep and control his mind even if he cant control what his body becomes he wouldnt be a danger anymore the face bobbed with satisfaction now the way to get this result would be to concentrate on what he wants as he is actually transforming because that will be when the curse is the most vulnerable and make it as simple and direct as possible not asking for much are you if it was easy everyone who was cursed would be able to do it the face said quite as if it had read her mind all right ill go tell him she said as her stomach reminded her that it had been a very long time and quite a lot of vigorous exercise since breakfast and thank you she added a little embarrassed that she had let momentary annoyance interfere with what should have been gratitude that the servant had done all that research for them and given her what amounted to another magic lesson to boot you are welcome the servant said politely but with an encouraging smile best of luck to you she hurried down to dinner to find that eric was back and deep in conversation with sebastian disappointed that she wouldnt be able to tell sebastian her news right away but not wanting to interrupt what looked and sounded important she just gestured to the spirit elemental waiting at her place to serve her she didnt even notice what she was eating she was waiting so impatiently for the two of them to end whatever their discussion was about does seem like a delicate situation sebastian was saying with a frown eric shrugged thats what the factor says im not sure that delicate is the word i would use the king and his council are all sitting on the fence the problem with being on the fence is that if you arent careful youll get knocked off and trampled on and the prince sebastian asked i dont remember him as being indecisive wants to take the army to the border and present a united front against waldenstein wont move until his father says to though the king thinks sending some sort of diplomatic party to take the lay of the land is the better idea and hes not all that enthused about supporting lorraine erics lip twisted a little but bella couldnt make out whether it was contempt for diplomacy or contempt for lorraine maybe both but lorraine is our ally sebastian objected waving his fork wildly in the air it was a good thing it was empty so is waldenstein eric reminded him and waldenstein has a bigger army sebastian rubbed his temples this is not good is the godmother involved how would i know that you tell me youre the magician eric retorted then added id be surprised if she wasnt though sebastian muttered under his breath bella couldnt make out what he was saying then he spoke louder what we need is a nice thaw along the border to make things mushy he said that would buy us time waldenstein has a lot of heavy cavalry and they cant move in the mush why dont you arrange that erics tone made it clear he was joking but sebastian answered seriously i just might be able to im already the most powerful magician in this part of the country and with bella to help it would be easier not easy magic never is but easier eric looked astonished probably as astonished as bella felt sebastian was more or less assuming she would help with a major work that was incredible she could scarcely believe he was trusting her with any part of something this big so early in her studies anytime you mucked about with weather it was major so many things to go wrongso many things you could unbalance ill have to consult with the godmother first of course but if its a good idea she will probably get others to join the effort sebastian pushed away from the table and bella caught a flicker of satisfaction on erics face it surprised her why would eric be satisfied that sebastian was going to undertake some major magic this sort of thing needed days weeks to set up in advance and if you added more magicians to the mix it would get even more complicated and add more time and he wouldnt have any time to do anything else this was after all a priority this might be another reason why father has been looking so worried and not just about me war is never good for trade maybe you had better go back to the city and keep me informed sebastian continued youve got my note making you my representative that will get you access to the court or at least the kings officials take a lot more pigeons with you eric nodded i can do that ive got ears everywhere he grinned lots of them are attached to pretty little heads too there is nothing like a chambermaid for hearing whats really going on youll need money for bribes and tips sebastian pulled a small square of paper out of one of the capacious pockets of his overrobe and took out one of his enchanted pens that made their own ink from a special holder on the left side of his chest he wrote out something in tiny meticulous letters then waved the paper in the air to dry it here im authorizing the factor to release as much as you need from the surplus eric folded it and put the paper into his pocket that will help palace servants arent cheap only negotiable and accurate information is worth whatever you have to pay for it sebastian stood up i need to go talk to the godmother ill go pack for a longer trip eric glanced over at bella and grinned and abel will be the new gamekeeper for a while eh something about the way he said that gave her an odd feeling she couldnt quite place what it was a vague unease but why dont see why not she replied have you spotted my collection of snares i left them hanging in the barn on their own pegs so you would see them he grinned i have keep up the good work and with that he pushed away from the table leaving bella to finish her dinner alone when she had she went straight up to the workroom she found sebastian sitting in front of a mirror just about big enough to allow someone to walk through it if they stooped until they had consulted the servant together the other day it had been covered by a drape at the moment it was black he looked up at the sound of her footstep it seems the godmother is already in the capitol consulting with the king the mirror servant said that he would give her my message about using a thaw to make it difficult for waldenstein to move its army on the border then he frowned its odd the servant didnt act as if the situation was as urgent as eric thought maybe the godmother already has a solution in place she suggested eric couldnt possibly have known that if he left the city this morning i suppose thats possible sebastian brooded for a moment perhaps the mirror servant just doesnt think the possibility of warfare is imminent but eric did seem impatient to get back and find out what was going on or maybe eric just wants to get back to the city and have a good time spending all that money you gave him access to she thought that but she didnt say it in the first place it was none of her business and in the second he had been confined here just as long as sebastian had that letter making him sebastians representative he would get what he had wanted for a very long time now the respect of the nobles and if he somehow made himself useful to the king having a wizard you can call on as fast as the pigeon flies might do that then the king could do what no one else could he could ennoble eric himself grant him a title of his own knight might be too much to hope for but he could certainly get esquire of course if the country went to war knight was not out of the question either provided you were useful enough much higher titles than that had been granted to bastards and even commoners who proved their worth to the king in war well this gives me a chance to tell you what the servant told me she said feeling the excitement all over again as she carefully laid out what shed been advised he listened intently his gaze brightening thisthis is brilliant reasoning he said finally it makes perfect sense and i really wont care if im a wolf three days out of the month as long as im still under control of myself mind itll be useful witches take years to learn to transform themselves and i already have this form oh granted all i have is a single form but its a powerful one one that can attack and defend itself travel for miles without having to stop for a rest hide just about anywhere first you have to make this whole alteringcurse thing work and you are the only one who can she cautioned the servant said it wouldnt be easy and it probably wont happen the first time you try his chin firmed im not giving up no matter how many times it fails it will only take one success to turn this werewolf curse into a blessing and then ill be able to go anywhere youre going to alter your curse eric said from the doorway his brows furrowing ive never heard of anyone doing that before just because no one has that doesnt mean that no one can sebastian replied this has the sanction of the godmother herself she thinks i can alter it so that even though i make the change my own mind remains instead of reverting to the beast oh really erics brows furrowed more i see what you mean by being able to go anywhere then youd be just another magician who can transform himself only three nights a month sebastian reminded him eric laughed it sounded a little forced three nights when you can be the nastiest thing in the forest and almost the nastiest out of it he replied youll scarcely need me then oh dont be ridiculous ill always need you sebastian told him as he rummaged through a drawer for one of the sticks of graphite and a sheet of paper meanwhile i take it you came to say goodbye eric nodded brusquely im spending the night but ill be gone before youre awake and i know you you are going to be working on that business of changing the weather past supper i want to get to the city in good time to establish myself if i am going to be representing you i need to update my wardrobe and hire a few more servants for the town house i cant bring important folk to talk and not have enough servants sebastian nodded absently his mind clearly already on other things do whatever you need to well be using the place anyway once i alter this curse and the more you do now the less youll have to do later then he turned away from the diagram he was sketching out to give eric a warm smile i dont know what i would have done without you all this time you know eric nodded somberly all right then im for an early bed and an early rise luck he left before either of them could say anything for a moment just a moment bella stared after him a fleeting thought passing through her mind had eric seemed less than pleased with their plans but no that was ridiculous sebastian had trusted eric all his life and with his life eric could have been rid of sebastian a dozen times in the past five years and no one would have faulted him for it hes probably just worried what will happen if sebastian fails he must have seen sebastians hopes crushed a hundred times and he doesnt want sebastian hurt anymore eric did seem to be the pessimistic sort certainly the cynical sort well we will just have to keep at it until we do actually alter the curse we both know it wont be easy but we both know it will be worth it eventually eric will see that too they had worked over the calculations and diagrams for the weatheraltering plan until supper and beyond eric had been right the two of them worked feverishly until their stomachs began growling but they didnt have to send anyone for food sapphire and azure the spirit elemental who generally attended sebastian in the workroom turned up shortly after that with another tray full of little bits of savory things they could just pick up and eat with one hand this was complicated stuff and bella was quite frankly thrilled and more than a little frightened that sebastian had decided that she should help work on it he had brought out maps consulted the mirror servant about the usual weather patterns at this time of year asked him to figure out what if any problems a rise in temperature would cause the local inhabitants then began drawing out the lines of power that ran from the manor to that part of the kingdom and from there he began making his calculations with bella doublechecking them he had to figure out how much change there would be how fast for every little rise in the temperature of course there was no way to measure the temperature rising but he didnt need to be able to do that what he was using was a day if i make the land and air feel like the start of march the second week of march the end of march the beginning of april finally he found the ideal day the th of april if he caused the entire border on the waldenstein side to think it was that date the deep snow that was there now would quickly become mush the longer he held the spell in place the more snow would melt and the deeper the mud would become soon it would become impossible for wagons and heavy horses to pass and if they could not then so much for the passage of the waldenstein army that took care of the date they needed to match then came a much more mundane calculation how deeply into waldenstein lands should he go to make a proper barrier that would serve as a deterrent he wanted to cover enough territory that it really became a slog but he didnt want to affect more than that because this was going to throw off the whole growing season within that area for at least a year then because of course as soon as this started to happen although it was a very novel technique waldenstein magicians would know what he was doing and try to counter it he began computing the countermeasures to their countermeasures and when all of that was done the magical parameters had to be calculated all over again adding the powers and abilities of more magicians eventually though they had to stop enough he said we have enough for the godmother there is no point in spending too much time on something she will either approve as it stands modify or throw out altogether it is weather magic it is nothing you trifle with and for all i know shell decide that instead of being subtle this situation warrants calling in a flight of dragons or more likely calling a half dozen more godmothers and setting up a winter carnival on the spot a youre joking she looked at him askance he shook his head not a bit of it shes done it before and who would dare bring an army across a spot full of godmothers no one in his right mind she agreed and found herself yawning my head is full and my eyes are starting to close by themselves mine too he looked at her across the little table they were working at and then unexpectedly leaned over it and kissed her at first her reaction was surprise this was not the first time that a man had kissed her although she had no serious suitors now she had had three before the twins came of age well they were serious even if she hadnt been one had been a tentative kisser one a demanding kisser and one had kissed her as if it was a duty sebastian was nothing like any of them he was confident without being demanding and although she sensed he would withdraw immediately if she reacted poorly she could tell he was enjoying this so was she a wonderful wave of warmth enveloped her quite a lot she closed her eyes and leaned toward him just allowing herself to feel instead of think it was very very nice it was more than nice her lips parted a little and he licked and nibbled at them sending all manner of pleasantly thrilling sensations up and down her body and slowly regretfully he drew back i think i had better we had better stop now he said before things get quite enjoyable extremely messy and potentially damaging to glassware and papers feeling a little dizzy she realized that she hadnt taken a breath in quite a while she did so and stood up straighter oh my she said ah yes he blinked at her ermyes what your question the one you asked me about the answer is yes she took another deep breath i realize that just having been kissedlike thati am probably not in my right mind to be answering it but having just been kissed like that more or less is the answer and i it was her turn to blink bother too much talk more kissing and she leaned across the table and kissed him the result was not damaging to glassware or papers although it did take a little careful maneuvering to a spot beside the hearth a huge ancient bearskin where they could sit and continue the experience without wreaking havoc it didnt a little to her regret get to the point where there was clothing flying about but it did get to the point where buttons were unbuttoned some laces were undone and there was a certain amount of damage to hair and quite a bit of skin exposed there was not enough goingson to have caused a torchbearing mob to descend in fear of werewolf cubs appearing in a few months but there was enough to make her quite quite certain that the first kiss had not only not been a fluke it was the harbinger of better things to come she let sapphire help her the rest of the way out of her clothing and into a nightdress and robe in a bemused and preoccupied state of mind was it too early to hint about this to her father probably not he could very well get annoyed with her if she didnt give him some warning and her letters of late had been more full of the patrols with and without eric than they were of sebastian that might have been giving entirely the wrong impression sebastians a duke so far as genevieve is concerned he could be a hairy ape every day of the year as long as he has a title and she would be overjoyed with the marriage with her on my side i dont think father can stand against us honestly as long as she was happy he probably wouldnt even put up a token objection but there was something else she hadnt been telling him while shed talked about sebastian working magic and her own work in the stillroom she hadnt exactly told him and by the way father it seems im a sorceress she settled down with pen and paper to detail what she and sebastian had been doing all this time i hadnt quite made up my mind until now because i really wasnt sure that it meant anything but now that i have tonight helped with something very difficult and important i suppose it is time i confessed to you that i seem to be a magician there get that shock over with first anything that came afterward would seem mild by comparison when she had finished the letter it barely fit in the box and it was quite late she checked the box reflexively as she always did once she had put it inside the letter was gone short letters didnt always vanish immediately long ones however did peculiar with a feeling of satisfaction she stood up and stretched and froze as the tortured howl of a wolf echoed through the corridors this isnt possible it wasnt the full moon it was the new moon an icy hand seemed to stroke her back as her breath and heart stilled another howl close her body felt as if she had been hit by lightning sapphire flew in through the door and slammed it behind her just as something huge and heavy hit it the thump shook the room bella ran to the door to try to hold it in place more thumps as the wood shivered under her hand and her heart raced the servant dropped a bar across the door into slots meant to hold it there but it was obvious that the door wasnt going to hold up under this punishment for long that was what the gate of iron bars was meant for her mouth dried with terror silver she shouted to sapphire looking frantically for something herself finally spotting a branched candlestick that would have to do frenzied growls punctuated the thuds as the wolf continued to ram the door the bar shivered and cracked every time he hit sapphire and bella backed into a corner bellas heart was pounding so hard it felt as if it was going to leap out of her chest the bar shattered with a shriek of tortured wood splinters flew everywhere the door smashed open hitting the wall behind it and sebastianwolf leapt wildeyed into the room she hadnt gotten a good look at him out in the woods he had seemed huge then he seemed bigger now tall and rangy dark gray fur his muscles rippled with power beneath his skin he focused on bella immediately his yellow eyes blazing at her he sniffed twice taking in her scent he stalked toward her stifflegged growling no sign of anything human in his eyes fear set her nerves on fire she grasped the candlestick firmly in both hands her mind racing she couldnt fight him off she probably couldnt even hurt him that much not physically that left magic she sensed then saw magic swirling in confused eddies all through the room whirlpools of sparkling motes of light that danced and pulsed with a golden energy that was stronger than anything she had ever seen before she called them to her concentrating on keeping her will strong believing that she could control this power come she called it and the magic answered she felt it warm and sweet pouring toward her it streamed toward her like swarms of bees heading for the hive the streams gathered around her she spun them tighter and tighter until the resulting sphere of power glowed like a little moon and then she flung it at sebastian sebastian she called her voice cracking sebastian i order you remember the sphere of magic hit the wolf fullforce and enveloped him like an insect in amber he froze every hair on end as the air crackled and the power surged around him remember she called again putting every bit of her fear and her feelings for sebastian into the order remember who you are you are not a beast you are a man the wolf shook like a tree in a windstorm eyes huge and wild the power continued to whirl around him trying to penetrate whatever it was that was keeping it from fusing with him remember she ordered for the third time and threw aside the candlestick you are sebastian and i love you the power struck again and shattered some barrier that she could not see it was sucked into the wolf like water into parched ground the beast yelped convulsed then went rigid all over legs stiff and then slowly painfully raised its head she looked in its eyes and saw not the beast but the man but before she could move the sound of someone running shattered her concentration stand back eric shouted bursting through the broken door stand back i have him he raised a crossbow to his shoulder aiming it at sebastian i have him bella to her horror she saw the head of the bolt glinting silver fear stabbed her no but in the instant before he shot a silver candlestick flew past her shoulder knocking the crossbow aside but it went off anyway the bolt hitting sebastians hind leg and tearing a furrow across the skin and hide with a yelp of pain the wolf wheeled charged for the door and shouldered eric aside dashing out into the corridor again bella ran in hot pursuit ignoring eric she raced down the corridor bare feet slapping on the stone following the sound of skittering claws sebastian she called or tried to her sides aching and her throat burning as she tried to catch her breath he didnt even pause even wounded sebastian was unbelievably fast she reached the intersection of two corridors and paused uncertain no longer able to hear him running a moment later she heard the crashing of glass far off in the direction of the greenhouse by the time she reached the spot it was obvious what had happened sebastian had managed to find the greenhouse shoulder the door open and had thrown himself through one of the panes to escape out into the snow there was no trace of him but the footprints dark pits in the drifts heading into the forest she stood uncertain in her bare feet holding her aching side staring her heart pounding like a mad drum and fear making her want to burst into tears and sink down helplessly to the ground but she didnt dare do that he was all she had the only hope he had she fought down the tears and clasped her fists to her temples trying to think a flood of spirit elementals poured into the greenhouse probably attracted by the noise several of them ones she recognized by their colors as being in the not very bright category began working on a makeshift patch for the broken pane to keep the cold from pouring in two began sweeping up the glass the rest milled uncertainly but some were intelligent ones and more than that were outdoor workers shed actually seen their little bunches of leaves floating on the verge of the forest could they follow him you she snapped pointing to ribbons holding leaf bundles oak ash thorn birch track him find sebastian now the four designated stopped milling and rushed back out the door she headed for her room sure of only one thing she had to get out there and find him find him before eric did sapphire already had one of her breeches outfits ready and a pair of sturdy boots with the clothing was her handcrossbow a quiver of bolts meant to go on her belt another for her saddle and two knives follow thorn was already written on the slate she scrambled into the clothing with sapphires help and belted the crossbow quiver and one of the knives on a second belt over her coat there was something nagging at her something very wrong but she couldnt put her finger on it it was nagging at her so badly that before she ran out the door she stopped and snatched up her mirror flinging magic and the demand for the servant or the godmother to appear into it the servant appeared in it almost immediately looking startled what he exclaimed your summons was very urgent sebastians gone she interrupted him explaining quickly what had just happened her hands were shaking as she held the mirror the servants lips thinned your intuition is correct something is wrong it is more than sebastian transforming out of season much much more someone has altered the curse on him i will inform godmother elena find sebastian and at all costs keep eric from him she didnt even bother with saying farewell she just left the mirror on the table and dashed for the stables pulling on her gloves and tying her hood around her face as she ran a wide creamcolored ribbon with thorns stuck through it like pins bobbed beside the nose of her horse the horse was already saddled and ready she only paused long enough to fasten the quiver to the saddle then used the mounting block to get in place the ribbon dashed ahead the gates were already open not a good sign eric must be ahead of her but eric didnt have the spirit elementals helping she urged the horse into a canter he didnt like running in the dark like this but he obeyed her they sped down the edge of the forest this was definitely sebastian and not a wolf for a wolf would have gone to cover immediately but sebastian was trying desperately to find something he recognized as a trail thorns ribbon flew on as fast as a man could run or faster and he didnt seem impeded by the snow at all that ribbon is going to get lost in the snow and the dark she realized and impulsively seized a handful of magic and flung it after the vanishing bow like a snowball light follow she willed and the little sphere of power lit up with a mild glow following the servant as if it had been tied to thorn by a tether she made another and tossed it above her head now the horse could see where he was going he snorted and answered her rein and heel with eagerness instead of reluctance she had never seen one of the spirit elementals out in the snow before it left no trace on the top of the snow and sped along as if it was completely unimpeded the horse caught up to the ribbon just as it flitted through a gap in the underbrush and down a trail the horse was barely keeping up it plunged through snow that was at times chesthigh but her urgency had passed to it and it did so without hesitation or complaint thorn seemed to know exactly where to go and the few times that bella was able to spot anything like a track the prints did look like wolf tracks and there was blood spotting the snow black in the dim light from her orbs chill that had nothing to do with the cold wind cutting through her coat and numbing her hands and feet came over her im never going to find him in this forest if he hides what if he bleeds to death werewolves healed immediately from most wounds but not those caused by silver and the crossbow bolt that eric had fired had been tipped with silver but the spirit elemental was still speeding over the snow and there were three more out there somewhere tracking sebastian sebastian wouldnt see them not in his panicked state and she didnt think he would scent them either she had to believe in them believe that they could keep up with him that they could find him if he got out of their sight then abruptly the track turned off the path and into the deeper snow the track twisted and turned and doubled back on itself if the wolf wasnt in charge then sebastian was using incredible cunning that wasnt likely the man had fled eric in fear of his life but this was the sign that animal terror was driving him now so again it wasnt sebastian it was the wolf that made it doubly dangerous not just for her but for him sebastian would surely have stopped somewhere and hidden if he were in command knowing that the more he ran the more blood he would lose the wolf didnt know that all it knew to do was flee her heart contracted with fear and she sobbed the horses sides heaved and there was a foam of sweat on his neck as he labored through the snow how long had they been running it all blurred into a nightmare of shadows and snow and an agony of fear her mind was full of nothing but pictures of what could happen finding sebastian dead or dying eric finding him first and killing him never finding him at all if he transformed to a man at dawn he would be out here lost naked and wounded the cold would kill him without any need for eric to act further eric would be entirely blameless why is eric trying to murder sebastian i thought he was sebastians friend she clamped her lips down on a moan of grief then thorn put on another burst of speed dashing ahead bella urged the horse forward it surged into a clearing the lightorb flared movement at the far edge of the clearing caught her eye as the orb circled and there was sebastian turned to stand at bay inside the hollowed trunk of an enormous tree he was exhausted eyes dull trembling in every limb but he still brought up his head and growled she pulled the horse to a stop the horse heard the growl and threw up his head eyes rolling but remained steady it was very quiet in this clearing there was nothing but the sound of the horse dancing a little in place with nervousness and blowing hard and that low warning growl her heart pounded her mouth was dry and the growl evoked a chill in her blood as old as time she stared at the wolf it stared back at her with no recognition only pure terror and hysterical defiance i might have to shoot him she felt for her crossbow for the arrows they were still there can i shoot him the wolf pulled back his lips from his teeth snarling at her every time she moved a little the snarl got louder but her crossbow bolts were plain wood and steel if she shot him hed start to heal immediately i might have to without the silver tips that eric had on his arrows if she shot him shed hurt him but not for long enough time for her to get out of reach maybe she made sure the little crossbow was in the sling at her side and the quiver still on her belt slowly deliberately she eased herself off her horse and sought for magic as the wolf sang a song of animal terror the night lit up with magic more than she had ever seen before there was plenty here to do what she needed to do swirling and eddying around sebastian around herself more than enough to try to wake the man again she began gathering it to her walking one slow step at a time toward the wolf sinking up to her calves in the soft snow with every step i cant move fast in this snow she realized fighting down shakes and the overwhelming desire to forget this folly to turn and run as she had run the night that sebastian bit her no one could move fast in this if he rushes me she clamped down on the fear she dared not fear him she had heard that animals could smell your fear and it made them want to attack you she had to be afraid for him sebastian she said over the low growl coming from the tree trunk where the wolf had squeezed in so far back she could barely make out the shape of him the glinting teeth and the shining eyes even with the help of the orb sebastian its me its bella she took another step closer the growl took on a pitch of hysteria sebastian you have to remember you know who you are youre not some monster youre a man and a wizard come back to me sebastian she pushed a wave of magic power in front of her and the light sphere brightened in reaction but there was some barrier between the magic and sebastian it had been there before but it was much stronger now she had to get the power past whatever it was that was blocking her from helping him she pushed harder the magic crowded into the tree trunk surrounding sebastian glowing a faint gold the wolf was aware of it too he turned his head snapping at it was this going to need actual physical contact it might be the only way to force the magic past what must be another spell you must remember sebastian she insisted willing the magic into him as she had willed it back at the manor she took another step now she was almost close enough to touch him you must sebastian she made the next words into her spell and behind them she put all the force of her fear for him all the force of her heart that had told her that there never would be anyone for her but this man this sometimes exasperating but always fascinating man i love you sebastian come back to me come back to me come back to me with the last words she gave a final push as hard as she could at the same time she plunged toward him with her hands outstretched as the wolfs growl spiraled up in pitch until it sounded like a scream she flung herself her magic her emotions on top of him she threw her arms around his neck and hung on for dear life while the wolf thrashed and growled and snapped she closed her eyes so she wouldnt see the teeth closing inches from her face and held on draped over the beasts back while it bucked like an untrained horse the wolf heaved battering her against the side of the tree trunk but there wasnt that much room in here and he could neither shake her off nor do her much harm and he couldnt get out while she held on to him she continued to hold on to him though her arms felt as if they were being torn from their sockets willing the magic into him and with it sanity the wolfs head snapped back his skull smashing into her chin and she saw stars for a moment but still hung on and kept up the relentless pressure this would work sebastian she croaked saying his name over and over hed come to himself once back at the manor he could do it again the wolfs head snapped back again this time smashing into her nose she went halfblind with the pain but somehow managed to hold on to him even though her eyes streamed tears and every breath came as a sob come back to me she howled through clenched teeth both fists buried in the fur of the wolfs throat arms just barely able to encircle his neck and shoulders she gathered her will again for another effort she concentrated only on one thing sebastian looking out of the wolfs eyes at her you will come back to me the wolf shivered all over and froze then there was well it wasnt a sound so much as a feeling the feeling of something giving way whatever barrier that had stood between sebastian and the magic vanished in an instant and once again the swirling magic was literally sucked into sebastian the wolf collapsed beneath her the orb of light flared lighting up the area like a lantern cautiously she let go of sebastians neck the wolf lay on his side panting with exhaustion but otherwise not moving the wound on his hind leg oozed blood sluggishly sebastian she croaked bending over him and tentatively stroking his muzzle the wolf whimpered he fixed a desperate gaze on her get away from him she jerked upright eric stood beside her exhausted horse his far more lethal crossbow aimed at sebastian magic but a nasty darktinged magic like the dust of dried blood swirled around him she stared at him berating herself for not seeing it sooner magic generally runs in families wasnt that what the godmother had said you did this to him she burst out without thinking the curse it was you he snarled all pretense of charm gone and why not he had everything i had nothing was his blood any better than mine and then his father died and no one was prepared to take over so i did and i ran the estate the forest and the lands better than the old duke had why shouldnt i have it she wanted to reply because it isnt yours but she knew better than that any opposition could make him fire did i kill the boy he continued voice cracking with strain no i took care of him i took care of the inheritance by rights i should have had and i was honest the whole time i didnt take a penny or an acorn for myself except to give myself the things that a proper guardian should have and did anyone ever reward me for it no she made an abortive move and the tip of the arrow moved to aim at her so i cursed him what of it all he ever really wanted to do was be left alone to play with his magic so three nights out of the month he had to be locked up so what nobody was hurt and i was still in charge his eyes narrowed and then you came strolling through my forest and you bah uppity snippy shrew that you are you werent like other women you wouldnt shut up when you were told and i had to stop you before you ruined everything id done i what but before he could answer she realized what he meant he knew after he had bullied and threatened her that she was going to get even and she herself had told him that she had a powerful enough father to cause him some serious problemsand she felt her eyes widen you turned sebastian loose that night she gasped i figured hed kill you eric shrugged without taking his eyes off her either youd be found and the king would order sebastian to be locked up forever or you wouldnt be found because sebastian would tear you to pieces and no one would ever know what happened to you either way i would still be in charge his face took on an expression of baffled fury how the hell did you manage to only get bitten she shook her head she still didnt know she remembered screaming at the wolf remembered it suddenly letting go of her looking at her with some unfathomable expression in its eyes remembered it running his lip curled you have the luck of the very devil when you got foisted on us i decided to find a way to make you trust me once you trusted me i tried to get rid of you in that ambush when that didnt work i knew all that messing about with sebastian in his workroom meant that you were some sort of witch and you were doing something to me so i couldnt think properly she tried not to show how right he was that was when i got away so you wouldnt work whatever magic it was you were doing to me and got my head clear he laughed you two arent the only magicians around here i dont need all your potions and powders and diagrams i dont need them because im stronger than you and you two so smug so pleased with yourselves talking about how youd change the curse i already knew it could be changed and when i got away from you well that was when i knew the answer to both my problems id change the curse id force sebastian into the wolf outside of the full moon when both of you thought you were safe hed attack and kill you id kill him alas too late to save you he smiled an icy smile that sent chills all down her spine then eric the hero gets the dukedom if not the title for saving the kingdom from a man whod become an uncontrollable monster the king gives out land all the time to people who kill monsters and i already take care of this area happy ending well not for you and not for him but that hardly matters thats how it is still going to happen ill just rip you up a bit to hide the arrowwound and the wolf had been lying quietly all this time without moving her hand lying on his shoulder she hadnt noticed sebastian tensing under her hand until it was too late two hundred pounds of fur and fury launched itself straight for eric not snarling but silent and deadly the man and not the beast never mind that the man went on all fours and wore fur and at the same time a dozen snowballs rocketed across the clearing aimed right for erics face the snowballs struck first blinding him just as he reacted to sebastian moving so the shot went wild and the crossbow bolt buried itself in the wood of the tree trunk just above her head then sebastian hit him and knocked him to the ground his crossbow went flying but it was the man who was in charge of the body not the wolf and the man didnt know how to fight like a wolf eric threw him off and rolled to his feet pulling a knife as sebastian crouched ready to leap on his enemy again the two froze measuring each other another dozen snowballs thrown by the invisible hands of the spirit elementals hit eric again sebastian took advantage of erics distraction to slam his shoulder into erics legs knocking him down for a second time then sprang away before erics knife could touch him bella scrambled for her own crossbow and lurched to her feet she had just enough time to load an arrow when a new voice rang across the clearing that will be quite enough everyone froze the voice female wasnt loud but it held unmistakable authority godmother elena dressed much as bella was and practically bristling with power entered the clearing accompanied by a dozen or more of the lighted orbs that bella thought shed invented the godmother didnt so much glare at eric as freeze him with her gaze she regarded him for quite a long time he stared back at her defiantly thank you very much for that quite traditional monologue she said coolly there were one or two pieces of the puzzle i hadnt yet found the uprush of dark magic caught the godmother by complete surprise it was like an avalanche of hate but it was one that packed a very physical punch with no sophistication only raw power eric slammed the godmother into the snow as if a giant fist had backhanded her with a second blow he flattened sebastian to the ground then still fueled by fury he turned toward bella and stopped and toppled to the ground the bolt of her crossbow sticking out of his left eye it would take an extraordinarily lucky shot she remembered eric saying a lucky shot or the tradition the crossbow fell from her hands and she started to shake and that was when things really got confusing for suddenly there were men with colored scarves wrapped around their arms or bunches of leaves pinned to their chests who hadnt been there before and they were everywhere one went to help the godmother to her feet one caught bella as she almost fell two ran to sebastian as he tried to struggle to his feet and fell over sideways and wrapped his bleeding leg up to staunch the flow of blood then more people poured into the clearing including a young woman in servants livery that had been stitched with such exquisite work that it was elevated far past being a mere uniform she had a blue ribbon wrapped around her arm and she and a man with a green scarf immediately took over the situation in no time sebastian was hoisted up on a stretcher and carried off the godmother was assisted onto bellas mule bella herself was helped into the saddle of her horse and erics body was taken away it all happened so quickly that she felt dizzy she looked down at the young woman sapphire she said incredulously the woman nodded eric cast a spell on us as well she said the loyal servants the ones he knew wouldnt leave he got us alone and blasted us with dissolution one by one its a horrible spell it rips you right out of the world and leaves no trace behind i suppose he thought hed killed us and some of us did die but the rest we were in a kind of limbo a nowhere place and when sebastian started calling real spirit elementals to take our place we were able to cross back over to serve him again we hoped he would figure out what had happened to us and break the spell it broke when eric died then she said and felt like bursting into tears but why is sebastian still a wolf because its a curse not a spell sapphire said sadly and curses dont die with their maker she looked up at bella with solemn eyes im sorry mistress bella theres nothing to be done bella sat in numb silence sebastian had become a human again with the dawn but he hadnt spoken to her or indeed to anyone the king had ridden in just after dawn with the prince and a formidable entourage to take charge of everything bella who had been pacing and crying outside the chamber where sebastian had been taken until the sun rose had been given something to drink and she didnt even remember going to her room she just finished the warm flagon someone had thrust into her hands and the next thing she knew she was waking up in her bed as soon as she was awake sapphire appeared you have to get up mistress bella the servant said her attitude making it perfectly clear that this was not negotiable the godmother has asked for you her head hurt horribly and she really just wanted to lie in a ball and be miserable for a while oh they had gotten an ending all right but it wasnt a happy one sebastian had been betrayed by the person he counted on the most and now who knew whether or not he was going to become a wolf every night instead of just on the full moon i suppose were going to find out she thought apprehensively then she steeled herself hadnt they proved that sebastian could control the beast hed done it three times now surely the king and the godmother would see that she got up let sapphire help her into one of the much less practical gowns in the closet and sat mutely while sapphire fussed over her hair muttering to herself finally the servant stepped back and examined her handiwork critically now you look like a proper lady she pronounced bella made a face i think i liked you better when you were just a ribbon im sure you did mistress bella sapphire said unperturbed now the godmother and the king are waiting for you in sebastians workroom you must go there the master needs you feeling decidedly strange not being in breeches for the first time in weeks bella made her way up to the top of the tower but there was someone waiting for her at the foot of the stairs sebastian looked completely utterly miserable he had clearly been waiting for her and no one else because the moment he saw her he steeled himself visibly bella you dont have to i mean it was one thing when i was only a wolf three nights out of the month but if i i wont hold you to what you said if you want to go home and forget you ever saw me and i dont blame you he stopped evidently forgetting every word of a speech he must have memorized instead he tentatively took her hand and looked mournfully into her eyes please please dont go a huge knot of tension released itself somewhere in the back of her mind she had been sure that after last night he would never want to see her again whether out of guilt or trying to protect her or some other daft reason she had been certain he was going to send her away and he was the duke she would have had no more choice in the matter than when she had been sent here and then probably he would ask the godmother and the king to lock him up somewhere somewhere far away where he would be a danger to no one but deer and rabbits she took his other hand you couldnt drive me away she declared and his eyes lit up with that expression she had come to love it will be all right it has to be the tradition does demand a happy ending he said although he still sounded uncertain even if it didnt well make it give us one she said fiercely which was why when they entered the workroom they entered it together hand in hand which drew an amused look from the godmother and a raised eyebrow from the king bella had not had a chance to look at the king before and she had never seen him except at a distance so while he studied them she studied him he didnt look old enough to have a fullgrown son but perhaps the rumors about the royal family having some elven blood in them were true he certainly looked as fit as eric and of the same physical type including the dark and slightly sardonic features but that was where the resemblance ended there was nothing of that undercurrent of cruel indifference that had tinted everything eric had said or done even when he was at his most charming but there could be no mistake about it he could be utterly ruthless when he needed to and that was demonstrated by the two guards with crossbows with silvertipped quarrels already loaded the silver collar and chains at his feet and the iron box in the middle of the floor well duke sebastian the king said in a voice like velvet over steel your curse has been changed if you cant demonstrate to us that youve changed it for the better godmother elena and i are going to relocate you as we have discussed previously then you relocate me with him your majesty bella said without waiting to be addressed raising her head defiantly where he goes i go thus depriving my kingdom of a promising sorceress the king gave her an opaque look have you no sense of duty to your king you werent the one who was bundled up here by armed men with no warning and no explanation she snapped i think i stopped owing you anything when you snatched every right i had out from under me she has you there eddy the godmother murmured and i did warn you that not everyone is going to take to being treated in that fashion quietly thats how the tradition makes rebels youre lucky she hasnt grabbed a knife taken you hostage and absconded with sebastian to set themselves up as forest bandits the king muttered something under his breath his brows knitting you wanted strong and independent thinkers eddy not sheep you wanted people who in an emergency could be counted on to pick up whatever weapon there was and defend themselves and their kingdom dont complain to me when you also get young ladies like this one she folded her arms over her chest and gave him a decided look the king muttered something into his beard then he sighed a king is not supposed to apologize for anything and i absolutely will not apologize for the steps i took to safeguard other people of my realm from a potential monster but the man apologizes for not having the wit to see that you deserved a better explanation than you got and something other than the sort of arrest that more properly is handed out to a convicted criminal bella tried not to gape with astonishment after a moment she made a curtsy and replied i accept the mans apology your majesty but i am not going to leave the man i love to live out the rest of his life in lonely exile he nodded a little stiffly very well then nowi suppose we wait until moonrise its not far off majesty sebastian said in a strained voice i can feel it godmother elena sighed well that answers the first question she looked at bella you might want to look away this isnt pleasant wordlessly she shook her head the godmother shrugged then youll have to come over here if he cant control himself i dont want you on my conscience as his first victim much as she hated to leave him alone that made sense reluctantly she let go of sebastians hand and stood beside the godmother sebastian stood beside the iron box which had breathing grates set into the door on the front and one of the guards encircled him and the box with braided silver wire twisting the ends together so that it formed a rough magic circle then they waited when the change came it came with brutal suddenness one moment sebastian was standing in the silver circle looking determined the next he had let out a horrible burbling cry dropping to his knees and then to all fours muscles rippled and there were terrible popping and crunching sounds as the bones moved under his flesh elongating and shortening relocating and the flesh and muscle itself grew or shrank to accommodate the changes his loose clothing must have been designed for this since he shook it off almost immediately as he convulsed a thick pelt of hair erupted all over his body his face was the worst to watch as it stretched and pulled the ears migrating to the top of his head his teeth growing so fast she could see it happen and all of this was accompanied by heartbreaking moans and gasps and whines of pain until with a final convulsion everything settled into place and the wolf raised its muzzle and uttered that howl that had become so familiar to her that long sobbing cry of despair then the wolf dropped its head and stared at them bella could feel it feel the beast warring with the man for control she kept her eyes on the wolfs eyes refusing to look away the magic was a mere shadow of what had been here last night but she gathered it up anyway and thrust it at him backing it with her will come back to me she whispered to him come back to me come back to me the beast was not going to give up as she stared into the wolfs eyes she sensed the epic struggle going on inside him a struggle created by eric she would not turn away from it she would not not even if it meant she would watch him lose that struggle theres always tomorrow she whispered to herself just because he lost today it didnt follow things would always be that way she continued to will magic power to him fighting beside him as best she could and just when she was certain that he had lost and the beast had won and those guards were going to prod him into the iron box the wolf gave another huge convulsive shake and when he looked up again she saw sebastian before she could say anything the wolf suddenly jumped up onto his hind feet and began to dance then he dropped to the floor and rolled over sat up on his haunches to beg and gave one of the guards who was a little too close a wicked look and raised his hind leg oy the guard exclaimed jumping back with alarm sebastian sat tongue lolling out in a doglike grin the king considered the wolf for a moment then slowly deliberately he raised his hands to applaud without waiting for the guards to remove the silver wire bella threw herself at sebastian and encircled his neck with her arms sebastian didnt lick her as she half expected but he did nuzzle her neck comfortingly then looked back at the king every inch of him proclaiming mine well be talking tomorrow duke sebastian the king said getting to his feet and looking down on both of them your usefulness as a wizard is going to be rivaled by that as a shifter and i suppose you two want royal permission to wed absolutely bella replied firmly as the wolf nodded the king smiled wryly very well then you have it he stroked his beard i must say though this may be the first time in history when the royal gift to the bride and groom is going to include the royal crest on a big leather collar a leash and fleabane and with that the king fled and was chased chuckling from the room by the godmother bella and sebastian with sebastian snapping his teeth at the royal posterior the whole way epilogue sebastian stood nervously in front of the desk behind the desk sat bellas father hands steepled in front of his face bella herself was not in the room but her father had forgotten that she was a sorceress now and that there were many reflective surfaces in his office she was in the dining room hands cupped around her own mirror watching and listening elena had enchanted the mirror to bring in sound as well as vision the reunion with her family extended family really since it had included the servants had been intense her father had actually wept the twins had been wild with excitement especially when they got the bare bones of the story genevieve had been the one that had surprised bella the most though shed taken bella aside and tearfully made absolutely certain that neither sebastian nor eric had interfered with her because if they have i shall murder them myself although that horrible gamekeeper is dead so i cant murder him but i will do something unforgivable to him i promise you i dont know what but i am sure that i will think of something when bella had assured her that nothing of that nature had happened genevieve had relaxed then dragged her off to the parlor and made her go into much greater detail long before bella had admitted that she and sebastian were in love and that he was going to come in person to ask for her hand genevieve had figured it out oh she exclaimed as bella told her how sebastian had started to teach her magic oh dont tell me she clasped her hands together like an excited little girl you two fell in love didnt you hes asked you to wed him bella had stared at her dumbfounded genevieve beamed at her that is exactly how your father and i fell in love i was all in a muddle with my accounts you know my first husband was in the drapers guild and when i went there to look for help there was henri on some business or other and i dropped all my account books and he picked them up and asked why i looked so upset and i started to cry and he offered to help me straighten everything out and i said yes please and he started to teach me to do the accounting properly and the next thing i knew he was proposing and i was saying yes bella had just blinked at her a little stunned by the avalanche of words you said yes of course right genevieve persisted its lovely that he is a duke and all that but he seems to be the right sort of person for you the king has already invested him on the council i cant think of anyone better suited to wed a sorcererwerewolf then she paused and her brows creased with puzzled chagrin that didnt come out the way i meant it to bella had laughed and patted her stepmothers arm comfortingly i understand exactly what you mean genevieve im not exactly a very conventional person and i would need a rather unconventional mate genevieves relieved smile had been quite genuine of course it is really rather good for the girls that hes a duke now there was one more hurdle to be dealt with henri beauchamps so the king speaks very highly of you duke sebastian said henri but i have some concerns naturally sir sebastian said politely but bella could tell from his posture that he was tense you are a wizard sorcerer sebastian corrected henri waved his hand dismissively this is a dangerous profession things explode or turn into frogs or behave in other unexpected and not particularly pleasant ways only when people do not take sufficient care sir sebastian said i am a very careful magician and this business of being a werewolf henri shook his head are you housebroken are you going to dig up the flower beds hiding bones are my grandchildren going to be born with tails will i have to hire an obedience trainer for them is their first word going to be mama or woof is genevieve stormed in at that moment henri beauchamps she exclaimed what are you doing seeing if this fellow is a fit husband for my daughter henri replied as she set her fists on her hips and glared at him that was when bella detected a twitch at the corner of his mouth well you can stop it right this instant genevieve informed him in the sort of tone reserved for illbehaved children you are terrifying the poor man he doesnt understand your sense of humor she turned to sebastian and patted his arm now no more of your jokes henri its settled he and bella are perfect for each other and if you keep trying to test him youll only delay matters and do you have any idea how hard it will be to plan for a winter wedding as it is fitting it in around the drapers ball the skating party lord bellaire ordered the morescaeus hunt fete the goldsmiths gala and how i am to get proper gowns in time for all of us much less a wedding dress that bella will actually wear i do not know i am at my wits end with that she turned and swept out bella stifled a giggle the two men looked at each other and finally sebastian shrugged i would listen to her if i were you the duke advised henri beauchamps nodded i think you just proved you are wise enough to marry my daughter he replied then added and with my blessing just as long as there arent going to be any explosions only the ones that are on purpose sebastian promised solemnly
